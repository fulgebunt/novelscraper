You could see the scene with just a slight turn of the head, but all the passersby paid it no attention\u2013because the four men were particularly infamous for being bad-tempered good-for-nothings, and the beaten man was just a no-name beggar.The unlucky beggar, Luisen, curled up his body and endured the violence. His coiled body resembled a mouse that had crawled up from the sewers. He didn\u2019t dare move a single muscle. He knew that the more he resisted, the longer he would be beaten. So, he tightly shut his mouth and covered his head with both arms. Dry, straw-like hair trembled.\u201cAh, what an intense guy. Didn\u2019t even make a single noise.\u201dThe gangsters stuck out their tongues. There had to be some kind of reaction for the beat-down to be satisfying; beating on a man who only curls up sucks the joy out of it.\u201cThis is boring. Let\u2019s go play cards instead.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cDirty bastard. Don\u2019t live your life like that.\u201dThe good-for-nothings spat on Luisen\u2019s trembling back and, snickering, exited the alleyway.As soon as they disappeared, Luisen stood up while grasping at the wall. Limping on one leg, he slowly moved forward.\u00a0 Perhaps the punks hit something vital; every time he put weight on his foot, he felt dizzying agony.He scraped the snow off the ground and used it to clean off his bloody mouth.\u2018Awful jerks\u2026\u2019It was those good-for-nothings that made the first proposal: \u2018If you follow us, we\u2019ll hand you a fairytale.\u2019 Luisen had already been starving for two days now. He begged all day and fulfilled odd jobs but was still unable to afford a loaf of bread. With that one loaf, he could endure a few more days. Snow was already falling\u2013if he did not eat today, he would surely perish.Biting back distaste, he had no choice but to accept the offer. However, those men soon began to act as they pleased, grabbing his hair and pretending as if they didn\u2019t know him. When Luisen asked for the money they promised him, they jabbered some nonsense, \u201cAren\u2019t you enjoying this?\u201d Suddenly, they showed their ill-temper and began to beat him.From the very beginning, they had no intention to give Luisen money.\u2018If you don\u2019t give me money, that\u2019s fine. But why hit me?\u2019Sniffling, Luisen swallowed some tears. The places hit by the punks throbbed. His whole body ached, and his eyes became blurry as a fever began to come over him. More unbearable than the body\u2019s pain, though, was the misery.\u2018In the old days, those people wouldn\u2019t dare set eyes on my feet\u2026.\u2019Luisen had lived his entire life without knowing hunger nor hardships. His father was the Duke of Anies, and his mother was a princess. He was born the only son of the duke and succeeded him early. The fertile plains of the south were all his.He was one of only four land-owning lords in the kingdom. Countless vassals were at his command, and he held the rights to tax them and put them on trial. For the southern part of the kingdom, he held the same authority as the king.As one of the great lords, he held the authority to host royal coronations and was able to marry into the royal family. Even the king treated him with caution, and the queen made him the crown prince\u2019s childhood friend, to make her son a strong candidate for succession.He grew up playing in the palace as if it were his own home. He only ate and wore the most precious and best things in the world. Anything he wanted, he got. He lacked for nothing, and not a shadow was cast over his life.Those were perfect years.Luisen Anies was not an existence a neighborhood punk would dare stare at. These were people that should have knelt at his feet in complete obedience. They were insignificant beings whose lives and deaths were overturned by his words.But, how\u2026\u2018How did I end up like this?\u2019Three years ago, in spring, the king fainted. The king was so old and sickly that everyone had already anticipated it. The problem, however, was that the aging king fell into a deep coma without deciding on a successor.Why, of all things, did the king have two distinguished sons?The eldest, Ellion, was only the royal concubine\u2019s child. But, as the king\u2019s eldest, he was given legal claim to the throne. With his excellent schooling and character, he received praises for his kingly nature.Paris, the younger, was the queen\u2019s child. Thus, no one could find fault in his right to succession. Though his intelligence and character could not compare to that of Ellion, his personality was favorable and left good impressions. All the powerful nobles supported him.When the king collapsed, the second prince, Paris, gained control of the palace with the power of his mother, the queen. Shortly before that, the first prince, Ellion, escaped to the north, where he had some influence, and began to raise a military presence. Following the two princes, the kingdom split into two factions, and a civil war began.Luisen and the Anies duchy stood by Prince Paris\u2019 side. There was no doubt in his allegiance, as Prince Paris was both a relative and his only friend.Prince Ellion was victorious in the civil war that spanned half a year. Prince Paris died during the war, and, when the first prince took control of the palace, the queen was officially imprisoned. The king was at the brink of death, so the kingdom was practically in the hands of the first prince. He then brandished his iron mace at Paris\u2019 supporters.Even the Duke of Anies couldn\u2019t avoid this fate. In the fall of that year, Carlton, the prince\u2019s sword, led the military to the dukedom.Who is Carlton? Though he is low-born, the first prince recognized his overwhelming military strength. He became an important figure to his faction. Among the nobles, he had other titles more popular than \u2018the prince\u2019s sword,\u2019: the prince\u2019s butcher, the slaughterer, the noble massacre. He despised those who boasted about their luck to be born as an aristocrat and scorned incompetent lords.And Luisen was both.Luisen was extremely frightened by the news of Carlton\u2019s arrival.\u2018Carlton will kill me. He\u2019ll kill me horribly.\u2019The young lord abandoned all work and confined himself in his room. He left all upcoming battles up to fate and drank nothing but alcohol. He was terrified and didn\u2019t know how to properly respond\u2013never in his life had he experienced a crisis like a civil war.The peaceful life he enjoyed became a poison. Day by day his terror grew. And, when it became too unbearable, Luisen made an irreversible decision.\u2018Let\u2019s run away. Let\u2019s run far, far away to where he can\u2019t chase me.\u2019He packed his fortunes and, in the midst of battle, escaped from the castle. He had several vassals, relatives, and friends\u2026surely one of them would take care of him. He hazily believed that someone would help him. It was a foolish decision made by a mind driven to tatters by fear.The world became cold as soon as he lost his steady background as the Duke of Anies. All of his trusted friends and relatives turned a blind eye to him. The fortune he brought with him was taken away by muggers and conmen, and the servant that came with him died while chasing the criminals. Too late, Luisen returned to the estate, but everything had already ended.Angered by Luisen\u2019s escape, Carlton massacred the citizens and set fire to various parts of the territory. Still, that didn\u2019t relieve his anger. The heads of the vassals hung from the walls of the castle. Crows flocked to the smell of rotting corpses, crying ominously.The fire spread endlessly and razed the plains. The yellow, ripe wheat in harvest season was devoured by the bright red flames. Black smoke filled the sky, and the remaining survivors mourned.At that sight, Luisen ran away once again. He chose to turn away because he couldn\u2019t cope with the tragedy he had wrought.After that, he couldn\u2019t settle down anywhere. He felt as if Carlton was still chasing after him. If he looked into the darkness, he felt as if he could hear the hooves of a black knight\u2019s horse.When he slept, without fail, he would dream of standing in a burning, golden field. The dead became ghosts that followed Luisen. They would trace his face with their nails, cut his neck, and crush his face. With miserable, burned faces they would resentfully blame and curse him.The world is cruel to a wandering, mentally unstable man.Due to the civil war and famine, the country was in dire straits. People became unable to care for themselves. Everyday life had broken down, and emotions such as sympathy and compassion had become a luxury. Luisen had to survive on his own strengths.\u2018Was I such a pathetic and helpless person?\u2019He was nothing after he lost his birthright and his family\u2019s wealth. Luisen was not good at accounting and didn\u2019t know how to farm, nor was he fit enough for manual labor. He couldn\u2019t even fight.He was ignorant to the ways of the world. There was nothing he could do, even if he wanted to earn a living.His money ran out quickly. He sold his clothes, his shoes, and even his hair\u2026but quickly found his limit. For the first time in his life, Luisen experienced hunger. His intestines felt twisted, and the sky became yellow.\u00a0\u00a01\u2018Hurts. It hurts so much. Hungry, anything would be good. I want to eat anything.\u2019His eyes rolled backwards. His lofty pride shattered in the face of starvation. Aristocratic refinement, morality, and values all collapsed.For a meal, he would sell even his body and heart. He didn\u2019t hesitate to do all kinds of crimes, beg, and steal. The struggle for survival was a symptom of the country\u2019s collapsing existence and stability.However, the food he ate in this way was so delicious he could cry. He would weep while wolfing down unknown soup that he wouldn\u2019t have even looked at while he was a duke.Like that, three years passed.No trace of Luisen\u2019s time as a noble remained. His body was as thin as a twig, and his complexion was yellowed and wan. There were deep shadows underneath his eyes, making him look sickly. For fear of being caught, he often crouched down and hid his body. Ultimately, this resulted in a hunched back and a neck like a turtle.Actually, it was a miracle that Luisen, who only knew how to eat and play, lasted for three years. They said that the ruined wealthy could only survive for three years, and for him, this was exactly three years. Now, he truly had nothing. Even his beautiful appearance was ruined by a rough street life, and no one wanted it.\u2018I\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m hungry.\u2019Vertigo rose up within him.Two days ago, he hid in the yard of some random family and stole and ate their dog\u2019s food. Come to think of it, that was his last meal. Due to the lack of food available for people, even dog food was too precious to waste.\u2018I want to eat anything. Anything\u2019s good, I just want to eat.\u2019He now thought a lot about when he was a duke\u2013the food he would barely touch due to a lack of appetite.A wide and long table filled densely with mounds of delicacies. He shouldn\u2019t have left it. He should have eaten it all without wasting a single bite. If he were handed that now, he would even lick the plates clean.He missed those days so much. Why couldn\u2019t he have understood the preciousness of his life at that time?Eventually, Luisen burst into tears. He knew crying would only waste energy. Even so, he couldn\u2019t stop the tears.The snowy path was slippery, and his legs were unstable. In his agitated state, he lost his balance and tumbled, falling down.*Crash*The snow was cold, and his one and only clothes became wet. He was in a situation where he had no place to dry his clothes nor to change into new ones. He had to stand up quickly so he could shake off the snow and salvage what dryness he had. Otherwise, if he slept outside in cold, wet clothes, he could develop tuberculosis.But Luisen didn\u2019t not move at all. He sobbed with his head still stuck in the snow.\u2018I should have died back then. Even if I had died, I would have died as a noble rather than living like this.\u2019\u2018Maybe then the vassals and the citizens wouldn\u2019t have died. This isn\u2019t a life that\u2019s worth sacrificing all of them. I\u2019m not useful anywhere, neither as a noble, not as the Duke of Anies, and not even to myself.\u2019\u2018If I\u2019m going to die anyway\u2026it would have been better to not run away.\u2019.Luisen felt anguish as countless regrets pierced his heart. He was weakened to the point that his heart couldn\u2019t bear the intense grief. As his body cooled down, he felt his consciousness fading away. The knife-like pangs of cold and hunger slowly began to disappear.\u201cRather than dying like this\u2026.\u201dFootnotesSlang for becoming disorientedNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first thing you must do when you return to the past*Bang**Bang**Aghhh!**Crash*Deafening booms and shrieks, as if an enormous mountain was collapsing, brought Luisen back to consciousness.\u201cMy lord, my lord. Please hurry and wake up. The battle has begun.\u201d\u201cUghh\u2026..\u201d\u2018Leave me alone. I just died, you know?\u2019Luisen covered his head and pushed away the hand trying to wake him up. His head felt like it had shattered, and nausea rolled around inside of him. A terrible alcohol stench permeated from somewhere.\u2018What is this alcohol smell?\u2019After the civil war, Luisen couldn\u2019t drink a single drop of alcohol. Prohibition was instituted as the famine continued to ravage the lands; the price of alcohol went through the roof. For a vagabond like Luisen who found it hard to find daily bread, the smell of alcohol, let alone the taste, was a pipe dream.But then, why was he currently suffering from a severe hangover?He rolled his hazy, heated head around. Slowly, bit by bit, memories returned.It was evident that Luisen should have died that wintery night, three years after he ran away from the castle. However, a man passing by miraculously saved him.He was a man on a religious pilgrimage. Because he was missing one arm, the man was called the one-armed pilgrim. Luisen didn\u2019t know his name. And he would always wear the hood of a monk, so he couldn\u2019t see his face. The man seemed extremely suspicious, but the one-armed pilgrim took care of Luisen with all of his heart.He would hand over his bed, warm the room with precious firewood, and was even willing to share medicine and food. Even though he wasn\u2019t well off, he devotedly nursed Luisen. Thanks to him, Luisen didn\u2019t die that winter and instead regained some vitality.Luisen felt deep gratitude towards the one-armed pilgrim. That there was such a merciful and wise person in this world\u2026 He began to call the pilgrim a saint and followed his doctrine.Following him, Luisen learned much of the world and realized his own foolishness. The stories the one-armed pilgrim would tell helped gift Luisen with a discerning eye. He helped him see the world with clear eyes, devoid of sin and senility. Luisen was able to feel remorse and apologized sincerely to the dead.After meeting with the one-armed pilgrim, he no longer felt devastating hunger and slept enclosed by ceilings and walls, but his body was already broken by the streets. The next winter, one year later, Luisen breathed his last.\u201cI thought I was in an old cabin\u2026\u201dIt was an endlessly uneasy and dreadful night. As it was deep into the winter, the blizzard\u2019s rage rattled the windows as if to shatter them. Knowing it was Luisen\u2019s last night, the pilgrim stuffed the stove full of firewood.Every time some strange sound rang out, Luisen\u2019s heart shook as well.Death was so scary.He was afraid to meet the people that died because of him. It was painful to look back upon his life, but it was also scary to think that no more days would come either. Ah, the process of the soul leaving the body was too long, boring, and terrible. Tears kept flowing down.\u201cBrother,\u201d said the one-armed pilgrim, Luisen\u2019s saint.He grasped Luisen\u2019s hand, as if he understood his heart\u2019s desire. Luisen moistened his lips with some wine that the man had procured, as if from thin air, and uttered his last will\u2013his final confession.And then, he died.That was the last moment Luisen could remember. He definitely died then.But then, why does he smell like alcohol? Didn\u2019t he die? No? The memory of his life seeping from his body couldn\u2019t have been a dream.\u201cAm I in hell?\u201dConsidering the dreadful shrieks coming from all sides, this must have been hell. He had a terrible migraine and felt nausea as if he were seasick. Every time he took a breath, the sickening stench of alcohol wafted out of his mouth. It was almost as if\u2026 it was the day after he had become blackout drunk.Are there hangovers in hell?\u201cHell? Well, I guess it wouldn\u2019t be wrong to call it hell.\u201dA brusque voice came from above.\u2018Is there someone beside me?\u2019Luisen opened his eyes. The room was dark, but it was enough to recognize the other person\u2019s face. The man had flashy red hair and a good-looking appearance, but his absentminded expression made him look plain.It was Luisen\u2019s chief aide, Ruger.\u201cRuger? Huh? Why are you here?\u201dRuger would have fled with Luisen on that fateful night, but instead he let himself get captured and killed by Carlton\u2019s soldiers in order to give his master an opportunity to safely escape. It was one of Luisen\u2019s greatest regrets that he couldn\u2019t retrieve the body for fear of being caught.\u201cPlease come to your senses. Now isn\u2019t the time to be carefree and drinking.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201dLuisen looked around blankly; the view looked familiar. The luxurious room decorated in green and gold was his past bedroom. Although Luisen spent more time in the capital than in his territory, he couldn\u2019t forget the bedroom he had used all his life, which had been passed down for generations in the Anies family.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m seeing this place again.\u2019This room had burned down with the dukedom\u2019s castle. Carlton had made sure of it.\u201cHere, have some cold water and pull yourself together.\u201dRuger handed over the cup. Luisen absentmindedly took it and gulped the water down. Maybe because he had arrived in hell, or maybe because he was seeing the castle he lost through his own mistakes, his throat burned.\u201cGah.\u201dThe ice cold of the water made his head spin.\u2018Isn\u2019t this strange?\u2019Luisen pinched his cheeks without mercy. Vivid pain blossomed.\u2018Am I alive right now? I\u2019m not dead?\u2019The dead can\u2019t feel pain. So, what\u2019s all that terrible noise coming from outside the window? He hurriedly ran to the window and flung it open.\u201cAHHHHHHH!\u201d\u201cStop them! Don\u2019t back down!\u201d\u201cSave me!\u201dYou could see the view of the entire castle in one glance from the duke\u2019s bedroom. A battle was in full swing just outside the castle walls. Despite the advantageous position due to the castle\u2019s defenses, the battle lines were steadily being pushed back. Luisen\u2019s soldiers were naive and without proper training, while the enemy soldiers climbing the walls were all elite. As if to predict their inevitable victory, a blue flag fluttered majestically over the wall. The blue lion was a symbol of the royal family.A blue lion flag\u2026The blue lion flag. Old memories, as vivid as if they had happened just yesterday, rose up when he saw that flag.Prince Ellion declared that all those who supported the second prince were traitors. In order to set an example for all the nobles who didn\u2019t support him, he sent soldiers to the Anies Duchy.Carlton, the first prince\u2019s sword, butcher, noble executioner, and all sorts of other horrible nicknames, led the army to the duke\u2019s territory.Carlton recommended they surrender to the royal family\u2019s rule. Though in name they were the royal family\u2019s vassals, the Duke of Anies had long ruled the south as its master. The duke, who had secretly belittled the royal family, couldn\u2019t accept submitting to its power. The castle closed its gates and chose to fight. He believed that the many southern lords, his vassals, would come as reinforcements if they endured.After the battle began, it only took three days for the castle to fall.Just three days.\u201cRuger, how many days has it been since the battle started?\u201d\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t even remember? Did you take anything other than alcohol?\u201d\u201cHow many days.\u201d\u201cIt started yesterday\u2026so it\u2019s the second day.\u201dSecond day! It was the same night Luisen ran away.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dLuisen chuckled despondently. \u2018I went back in time? Why, of all times, did I come back to the night I regret the most?\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe it. Luisen clenched his fist and punched the window frame.*Thud*\u201cNn\u2026it hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cYou punched a brick frame, of course it hurts! You picked up something weird and ate it, didn\u2019t you? Yes? I\u2019ve been doing what my lord ordered me to do, even in this mess, so much that my soles are on fire, and you\u2019re here smoking?\u201d\u201c\u2026I said I didn\u2019t take anything.\u201d\u2018Or actually, did I?\u2019Luisen felt like he was out of his mind. He would usually enjoy that kind of thing during the new year celebrations, and with the fear of death, perhaps there was no reason not to do it.\u2018Maybe I did. A little bit.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Now\u2019s the time. With the battle in full swing, no one will pay attention to us.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d Luisen asked blankly.He felt as if he was dreaming. Did he have a weird dream after drinking? This Luisen Anies couldn\u2019t have become a beggar after all\u2026\u201cWe\u2019ve got to run. I\u2019ve prepared the horses and money.\u201d\"\"Hm. It couldn\u2019t have been a dream. It really did happen. Luisen suddenly made a distressed sound.\u2018Returning to the past\u2026I\u2019ve read stories like that but\u2026\u2019Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a man. He wandered the world and helped many people. Everyone praised him as a saint, but he couldn\u2019t be happy. That was because he committed a great sin in the past. Even as he atoned with good deeds, he felt distress. One day, he made a wish to God. He wanted to revive his loved ones\u2026 God, who felt sorry for the saint, granted him his wish. He sent the saint back to the past so he could save them himself.This was a legend that was known by all the kingdom\u2019s citizens\u2013fiction made to teach morality and to inspire faith. But that story had become his reality, even though Luisen wasn\u2019t a saint.\u2018Why me?\u2019He was a sinner. He made a wrong decision that drove many people to their deaths and became one of the causes for famine. How many people died because of one person? How could he be given the same opportunity as a saint?TN lil-vally: Thanks for joining me for the first two chapters! I\u2019m reading along with you guys, so I\u2019m excited to see where this goes.

Abandoning his lordly duties, he squandered his youth playing, eating, and drinking in the capital. He was indolent, apathetic, and made light of the world. Although he repented for his many mistakes after meeting the saint, he was still a fallen soul whom hell would welcome with both hands.\u2018Perhaps\u2026did mister one-armed pilgrim, my saint, help me?\u2019A strong feeling overwhelmed Luisen\u2019s heart. Yes, such a devoted and merciful man could definitely have created this opportunity for this pitiful life. Or maybe he was included in the saint\u2019s grand plan in the past somehow! Anyways, everything was in debt to his grace.\u201cDuke-nim, Duke-nim\u00a01. We must hurry, there won\u2019t be another opportunity.\u201d\u201cWait a minute.\u201d He wanted to give his last thanks to the saint in a prayer.However, Ruger did not give Luisen a chance to pray.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to relax. My lord knows well how vicious the butcher can be. He killed one man by tying all four of his limbs to a horse and letting it rip him apart. The remaining torso was spat on and cursed at. He\u2019s a cruel and villainous man. I heard he despises nobles, does he not? If he catches you, you won\u2019t have a gentle death. He\u2019s coming here with full tyrannical power. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do to you, my lord!\u201dRuger trembled. \u201cIt\u2019s now or never. We\u2019re going to lose\u2013we\u2019re definitely going to lose, no matter what.\u201d\u201cSo, you want us to abandon the territory and run away? In the midst of battle?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? Those men are all fighting to protect you; there\u2019s no meaning if you die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLuisen swallowed a sigh. His past self had agreed with Rugert\u2013and then ran away. At the time, he had believed fleeing was his only chance for survival. He couldn\u2019t even imagine the life he\u2019d live afterwards. He had just been relieved to be alive. Just as he had lived before, carefree, he had been vaguely confident things would work out.So stupid and lackadaisical!!!\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI have no intention to run. If you want to leave, do whatever you want. I won\u2019t blame you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?!\u201d\u2018I won\u2019t run away.\u2019 For the sake of those who had died, and for the sake of Luisen\u2019s own life, this was the right choice. He couldn\u2019t go through what he did twice.\u2018I\u2019d rather die as a noble.\u2019How could he squander his new life? He\u2019ll live like a nobleman. He\u2019ll formally surrender.That way, everyone will survive.The dukedom\u2019s military strength was deficient, but it was holding up well for now. Maybe that was why in the past he thought he could take on his opponent. But, Carlton was deliberately dragging his feet, biding time.After he realized Luisen had fled, he took the castle in less than half a day.So, why was he now deliberately stalling for time?Carlton was aggressive\u2013his hands spread cruelty\u2013and he never retreated in battle. His favorite pastime was to trample, humiliate, and subjugate snobby nobles. The higher the noble\u2019s ego, the more pathetic they would become in the end. Luisen would have been his favorite prey.He would have been excited to occupy noble castles, trample upon centuries-old traditions and honors. Nevertheless, one could assume the first prince had a reason to make Carlton drag his feet.\u2018This is what the saint explained.\u2019Luisen had faith in the saint\u2019s bountiful knowledge and keen insight.The Anies Duchy was one of the four grand lordly families. They held power comparable to the authority of a king. Though the first prince believed a centralized ruling system was ideal, he lacked the legitimacy to pull it off. He had a long-standing complex regarding how few nobles supported him compared to his younger brother.After winning the civil war, he attempted to shore up those weaknesses by winning the loyalty of the nobles. The Duke of Anies was someone who had the right to elect a king. Even though the first prince won the war, the loyalties of the great lords held deep meaning.The saint said that Luisen\u2019s lifeline depended on his loyalty to Prince Ellion.\u2018It would have been better for you to have bent over for him. It\u2019s best to surrender before being occupied.\u2019Holding out until he broke would go against the will of the first prince. A Duke of Anies who didn\u2019t obey until the bitter end would become a scar upon the prince\u2019s legitimacy. Prince Ellion would not tolerate such disgrace. At that point, the force of Carlton\u2019s cruel pleasure would be unleashed, and there was no way of knowing what would happen to the duke.Luisen was ignorant of all of this in the past. He was just terrified to hear about the execution of the second prince. He only thought that the first prince would try to murder him as well, so he insisted on fighting him.And in the end, he abandoned everything...Luisen bit his lips and opened the door to the conference room. The room, which was used as a base for military strategy operations, was filled with a heavy tension. The general and treasurer, as well as other officials and the butler, were standing in front of a table laden with tactical maps. As the battle was in full swing, the knight commander and his knights were not present.When Luisen appeared, all eyes in the conference room became fixated on him. They all looked at him with confused and surprised gazes.\u201cMy lord, for what reason have you come to this humble place? Do you need anything else?\u201d the treasurer welcomed him warmly.Though the man had gained ample weight throughout the years and had a generous, kind-looking face, his words contained a sharp backbone. It would have been commonplace for a lord to present at meetings that concerned the territory. However, he was shocked at Luisen\u2019s appearance. He had inwardly sneered when he heard Luisen had locked himself up in his room.In the past, Luisen would not have been able to detect the treasurer\u2019s sarcasm, but a life of wandering had made him develop some sense. He flushed red with embarrassment.\u201cHe is your lord. Watch what you say.\u201dThe butler sided with Luisen, but Luisen couldn\u2019t bear to see him. Before the regression, Carlton was said to have tortured the butler for information on Luisen\u2019s whereabouts. He did not reveal anything until the end, and was eventually abandoned in some gutter with all of his limbs torn off.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? We were just discussing something very important,\u201d the general said. In the face of his stern gaze, Luisen\u2019s shoulders lightly trembled.The general was always hard on him. On behalf of his parents who had died when Luisen was young, the general was his foster parent and his proxy in estate matters. He was always a strict teacher and became a very competent thorn in his side. When the castle was occupied, he committed suicide. Carlton decapitated the corpse and hung it over the wall. When Luisen tried to return to the estate, he saw the general\u2019s rotten and decayed head.The same was true of the other officials. All of the people who worked at the duke\u2019s castle had been decapitated and hung over the wall. This was Carlton\u2019s revenge.Luisen fidgeted with his thumbnails. Their corpses\u2019 deathly appearance and stench were still vivid in his mind. Anxiety and nervousness filled him all the way up to his chin. It was harder than he\u2019d thought to see the dead roaming alive again.But, he couldn\u2019t back down.\u2018Remember how much you regretted this day, Luisen Anies.\u2019\u2018Please, Saint, give me courage.\u2019Luisen drew a small cross over his heart with his hand, heartbeat flickering like dim lamplight. He steeled himself and said, \u201cWe must surrender.\u201dThe general\u2019s face distorted with disappointment at his words. The same was true of the treasurer and the others.\u201cWhy do you say this now, my lord? You may have forgotten since you locked yourself in your room, but we\u2019re currently in the midst of battle.\u201d\u201cAghhhhhh!\u201dJust then, an unnamed soldier shrieked from the outside. Everyone in the room knew immediately that the soldier was now dead, and the air became heavier.\u201c\u2026.I know,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cThen, you know just how ridiculous your words are.\u201d\u201cI know. But, we still have to surrender. We\u2019re no match for Carlton\u2019s power. It\u2019s only a matter of time before we are occupied.\u201d\u201cOur soldiers are still enduring well.\u201d\u201cHow long can they last?\u201d\u201cThe reinforcements will arrive soon. Anies\u2019 vassals will come to our aid.\u201d\u201cReinforcements are not coming. They\u2019ve already abandoned us.\u201dNone of the reinforcements came last time. All of the duke\u2019s vassals had turned their backs on them. Luisen had experienced this firsthand in the future (of the first timeline), but the officials all strongly protested.\u201cBefore there was a kingdom, the Anies Duchy was the master of this territory. There\u2019s no way the vassals would abandon us and join hands with the royal family. They are our subjects and we are their sole liege. Didn\u2019t we always teach you to not forget what kind of existence you are to the south?\u201dThe general agreed with the rest of the officials. \u201cThat\u2019s correct. The loyalty of the southern territory is different from those greedy nobles in the capital.\u201d\u201cMy lord, you may not know anything about this since you\u2019ve spent all your time in the Capital,\u201d another official added.\u2018No\u2026 the times have changed.\u2019Even before the civil war broke out, both princes had been building their factions. The first prince attracted small and medium-ranked lords to his side. He tempted them through the promise of breaking old contracts and installing a new system. As a result, the vassals would not see the Duke of Anies as a lord to protect but rather plump prey to gorge upon.As if they were waiting for the duchy to crumble, the vassals did not put their heart into the battle to protect their own counties.\u2018My words would never be enough to convince them anyway.\u2019The duke\u2019s advisors were competent, but they had immense pride in their ducal history and were quite conservative.\u201cThink about it carefully,\u201d Luisen said. \u201cIf they were truly going to help us, they would have sent soldiers even before Carlton unsheathed his sword. Has any family sent us their auxiliary troops?\u201dThe treasurer became slightly disturbed. Luisen\u2019s words weren\u2019t without sense.TN: I\u2019ll try to come out with Chpt 4 sometime later in this week/weekend!FootnotesNim here is the suffix for respect.

All they want is our surrender. It\u2019s enough for the duke to show his submission to the prince,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cIf what the prince desires is our submission, we should not be weak-hearted and back down any further!\u201d the general argued. \u201cOur honor as the ruler of the south is at stake!\u201d\u201cDoes honor feed you?!\u201dThe general became angry. \u201cIs that what the Duke of Anies should say?! Is the master of these golden fields scared away by the dog of an illegitimate prince?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m\u2026afraid, yes. But I made this decision for all of us.\u201dIf the prince were to give up on the duchy, Carlton would brutally crush the territory. If that were to happen, the result would be no better than the desolate future Luisen had experienced before.\u201c\u2026When you insisted on supporting the second prince, you said the same thing,\u201d the general contended. \u201cYou said that it was a decision made for the good of all of us, but what has happened now? You\u2019ve only lost soldiers and wealth; you were branded a traitor. This is why I begged for you to not be involved in central politics!\u201dLuisen shut his mouth. To be honest, he had nothing to say to that\u2013true, he was complacent and incompetent. He had never seriously considered the consequences of a civil war, nor the succession dispute.He lived as a flowing river. Because he was a relative to the second prince, he stuck close to him. There were no other serious considerations.\u201cMy lord, are you not just scared? Are you going to beg for your life when you surrender? Can\u2019t you please feel responsible as a lord, especially when the situation has already become so severe?\u201d one of the advisors pleaded.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. We\u2019ll just do what we\u2019ve been doing so far. My lord should go back and just finish his wine bottle. Or take a shower. You smell strongly of alcohol.\u201dThe words of the treasurer, which did not contain any expectations, penetrated Luisen\u2019s heart more than the general\u2019s gruff reprimand. The advisors ignored Luisen and resumed the discussion they were sharing before he had appeared.Luisen could not respond to any of their rebukes. His intentions were good\u2013he wanted to save everyone in the conference room\u2013but it was difficult to convey his true feelings.Only the kind butler approached Luisen.\u201cYoung master, you must be alarmed. Please, feel free to rest in your room. The elders of the castle will take care of matters.\u201dStill a young master. Even though it had been more than twenty years since Luisen had become the lord, to the butler he was still \u201cyoung master.\u201d Not a lord to trust and follow.This wasn\u2019t an issue unique to the butler either. Not one person in this conference room was confident in him as a lord.A feeling of frustration and helplessness simultaneously brewed within Luisen. Unlike his previously vigorous run to the conference room, he returned to his chamber with plodding steps.***\u201cThey mean well, but\u2026.\u201dLuisen cringed. It was impossible to even curse at his advisors, considering he had never worked properly as a lord before.His parents died when he was six years old, and he became a duke. The general was the acting-lord and spent a great deal of time trying to mold him into a proper noble. The general proved to be strict, and Luisen was inevitably dragged along against his will. He often ran away from his tutor and hid in the attic. Thus, he had little knowledge of martial arts, history, and etiquette.As he grew older and became an adult, he escaped from his tutor\u2019s grasp and left all of the work and his estate to his advisors. He spent money from the territory like water and mingled with unsavory friends.After being in so many scandals, his reputation was at its worst. He knew how to spend money, but he had little knowledge or appreciation for the money\u2019s origins. He wasn\u2019t interested in the land nor his family name.He used to think \u2018everybody is already doing well, why do I need to care?\u2019 and he was ignorant of any of his territory\u2019s issues, for he liked the flashy and colorful capital more so than the manure smell of the rural villages of the duchy. His advisors were the only ones keeping the territory running while Luisen was playing around.He was then stuck on the losing side in the clumsy struggle for the throne, having uprooted the pillars of his territory\u2019s economy to support the second prince. He was left without proper personal connections because of his former misconducts and was even set up as a foil to the first prince due to their bad relations. His biological bloodline was excellent, but he had no idea how to utilize it.In other words, many thought the territory would be better off without Luisen!\u2018Even if it were me, I would probably want to chase off the person who insisted on surrendering the night of the battle.\u2019However, the people were too nice, he thought, and they didn\u2019t leave him to fend for himself. Luisen recalled how, in the past timeline, people would spit on, beat, and insult him\u2026and then he felt grateful for his strict advisors.\u2018Why did I get angry and ignore them in the past? They were such good people.\u2019Ever since he was born, he was used to being supported. Luisen resolved to take as much responsibility as the support he was given.\u2018The saint was right. Nothing in life is ever free; people must work for their meals.\u2019With that in mind, Luisen was now determined to at least start earning his own keep. As payment for his meals, he would step up in this battle, save the people, and protect the future of the land!To do that he needed to successfully surrender\u2026 Since the vassals wouldn\u2019t listen to him, sending a formal envoy was impossible\u2026 How many more days could this situation last?According to Luisen\u2019s memory, tonight would pass safely, but there was no knowing what tomorrow would bring. The vassals all believed in their safety, but Luisen knew that Carlton wasn\u2019t yet using his full power.\u2018Carlton\u2026even though he may be a madman, his skills cannot be denied.\u2019Even though Carlton openly persecuted nobles and made many enemies, his ghost-like\u00a01\u00a0mercenary skills and strength enabled him to gain the confidence of Prince Ellion.The first time Luisen had seen him was during the first battle on the day the castle was besieged. He had seen him from a far-off distance. Wearing black armor, Carlton was like a death knight from old legends.With a single swing of his spear, Carlton razed swathes of soldiers, knocking out heavily armed knights and clearing his path. Countless articles and tall tales regarding the man flew about the capital, but they were still not enough to prepare Luisen to see him in person. He was the scariest human being Luisen had ever met.It was enough to scare those that weren\u2019t even standing on the battlefield.\u2018Maybe I should directly\u2026.\u2019But the battle was well underway, and it would be hard to penetrate through.He was sure that even before meeting Carlton to surrender, he would get caught up in the battle and die. Luisen frantically paced back and forth as he continued to think. Ruger, who had been watching him with an anxious face, slyly brought up the plan to escape once more.\u201cHearing what others have said, it seems like the castle will not last much longer. If the enemy truly intended to fully invade, we would have fallen immediately. It seems as if the general is lying. We have no more chances; reinforcements won\u2019t come.\u201d\u201cIf you want to escape, do it by yourself,\u201d Luisen responded.\u201cI will go wherever my duke goes! Even if I die, I\u2019ll stay by your side. Please, don\u2019t underestimate my loyalty.\u201d\u201cYou want to stay with me?\u201d\"\"\u201cB-but\u2026who knows what kind of vivid humiliation my duke will suffer from that butcher? He\u2019s a monster, you know!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you remember?\u201d Ruger explained, \u201cI told you everything. For goodness\u2019 sakes, he tore the limbs off a viscount\u2019s son with ropes and horses! To imagine you meeting such a disgraceful and horrible death\u2026\u201dRuger had a way with words. Even if the same words were spoken, Ruger\u2019s eloquence would make it seem more realistic\u2013the words would remain in your mind.\u00a02\u00a0While explaining Carlton\u2019s notoriety, Ruger gestured wildly with both hands and feet. A chill traveled up Luisen\u2019s spine.\u201cStop. I\u2019m already disturbed, but you\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d Terrified, Luisen wrapped his arms around himself.Carlton had directly chased him when Luisen originally escaped under the cover of darkness. That night remained a nightmare that had long tormented his dreams. Though Carlton had been distant enough that Luisen couldn\u2019t properly see him, he threw his spear with scary accuracy. It had missed Luisen by a hair\u2019s breadth. The attack instead hit a tree, which immediately split in half.Even now, recalling that moment caused cold sweat to form on Luisen\u2019s brow.It had been the first time in his life that he felt as if death was just around the corner. As most of his life was spent in peace and safety, he could not easily shake off that experience.For a long time afterwards, Luisen was caught in delusions concerning his ever encroaching death by Carlton\u2019s hands. A grim reaper\u2013a knight of death\u2013made in Carlton\u2019s image persistently followed him. If the saint hadn\u2019t saved him, he would not have been able to brush aside that delusion.\u201cSo, let us leave, my duke. You\u2019re scared too, right? There\u2019s nothing left for us to do here\u2026 And, honestly, wouldn\u2019t the people prefer that my lord disappeared?\u201d\u201cNnn\u2026.\u201d Luisen winced.\u201cLook at this. It\u2019s a map from the groundskeeper. If we follow this map, we can safely avoid the monster and quickly cross the forest to Dubless Pass.\u201dRuger opened a familiar map to persuade Luisen. In the original timeline, they used this map to escape to the neighboring Dubless County. It wasn\u2019t a particularly pleasant memory.Ruger had said that Count Dubless would protect him and give him the best reception, but instead Luisen was treated completely insignificantly.\u00a03\u00a0The count had held Luisen in the parlor, asked him a few questions, then kicked him out. That was when Luisen returned to the Anies Duchy, heartbroken.In any case, the map was reliable. No beasts beset him while he was traveling through the woods. A single wrong path may have led him near Carlton\u2019s garrison of soldiers.\u2026Huh?\u201cGive me that map.\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d Ruger, thinking Luisen had changed his mind, happily handed over the map.TN: Here\u2019s chapter 4!

The entrance to the forest lay a short distance from the north gate of the castle. He ran a finger down the road that stretched from that point.\u201cHere, the left path leads to Dubless?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201dLuisen pointed to some foothills directly opposite Dubless, to the right side of the forest.\u201cAnd this way lies Carlton\u2019s barracks?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s the front gate of the battle. It\u2019s opposite the way we\u2019re going. We can escape safely without being involved in the fighting.\u201d\u201cSo you say it\u2019s on the right\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no, the left side. We have to go towards the left, right?\u201dRuger looked at Luisen with pitiful eyes, insisting that he was confused.\u2018Does he think I\u2019m a fool?!\u2019Tears threatened to fall, but he stayed quiet. There was something more important than that right now. It\u2019s better for Ruger to have this misconception now.\u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019ve made a wise choice! Excellent decision! As expected of my duke, so bold and decisive!\u201dRuger\u2019s expression lightened. He gleefully handed Luisen a black robe and offered his useless flattery. Luisen frowned. In the past, he had enjoyed such flattery, but now he felt bad.What is this insincere brown-nosing? He couldn\u2019t believe he used to be pacified with such obvious compliments.He stopped Ruger\u2019s flattery while speaking ill of his past self.\u201cStop it, we need to get going.\u201dLuisen tightly rolled up the map.\u201cUh? I can hold the map\u2026.\u201d Ruger offered.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take the lead in the woods. Just follow me.\u201dRuger seemed puzzled\u2013it was natural for the servant to lead with the map and for the master to follow. However, he thought nothing more of it\u2026 Luisen was originally a capricious man, and Ruger thought his master was too transparent to have any schemes. He never imagined there would be a plan other than to go to Dubless.\u201cDubless will be safe. Carlton won\u2019t be able to follow us there!\u201dRuger led the way with laughter and joy. Even if Luisen were to take the lead in the forest, Ruger had to guide them to the place where the horses and money were hidden.Looking at his light-hearted back, Luisen thought to himself, \u2018I\u2019m sorry to lie to you, Ruger. But, this time you won\u2019t die because of me. This is for the best.\u2019Of course, Luisen had no intent of running to Dubless. Why would he run when that was what he regretted in the first place? He was not very smart, but he wasn\u2019t foolish enough to step onto an obviously hellish path.****As soon as they slipped out of the fortress door, the entrance to the forest stretched out before them. In the night, the forest seemed like a huge monster. An inky darkness of unimaginable depth enveloped it wholly. From the back, the sounds of the battle could be heard; from the front, crickets chirped. In the midst of all of that, a strange silence weighed upon Luisen\u2019s shoulders.It was common knowledge that the forest at night was dangerous. And, apart from common sense, Luisen was afraid of the forest. He had entered the woods many times to forage for food after getting chased out of the cities.Every visit was a crisis of death. How fierce the wild animals were\u2026and how numerous the monsters were\u2026 The traps set up to hunt them were also incredibly dangerous. He almost lost his ankle once when he got caught in one of those traps. He even ate toadstools while blind with hunger.It was almost laudable that he was even still alive.Ever since he was young, he was told to be careful of his weak body, but he may have actually been unexpectedly tough.\u2018Eugh\u2026\u2019 Luisen tried to relax with trivial musings, but it didn\u2019t work. The endless darkness itself was an entity that overwhelmed people.\u2018It feels like my death knight will soon arrive\u2026\u2019According to the legends, deep in the forest where moonlight couldn\u2019t penetrate, a solitary headless knight roamed. He was once the most honorable knight, but he was corrupted and became depraved. He betrayed his master and violated the sacred knights\u2019 vow. He was said to have been sentenced to death, hung by his neck on the walls of the castle and dumped deep in the woods. Now, he was said to reap the souls of the guilty who wandered into the forest.During his wandering and delusional days, whenever Luisen attempted to find some peace in the forest, he would hear the thundering sounds of horses\u2019 hooves. The death knight would appear at the corners of his eyes, from the darkness\u2013an envoy from heaven to punish him.He was not allowed to rest.They say if you were caught, your body would be torn apart and scattered in the fields and meadows and your soul would be locked away and tormented forever. Like an insidious shadow, the knight sat in the darkness and whispered to Luisen, \u2018Run away, run far far away.\u2019Luisen\u2019s mouth was dry with fear. Though he no longer clearly saw those delusions, he still felt that someone was watching him, hidden. The wind caressing his neck was cold like a blade.\u2018No, no no. There\u2019s no way that the knight of legend exists in this world.\u2019Of course, the knight of death was just a fictional being. The knight who chased Luisen persistently was just one of the many delusions Luisen\u2019s consciousness had created. After meeting the saint and facing his own mistakes, the knight seemed to have disappeared.Looking back, Luisen only saw Ruger\u2019s blank face. There were only two of them, him and Ruger\u2026\u2018That\u2019s right. It\u2019s just an illusion.\u2019Luisen, after much internal struggle, shook off his fear and stepped into the woods.*****Luisen and Ruger walked silently. As they went, the road became narrower and the overgrowth of plant life climbed up to their knees. The old, long-standing trees were thick and dense, and darkness filled the gaps between the trunks. The two were hidden from the softly shining moonlight by their dense branches.\u2018Ah, I think there\u2019s something in front of me.\u2019Luisen walked forward step by step, even as he felt like he was about to cry. The lamp he was holding was enough to see the immediate area around his feet, but the flame was too small and weak to conquer the forest at night. A sudden wind shook the foliage. Luisen hunched his shoulders in terror.\u2018Ugh\u2026I\u2019m scared to death.\u2019Luisen was still making steady headway, but what was scary was undeniably. He glanced at Ruger\u2013he was silently following his master without a word. It would have been a lot less terrifying if he was spouting his usual inane conversations.\u201cMy duke.\u201d\u201cHuh? U-uh, yeah?\u201d\u201cAre you sure we\u2019re on the right track?\u201d\u201cYeah, we\u2019re where we\u2019re supposed to be.\u201dLuisen evaded Ruger\u2019s true question. It wasn\u2019t as if his aide was originally from Anies anyway. He was born and raised in the capital until he followed Luisen here; how would he know the surrounding geography well?However, Ruger suddenly stopped.\u201cWhy is my lord lying?\u201dAt his unexpected words, Luisen felt like his heart was about to fall through his stomach. Quick-witted Jerk!! He was always clumsy when Luisen needed him but sharp at times like this! Ruger looked at Luisen with a frigid expression\u2026enough to make Luisen wonder if this was the same servant who had simpered and begged him to run away.\u201cYou\u2019re going the opposite way.\u201d\u201cN-no, I\u2019m not?\u201d Luisen stuttered. Damn it. He lamented his atrocious acting skills and non-existent wit.\u201cAs expected,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cI thought something was weird. My cowardly duke choosing to lead the way with a map and a lamp? The road was so bumpy, and yet you didn\u2019t get annoyed with me once? My lord definitely had another plan.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are we headed towards Carlton\u2019s barracks? Do you want to die?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not dying! Why would I die?\u201d\u201cThen what are you doing? Are you going to surrender and beg for your life?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Luisen\u2019s silence affirmed all that was said.\u201cAre you serious? My lord, have you gone crazy?\u201d Ruger couldn\u2019t believe what he heard.\u2018Yeah\u2026 I guess I seem crazy. It\u2019ll look as if I\u2019m putting my own head in the lion\u2019s mouth.\u2019\u201cCrazy. Absolutely mad. \u201cNo wonder he was so obedient about leaving. Damn.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry I deceived you\u2026but don\u2019t worry. I have an idea.\u201d\u201cMy duke thought of something? You\u2019ve lived without thinking so far!\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a bit too much.\u201dIt was a disrespectful remark, but Luisen couldn\u2019t refute it. Ruger was someone who had been by his side all throughout his good-for-nothing trash days. Furthermore, Ruger was someone who died while helping Luisen escape\u2026 He was not in a position to yell at Ruger.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s my fault for letting my lord lead. Let\u2019s at least turn back now.\u201d\u201cNo, I have to meet Carlton. If you want to go to Dubless, I\u2019ll give you the map. You can go on your own.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t do that! How could I abandon my duke for safety, alone? You must go with me.\u201d\u201cYou can go alone.\u201dRuger\u2019s loyalty shined through, but Luisen\u2019s heart was firm.\u201cI will force my lord to come with me, if it comes down to it.\u201d Ruger inched closer, holding a fist. He was prepared to use physical force if his master wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201cHey! This is mutiny!\u201d Luisen stepped back.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. If I don\u2019t take you back to Dubless territory, I\u2019ll die anyway.\u201d\u201cGet a hold of yourself! Don\u2019t be too scared\u2026 Just trust me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather believe in our \u2018fuzzy\u2019\u00a01\u00a0than in you, my duke!\u201d\u201cHey! Fuzzy is my dog! That\u2019s too much, really. Were you really such a brash person?\u201d\"\"It seemed persuasion was impossible. Luisen made a split-second decision, throwing the map and lamp into Ruger\u2019s arms. When Ruger faltered at the new weight, Luisen turned and ran.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201dTN: thanks for joining me for these two chapters!

    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMy duke!\u201dLuisen ran like crazy. He had roughly memorized the right path, so he just had to avoid capture. Ruger followed close behind.\u2018Why is he so good at running?\u2019Ruger ran like a bolting deer. Luisen mustered all the strength he could access from deep within him. His face turned red and sweat flowed like rain. Luisen\u2019s body was not used to the rough and rugged forest path, filled with tree roots and stones. Back then, he would insist on riding on a carriage if he had to walk more than three steps.Soon after, Luisen tripped *heroically* over some jagged pebbles, and Ruger, sporting a despondent expression, grabbed Luisen\u2019s wrist. Luisen spent what strength he had, but ultimately the chase was cut short.\u201cMy lord, why have you needlessly wasted energy like this?\u201d Ruger asked dispiritedly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe knew it was pointless. Though his heart would have crossed the forest twice already, his feet could not follow. Luisen hung his head, embarrassed.However, Ruger then suddenly stopped approaching. \u201cShit,\u201d he swore softly.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u2018Did he just curse? To me?\u2019 Luisen\u2019s eyes became comically round. \u201cNo matter how much I lied to you, isn\u2019t cursing just too much? I\u2019m still your master\u2026\u201d\u201cNot, not you, my duke.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dLuisen looked forward. Yellow eyes were floating in the darkness. A loud and creepy growl broke the silence.One by one, the eyes stepped forward. Short and green-skinned, bulging eyeballs set in a bizarre face, and skinny except for a bloated stomach\u2026a goblin appeared.\u201cWhy is a goblin here\u2026.\u201dGoblin.Monsters that lived in the forest. However, they lived in the deep and humid wetland areas of the woods and never left their designated habitat.They were generally afraid of large groups of people, so they never appeared close to the roads\u2026 So why were they here right now?\u201cHide behind me.\u201d Ruger had already drawn his sword. Luisen dove behind his back on instinct.Three goblins approached them, but only Ruger had a sword. Though swordsmanship was considered an aristocratic endeavor and many noblemen cultivated such an ability, the four great lords concerned themselves more with matters of governance. Luisen was different from the general aristocracy; he ruled over those who would fight for him. Since he would never use the sword in any official capacity, he had never learned swordsmanship properly. He didn\u2019t pack a sword for travel, either.The old him didn\u2019t want to learn before, but now he desperately wished he\u2019d been more studious!His retainers would bar him from using even a letter knife, worried that he\u2019d hurt himself. Thus, if Luisen wanted to learn swordsmanship, he would surely meet vehement protests.Anyway, the goblins in front of them were a more pressing issue. The green monsters narrowed the distance between them, little by little. Thankfully, Ruger, counter to his usual image, was quite proficient with the sword. The situation could have been worse.\u201cI\u2019ll fend them off and then follow after you. Please run to the left, towards the direction of Dubless,\u201d Ruger said.\u201c\u2026.Okay.\u201dKek, Kek!The goblins all attacked simultaneously. At the same time, Ruger lunged forward, sword aimed at one of their necks. Without any extraneous movements, his sword drew a clean cut across, beheading the monster.Keghk! A single goblin instantly extinguished with a scream. A gap formed in the goblins\u2019 siege.\u2018Now!\u2019Luisen immediately ran through that gap, heading towards the enemy barracks.\u201cDuke! Ah, damn it! To the left I said!\u201d\u201cSorry!\u201d Luisen shouted.Ruger couldn\u2019t follow as he was blocked by the goblins. Similarly, the two remaining goblins couldn\u2019t turn to follow Luisen since Ruger\u2019s sword demanded their attention.But as he was running through the forest, a waiting goblin suddenly appeared out of the underbrush before him. Perhaps this goblin was a straggler, as it seemed surprised to see Luisen instead of its scout mates. Immediately, it pounced on him.\u201cUrk!\u201dLuisen stepped backwards to avoid the goblin\u2019s nails. His heart felt as if it was about to burst, his throat clogged with the smell of blood. The muscles in his thighs were spasming, and his ankle felt sore whenever his foot touched the ground\u2013perhaps he had sprained it as he was staggering around in the forest. Regrettably, the opposing goblin was quite agile. Luisen kept running backwards to escape but eventually stumbled onto the ground.*thud*\u201cMy duke!\u201dRuger shouted, but he was unable to come and help his master. The goblin laughed sinisterly and rushed closer to Luisen, its small, yellow eyes glistening. It\u2019s teeth, unlike a human\u2019s, were dense and pointed, making horrible clacking sounds as they gnashed against each other.The sight was dirty and horrifying.Luisen began to crawl backwards, throwing whatever he could lay hands on in the goblin\u2019s direction.\u201cGo away! Don\u2019t come any closer!\u201d\u201cKek, kek.\u201dLuisen\u2019s struggles had no effect. The goblin raised its club\u2013which was the size of its own head\u2013high in the air. Just one swing of that club would crush Luisen\u2019s delicate head, sending him straight to heaven. These goblins were stronger than they seemed; they weren\u2019t called monsters for nothing.Perhaps dying with one quick swing wouldn\u2019t be so bad?Rather than living a long, clumsy, and useless life, maybe it would have been better to just die immediately. How many times before had he thought it would have been better to die than to live a sinful and painful life? When the saint moistened his lips with wine while the two slowly awaited the messenger of death\u2019s scythe, Luisen had been afraid but also slightly relieved that he would finally be freed.He couldn\u2019t have imagined he would be sent back to the past.\u2018But\u2026If I died here, everyone would think I perished while running away, right?\u2019How pathetic. He would become a lord who perished at the hands of goblins after taking the wrong road while cowardly escaping battle.If he died here, he would suffer a far worse reputation than what he had pre-regression. His name would pass as an insult between the little ones in the kingdom.\u2018I can\u2019t die here! Think about it, Luisen! How can I deal with monsters?\u2019Luisen suddenly recalled the words of the one-armed pilgrim, the saint he desperately believed in.\u2018The eyes!\u2019Luisen grabbed some soil and threw it into the goblin\u2019s eyes. Simultaneously, he kicked at it with all his might. It was a rather powerful kick, containing all his anger and his refusal to die so helplessly. The goblin\u2019s body flew back with a thud, and the impact caused it to start convulsing.\u2018\u2026\u2026?\u2019Were his kicks really that strong? Did he have some hidden ability to kill goblins with one kick?\u2018I didn\u2019t think that would work.\u2019Luisen blinked. When he looked at the goblin corpse again, he noticed a spear piercing its body. The moment his feet had collided with the goblin, it seemed a spear had flown in and killed it.\u2018If I hadn\u2019t fallen back and kicked the goblin\u2026I might have also died.\u2019Goosebumps travelled up his trembling skin. As he observed the corpse with fearful eyes, something in the dark caught his attention.A death knight.A black knight of death was standing in the darkness.He wore black armor and a black cape\u2013even his horse was all black. It was just as if a knight\u2019s shadow had come to life. Slowly, his horse approached Luisen.*rattle, clink*The armor signaled his approach, rattling at the joints and scraping against itself with every movement. The chilling ring of the iron scratched at Luisen\u2019s ears.\u2018No, the knight of death is simply my own delusion. Nothing like that actually exists. Go away!\u2019But then\u2026how did a spear pierce and kill the goblin? Was the knight actually real? Luisen opened his eyes slowly, and the death knight was still there\u2026It seemed it was not an illusion.Luisen\u2019s face turned pale, and his heart began to skip beats. A white fog settled within his mind.For a moment, Luisen had forgotten he was travelling to Carlton\u2019s barracks to surrender, to prevent a tragedy.\u2018He\u2026He\u2019s come to judge me. You\u2019ve been chasing me\u2026come to tear my body to pieces and cast my soul into hell.\u2019Luisen tried to crawl away from the death knight, but he ended up just wriggling on the ground. He felt as if his arms and legs were paralyzed.A completely different pressure than when he had faced the goblin weighed down on Luisen. He felt suffocated. He was entranced, bound by the knight\u2019s gaze, and couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away. Though the moment lasted for only a second, time felt like it was dragging by.The death knight opened his mouth, \u201cLuisen Anies?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dA low pitched voice had come from the gaps of the knight\u2019s helm\u2013a human?Ironically, the chilling voice snapped Luisen\u2019s spirit back into reality.\u2018Huh? He talked? He called for me?\u2019Only then did Luisen notice that the knight in front of him was not headless. This man was not the knight of death from legends.\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Luisen responded.The knight\u2019s voice sounded somewhat derisive. He looked down upon Luisen with disgust in his eyes.\u2018Who\u2019s this anyway?\u2019 Luisen thought. His gaze was one he couldn\u2019t forget. It was the same gaze he\u2019d received from passersby when he\u2019d been wandering as a beggar.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201dThe knight did not allow Luisen to ask questions. He suddenly grabbed Luisen by the collar and dragged his body, dangling in the wind like a piece of paper, upwards. Luisen was then loaded onto the horse\u2019s rump like a piece of luggage. The saddle dug into his soft belly.\u201cNgh!\u201dThe knight turned his horse around and started to gallop. He sped up as if he had already forgotten his bedraggled passenger. The black horse ran at an unbelievable speed, not slowed down in the slightest by the addition of the weight of another adult man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMy duke!\u201d\u201cAck, get this guy! Why is he so strong?!\u201dBehind him, Luisen could hear Ruger\u2019s desperate shout and the sounds of fighting. However, Luisen could barely take care of himself. The forest was rough and unpaved. Every time the horse\u2019s powerful hooves hit the ground, dust rose and pebbles bounced off of Luisen\u2019s head.Luisen held on with all his strength. He could fall off at any errant jostle! If he were to fall off the horse at this terrifying velocity, he would surely sustain a grave injury. There was nothing to hold onto, nor did anything properly tie him down, so he just plastered his whole body onto the horse.When the horse jumped to avoid tree roots, Luisen\u2019s body also flew upwards. Somehow he managed to stay on, but the hard saddle hit Luisen\u2019s stomach with every leap.\u201cHnnk! Urk! Ahh!\u201dA firm horse butt pressed against Luisen\u2019s cheek, and the horse\u2019s tail slapped his body. Blood began to pool in his head, and black spots entered his vision.The moment he began to think \u2018maybe it\u2019s better to die\u2026,\u2019 the horse came to a stop. Luisen couldn\u2019t hold on any longer and rolled down to the ground. A loud thud rang out from his impact.Feeling dizzying pain from his tailbone, Luisen bowed his head to the ground and began to gag. His body still felt as if it was floundering on the running horse. Tears automatically formed at the corners of his eyes.\u201cHurk. Hnngh.\u201d In the midst of retching, Luisen began to hear laughter.\u201cHahahahaha.\u201d\u2018You\u2019re laughing? Am I funny right now?\u2019\u201cWhat kind of foolish creature did you pick up from the woods? Did you go hunting? Are you going to eat him tonight?\u201d\u201cThat thing\u2019s so skinny, I bet it won\u2019t taste any good!\u201dThe ones talking were incredibly rude and had no manners, like a bunch of gangsters.\u2018Did I get dragged off by bandits?\u2019Luisen clutched at his dizzy head and raised his eyes. Against the backdrop of a temporary campsite, he saw numerous men. All of them were wearing armor and holding weapons. They were dressed too well to be mercenaries, but too carefree to be proper knights or soldiers.A flag embroidered with a lion fluttered violently over their heads. The blue lion\u2026a symbol of the royal family and also the symbol of the king. That flag could only be flown over the king\u2019s presence or the king\u2019s messenger. The lion was synonymous with the king\u2019s will\u2026though instead of the king, it now symbolized the first prince.In any case, the identity of those who flew this flag became quickly apparent.Carlton\u2019s army\u2026\u2026\u2018Is this man Carlton\u2026.?\u2019There was much speculation about his ambiguous origins. Most believed him to be the son of a mercenary king rather than the illegitimate son of a noble. It was later revealed that he was part of a tribe of a thousand people in the northwest territory who raised horses for a living.Carlton ran away from his home as a child and served as a mercenary wandering the monster-rich northern lands\u2013before catching the eyes of the first prince and becoming his retainer. Thus, he became one of the most notable talents in the civil war, defeating many famous noble knights.However, his characteristic rough temper and defiant attitude offended the aristocracy. As a result, when Prince Ellion finally ascended the throne, Carlton was the first to be eliminated in the new power structure.An insult to the aristocracy? A typical excuse for killing the dog after the rabbit hunt.\u00a01\u00a0An official proclamation of his execution was dispersed into the public\u2026but many speculated that Carlton had managed to run away just before the execution. Perhaps he retreated to some mountain hovel and became a bandit, or perhaps he was converted to some religion in a temple.Anyway, during the civil war, he was one of the first prince\u2019s closest confidants.\u201c\u2026\u2026You know me?\u201d Luisen asked in a trembling voice.\u201cI heard the other guy call you duke.\u201d Carlton was referring to Ruger. At that moment, the other soldiers who had gone hunting with Carlton returned with Ruger thrown around their shoulders. He didn\u2019t seem to be hurt.\u201cI-I see.\u201dWhat could he do after hearing that statement? Luisen stuck out his tongue in frustration. Carlton\u2019s words stirred the rest of the soldiers.\u201cReally? A noble? Isn\u2019t a noble more clean than that?\u201dLuisen appeared incredibly bedraggled. He was covered in mud and goblin\u2019s blood, and his hair and his clothes had become matted messes after riding on the rump of a horse. Only then did Luisen become aware of his appearance, and he attempted to recover some poise, albeit a little late.He stood on shaky legs and dusted off some loose dirt from his pants. Then, with all his strength, he straightened his back, shook out his hair, and began to neatly organize his clothes. Nothing was made particularly neater, but the natural aristocratic elegance cultivated within his body was apparent in his motions. His years as a fugitive were harsh, but he could never forget his years as a nobleman.As soon as he pushed away his fear, his delicate and sophisticated beauty shone like an heirloom. His cheeks glowed white in the moonlight, and flecks of gold sparkled in his hair.Once he regained his delicate poise, his beggarly appearance became meaningless. Rather, he began to look like a noble young man with a dark backstory, like a main character from a minstrel\u2019s story. The soldiers began to \u201cooh\u201d and chatter exclamations amongst each other.\u201cI\u2019ll introduce myself again properly. I am Luisen Anies, Duke of Anies.\u201d Luisen raised his head and firmly looked at Carlton. He couldn\u2019t guess what kind of expression might have been hidden behind the pitch black helmet. Ferocious and chilling eyes peered through.\u2018Don\u2019t show how beaten down you are. I\u2019m not a fugitive, a bum, nor the kingdom\u2019s biggest fool. Right now I\u2019m the great lord Luisen Anies, a duke.\u2019 Luisen inwardly repeated these words for courage.That was what the saint had advised. What use was there in being afraid? His opponent was a person, not a god. And, as a human being, he was still an existence that couldn\u2019t escape the disciplines and status shackled around his wrists by society.Luisen\u2019s body was the lord of vast farmlands; he should not be bullied anywhere.The Duke of Anies? The owner of that castle? The soldiers were once again agitated. Carlton was the only one who remained composed. Then, he let out a barking laugh.\u201cYou\u2019re the Duke of Anies? I wasn\u2019t sure, but I couldn\u2019t believe that this \u2018noble lady\u2019\u00a02\u00a0was wandering through the woods at night like some fugitive running away from debtors.\u201dCarlton\u2019s hostility was obvious. His tone was openly sarcastic and his eyes contained unconcealed contempt. Although societal norms would demand for deference for Luisen\u2019s rank, he did not hide his disdain.\u2018Ah\u2026so scary. I\u2019m scared to death.\u2019Luisen rebutted quickly, anxious that Carlton might whack him with those bear-like hands of his.\u00a03\u201cEscaping under the cover of darkness? Absolutely not.\u201d\u201cThen what could it be\u2026.Ah! Moonlight\u2026a deserted area\u2026two men together?\u201d Carlton gestured inappropriately towards Luisen. When Carlton erupted into laughter, his soldiers followed along.\u201cYou bastards! What is this disrespect! How dare you insult the duke!\u201d\"\"At Ruger\u2019s outburst, Carlton\u2019s eyes became more perilous.\u2018Ah\u2026please, stay quiet,\u2019 Luisen thought.Luisen gave Ruger a grudge-filled stare. Carlton wasn\u2019t laughing because he found the situation funny; he wanted to thrash Luisen\u2019s pride. Couldn\u2019t he see how Carlton\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t smile?Besides, Luisen was used to insults. Before his regression, he may have been known to blow his temper, but the current Luisen was different. He was used to even more derisive remarks and had been laughed at more than this. Why should he care about mere words when they came unaccompanied by physical pain?\u201cThat\u2019s not true either. I came here to meet you,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to meet you in the woods like that. But in any case, I seem to have arrived at the right destination.\u201dCarlton looked doubtful. He seemed to think that Luisen was making excuses after getting caught in the midst of escape.\u2018It\u2019s okay\u2026It\u2019s all right\u2026\u2019Luisen comforted himself and took out the white flag he had secretly brought. The flag was embroidered with golden wheat, the symbol of the Anies Duchy. He dropped to both knees\u00a04\u00a0in front of Carlton and raised the flag over his head.It was reminiscent of swearing an oath of allegiance to a king.Though it would have been scandalous to kneel to a simple retainer\u2026for Luisen, Carlton was more than the illegitimate prince\u2019s agent. His future and his estate were at stake. When Luisen kneeled, all chatter disappeared. Only the sounds of grasshoppers could be heard in the silence.\u201cI, Luisen Anies, son of Robert and Tina Anies and duke of the golden hills, kneel before the blue lion and the prince\u2019s proxy and plead for mercy.\u201dThis time, even the grasshoppers were shocked into silence. Every single astonished member of the barracks stared at Luisen and Carlton. A cold wind blew around them, and Carlton\u2019s horse snorted softly.TN: We finally meet Mr. ML!\u00a0 Thank you guys for joining me for these two chapters!FootnotesIdiom for getting rid of your tools after you\u2019ve used them\u00a0the world is also a homonym for lily, he\u2019s at once calling the MC delicate and pretty but useless.\u00a0The correct idiom used was \u201ccast-iron-pot hands,\u201d basically, big heavy hands!\u00a0There\u2019s uh\u2026a lot of double entendres in the raws.

Are you out of your mind, Duke?\u201d Carlton smiled, dumbfounded. The sound of his laughter was jagged sharp, piercing Luisen\u2019s back.\u201cYou\u2019re surrendering now? Then you should have opened your gates yesterday with open arms if you wanted to spare your life. We\u2019re having a hard time out in the open, all because you\u2019ve been stretching this battle out. So far, it seems like you\u2019ve been expecting others to roll onto their stomachs by the force of your good name\u2026\u201dCarlton slapped Luisen on the back of his shoulder, the force of which made his body reel. \u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not that merciful of a person. If you\u2019ve started a war, you must take responsibility for it, my lord.\u201dCarlton began to slowly creep his sword out of its sheath. A hollow sound rang in the air, and he brought the tip of his sword up to Luisen\u2019s nose.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you first and then sweep through your land. I don\u2019t know how to end things peacefully; those who fight me must be beaten to the bitter end. Especially a noble like you.\u201dThis crazy bastard.Fear threatened to overwhelm Luisen. The anger in the knight\u2019s eyes was sincere; none of his words betrayed any hesitation. His nicknames, the butcher and the slaughterer, were no exaggerations. He was someone who had no qualms about killing aristocrats.No, rather Carlton was enjoying this situation. While wandering, Luisen had met many folks who hated aristocrats. However, the difference between those men and Carlton was that the common man held fear for a noble\u2019s power. However, Carlton did not share that fear.\u2018I\u2019m really going to die if this continues.\u2019Luisen\u2019s back became wet with cold sweat. He had to think of something. He had to say something\u2026no, not just anything. He had to say something to unnerve Carlton and to suppress his anger.Luisen was already prepared for this situation.He didn\u2019t want to waste his second miraculous chance at life, so he had been thinking hard about how best to beg Carlton to spare his life. While walking along the forest road, he thought and thought again, revising his words.However, Carlton was a crazier person that he could have imagined\u2013a hopelessly mannerless one as well. No matter if they were currently enemies, the opposing lord should have been treated politely and not like human luggage. And if the enemy leader surrendered, one should listen carefully\u2026but instead Carlton immediately took out his sword?Carlton\u2019s sword began to move.\u2018Think. Get a hold of yourself, Luisen Anies. Think!\u2019He whipped himself with his words. His mind became blank, however, and he could only spit out one phrase.\u201cIf I die, so will you.\u201d\u2018Ah. What\u2019s this? I\u2019m doomed.\u2019These were words that incite conflict, right?\u201cWhat?\u201d Carlton\u2019s countenance became more frightening. Luisen hiccuped once.\u201cHave you said all that you\u2019ve wanted to say?\u201d Carlton continued, \u201cWhat glorious last words.\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201dHowever, the words were similar to what he wanted to say. The overall meaning was conveyed, but the placating words Luisen had carefully chosen to soothe Carlton\u2019s temper had all disappeared.\"\"\u2018Ahh, why now?! I wanted to be level headed in my explanation!\u2019He felt an urgent need to rectify his words. Luisen quickly continued before Carlton could say anything else.\u201cWhat are you going to do after killing me? Can you manage the wrath of the first prince or the other nobles?\u201d\u201cWhat will I do? The first prince will praise and reward me for executing his will,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cYou think the other aristocrats will allow you to get away with this? This body is still one of the remarkable great lords. My vassals will not remain peaceful.\u201d\u201cDo you still believe anyone is on your side?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s probably no noble family willing to help.\u201dIt was a bitter truth he\u2019d experienced physically. Even if they were Anies vassals in name, the support base had long been divided and bankrupted by the princes\u2019 struggle for the throne and civil war. Half of his retainers had switched to the first prince\u2019s side, while those that still supported the second prince had lost political and military strength and could not afford to help Luisen.\u201cI have no one on my side, but you, too, have many enemies. If you kill me, they\u2019ll clamor for your blood under the pretext of my murder.\u201d\u201cI care not what the other nobles say. I only followed the prince\u2019s orders. Prince Ellion has never punished me for killing anyone, no matter how important a noble he may be.\u201d\u201cYes, but those are civil war circumstances.\u201dAt the beginning of the civil war, Prince Ellion was driven to a northern fortress in an initial defeat. To showcase his strength and to continue the momentum of victory, the prince severely punished the nobles who supported Prince Paris. Carlton\u2019s cruelty proved to be the perfect display of strength, thus the prince deliberately overlooked Carlton\u2019s behavior.\u201cGet a hold of yourself. The civil war is over,\u201d Luisen said.\u201c\u2026..\u201dCarlton wavered. Luisen didn\u2019t miss how his eyes shook slightly through the gaps of his helmet. He had to have felt that the situation was changing rapidly. To have rapidly risen in status from the son of a low-class peasant to the prince\u2019s confidant, he must have had more than brawn. It would have been more advantageous for Luisen if he wasn\u2019t a fool who only had strength.The first prince knew that once he would become king, the nobles would no longer be his enemies. They would become vassals who would pledge their allegiance and riches to him.As soon as the civil war finished, the first prince would have started to see his world through different eyes. Yesterday they may have been an aristocrat who stood on the enemy\u2019s side, but today they would be possible taxable resources and servants. A king\u2019s subordinate would never dare violate the king\u2019s authority.The same went for the nobles. Even though they may fight as if their lives were on the line, they would not hesitate to join hands with the enemy to maintain their noble authority. They would marry and exchange political hostages for that goal. This was the enduring ruling-class\u2019 philosophy.If Carlton acted as he pleased, regardless of one\u2019s status as enemy or ally, the nobles would all unite to eliminate him. His excellence only mattered in times of war\u2013the nobles wouldn\u2019t let any commoner dare defy the natural hierarchy. It was obvious the nobles were waiting, grinding their teeth, searching for the opportunity to pay back their humiliation.In that sort of situation, the first prince must have thought deeply about how to best proceed. It would be a waste to eliminate a man of Carlton\u2019s talents, and the prince held a debt of gratitude to him. However, he was far too merciless and aggressive to be part of his retinue. Carlton would have been the best hunting dog, if only he could have been controlled.\u201cThat\u2019s why the prince sent you here. He wanted to see if you can act tactfully and control your bloodlust,\u201d Luisen said.\u201c\u2026.The prince is testing me?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why else would you be sent here? As you know, all of our elite soldiers have been taken as prisoners of war; we lack the resources to fight properly. Even the foot soldiers enlisted by the southern nobles on the first prince\u2019s side would have been enough to take care of us. Don\u2019t you think this is excessive?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cPut simply, it\u2019s a test to determine whether or not you are a hunting hound that can distinguish what\u2019s appropriate to bite or whether you are a rabid dog that needs to be put down. If you kill me, you\u2019ll die.\u201dIt hadn\u2019t come out exactly as he\u2019d planned, but Luisen finished speaking everything he had prepared. He sighed inside, \u2018Did everything sound plausible?\u2019Although Luisen talked confidently, as if these were his own distinguished words, the ideas were not solely his own. His deductions were the combined efforts of bits of wisdom picked up from his wandering beggarly days and from the teachings of his saint.If only he\u2019d had half the insight he did now. Perhaps then he wouldn\u2019t have lived so miserably. Even still, Luisen was not naturally smart. These were lessons he may have forgotten if not for the life or death nature of his situation.In addition, this battle was a test for Luisen as well. The first prince desired a vision in which the Duke of Anies laid flat before his authority. He was testing to see if Luisen knew the value of his own life. A test to see if he knew how to behave and whether or not he could be loyal to the future king.Before regression, both Carlton and Luisen failed spectacularly. Both of them chose the worst path, surpassing even the prince\u2019s imagination. Luisen ran away during the battle\u2019s climax, and Carlton, enraged, went wild, massacring everyone and setting the land ablaze.\u2018The first prince probably didn\u2019t know we\u2019d be this reckless.\u2019As a result, Prince Ellion suffered greatly through a grievous famine as soon as he became king.Anyway, Luisen had said everything he\u2019d wanted to say. Carlton\u2019s reaction?\u2026.Typical. He became very cross and sarcastic.\u201cWould someone who knows the prince\u2019s intentions so well gather the mere farmers to defend their castle? In the middle of harvest season?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.an internal issue,\u201d Luisen spoke vaguely. It wasn\u2019t a complete lie. If he were to say something unbelievable like he\u2019d changed his mind after returning from the future\u2026he would be strangled by Carlton\u2019s bear-like hands.\u201cHa, internal circumstances. Does that soothe your conscience? Did you think that I would just say \u2018Ah? I understand\u2019 if you spoke so lengthily? I came all the way here; I can\u2019t return empty-handed.\u201d\u2018I\u2019ve been talking for so long! I\u2019ve explained twice over why your life would be forfeit!\u2019 Seeing his words go in one ear and out the other, Luisen slowly began to get frustrated.\u2018If I\u2019ve argued this much, the least he could do is to pretend to think about it!\u2019\u201cThen, why are you so agitated?\u201d Luisen said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you feeling insecure about your position with the prince? You\u2019ve come all the way down south, away from his retinue. You\u2019re here feeling uncomfortable for some unknown reason, anxiously hunting and dragging your feet.\u201d\u201cMe? Nervous?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, cut my throat here. In the coming new year, you will hang from the wall.\u201d\u201cYou\u2013!\u201d Carlton raised his sword high. Luisen distantly heard Ruger\u2019s screams of \u201cMy lord!\u201d and \u201cOh my god!\u201d Though he was trembling, Luisen still kept eye contact, glaring at Carlton through the small gap in his helmet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His blue eyes were terrified, but they held no deceit. There was no doubt these were innocent eyes.Moreover, every single one of his words penetrated Carlton\u2019s heart. They accurately agitated the anxiety and sense of disharmony he vaguely felt. He became angrier partially because there was no way to contradict what Luisen had said.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Carlton threw his sword onto the ground. At the clanging sound, Luisen deflated like an empty sack.\u2018Ah, I\u2019m alive.\u2019He shivered. Carlton kicked the ground, cursed, and threw off his helmet.Luisen looked at him rapturously\u2013he had a far more handsome appearance than he could have ever imagined. He didn\u2019t expect such a good-looking face underneath the black helm. His rough, chiseled jawline particularly complimented his fierce aesthetic. His black hair, wet with sweat, was in disarray. It was not neat, but rather than looking dirty, the tousled effect gave off a wild aura.\u201cLet\u2019s redo it.\u201d Carlton nodded at Luisen\u2019s hand with his knife-like jawline. Luisen looked down; he had been clutching tightly at the white flag this whole time.\u201cAh.\u201d Surrender again?Luisen once again knelt down and offered the flag high in the air. He did not beg for his life\u2019s mercy twice, though. Without speaking, Carlton snatched the flag from his fingers.Then, raising the white flag high, he declared victory. The soldiers in the barracks cheered loudly. The sun began to rise like a torch burning ceremoniously upon an important event. Luisen, still kneeling, looked at the white flag flying against the dawning night sky. The kernels of the golden wheat grains embroidered on the flag sparkled like stars.***After a very plain surrender process, things proceeded like rapidly rushing torrents. Carlton\u2019s army dexterously packed up their tents and demolished their temporary holdings. The soldiers who returned from battle lined up neatly. In an instant, all clean up was finished, and Carlton\u2019s army marched towards the duke\u2019s castle.Carlton led the army from the front.His deputy, who followed along beside him, asked anxiously, \u201cIs it really okay for us to just go like this?\u201d\u201cAccording to my spy, it\u2019s not a trap.\u201d\u201cIf you say so\u2026.\u201dAccording to the spies placed in the fortress in advance, the castle was overwhelmed with defending the location and could not afford to lay traps. Carlton had thought of the possibility that Luisen would be pretending to surrender while lying in wait for a devious opportunity, but that situation seemed unlikely. Still, Carlton\u2019s deputy was deeply concerned since the current situation was far from the usual routine.Were there any others who were obsessed with the propriety of useless procedures as much as nobles? Even if there was no place to run after the castle fell, nobles would definitely declare surrender surrounded by their servants and knights, pretending to be composed and mighty. However, Luisen came with only one servant to kneel upon bare ground?Incredulous, the deputy kept staring backwards. Luisen slowly followed on a horse. His smooth, pale skin and bright gold hair shone even though they were dirty\u2013smeared with dust and mud. Though he was surrounded by enemies, the deputy felt that Luisen seemed relaxed, as if he were in no hurry.That leisurely confidence. Perhaps that was the mark of a great lord.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the Duke of Anies was a useless pushover. But, seeing him here, nobles really are noble\u2026That composure\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat an unlucky man,\u201d some soldier said. Carlton stared at Luisen, irritated.\u2018Ugh, did I do anything wrong? Stop staring at me.\u2019Luisen wanted to cry. Why did he keep staring daggers at him? It was already hard enough trying to ride a horse\u2026In fact, Luisen was awfully bad at riding. His slow, relaxed pace was actually because he could not go any faster without falling. His upright position was a result of his tense muscles, concentrating hard on maintaining balance.However, Carlton and his companions would never think Luisen couldn\u2019t ride a horse. Riding was a basic skill of the aristocracy, allowing the nobles to condescendingly look down upon the peasantry from their high seat. Of course, Luisen\u2019s noble appearance also contributed to the illusion.\u2018I should have slapped him around a bit first before listening to him.\u2019 Carlton had been in a bad mood since the start of the trip.Though the civil war was not officially over, the first prince\u2019s retainers acted as if everything was finished. The atmosphere was complacent, noisily dividing their share of war prizes. Those who used to be blood brothers would bite and snap at each other for a bigger share. Of course, on the surface they maintained the image of placid waters, keeping conflicts underwater.In the midst of that mess, all nobles secretly united under the goal of sprinkling ashes upon Carlton\u2019s future.\u2018How dare this peasant not know his place!?\u2019 The nobles were of this state of mind.Currently, Carlton\u2019s worth was still too big and the first prince still cared for him, so the nobles couldn\u2019t flaunt their hatred openly. They could only sarcastically make remarks behind turned backs, vowing to boil and eat him. These were remarks that Carlton may have poked fun at during the war\u2026but now they held an uncomfortable kernel of promise.Under these circumstances, being sent to the south to suppress the Duke of Anies had fanned the flames of anger. It wasn\u2019t enough to just merely stay by Prince Ellion\u2019s side and receive one more accolade. Carlton\u2019s head hurt from trying to navigate his relationship with the prince, who was constantly receiving gossip from the nobles regarding his matters.The nobles were busy gorging themselves upon the joy of victory in the capital. Carlton wondered if he was ordered to clean up the remnants of the war because he was low-class; perhaps if he were a nobleman, he wouldn\u2019t be such a pariah. Now that the civil war was over, would his usefulness come to an end? Beyond obligations, he felt a sense of duty. Besides, the first prince himself commanded him to tie up loose ends\u2013it was impossible to reject this order.In the face of such powerlessness, Carlton wanted to make an example of the Anies Duchy to declare his undiminished robustness. The Duke of Anies was an existence that symbolized nobility far greater than the mosquitos at the capital. Through the duke\u2019s total domination, he had wanted to imprint fear on all the nobles who began to underestimate him.But, now that he was at the front gate, Carlton felt uncomfortable.\u2018It\u2019s too easy. It\u2019s good that things were easy, but that makes me feel on edge. What\u2019s going on?\u2019 he thought.The more he thought about it, the less answers he had. Furthermore, he had been delaying victory because of this sense of unease. This feeling had made him abandon his duties as a commander to begin hunting during the night. To destress, to take the time to relax.He couldn\u2019t have imagined that he\u2019d receive his answers from Luisen Anies, captured during his hunt. Carlton felt even worse now, since Luisen had pinpointed other doubts that he himself wasn\u2019t even aware of.\u2018What kind of man is Luisen Anies?!\u2019He was that stupid fellow who got dragged around by the second prince. It may have been another matter if he was cautiously using the prince for some sort of advantage\u2026but he was a pushover of a man who had spent and lost all his supplies and troops.Furthermore, his fellow trash lords\u2013the very same friends that would laze about in the capital together\u2013would rather take an oath of service to the enemy future-king. He had lost control to the extent that even his capital friends refused to extend a helping hand. If he were to spend his days wasting at the capital, then he should have built his own political base. It was natural that Luisen had procured a reputation of being a fool who was born with a good umbilical cord and nothing else.If he hadn\u2019t been born as the duke\u2019s son, or even if the duke had one more child, Luisen would have joined the rats and birds in the streets.That had been Carlton\u2019s assessment of Luisen\u2026\u2018He\u2019s somehow different from what the rumors said,\u2019 he thought.Luisen\u2019s argument was absolutely essential to Carlton at this point. The war was over. The young first prince would become king. There was no point to discussing who the king would prioritize among the nobles he had history with and the mercenaries he picked up on a whim in the northern lands. Luisen\u2019s comments were tantamount to a sobering poke in Carlton\u2019s careless ribs. He\u2019d returned to his senses.People everywhere said that nobles were special beings who bled blue. They may have been the same species, but nobles could access a different perspective; as such, it was natural for them to reign over others. The average citizen accepted that they should live as they are told.Carlton had defied that mindset all his life, but this time he was completely defeated by Luisen\u2019s insight. He couldn\u2019t believe that such a pushover could divine a wisdom which his strength of body could not overcome.\u2018You\u2019ve provoked your enemies to your heart\u2019s content, and yet you seem calm. Is that the greatness of true blue blood? That can\u2019t be true\u2026Maybe he was lucky somehow. Maybe someone assisted him.\u2019Carlton didn\u2019t want to admit that he was somehow worse than Luisen. However, it was true that he accepted Luisen\u2019s surrender after a few words of persuasion. His words were just too plausible to ignore. It was as if somehow Luisen had seen the future and knew exactly what would happen afterwards.\u2018\u2026We\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll pay him back for this displeasure at any sight of falsehood.\u2019 Carlton gritted his teeth.A ways back, Luisen felt a cold chill for no discernible reason.The procession finally arrived before the front gates. Carlton stopped the army procession and watched the duke\u2019s reaction.Carlton\u2019s remaining soldiers on the castle walls withdrew, drunk off the relaxed atmosphere. Without warning, Carlton\u2019s blue flag could be seen flying in the air. However, next to the blue lion, a flag emblazoned with golden wheat fluttered as well.\u2018Eh? Why is that there?\u2019 the inhabitants of the castle thought. Then, following the flag, they discovered Luisen.\u2018Why is our lord over there?\u2019The castle became a mess. The castle\u2019s denizens began to call for their superiors and were asking what had happened.\u201cThose guys really are surprised, aren\u2019t they?\u201d the deputy said.\u201cThis isn\u2019t an illusion. Everything\u2019s too chaotic\u2026..They really had no idea that their lord left to surrender,\u201d Carlton agreed with his deputy as he carefully scrutinized the castle walls. \u201cThere must have been some internal struggle. The young duke was genuine.\u201d\u201cThe duke seems to be afraid of his retainers. Perhaps he has no real position within the castle?\u201dEven so, how could the duke run barefoot across the woods to surrender? It seemed as if the internal chaos wasn\u2019t ordinary.\u201cIt\u2019s worth seeing him in such a sorry state.\u201d\u201cLike this, will the duke not have become a traitor to his people? Perhaps it would be best for us to keep the duke under seclusion\u2026\u201d\u201cLeave him alone. They won\u2019t kill him.\u201d Carlton chuckled, a bit grumpily\u2013he wanted to see Luisen shaken off his pedestal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the owner of the castle, Luisen, standing at the front, the gate which had not opened despite all imminent threats began to creep ajar.The people stationed at the outskirts had no idea why Luisen appeared from outside the walls, nor why he was with the enemies. However, they had no choice but to open the gates for their lord.As soon as Carlton stepped foot inside, he skillfully disarmed most of the still-resisting soldiers and seized the castle. Many of the soldiers were peasants in the first place. When the gate unlatched, many were shocked and preoccupied with running away.The retainers, who had heard the news from a messenger from the outer walls, gathered in front of the inner door.\u00a0 Rather than to welcome Carlton, they were practically salivating to catch Luisen and figure things out.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a moment to have a conversation.\u201dAt Carlton\u2019s kind offer, Luisen\u2019s complexion became pale. The brazen, pretentious image of a noble disappeared, and it was replaced by an expression befitting a pig being dragged to a slaughterhouse. He gulped back a cry of denial. Carlton observed his demeanor, pleased.\u2018Ah, come on! It\u2019s common sense to separate the lord from his advisors so they can\u2019t do anything foolish!\u2019However, he was too afraid of Carlton to complain and couldn\u2019t utter a single protest. Instead, he was pushed into the conference room with the rest of his retainers. Luisen turned around hesitantly.The conference room was filled with terrible silence. As if to ask each other what had happened, the retainers simply stared at one another. Luisen felt as if their gazes were choking him.He sweated profusely. Unable to stand the silence, he began talking.\u201cI surrendered.\u201d\u201cAre you out of your mind?\u201d the normally soft-spoken treasurer shouted.Though the others in the room did not raise their voices, they all agreed silently with him. Is he sane? Is he crazy? What on earth has our lord done?! Even if they didn\u2019t voice their thoughts, Luisen could see their questions written plainly on their faces.\u201cSo what will we do now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be seen as a traitor! This matter won\u2019t just blow over.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know why that barbarian was sent here? He was tasked with razing the whole kingdom, leaving no survivors!\u201d\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking? Surrendering?!\u201dThe knight commander clenched his fist and hit his chest, trying to chase away his frustration. Swords and armor were confiscated from the pitiful-looking knights\u2013they stared at Luisen with a despondent expression. The tender-hearted servants around them wept as they imagined a terrible future.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. We\u2019ll all be fine,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cHow so?\u201d the treasurer asked.\u201cWhat the first prince wants is not the fall of our dukedom.\u201d Luisen once again told the others what he had told Carlton. All his theories, his knowledge for why Carlton was sent here, the first prince\u2019s test for both of them.\u201cAnd so Sir Carlton agreed. There will be no pillaging in our lands, nor will he harass our people.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201dThe treasurer was surprised to hear that the enemy would not be looting them. Maintaining the army required a great deal of wealth. Without the backing of a wealthy family, supplies would run thin, so looting recouped losses. In particular, mercenaries like Carlton were famous for their lack of compassion and were no different from bandits.\u201cCarlton is following the prince\u2019s orders to gather the allegiances of the southern lords that were not originally on Prince Ellion\u2019s side. Peaceful transition would be impossible without our help, so the enemy is being cautious.\u201d It was hard to find fault with Luisen\u2019s claims. His uncharacteristic cleverness impressed the butler, who had already unconditionally favored him. However, most of the others doubted Luisen.They may have listened if these same words came from another\u2019s mouth. But from Luisen\u2026.it was an issue\u2026\u2018The lord can\u2019t possibly say something intelligent\u2026\u2019\u2018Can we believe those claims? Isn\u2019t he just spouting drivel from that mouth?\u2019All of the advisors in the duchy did not trust Luisen at all. He was a lord who had never stayed in the territory for longer than a month within a year. Perhaps they could have trusted him if he were to stay still, but he was the type of trash to get into scandal after scandal. He was the one to throw his quiet family into the whirlwind of civil war.Instead of listening to Luisen, who squandered the respected position as the Duke of Anies, the retainers looked towards the general, who had effectively led the estate on Luisen\u2019s behalf. What did he think of these claims?Bearing the weight of confused gazes, the general opened his mouth calmly.\u201cWhether the duke\u2019s judgement was logical or not, the gates have already been opened. Carlton\u2019s soldiers have already taken control of the castle. All we can do now is wait.\u201d\u201cBut commander, even so\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you have a better idea?\u201dThe general neither affirmed nor denied Luisen\u2019s words. Luisen felt even more anxious, waiting for some kind of judgement.\u201cBut I\u2019m disappointed, my lord.\u201dLuisen\u2019s heart dropped. To him, the general was more than just a retainer. He was his teacher, a replacement for his father. On one hand, he was sick of being under his control; on the other hand, he was afraid to disappoint him. Even now, the general\u2019s statement tormented his heart.\u201cOnce again you\u2019ve arbitrarily run off without properly consulting anyone.\u201d\u201cI apologize\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you were to surrender, there are procedures that suit the status of a duke. You ignored all that and went to the enemy camp alone, kneeling to another. What would the people of the kingdom think of this?\u201d\u201c\u2026They\u2019d probably say that I was terrified and begged for my life. That I threw away all dignity.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2026.knowingly made that mistake?\u201d The general took a deep breath, trying to constrain his rising anger. His tone was as calm as always, but there was unmistakable fury hidden within his voice.\u201cI\u2019ve taught you time and time again. Whatever you do, think of the honor of the Anies Duchy,\u201d the general continued.\u201cI did\u2026\u201d Luisen mumbled. He always felt like a 10-year old child when standing in front of the general. The general had given up on past Luisen\u2019s indifference and laziness, but he would not concede on maintaining a noble\u2019s honor.The dukedom was the royal family\u2019s granary. Without the wheat produced from this territory, the kingdom could not survive. The Anies family had ruled this land longer than the royal family without ever being invaded.The general loved this land, and he was proud of dedicating his life to the duke\u2019s family. Knowing how much he had pledged to the duchy, Luisen couldn\u2019t raise his head in front of him.But Luisen did not have any regrets. This decision was perhaps the best choice he had made in his time as a lord. It was regrettable that the general\u2019s pride and heart were inevitably hurt.\u201cHonor and pride do not save lives,\u201d he said.\u201cAnd does someone who idled their life away as a delinquent have the right to say that?\u201d\u201cJust be honest and say that you wanted to live. You haven\u2019t stayed at the estate for longer than a month since you were sixteen, so don\u2019t make the excuse that you somehow care for the territory now. Didn\u2019t you say you had no desire to waste time in a rural village and instead wanted to be in the capital with your friends?\u201dLuisen felt the governor\u2019s long-standing resentment from his words.\u2018Did I say things like that?\u2019Luisen was speechless. To be honest, he had no memory of any of this. No matter how hard he tried, his delinquency was a dim, hazy memory of many years ago. He only knew how he chased pleasure, like water chasing water.\u201cLet\u2019s stop this argument. As the general said, we have no choice but to sit still and wait.\u201d The treasurer stepped up to mediate, \u201cLet\u2019s hope the lord\u2019s judgement was correct.\u201d\u201cTch. How did we become people who would wait around for a mercenary\u2019s instructions.\u201dThe general left without hiding a single ounce of his disappointment. The knight commander quickly followed as well. The treasurer hesitated, noting the tension between Luisen and the general, but ultimately followed the two out of the room. As each minister and the heads of each organization filed out of the conference room, everyone else also made themselves scarce.They gave Luisen pointed and hostile glares. Some even sighed or cursed quietly. According to the mood, if Luisen were not the lord, he would have been stoned as a traitor by now.\u201cAre you all right, my lord?\u201d The butler remained to console Luisen.\u201cEveryone is just very proud of the duchy and this estate. It\u2019s the first time in history that these southern lands have been conquered, so everyone\u2019s pride is smarting. They\u2019re searching for avenues to lash out. They\u2019ll understand you\u2026gradually.\u201d\u201c\u2026.Thank you,\u201d Luisen sighed. The consoling butler also did not seem to trust in his judgement. He just had more compassion for Luisen than anger for his actions.\u2018My past truly is a shackle on my ankle. It\u2019s all my fault.\u2019That\u2019s right, who told him to act like trash? This was why people said that it was best to live a sincere, kind, and faithful life.Though the fact that no one understood his true feelings made him sad, Luisen accepted his fate calmly. He had known it would be like this\u2013actually it was more heartbreaking than he had prepared himself for, but this hurt was inevitable. The past could not be erased.But that was okay. The horrid night he had regretted had already passed, and a new morning, a new hope, had arrived. The unhappy future had already shifted. He would no longer wander around miserably and suffer the harassment from the spirits of those he had indirectly killed.He had made a new future for himself.When Luisen looked out the window, he saw the panorama of the dukedom under the soft glow of the morning sun. The endless fields of wheat sported a deeper golden color, more so than any other harvest season.***Since the day the duchy was seized, a blue lion flag hung next to the golden wheat flag that symbolized the Anies family. News of the duke\u2019s defeat spread throughout the entirety of the southern region.No one was predicting the duke\u2019s victory. The general public rather laughed at the absurdity of the duke\u2019s choice to fight back. However, the blue flag hanging at the castle still came as a shock.How did the duke feel when he knelt to Carlton who, despite being the first prince\u2019s agent, was still a mercenary from the common people? What would happen now to the duchy and the citizens of the south? Many people desperately observed the castle, but no further news arrived.Carlton and his men took control with remarkable skill and neutralized all enemy forces. They locked the gates to the castle and simultaneously banned all access.\u201cI bet something terrible is happening there.\u201d\u201cAs expected of Carlton. I don\u2019t know if anyone in that castle will be left alive.\u201d\u201cThen, what\u2019ll happen to the duke?\u201dThe common people expected hell to unleash\u2013Carlton and his troops were just too notorious.\u201cI bet he\u2019s alive but\u2026to the pride of a great lord\u2026he\u2019d be living without truly being alive.\u201dEveryone thought the same. People sympathized with Luisen\u2019s situation. Though they thought him foolish and may have cursed his name, they didn\u2019t think he deserved the horrors Carlton would inflict upon him. Either way, the people agreed that his future looked extremely bleak and miserable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The soldier guarding the door inspected the tray Ruger had brought. Meanwhile, he gave a long sigh.Luisen was chased away to this room after losing his bedroom, the nicest room in the castle, to Carlton. Luisen had said he offered the bedroom willingly to Carlton, but most of the servants seemed to think he had been forced out.\u2018How could the Duke of Anies end up like this\u2026.\u2019The guard finished his examination and opened the door. Ruger nodded his head briefly at him and entered the room. Luisen had already woken up, changed his clothes, and sat at the table without a servant to help him. At his appearance, Ruger let out another sigh.Luisen was always surrounded by the finest of materials and waited upon by a dozen servants. He would pay no attention to things unless they were expensive and precious. Of course, he had always stayed in a refined and splendid mansion within the capital as well.\u2018This room, by comparison\u2026.\u2019The room was spacious and clean, but the furniture was worn-down and the decorations were old-fashioned. The space seemed even shabbier as Ruger compared it to an empty storage room.Furthermore, Luisen was not assigned any attending servants. All of the duke\u2019s servants were busy cleaning up after Carlton and his men. Only Ruger stayed behind to attend for Luisen, but it was hard for him to finish the work of many people. He prioritized retrieving meals on time and keeping the room clean\u2013and even that was tiring. As a result, Luisen washed himself, clothed himself, and took care of his own needs.From Ruger\u2019s perspective, Luisen was someone who had never lifted a finger for himself; he would wear pajamas all day long if the servants didn\u2019t prepare a change of clothes.\u2018Ha\u2026.The duke is somehow brought low like this\u2026.\u2019 Ruger thought Luisen looked so pitiful.Ruger put the meal down on the table; the meal\u2019s quality was less than what the duke would usually be served. Bread, soup, meat, and various vegetables\u2013poor barons in the capital would eat more extravagantly than this\u2013though certainly the meal was plentiful for Luisen\u2019s changed life. The butler secretly wiped away tears thinking about his master\u2019s current situation.But Luisen was different.\u201cIt\u2019s a feast today, too!\u201d He happily welcomed the shabby, unfit for a noble meal. Ruger looked at Luisen in bewilderment.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you have anything to say? Can you say it while I\u2019m eating\u2013I\u2019m quite hungry.\u201dRuger did not know whether or not Luisen was trying to stay positive, or whether he was simply air-headed. The one who had his pride scarred the most, the one who should have been the most melancholy, seemed perfectly fine.\u201cNo. Please eat.\u201d\u201cMhmm,\u201d Luisen answered brightly, and began eating.First, he cut off a large piece of the bread and *aang* pushed it into his mouth. While chewing the bread, he gulped down the nice hot soup in one long slurp. Then, he calmly targeted the vegetable and meat dishes. Luisen ate happily, the sincerity of the feeling disseminating through his whole body.\u2018Since when did my duke eat so well\u2026?\u2019The Luisen that Ruger remembered would always look apathetically at his meals. Even when the royal chef prepared particularly ambitious food, with ingredients that would appear once in a decade, Luisen would offer no appreciation nor admiration. The chefs in the mansion had a hard time trying to satisfy his short mouth\u2026But now Luisen was gnawing on a chicken leg, chewing the salted gristle.\u2018Three hours ago, he ate three apples\u2013cores and all\u2013because his mouth was bored.\u2019 At times like this, Ruger felt that he wasn\u2019t serving the same lord as before. He had an inexplicable feeling that there was a beggar wearing his lord\u2019s skin?\u2018I\u2019ve heard of cases where binge eating relieves psychological pressure\u2026.Is he in shock?\u2019 Ruger looked at Luisen with a complicated gaze.Ignorant to all the misunderstandings Ruger was crafting inside his head, Luisen was just ecstatic at his delicious meal.\u2018As expected, bread really is the best.\u2019 In his beggar days, he had scrambled to eat bread as hard as bricks that had been thrown into the trash\u2026But white bread made only with wheat that was so soft it melted in the mouth? Luisen was in bliss.\u2018The best! Surrendering was such a good idea.\u2019 He passed his days captive as if he were having the most satisfying time in his life.When mealtime arrived, Ruger would bring freshly prepared, warm meals. the tables were laden with fruit\u2013he only had to reach with his hands to take his fill. Luisen could sit still and still have enough food to fill his belly.Ruger lamented the shabbiness of the room, but the bedroom, which had working walls, a roof, and heating, was just like a palace for Luisen. If he had wanted to sleep in a random barn overnight, he would\u2019ve had to show all sorts of flattery to the barn\u2019s owner just for a bit of hay. He had no fear of being covered in frost while sleeping, nor did he have to stay on guard all night for fear of being attacked by a wild dog.After a night of sleeping, swaddled in the soft downy mattress, Luisen felt so refreshed in the morning that he felt as if his body could fly. And all these benefits were free! This preferential treatment was thrown at him through the force of his name and status as duke!In the past, it was so easy to take all this for granted\u2013privilege came as easily as breathing. Now, though, he looked at this treatment with new eyes. Perhaps because he had corrected his mistakes, he felt like he could take some pride in his role.Well into his dinner, there came a knock on the door, and Carlton\u2019s soldier stepped into the room. Luisen froze with a spoon halfway to his mouth. Him again? Was this the end of his happy days?\u201cI was asked to escort the duke,\u201d the soldier said.\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of eating\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must go right now, without delay.\u201d\u201c\u2026.I see.\u201d\"\"Luisen put down his spoon and washed his hands clean in the wash basin that Ruger had brought.\u201cDo you always have to run when called? Isn\u2019t\u00a0he\u00a0timing this on purpose? You\u2019re always summoned in the middle of a meal,\u201d Ruger whispered to Luisen.Luisen agreed with his suspicions, but there was no choice. He could not afford to be stubborn.\u201c\u2026.I have to go.\u201d He gazed down at the table. Warm food stared back at him.Half-eaten chicken legs sang to Luisen affectionately, \u2018Are you really going to abandon me like this? Truly?\u2019 Luisen knew that if he left now, all this perfectly good food would be thrown away\u2013his heart was breaking at the waste.But he had to go.\u201cIf I don\u2019t go, I don\u2019t know how Carlton will retaliate\u2026\u201d Luisen murmured melancholically.*****Contrary to popular expectations of pained screams and crying, the inside of the duke\u2019s castle was quiet. Luisen\u2019s words at the time of surrender seemed to have led Carlton to a revelation.Carlton was careful not to cause problems while keeping his men under control. How harsh the military discipline must have been\u2013even those who had nothing to do with Carlton\u2019s occasional scoldings shriveled in sympathy for their comrades.Carlton\u2019s soldiers were mostly mercenaries; they were rough and cruel, but they were also well disciplined. They did not cause any scandals. According to the butler, they sometimes quarreled with the more energetic servants, but these scuffles could be overlooked.It seemed the brutal events that occurred during Carlton\u2019s occupation of other territories did not occur through Carlton\u2019s lack of discipline over his men but through his explicit permission. However, no one was brave enough to complain about that\u2013that had happened on other properties, not their own.Luisen arrived at the room Carlton was using as his office. Worry bred anxiety within his chest; he could feel his heart thumping.\u201cHaaa.\u201d He took deep breaths but still couldn\u2019t seem to relax.\u201cShall I open the door?\u201d his escort asked.\u201cYes.\u201dHe gave his permission to open the door but couldn\u2019t control his heart. Not long after the soldier complied, Luisen entered the room.Carlton was deep within his work at his desk. As soon as he heard Luisen enter, he smiled and stood up from his seat. As if they were two friends that had met outside on the street, he approached quickly and placed his hands over Luisen\u2019s shoulders. As soon as his big hands wrapped around his shoulders, Luisen\u2019s heart sank to his stomach.\u2018Ah, my heart hurts.\u2019Carlton dragged Luisen\u2019s helpless body to the sofa. After sitting him on top of the cushions, Carlton sat himself in a low position before him.\u201cHere you are, Duke. I\u2019m sorry I called you so suddenly.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know much, so I need my lord\u2019s advice from time to time. Please understand with your generous heart.\u201d Carlton\u2019s attitude was impeccably polite. He treated Luisen like a superior; he showed respect and used formal language. Despite Luisen\u2019s awkward responses, he maintained a friendly attitude and an open smile.That. That right there was why Luisen was scared.\u2018I don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll change again.\u2019 Luisen was reminded of a few days ago, the night he surrendered.Carlton had held a banquet to celebrate his victory, to which he also invited Luisen.\u2018Should I or should I not go?\u2019 Luisen was in a far too ambiguous position to easily join the celebrations, but he was too cautious to reject the invitation. He had no desire to give Carlton any impression of dissatisfaction.\u2018Maybe it would be better to attend, since none of the other retainers are going.\u2019 Luisen, still worried, attended the banquet.As the banquet was held in Carlton\u2019s honor, Luisen had expected to become an object of ridicule. He went with the determination to endure all mockery. Unexpectedly, Carlton treated Luisen with nothing but respect. Carlton\u2019s men also cautiously aimed to please him.Luisen was wary of Carlton\u2019s schemes, so he was cautious and suspicious at first. However, the banquet food was so delicious\u2013high-quality liquor that wrapped his tongue, food as far as the eye could see. So, little by little, the tensions began to ease and his boundaries began to soften.When the atmosphere of the party was at its climax, Carlton approached Luisen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI\u2019ll pour you a drink, Duke.\u201d\u201cUh, okay.\u201dCarlton chuckled and poured alcohol into Luisen\u2019s glass. Seeing Carlton so well-mannered, Luisen realized what great change he had brought about today.After being sick, dying, coming to the past, and almost dying again several times\u2026he had corrected many regrets in life. Even the scary Carlton was acting somewhat obediently, wasn\u2019t he? The sense of accomplishment, that he had done it all despite his lack of strength, made Luisen feel flattered.As the saint said, Carlton was neither a ghost nor a monster. He was a person, albeit an extraordinary common person. But he, too, could not be free of societal norms. He poured alcohol with the same intensity as he had when killing others\u2026To be very honest, Luisen found it slightly amusing.\u2018I guess Carlton wasn\u2019t such a big deal.\u2019As soon as that thought entered Luisen\u2019s mind, Carlton\u2019s face immediately hardened and all traces of laughter disappeared. Like a volcanic eruption, anger burst in his eyes. Carlton\u2019s hands were faster than Luisen\u2019s brain\u2013before he could process the change, Carlton grabbed him by the collar and threw him onto the table.Wham!The dishes scattered with a crash as the table broke in two. The impact on Luisen\u2019s body was enormous\u2013for enough force was used to break sturdy furniture. Luisen whined at the sudden pain. He couldn\u2019t figure out what happened or why his back was aching.Carlton poured alcohol on Luisen\u2019s hair with an expressionless face.\u201cUgh, what are you doing? What is this? You know who I am.\u201d\"\"\u201cYou\u2019re the Duke of Anies, a prolific great lord.\u201d\u201cYou know that, so why\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201dThe bright lights of the chandelier above left dark shadows over Carlton\u2019s face. His eyes, devoid of friendliness, were filled with intense hatred and murderous intent.\u201cWhenever I see people like you, I want to tear off their limbs. People like you who were born aristocrats, ignoring and underestimating me while living off the fat of the common folk. I became a mercenary because I wanted to punish you all.\u201dThese were the words of the famous mercenary that made a name for himself in the civil war. The rumor must have been true: the first prince brought Carlton under his command after seeing him break a noble\u2019s head on the battlefield.Luisen had no desire to properly confirm the depths of Carlton\u2019s hatred for the nobles. In fact, if Carlton had fully decided to kill him, Luisen would be helpless. No one would be able to save the duke.The servants holding platters had made themselves scarce, and Carlton\u2019s men stood still, looking at their leader. Luisen imagined that the moment Carlton gave his orders, the men would, laughing, draw their swords and repeat the massacres of the past.\u201cStill, this is a waste of my merits, so I\u2019ll try to be patient, hmm?\u201d Carlton\u2019s hands gripped at Luisen\u2019s neck. His hands were rough and firm, strong enough to easily twist Luisen\u2019s thin neck. In his grasp, Luisen\u2019s heartbeat thumped loudly.The noble butcher!His opponent was Carlton. The black knight who would someday come to reap his soul, from whom Luisen had fled in both dreams and real life.Luisen\u2019s body trembled. Memories of old horrors began to flood in; old fears returned like a beloved stalker. He became, at once, that same foolish lord again\u2013the one who abandoned his estate and became a fugitive.\u2018I\u2019m scared. Help me. He\u2019s finally here to kill me! Saint, please, save me from this mercenary.\u2019 Luisen prayed deep within his heart, but the saint did not answer.\u201cIt would be better for you, Duke, to maintain your fear of me,\u201d Carlton told Luisen in an almost ticklish, polite tone.\u2018Answer\u2026you have to answer.\u2019 Luisen moved his stiff head. Once, twice\u2026countless nods.Only then did Carlton let Luisen go. He returned to smiling and polite courtesy, as if this incident had never happened.Carlton had never threatened Luisen since. However, the memory of the banquet conjured up the deep fear that Luisen had forgotten since he\u2019d met the saint. Now, without his savior to help calm him down, Luisen was left to face the consuming fear alone.\u2018What a scary fellow. Instead of being a mercenary, maybe he should be a fortune teller?\u2019Luisen had thought about ignoring Carlton for a tiny bit as he handed him some alcohol. Perhaps he had grasped Luisen\u2019s mood through some minute changes in his expression. That foolish thought only passed within seconds, but, unbelievably, he recognized that short sliver of condescension.Even if a brief moment of tactlessness became apparent, wouldn\u2019t most people usually let that slight go? Carlton really didn\u2019t hesitate to stick Luisen on that table.*****\u2018Crazy bastard. Really, he should have given me some notice before throwing me around.\u2019So, Luisen became even more scared since he had no idea when that smiling facade would change. He had started to lower his eyes in front of Carlton.Breathing deeply, Luisen asked Carlton, carefully, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an armory somewhere in a warehouse to the north. However, I haven\u2019t the slightest idea of where it could be from this map alone. Do you know where it is?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLuisen wouldn\u2019t know about something like a warehouse. Weren\u2019t servants supposed to manage that?\u201cIf there\u2019s anything useful there, I\u2019d like to take it with me. I\u2019d like for you to go around and find some information.\u201d\u201c\u2026.If we\u2019re talking about some warehouses up to the north, there\u2019s at least five\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, I guess you have to be diligent. I\u2019m still lacking, so I must bother you with this work.\u201d\u201cI still have a backache from carrying food provisions from the southern warehouses yesterday\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean! If only your retainers were more robust, the duke wouldn\u2019t need to suffer this much.\u201d\u201cHa. Ha. Ha.\u201d Luisen laughed awkwardly.Well, he wasn\u2019t wrong.Luisen and Carlton both knew that the retainers in the duke\u2019s household were all feigning illnesses. With that knowledge, bringing up these retainers was like blackmail. If Luisen didn\u2019t listen obediently, he would no longer turn a blind eye to the retainers\u2019s trickery. So, when called, Luisen had to put down his food and run to Carlton\u2019s side.The advisors went on strike to express their dissatisfaction with Luisen\u2019s actions. They had told him to do whatever he wanted\u2013lo and behold, they truly did lock themselves in their rooms and refused to do anything.Luisen had lost the war, so there was a lot of work to do. First of all, one of the biggest issues was that Calrton\u2019s company must be given food and weapons as war reparations.Luisen had gone to the retainers\u2019 rooms to persuade them. He wasn\u2019t allowed to even step foot in the rooms and could only pound on their doors in vain. \u2018Carlton will kill us all, aren\u2019t you scared? Save me!\u2019 Luisen begged and threatened\u2026but they would not budge.No one, from the general to the mere administrative official, resumed their work. So Luisen had no choice but to nod and comply whenever Carlton purposefully threw more work his way. Luisen had to take care of his people.\u201cWell\u2026where should I find the key?\u201d\u201cThey say the general has it. Maybe so, maybe not. I wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d replied Carlton.So he needed to find the key first. Hah\u2026Luisen stood up, weakly, and left the room at a far more sluggish pace than when he first entered.****Sweat covered Luisen\u2019s soles in his efforts to find the key.Beyond the huge building that made up the main castle, the household owned many other buildings on the property. Low walls surrounded the castle outskirts, and beyond that, past the hills, was the city commonly referred to as \u201cdowntown.\u201dEven the scale of the castle outskirts was enormous. The large expanse of flat lands had allowed the buildings to be naturally low in height\u2013thus the outskirts sprawled across a large portion of land. First Luisen went to the various storage buildings and later discovered the room where the keys were kept separately. Luisen had learned, for the first time, that such a room even existed.However, the key to the northern warehouses was not present. After searching for a long time, he managed to uncover a record that noted that the general had borrowed the key. A sigh of despair bubbled out from Luisen.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dEven though Luisen was born and raised in this castle, everything seemed so new. If someone had told him to check the record hanging next to the door, he wouldn\u2019t have had to overturn the entire room.Of course, now he needed to overturn the feelings of his advisors.Carlton never asked Luisen to do anything particularly important or difficult. Why did he have to look for a key in the warehouse, anyway? Carlton could have broken the door if he really urgently needed to get inside. His excuses of not wanting to touch Luisen\u2019s property thoughtlessly was just another way of forcing Luisen to accept work.The real problem would be after Carlton leaves. After harvest season, winter was soon to follow. Though the south was much warmer than the other regions, winter was still quite severe. Even if the region were to prepare thoroughly, the season was still difficult to endure.\u2018I have to leave for the capital for the coronation of the first prince in the middle of winter\u2026so I have to restore order to the territory before then.\u2019Luisen now knew that his power came from the health of the territory, and he was now resolved to protect it well.\u2018I have to do well if I\u2019m going to one day invite the saint to my estate. I can\u2019t be so pathetic anymore.\u2019Luisen\u2019s saint\u2013the nameless one-armed pilgrim.Luisen had another long-term goal; he wanted to find the saint and invite him to the territory and repay all the grace and kindness he had received.Luisen\u2019s heart ached when he recalled how, after being saved from misery and the streets, he had nothing to give to the pilgrim. Now, he could repay him with more than the sincerity from the bottom of his heart.The day after he surrendered, Luisen had attempted to garner information on how to track a person\u2019s whereabouts. However, he couldn\u2019t get far after Carlton had locked down the castle.\u2018Let\u2019s cheer up! The sooner Carlton leaves, the faster I can find the saint.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He ran into a group of servants standing in front of the door. They recognized Luisen and greeted him with polite courtesy, but as soon as they passed by each other, they began to gossip in low whispers.\u201cThat was the duke.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t he locked up somewhere? Can he really walk around like that?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? He\u2019s acting like Carlton\u2019s servant.\u201d\u201cOh my lord, I can\u2019t even be proud of myself anymore if I\u2019m serving someone like that\u2026\u201dTheir secret glares burned at Luisen\u2019s back. He scurried into the general\u2019s office, pretending not to hear. Most of the servants he encountered while fulfilling Carlton\u2019s errands had similar reactions\u2013tongue-tied, thinking him pathetic.Sniffling, Luisen rubbed at his eyes. Still, tears formed as he stood there, blinking at the ceiling.\u2018I\u2019m sad\u2026.\u2019It was a natural reaction for those who had no idea of the tragedy that Luisen had averted. But, especially now, Luisen couldn\u2019t help but feel pain in his soul.\u201cHn\u2026.\u201d Luisen placed his hand on his chest. There was a secret \u2018something\u2019 hidden in his coat\u2019s inner pocket. A red, firm \u2018something\u2019 swaddled in thin cloth.That something was jerky.Perhaps because he had once starved terribly, Luisen began to lose all reason when he became hungry. He returned to a primitive state\u2013his body automatically prowled around the trash to find any stray morsel. So, he started carrying a couple pieces of emergency jerky in his pocket.Maybe Luisen was abnormal, but now the pangs of hunger would make him severely depressed. On the contrary, a full belly made him feel as if everything was okay.Luisen began to munch on the beef jerky. With his hunger assuaged, slowly his melancholic mood began to disappear.\u2018That\u2019s right\u2026this is just depression brought about by hunger. It\u2019s not about what anyone said\u2026\u2019 People who didn\u2019t know him well may pity him, but he now felt comparatively calm.\u2018They aren\u2019t beating me nor throwing stones at me. It\u2019s nothing.\u2019 The abuse he had experienced previously made his resolve strong. With jerky hanging from his mouth, Luisen searched the general\u2019s office.\u2018Here it is.\u2019Hastily stuffed inside the general\u2019s desk drawer, the north warehouse\u2019s ledger was found alongside the key. It seemed the general had been searching for useful items in the armory in preparation for the castle\u2019s defense.\u2018If I take this to him, he wouldn\u2019t make me organize the warehouse either, right? I\u2019m ending work early today.\u2019 Luisen skimmed through the ledger with delight. It was detailed with both illustrations and thorough explanations.\u2018This is a water-dowsing tool from previous droughts\u2026This is a new tool to direct water flow\u2026As many of the nearby locations were fields, many farming tools were stored in the warehouse. Come to think of it, agricultural research used to be conducted in great volume in the duchy, though Luisen\u2019s previous lack of interest had made such study less common during his generation.While searching the items one by one, a tool suddenly caught Luisen\u2019s eyes.\u2018Oh, the Flames of the Holy Spirit.\u2019It was a grandiose name, but it was simply a fire-breathing tool to eradicate locusts. Since the southern regions were a granary, swarms of locusts would gather every few years.\u2018Nngh, locusts\u2026those cursed pests from hell.\u2019It was not named \u2018The Flames of the Holy Spirit\u2019 for no reason. The pests would paint the sky black, consuming all the grain painstakingly grown throughout the year and leaving only ruin behind. In the midst of that tragedy, one couldn\u2019t help but to search for God.Luisen had observed the adults using the tool when he was young. Blessed with magic, it would burn the locusts, leaving the grain intact\u2013the grandiose name was well-earned.\u2018This truly is amazing.\u2019\u2026.Wait?Looking lovingly at the divine tool, Luisen suddenly recalled a forgotten memory.The estate would soon face one more crisis!It was after Carlton left the duchy completely devastated. A swarm of locusts descended upon half of the burned and desolate fields. The people, already exhausted from dealing with the fire, had reported watching, stupefied, as the locusts carried off all the grain.Carlton\u2019s massacre had been so shocking, and Luisen\u2019s escape had been so amusing. As a result, the locust incident had not received much attention. Locusts were a rare gossip; it did not often pass through Luisen\u2019s ears while he was struggling. In fact, most had no interest in it. Compared to the foolish lord\u2019s flight and the cruel butcher\u2019s bloodbath, events that would go down in history, the insects were simply too dull of an affair.Luisen had almost forgotten about it.\u2018Since I had originally fled to Dubless, back to my territory, and again to somewhere else\u2026I still have some time.\u2019 Luisen did not know the exact date, so he estimated by tracing his past.Though the previous events were alarming problems, locusts had the ability to control the year\u2019s crops. Left alone, these pests would attack even people and livestock.Once a swarm of locusts arrived, the upper and lower villages would join hands to fight them. The situation was troubling even for affluent households like the Anies family; for simple farming villages, the crisis was even more dire.\u2018I need to stop the locust swarm.\u2019Fortunately, the duchy had one of the greatest agricultural inventions in history\u2013the Flames of the Holy Spirit.\u2018But how do I even use it?\u2019 After Luisen became a lord, the territory lived through several locust raids. However, the advisors and vassals took care of it all. All Luisen did was watch the burning locusts and applaud them. And then, at some point, he spent the majority of his time at the Capital.\u2018But since I\u2019ve seen it used before, I\u2019ll think of something\u2026\u2019Luisen crinkled his eyebrows and thought for a long time, but he really didn\u2019t remember anything.He wanted to cry. He searched his pocket for jerky, but there was no meat left to soothe his mind this time.There were many things Luisen couldn\u2019t do. His problem-solving skills were severely reduced as Luisen had never solved estate issues on his own.Luisen had learned a lot from the saint in his past life. Maybe that\u2019s why, after returning, he recalled the saint\u2019s words so often. The same was true of this time.The saint had said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what to do, don\u2019t overreact. Stay still, walk the middle line.\u201d But what if\u00a0 Luisen couldn\u2019t stay still?Luisen went to find the general. The person who knew how best to run the estate, the person who had run the territory for a long time, was the general.*Knock knock knock*\u201cGeneral, it\u2019s me. Luisen.\u201dNo answer was returned. However, there was a soldier standing by, watching the general\u2019s door, and a sure sign of life could be heard inside. Luisen was sure the general was inside, ignoring him.\u201cGeneral, we need to talk. It\u2019s important. I think there will be a crisis soon in the territory, and I\u2019m not too sure what to do. A swarm of locusts are coming; what should I do?\u201dAt the words \u2018a swarm of locusts,\u2019 a loud noise reverberated in the room.\u2018It worked!\u2019 Luisen was happy for a moment, but he then deflated after seeing that it wasn\u2019t the general who stepped out of the room.\u201cWhat is the treasurer doing here?\u201d\u201c\u2026.I\u2019m looking after the general.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cHe is not faking illness. The doctor\u2019s been here several times.\u201d\u201cWhat does the doctor say?\u201d\u201cOverwork, stress, it\u2019s obvious. What do you mean, locusts? What about those vulgar beings that have crawled up from hell?\u201d The treasurer expressed interest. He was definitely a southern man.Of course, any southern man would grit their teeth in vexation at these locusts. Feeling a strange sense of fraternity, Luisen informed him that soon a swarm of locusts would swoop onto their fields.\u201cHm. There\u2019s nothing to support a swarm forecast,\u201d the treasurer continued.\u201cYou can predict this?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cYes. Locusts don\u2019t just fall from the sky\u2013they usually fly a certain path. Usually territories earlier in the path will tell us signs and sightings in advance\u2026but we haven\u2019t heard from them this year.\u201d\u201cWe had a civil war this year.\u201d\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Though the treasurer nodded, Luisen could see he thought differently.\u00a0The treasurer did not believe in Luisen, for he was a lord trapped in a castle with no access to outside information. How would he have received information about a swarm forecast? Even the general, the foremost authority in this household, had not been tipped off.\u2018But, it\u2019s the first time the lord has asked me about estate matters,\u2019 he thought. \u2018I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so stuck on locusts, but at times like this, I have to answer sincerely.\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s not so difficult\u2013this has happened once every few years. With proper prior communication, each village, each chief or mayor, will take care of it: every village has their own \u2018Flames of the Holy Spirit.\u2019\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve left the Flames of the Holy Spirit alone while preparing for our defense, so there\u2019s no need to worry about it\u2026.But there\u2019s no way to give advance warnings\u2026what to do\u2026.\u201d Hesitant words flowed from the treasurer\u2019s mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On top of that, Carlton sealed off the castle outskirts and those inside couldn\u2019t contact the outside world. Group assemblies were strictly banned; no matter the crisis, locust or otherwise, Luisen wasn\u2019t sure Carlton would allow the people to gather at Luisen\u2019s command.\u201cLooking at the situation, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll listen.\u201dCarlton was very, very careful. The lords who once followed the second prince were definite enemies, and the lords that followed Prince Ellion were allies that may soon stab him in the back. Luisen, who surrendered on his own, may have been believable but not unconditionally trustworthy. He may have left Luisen to his own devices, but he never dropped his guard around him.\u201cWhat if I just let things happen? There\u2019s a \u2018Flame of the Holy Spirit\u2019 at every estate. Couldn\u2019t they prevent the crisis on their own?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cThat will be difficult. Many of the young, able-bodied men have been drafted into the army. They\u2019re already so short-handed\u2026.the harvest will take more time than usual, and the damage will be greater than normal.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026.I see.\u201d Luisen had no choice but to request access from Carlton, though he wasn\u2019t sure if a man who would burn the golden fields in a fit of fury would care about something like a plague of locusts.\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have one. Don\u2019t worry too much. I\u2019ll figure something out and come back,\u201d Luisen said.Luisen somehow looked reliable\u2013the treasurer was internally surprised. \u2018The lord says he\u2019s going to fix something on his own? Really\u2026I never thought this day would ever come.\u2019Luisen had never stepped up to do anything on his own before. He had taken the mentality that the natural order would ensure that the others around him would take care of everything. When a bug flew into his cup of water, the old Luisen wouldn\u2019t say anything, wouldn\u2019t throw the water away nor cry. He would just remain silent until someone noticed the problem and resolved it for him.Inactivity became a habit\u2013there were so many servants in the household. Eyes were constantly on him, catering to his desires. Belatedly, he realized that this pattern wasn\u2019t healthy and he attempted to dissuade the servants, but it was difficult to change such deeply ingrained behavior. The uncomfortable behavior of the servants was part of the reason Luisen ran away to the capital.\u2018Now that I think about it, it\u2019s quite unusual for the lord to offer surrender personally,\u2019 the treasurer thought.Some people had said he acted impulsively out of fear\u2013most advisors thought this way. But on second thought, Luisen was not the type of person to be proactive, even while scared.\u2018They say that people change during times of crisis\u2026maybe he\u2019s maturing.\u2019\u2018No, it\u2019s too early to expect anything from him. I have no idea why he\u2019s suddenly worrying about locusts, but he could have fabricated an excuse to get out from underneath Carlton\u2019s thumb. Only time will tell.\u2019Suddenly, the treasurer recalled something.\u201cCome to think\u2013the territory that we have always been in contact with about the locusts\u2019 route is run by Baron Laures.\u201d\u201cWhat about that place?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cThe lord of that region invited Carlton to a meal and deliberately kept him waiting for half a day. Ultimately, he died from having his limbs torn off.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Hurk.\u201d Luisen turned pale. He had completely forgotten about Carlton\u2019s errand while searching for the key and the \u2018Flames of the Holy Spirit.\u2019\u201cI-I\u2019ve got to get going!\u201d Luisen quickly scurried away, forgetting all about his body\u2019s aches.\u2018It\u2019s too early to expect anything. Of course.\u2019 The treasurer had thought him quite undignified.****In the Duke of Anies\u2019 office, Carlton looked up while checking through the ledgers. He had thought his eyes were stiff\u2013it turned out much time had passed. After sending Luisen, he had sat down and sifted through letters and paperwork. No matter how strong his body was, of course he\u2019d feel uncomfortable after sitting in one place for too long.Carlton got up from his seat; he had little leisure time to enjoy the view from the window. \u2018This Anies Duchy\u2026.I\u2019ve been delayed here far longer than I had expected.\u2019When coming south, Carlton\u2019s goal was to quickly return to the capital after a successful battle. Therefore, the army did not pack enough food for an extended stay. Since the south was full of food, they had planned to source it all locally.His original plan was perfect, and despite his tardiness, the conquest was quickly accomplished without much loss. However, he didn\u2019t expect success to become a bear trap for his ankle. He could not return to war if the duchy did not offer food compensation, but receiving this repayment was dependent on the household retainers\u2019 work productivity.Usually, in this scenario, his company could have solved the problem by cutting the heads of the advisors or breaking down the locked doors of the warehouses and taking everything they could see.But now Carlton\u2019s livelihood was at risk. As Luisen pointed out, it was now time for Carlton to truly reflect on his own situation. Therefore, he could not use the aforementioned methods, and instead, Carlton had no choice but to personally pack his spoils of war and supplies on behalf of the absent retainers.That was why he was checking over the administrative documents of the southern duchy. Fortunately, Carlton had learned to read and write while chasing after a village priest, and he had learned to balance ledgers while escorting a simple peddler. An ordinary mercenary would have either been left empty handed or would have risked his life with crude methods.Anyway, Luisen Anies\u2026he was the problem.How incompetent must he have been for his retainers to go on strike at such a crucial time?At least he seemed to recognize he was at fault and was now doing his utmost best to survive, but Luisen was shockingly unhelpful. In just a few days, Carlton was more aware of the financial situation of the duchy than the duke himself.A complete disappointment.Carlton had some expectations for Luisen when he entered the castle. Luisen\u2019s insight was decisive and his attitude seemed promising; it was as if he had looked into the future. He was also surprised that the duke had come to personally surrender to him and had a clean and courteous manner. A noble that didn\u2019t treat his soldiers like dogs were rare.All the nobles Carlton had met underestimated him. They were afraid of his force and cruelty, but inwardly mocked him. No matter how well they hid it, the moment Carlton showed a bit of mercy, their condescending attitudes bled through.The victory banquet was Carlton\u2019s own way of testing Luisen, and his expectations were quickly shattered. He didn\u2019t miss the underestimation he saw in Luisen\u2019s eyes.\u2018I can put up with everything else, but I can\u2019t stand being disregarded.\u2019 Carlton had immediately grabbed Luisen\u2019s lapels at the time. Perhaps he could have been a bit more patient, but currently, Calrton had no regrets.\u2018Who told him to be so condescending, straight to my face?\u2019Also, he just manhandled him onto the table. Considering the punishment inflicted upon other nobles in the past, Carlton had thought this was a very moderate response.Anyway, despite his disappointment, Carlton had tried to be kind to Luisen in his own way. Since then, he had not laid a finger on him and had spoken to him in honorifics. He didn\u2019t even blame him for delays in his company\u2019s departure. However, Carlton was still so annoyed and vented by working him hard.\u2018This isn\u2019t even a big deal?\u2019In the old days, the scent of blood would already have traveled by wind. But Luisen didn\u2019t know that, did he? He always gave such a gloomy, short response to his jokes. Carlton complimented him? Nothing. Argued with him? Nothing. Even mocking him? Still the same faint reactions. Carlton\u2019s sense of inferiority was stimulated.\u2018Is he just not responding because he thinks I\u2019m less than dirt beneath his feet?\u2019However, Luisen\u2019s attitude was not due to his displeasure at interacting with someone low-born. Luisen was completely discouraged by Carlton, unable to make any noise nor answer properly. He was nervous, but no one else knew how he felt inside.Not Carlton, nor his servants.Luisen\u2019s appearance was to blame. With white skin and delicate features like a ceramic doll, Luisen gave off an aloof and mysterious vibe\u2013like an artist caught in some greater reverie. On top of that, his childhood lessons had ingrained harshly within him an expressionless and elegant attitude. Even if he were to sit blankly on a stool, he\u2019d still appear like a haughty aristocrat.In particular, whenever Luisen lowered his head slightly, his golden eyelashes contrasted his blue eyes, creating an image of an angel. Carlton felt that no matter what he did he would seem like a devil compared to that false innocence; his temper rose feverishly.\u2018He can\u2019t even find one key and is making me wait?\u2019He\u2019d never had to wait for people to fulfill his orders. The task was neither important nor urgent, just something to keep the young duke out of the way, but when time passed and Luisen didn\u2019t show up, he became annoyed.\u2018Should I just leave it all to fate and swing my sword at him?\u2019 Carlton took out his dagger and began to fiddle with it in his hands. Meanwhile, a rushed pattering of feet preceded the abrupt opening of the door.Luisen took poised steps as he entered the room. Each step seemed light as a feather. Perhaps on any other man it would have seemed unfortunate, but these airy steps somehow fit Luisen\u2019s face\u2013pallid skin that seemed to have avoided the sun all its life and softness that indicated not a day of hard manual labor. His was a face that seemed to know no suffering.Completely the opposite of Carlton\u2019s.Luisen\u2019s very presence\u2013his whole body which screamed noble breeding\u2013scratched at Carlton\u2019s insides.\u00a01TN:Carlton: Terrorizes people regularlyAlso Carlton: I don\u2019t understand why people are scared of me\u2013I was so nice to them.FootnotesThis is an idiom for feeling uncomfortable or feeling some type of guiltPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t this the Duke? I thought you\u2019d forgotten about me since you\u2019re so late.\u201d Carlton laughed to hide his irritation, but Luisen lowered his eyes again\u2026.as if Carlton was not even worth opposing.Meanwhile Luisen felt like he was on the verge of death. He avoided Carlton\u2019s eyes because he couldn\u2019t help but concentrate on the dagger in his hands.\u2018Why are you holding a dagger? Are you going to throw it at me? Because I was late?\u2019Luisen began to understand why Carlton was purged after the first prince\u2019s coronation. People might be a little late\u2013that\u2019s no excuse to pull out a dagger while waiting. Even the prince may grow scared of his temper.\u201c\u2026..\u201d Luisen swallowed dry saliva. He had run for so long he began to taste blood in his mouth.\u201c\u2026.How could I? I would never forget what you\u2019ve asked of me.\u201d Luisen spoke as calmly as possible, not wanting to provoke Carlton. But he had no idea that his calmness angered Carlton even further. Luisen was ignorant of what he looked like to others, especially when it came to his own appearance; he was still stuck with a self-image of his own miserable state during his wandering days.Carlton\u2019s expression became fiercer. His gaze slid up and down Luisen\u2019s figure, as if looking for something to find fault with. His eyes lingered on Luisen\u2019s hands.\u201cIs that so? Then where are the keys and the accounts of the armory items?\u201dAh\u2026that\u2019s right\u2026Only then did Luisen realize he was empty handed. In his urgency, he had left everything in the general\u2019s office.\u201cThat\u2026I suddenly remembered something important,\u201d Luisen murmured.\u201cIs it something more important and urgent than my request to the duke? Could there be such a thing?\u201d\"\"Luisen sweated profusely. He didn\u2019t know where Carlton learned to make his smiles so menacing, but each of his words were sharp enough to poke at the pit of his stomach. He had thought that Carlton was only good with a sword, but unexpectedly he also had the gift of gab.Luisen smothered his desire to run out of the room.\u201cAhem, I just thought of a very good plan.\u201d His words sounded too much like a swindler. Luisen quickly continued before Carlton could say anything, \u201cI know you\u2019re struggling with bringing the other southern lords to heel. I can solve that problem.\u201d\u2018Well, aren\u2019t you curious?\u2019 Luisen thought.However, Carlton remained slightly sullen, as if his entire body protested that it had ever been troubled by such trifling issues.\u201cI know well the strength of your army and your own military might. But wouldn\u2019t it be easier if there was a way to make them surrender without fighting?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I find it quite strange that the duke is worried about me.\u201dHow intelligent. Self-made mercenaries, ones that will go down in history, certainly were different. \u2018If it were me, I would have asked them to tell me everything while clapping,\u2019 Luisen thought.Still, despite Carlton\u2019s suspicions, Luisen tried to remain calm. While running in the hallway, air bursting through his lungs, Luisen had recalled memories of the future.Before his regression, the locust plague took advantage of the nation\u2019s chaos. At the time, every southerner poured their all into fighting against the swarm. Everyone needed to eat and survive in order to pursue politics, power, and glory.Luisen confidently said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard a rumor about an incoming swarm of locusts. At that time, the lords will be scrambling to surrender first. They can\u2019t afford to fight you while preparing to fend off the swarm.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Locusts?\u201d Carlton doubted his ears. What the hell was he talking about? Grasshoppers? The green insects that ate grass? The ones that were the size of a finger?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Locusts.\u201d Luisen nodded.Carlton tightly clutched the dagger in his hands. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201dAfter the civil war, when the Anies duchy was razed to the ground, Carlton\u2019s notoriety spread throughout the kingdom. However, the lords of the south were unyielding to his power. Carlton sent countless threats, asking them to surrender and to support the first prince. Still, these nobles endured; they claimed that bowing their heads to peasants and mercenaries would injure their pride.Carlton was dumbfounded. He could not believe that those prideful nobles would surrender over a few pests. He felt his temper rising, feeling mocked, but Luisen\u2019s face was as serious as ever.\u201cI\u2019m completely sincere. There\u2019s no point in scorning you.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m so scared, I can\u2019t even make eye contact,\u2019 Luisen thought. \u2018How could I even joke in this situation? It\u2019s more likely that I would die of a heart attack.\u2019\u201cI\u2019d be more disappointed if you\u2019re serious, if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve come up with. War is not child\u2019s play.\u201d Carlton laughed.Luisen inwardly clicked his tongue. \u2018That\u2019s why northerners are so\u2026.\u2019They didn\u2019t know the true fear of locusts.Others may have thought, \u2018How much could those little bodies eat?\u2019 and underestimate them. However, in a single day, a cloud of locusts could spirit away enough to feed tens of thousands of people. They ate everything they could digest, whether it was grain, grass in the field, or even fruit trees.When one loses a political battle, they may lose authority and wealth. Still, the household may have enough food to satisfy hungry bellies. However, if one loses the battle with locusts, all that is left is a wasteland with no plant life left.\u201cIf people don\u2019t respond properly to the locusts at harvest time, they\u2019ll end up empty-handed in winter. Numerous people will starve to death.\u201dThe power of a landed noble comes from the population of their territory and tax revenue. If this crisis is left unattended, tax revenues and population will decrease. And, after enduring the hardships of winter, there will be no seed left to sow in spring. The hardship does not end with the failed harvest.\u201cFor you, these insects may seem like nothing. But the fate of the estate is at stake for these southern lords. If we were to choose between a bad situation and a worse one, most would choose the former.\u201dThe worst situation would be the impending famine on top of dealing with Carlton\u2019s anger. The bad situation would merely be bowing down to a low-born dog of the capital and preparing for the swarm comfortably.The moment the plague appeared, Carlton became the lesser of two evils.\u201cAre you saying that my army and I can\u2019t even compare to bugs?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. In any case, they will definitely surrender. Having an official proclamation with the duke\u2019s name will be more effective than just spreading a rumor\u2013people always watch the duchy\u2019s movements.\u201dFinally, Luisen reached the goal of this roundabout conversation.As Carlton had keenly pointed out, neither Luisen nor the lords were currently preoccupied with Carlton. Even if Carlton was agitated enough to start a massacre, Luisen was concerned with more important matters. Nevertheless, it would be self-serving to give Carlton the chance to help.Luisen\u2019s only wish was to grow old in his home territory as the owner of a wealthy duchy, perhaps with the saint. For that goal, not one grain of wheat could be stolen by these insects.To do so, an official letter must be sent with his name stamped on it. However, Luisen knew that Carlton wouldn\u2019t allow any sort of suspicious communication. The more he would prostrate and beg, the more Carlton would dig in his heels, finding the whole situation shady.Thus, Luisen wanted to capitalize on Carlton\u2019s own desires and have him send an official letter for his own self-serving purposes. And, killing two birds with one stone, Luisen could slyly proclaim that he had helped him.\u201cHow about it? Will you do as I say? You have nothing to lose, right?\u201dCarlton, who wanted nothing more than to return to the capital quickly, had no choice but to accept.\u2018Hehe, scheming like this\u2026.I\u2019ve become more clever.\u2019 Luisen patted himself on the back and once again gave thanks to the saint.The previously quiet Carlton slowly opened his mouth. \u201cI appreciate the duke\u2019s opinion.\u201d\u201cYes, and I\u2019ll help with the official letter.\u201d\u201cOh, that won\u2019t be needed.\u201d\u201c\u2026.I-I should do something\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you afraid that I\u2019ll ask for something ridiculous in exchange for sending this official document?\u201d\u2018How did he know? What extraordinary fellow.\u00a01\u00a0Don\u2019t tell me, he has some superpower to read minds? Although\u2026if Carlton was indeed psychic, he wouldn\u2019t have been abandoned by the first prince.\u2019Luisen squinted his eyes and peered up and down at Carlton.\u201c\u2026.No? I\u2019m sincerely trying to assist you,\u201d Luisen insisted. Carlton smirked and laughed, as if the concept was utterly absurd.\u201cI would like to trust you as well, but I\u2019ve seen too much betrayal to give my trust easily.\u201d\u201cAnd so\u2026?\u201d\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll believe the duke if you show me more sincerity.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cAs my duke said, I will make a rumor about the locusts and wait for their surrender. But, if there\u2019s a lord who won\u2019t yield even with that rumor, you must help me.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dLuisen and Carlton, the whole world even, knew that he lacked that sort of talent.\u201cYou just have to stay by my side.\u201d\u201cThat means\u2026.you want me to follow you to the battle front?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Carlton smiled gently.Luisen was horrified. \u2018He\u2019s going to drag me into the battlefield? I\u2019d only be of use as a meat shield! Is that his ulterior motive?\u2019TN: What a terrifying way to say 'stay by my side\u201d lmaoFootnotesThe word used here is \u201cghostly.\u201d Which, in Korean, often brings the connotation of being scarily good.

How horrifying! In the first place, Luisen had no desire to go to such a dangerous place where people get hurt and die, but he also had no idea what Carlton would do to him in the midst of the battlefield\u2019s confusion. A sword had no discerning eyes. Even the slightest misstep of an ally would be the difference between life or death.\u201cAnd if I refuse\u2026.?\u201d\u201cThen we\u2019ll continue as if we never had this conversation. Of course, there will be no official document either.\u201d\u2018You\u2019ve caught me. You\u2019ve caught everything,\u2019 Luisen thought.Carlton had already figured out Luisen\u2019s goals yet he pretended otherwise. Ironically, this insidious skill was required for nobility; Carlton suited aristocratic scheming more than the noble himself.\u2018Ha\u2026I really wracked my rusty brain for this\u2026\u2019\u00a01The first scheme Luisen had ever plotted failed. \u2018Maybe people should live as they look.\u2019Eventually, Luisen raised a white flag. \u201cI see. Then we\u2019ll do as you say.\u201d\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll never forget the duke\u2019s assistance.\u201d Carlton smiled kindly again. Luisen felt like his soul was escaping from his body at the sight of that abominable smile. \u201cBut, how should we prepare for the locusts?\u201d\u201cThe locusts have been such a large problem, so countermeasures have already been prepared. There\u2019s a magic tool that burns only locusts away\u2013it\u2019s called the Flames of the Holy Spirit. There\u2019s one in every town and village,\u201d Luisen spoke with pride. The groundbreaking invention of these flames had once again established the Anies Duchy as the guardian of the golden fields.But Carlton was not interested in that. \u201cOnly Locusts? What about people? Can it burn humans?\u201d\u201cWhy would it burn humans?\u201d\u201cHn. Forget it. It only has a grand name. If you\u2019d have made weapons of similar nature in the time you\u2019ve made this tool, then perhaps the course of the kingdom could have been altered.\u201d Carlton quickly lost interest in the Flames of the Holy Spirit. At that slight, Luisen felt a bit teary.\u201cThe Flames of the Holy Spirit was an innovation in service of the people\u2019s livelihoods. Don\u2019t ridicule the duchy\u2019s creed as the guardian of the golden fields. You wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Carlton asked while raising his eyebrows.\u2018Why do you have to clutch at your dagger again?\u2019 Luisen winced. He had impulsively blurted out his feelings. His legs began to tremble, but for some reason, Luisen didn\u2019t want to apologize. His pride as a member of the Anies family, which Luisen didn\u2019t even know he had, sprang forth.\u201c\u2026Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d Luisen chose to retreat. He\u2019d spoken back enough for the day. He rushed out of the office.His steps quickened after leaving the room, and a chill ran down his back. What if Carlton hunted him down? However, even as Luisen rounded the corner, Carlton fortunately didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of following him.Whew.Luisen could finally sigh in peace and slump his head. But at that moment, a familiar person appeared at the far end of the hallway.\u201cHuh? My duke?\u201dIt was Ruger. He had been walking and chatting with a maid.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cOh, my lord!\u201d The maid greeted her master and rushed away with soft, pattering footsteps. Luger gave a bashful chuckle at Luisen\u2019s glare.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? The master is busy trying to divert the estate\u2019s biggest crisis, but the chief attendant is chatting up a maid?\u201d Luisen said.\u201cDon\u2019t jest. I\u2019m here to bring you something you\u2019ve left behind.\u201d Ruger handed Luisen the key to the northern warehouse that Luisen had left in the general\u2019s office.\u2018Ugh.\u2019 Luisen wrinkled his brow. \u2018I\u2019ve barely escaped Carlton now. Do I really have to go back? Let\u2019s pretend I didn\u2019t see this.\u2019\u201c\u2026Put it back in the general\u2019s office.\u201d\u201cWhat? Isn\u2019t this important?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to my room.\u201d First he\u2019d have a meal. Then he could ask whoever, whether the general or the treasurer, about the official document.Ruger naturally followed next to Luisen. \u201cWhat did that person say? Did something happen?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWell, I heard you went to the general\u2019s room in the middle of searching for this key. But now you say you don\u2019t need this key anymore\u2026I\u2019m simply curious.\u201d\u201cAh. We talked about something else.\u201d\u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d\"\"\u201cThis and that,\u201d Luisen responded listlessly, strength gone. Ruger looked at him suspiciously, but Luisen ignored his attendant\u2019s annoying gaze.Ruger grumbled as they walked down the hall. Carlton\u2019s men were too crude and too arrogant. He and Luisen should have run away that night. Carlton was too rough with the duke\u2026Ruger cursed Carlton and his men in various ways.Luisen simply said one thing after letting him talk his ear off. \u201cWatch your language. Why do you not call him Sir Carlton and instead refer to him as\u00a0\u2018that person?\u2019\u201d\u00a02\u201cWhat, sir? He\u2019s not even a real knight. Isn\u2019t it embarrassing to call him that? That low-born is too arrogant; he should know his place.\u201d Ruger snorted. Luisen was surprised, since this all sounded so uncharacteristic of his attendant. On second thought, though, Luger was of noble birth. He was a third son, so he may never succeed a noble title, but he was still born to a noble family. Perhaps it was natural for him to be socialized in this noble mindset.\u2018Now that I think about it\u2026what noble household is he from?\u2019The name of the household should have been contained within the letter of recommendation that came with him, but Luisen\u2019s memory was hazy. Maybe he had been drinking; he couldn\u2019t even remember who had recommended Ruger in the first place.\u201cAnyways, mind your words. Since you\u2019re my chief servant, your mistakes will be attributed to me.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll make sure no harm comes my lord\u2019s way.\u201dThat was that. Come to think of it, Luisen felt a bit of pity for Ruger. He had lived lavishly as a servant of the duke in the capital, but then he was brought to the far south and endured this twisted hardship. What\u2019s worse, before regression, he had died defending his master.\u201c\u2026Just be patient for a little while longer. Sir Carlton will leave soon.\u201dIf the rumors about the locusts proved successful and all the lords surrendered, Carlton would most definitely leave without delay. Time would fly by during the hectic preparations; that day may come sooner than expected.\u201cReally? Why? What did you talk about with that guy? Huh?\u201d\"\"Luisen flapped his hands in annoyance. Suddenly, he remembered something very important\u2013the first thing he must do as soon as he had the luxury of free time.\u201cDo you know any magicians?\u201d he asked.\u201cA magician?\u2026.What for? To find the person you were searching for earlier? To find someone without their age, their appearance, or even their name, you probably need the services of a magician far more than the intelligence guild. Who could you be searching for? The duke I know has no reason to search for such a mysterious man.\u201dThe one-armed saint. Luisen\u2019s saint.Luisen couldn\u2019t help but to scrunch his nose as he thought of the saint. He had no knowledge of the finer details of his savior\u2019s life, but he could guess the man lived a rough life. A person who had lived a smooth life wouldn\u2019t have such a calloused hand, a body littered with scars, and edges sharpened by hardship.\u2018I\u2019ll help you live comfortably so you may never suffer. I\u2019ll protect you this time around.\u2019In order to do that, though, Luisen needed to find him.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be even an hour late in finding him. You have a lot of connections, so please send out some feelers.\u00a03\u00a0We can start as soon as Carlton leaves.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not that difficult, I guess\u2026.Who is this person anyway?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026my benefactor.\u201dCuriosity struck Ruger. \u2018A benefactor? Who has the ability to do the Duke of Anies a favor?\u2019The recently deceased queen and second prince were kind to Luisen, but the duke was not indebted to them. Who could have been the duke\u2019s benefactor if he never lacked anything?\"\"Ruger was very curious but didn\u2019t ask any further questions. Luisen\u2019s eyes had begun to look slightly blurry, and his expression couldn\u2019t hide his exhaustion. His lord needed his rest.\u201cLet\u2019s hurry to your room,\u201d Ruger said. \u201cI will bring bread and some leftovers so you can eat straight away.\u201dLuisen\u2019s face glowed at Ruger\u2019s words.\u201cYou praiseworthy attendant. Alright, let\u2019s hurry!\u201dThere would be food. Food, hehe. Luisen now looked at Ruger with new eyes. His previous worries seemed to have been washed away.******Luisen had composed the official letter with the help of the treasurer. In the process, rumors of an impending locust swarm had naturally spread within the castle.Everyone was skeptical of the news, as it had originated from Luisen, but the rumors had forced several administrators of various departments to return to work. While helping with the official letter, the treasurer had naturally joined the ranks in the war against the locusts; he began to lead organization efforts.This was wonderful news for Luisen. He was relieved that his advisor\u2019s anger seemed to have abated. And, most of all, there was no more justification to further mess with Luisen, and Carlton no longer called him to do various errands.The letters spread throughout the duchy through messengers. Everyone was shocked to see that their duke, usually absent from most estate issues, had penned the document. Setting aside their feelings, however, the villages steadily prepared for the incoming war.The village chiefs took out the Flames of the Holy Spirit which had been securely stored in shared warehouses.\u201cOnly thorough preparation will save our lives! You got it?!\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThe villagers were more incensed, more aggressive than in combat. Thanks to Luisen\u2019s quick movements, everyone managed to prepare themselves without disturbing the farming process.TL: Thanks for readings. This is more of a in-between chappy~ But I hope you guys will be fine with it!

Everyone had paid close attention to any news from the duke\u2019s castle; several nobles had even probed the area with their information connections. As soon as the official letter was sent to the nearest village in the duchy, they too learned of the plague.The news threw the nobles deep into disarray.\u2018Is this real?\u2019If it were true, then the whole of the community had a crisis on their hands. Even if the locust clouds were to pass over their skies and skip their fields, the nobles had to decrease the overall pest population as much as possible.However, the nobles were all caught on one specific detail: the Duke of Anies had been coiled up in that complicated, unstable situation with Carlton. \u2018The entire household has been isolated\u2026how would they know if a swarm will arrive or not? Couldn\u2019t this be a trap?\u2019The Duke of Anies could be helping Carlton, whether willingly or unwillingly. Nevertheless, no proud southerner could freely ignore this possible disaster.\u2018Damned if we do, damned if we don\u2019t.\u2019 The lords ruminated on this matter to the point of stress-induced hair loss and gaunt cheeks. They eventually concluded, \u2018Alright, let\u2019s just trust the duke one last time!\u2019He was still the guardian of this region, a man of the family that reigned this land for ages. Currently, he may have been infamous for his reputation as trash, but he was still a proud duke. All of his other family members were competent men.The southern lords shared similar concerns, and they had all reached the same conclusion. They rushed to dispatch envoys to the Anies region. Thus one day the tightly locked gates to the castle were visited by various flags from all sorts of households throughout the southern region.\u201cHow does this make any sense?\u201d Carlton, who was looking for a chance to wield his sword, was emotionally assailed by the news.He couldn\u2019t decide if he was speechless or despondent. It was good that things ended so well, but it simultaneously hurt his pride. Carlton was a man who lived a turbulent life, experiencing many hardships and tumultuous moods. But this was the first time he\u2019d ever felt this strange combination of emotions.Carlton had set up temporary barracks outside the wall and met the messengers there. He was paranoid that these messengers would have ulterior motives and did not allow them to step foot in the castle.However, the other lords\u2019 envoys seemed rather relieved that they were not invited inside. Though they still carried an air of importance, they handled their affairs with Carlton professionally, without agitating the mercenary.The messages they conveyed were all similar:\u201cWe pledge allegiance to Prince Ellion. We can provide XXX in war reparations. Nothing more can be given, so please accept this and don\u2019t come to our territory.\u201dThe letters were longer, with unnecessarily long greetings and fancy roundabouts at every discourse point. The above was a short summary of the most important parts of the messages.\u2018They\u2019re not even bargaining?\u2019Although the marketplace may come to mind when imagining \u2018bargaining,\u2019 no one else risked their lives to bargain as much as the nobles. They would ask the common folk to donate their own money to pay for development while spending riches earned by others. They would argue to discount one more coin off a ransom even if a knife was held to their necks.\u2018There\u2019s no way this is possible. These folks weren\u2019t the type to offer their fortunes quietly.\u2019 Carlton, full of doubt and distrust of the aristocracy, had made some mental calculations.The amounts proposed by the envoys were just appropriate enough to be taken as a war trophy. Of course, more could be negotiated, but he would have to throw away his dignity to argue with some nobles.Although Carlton was still wary of the situation, he accepted the offers. All the messengers left quickly without delay.Carlton stood on the castle walls and looked over the scattered envoys. In the end, everyone judged a bunch of insects to be more important and more dangerous than his armies?\u201cI feel like the south is playing around with me,\u201d he said.Carlton\u2019s men all nodded sympathetically with their commander. \u2018\u2026It really worked out just the way the Duke of Anies said it would\u2026\u2019He couldn\u2019t have imagined this result\u2013not when a lone envoy carrying Luisen\u2019s official letter had set out from the duchy. He had accepted the duke\u2019s proposal because it wouldn\u2019t result in further loss to his army\u2026and it would be a pain in the neck if Luisen had complained to the capital court that he had been treated poorly.Far from wasting money, Luisen\u2019s advice led to greater gains. Like flies to honey, he sat still and reaped the benefits of a silent war\u2013a battle without the consequences of combat.What would have happened if Carlton had been forced to fight? He was confident in achieving victory, but he likely wouldn\u2019t have been able to gain so many advantages.\u2018I just can\u2019t understand. At all.\u2019 Carlton returned inside\u00a0 and immediately started walking towards Luisen\u2019s room. When he stepped into the castle, he\u2019d had no intent to visit. Even seeing Luisen\u2019s face made his stomach turn over; why should he want to visit? But somehow his feet traveled to Luisen\u2019s door while his consciousness wandered absentmindedly.Ruger, who was guarding the door, wrinkled his face distastefully at Carlton. Though he pretended to greet him courteously, anyone could tell Ruger was cursing inside. The servant wanted to give him a piece of his mind, but Ruger reigned in his temper.Luisen was in his room.\u201cIt\u2019s Carlton.\u201dLuisen had been stretched out on his bed like melted butter, expressing joy in laziness with his entire body. Carlton had not called for him again after his retainers had returned to their posts; the duke couldn\u2019t help but to revel in these peaceful days.\u2018Hurk, what?\u2019 Luisen got up in a hurry, fixed his appearance, and roughly brushed his hand through his hair. By the time Carlton came into the room, Luisen had managed to regain his aloof, fine appearance thanks to his quick movements. His upright posture made him look reverent.Although his heart was pounding in his chest, Luisen responded to Carlton with a calm demeanor.\u201cSir Carlton, is there something wrong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come here after meeting the envoys at the outer wall.\u201d\u201cAh, is that so?\u201d Luisen could not leave the castle, so he was ignorant of the outside situation. Suddenly, Luisen\u2019s face lit up brightly. \u201cWhich families sent envoys? Did everyone send one? They all brought news of surrender, right?\u201d\u201cNo. Three places have yet to declare surrender.\u201d\u2018What crazy idiots. Do they take locusts lightly?\u2019 Luisen\u2019s expression soured. \u201cWhich households?\u201d\u201cSete, Vinard, and Holga. Do you know anything about these families?\u201d\u201cUrm\u2026\u2026\u201d Luisen struggled.He had no idea!From the gaps in his knowledge, Luisen could only guess that these were landed nobles of small and medium-sized estates far away from his own. Carlton, while waiting for his answer, saw Luisen\u2019s hesitation. This time, Carlton did not misunderstand and knew exactly what was on his mind.\u201cYou have no idea? Their territories are quite close to your estate too, aren\u2019t they? As far as I know, Sete still has trade agreements with the duchy,\u201d Carlton said.\u201c\u2026.Maybe I\u2019ll remember\u2026.It\u2019s on the tip of my tongue\u2026.\u201dThat was a complete lie. Luisen couldn\u2019t remember anything.Luisen had just blurted out whatever was on his mind, and Carlton saw through his transparent struggles.\"\"\u2018\u2026So he really doesn\u2019t know,\u2019 Carlton thought. Luisen had caught him off guard twice. Seeing everything go Luisen\u2019s way, it was clear that the man wasn\u2019t all that stupid. His insight that could sometimes foretell the future was quite shocking.But that just confused Carlton more. How could such an intelligent person know absolutely nothing? Didn\u2019t a person need to know the basic layout of the situation to garner such insight? With such a sharp eye, why did Luisen allow himself to be caught in the crossfire of the princes\u2019 succession fight? Why did he put himself in such jeopardy?\u2018I had heard you were nothing more than foolish trash\u2026.\u2019 Looking at his calm and quiet face now, Carlton couldn\u2019t see the traces of a man who was rumored to spend his days drinking and playing around with women.Rather than drinking or vulgar entertainment, Carlton thought Luisen suited walking gracefully through art exhibitions or sitting, just like a portrait, and listening to music.Carlton\u2019s close scrutiny burned holes into Luisen\u2019s mouth. \u2018What?\u2019 Luisen thought. \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Did I do something wrong again? Did he discover that I raided the kitchen last night? Or did he realize that I hid a bejewelled ring because I thought it would look beautiful on the saint? Why is he looking at me like that?\u2019Luisen inwardly trembled.Then Carlton, who had been silent for a while, said something out of the blue. \u201cThe town below the castle has been very quiet. Aren\u2019t you curious about the situation there?\u201dThe village he was referring to lay between the inner and outer walls of the duchy\u2019s fortress. Since it was the closest town to the castle, the village was actually more like a city: rich and secure.Why, all of a sudden, did he bring that up?\u201cIs there an issue with that town?\u201dCarlton smirked at Luisen\u2019s question. He smiled as if wind was escaping him\u2013an expression of derision and pity; that expression somehow bothered Luisen. When Luisen had gotten a job as a manual laborer, he saw that expression leveled at him after he\u2019d been inflicted with bone disease half a day after beginning work.It was as if Carlton\u2019s gaze was saying, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s you.\u201dLuisen was annoyed enough to question what his expression meant, but his timing was off. When he opened his mouth, the door to the room opened as well. Carlton\u2019s men and Ruger piled into his guest bedroom and shouted simultaneously, \u201cDuke! There\u2019s been an incident!\u201d\u201cA swarm of locusts is flying in!\u201dCarlton and Luisen both got up from their seats in surprise. Luisen forgot the unpleasant atmosphere from a while ago and inwardly cheered.Finally!If something went wrong and the swarm didn\u2019t appear, the duchy would be seen as unreliable.\u201cA swarm of locusts has really appeared?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cYes. A scouting group discovered black clouds flocking from across the river,\u201d his guard responded.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s really locusts?\u201d Carlton found everything so hard to believe. He had expected that the locusts were an excuse to garner the lords\u2019 surrender\u2026It was ridiculous to imagine but\u2026could Luisen somehow predict natural disasters?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luisen\u2019s predictions were accurate again. However, Carlton couldn\u2019t believe it until he saw the swarm with his own eyes.\u201cI need to check,\u201d he said.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the bell tower,\u201d Luisen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest location in the area, so we can properly see the surroundings.\u201dCarlton agreed with his suggestion. Luisen, on the other hand, just didn\u2019t want to miss the spectacle of the magical flames. Since their interests coincided, the two headed for the bell tower.******Carlton and Luisen climbed their way to the top platform. It was quite low for a bell tower, but the castle itself was built atop a small hill and was surrounded by plains. The weather was quite clear, and the two could see far. The wind blew from the direction of the distant river, and the stalks of the ripe wheat swayed, almost flattening with the wind currents.It was a peaceful and beautiful landscape, but the clouds of war still hung low.Black wings began to flood the sky, and on the ground the town militia were equipped and in perfect formation.The atmosphere was explosive. The palms of Luisen\u2019s hands began to sweat.Finally, the locusts met the defending line. At that moment, a powerful fire shot out of the \u2018Flames of the Holy Spirit.\u2019 The huge flames burned splendidly, decorating the clear sky line. The approaching locusts were burned to ashes and fell to the ground in masses.But the locusts did not falter. They flocked like sheep and descended to devour the people.The front line, as seen through the binoculars, was a pandemonium.Huge grasshoppers the size of a fist flew around, beating heads with their wings. They would bite at the flesh and gnaw at the hems of clothes. The humming of their wings gradually grew louder, and Luisen\u2019s eyes grew dizzy from the sheer size of the cloud. It wouldn\u2019t be strange to fall into a state of panic in such an extreme situation.Nevertheless, the people were not daunted. They steadfastly burned the locusts using the magical tools. Ash fell like rain and black smoke filled the sky.\u2018This is it!\u2019 Luisen clenched his fist. The blood of a southerner, hidden deep within himself, began to boil to the surface.Enemies that wanted to plunder, and those that wanted to protect.Locusts and humans.The fight for survival between these two groups continued fiercely. Countless insects died, but their original population was just too high. The locusts did not hesitate for a moment to mourn for their dead companions. The fallen corpses all blew away in the wind.The first clash ended, leaving behind only black smoke and a burnt smell in the air.There would be another battle against these pests, but seeing today\u2019s battle, Luisen did not worry. The villagers prepared and fought with all their might.Luisen was confident in the human side\u2019s victory.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dAs the tension eased, Luisen naturally burst into laughter. \u201cIsn\u2019t it amazing?\u201dUnderneath the mellow sunshine, Luisen smiled refreshingly. Carlton looked at him with complicated eyes.\u201cYes, yes\u2026There really was a plague.\u201d In reality, Carlton was not interested in the locusts. Of course, the agricultural battle was a new and strange sight, but Luisen was more interesting than that.\u2018How did you predict this? No one else in the estate had the forethought.\u2019Perhaps the air was messing with him; Carlton thought that Luisen looked like a beautiful, gentle young master\u2013beautiful but not necessarily resourceful.\u2018I really can\u2019t tell.\u2019Is he smart? Or is he stupid?Competent or incompetent?Altruistic or selfish?Carlton suddenly felt uncomfortable. After smiling, the duke finally melted from a pretty sculpture into a living, breathing person. Seemingly transparent behavior coupled with a mind that felt distant and opaque\u2013Carlton\u2019s curiosity was piqued.*****The war against the locusts ended in favor of the humans. Thanks to the preparations made well in advance, the villages suffered very little damage.\u2018This time again, I overturned another crisis,\u2019 Luisen thought. According to his memories, there wasn\u2019t another pressing issue in the near future, so he could truly relax.However, before he could take a moment to breathe, another problem sprung up.The main instigator was, of course, Carlton.After he left Carlton\u2019s office, Luisen gave one long and deep sigh. Ruger asked if he was okay after seeing his posture droop, as if all water was drained from his body.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not fine.\u201d\u201cWhat did Carlton say?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s planning to go to war with the Vinard household.\u201dAs soon as the locusts landed, two of the remaining three families rushed to surrender. Luisen hoped that the last remaining family would also raise the white flag, but they remained silent.\u201cVinard\u2026Isn\u2019t that a long ways away?\u201d Ruger asked.\u201cIt\u2019s far. So he\u2019s only taking the cavalry for this strike.\u201dBecause the estate of the Vinard family was quite small, it was questionable whether or not a proper battle would take place. Honestly, why couldn\u2019t they just ignore this family? The force of the tide would force the Vinard family to follow the first prince. However, Carlton thought differently.\u201cHe\u2019s asked me to follow him.\u201d\u201cIs he crazy?\u201d Ruger panicked. \u201cJust where is he taking the duke? The battlefield? Is he out of his mind?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be useless to bring the duke anyway? Is he planning on threatening the Vinards with your life? That\u2019s not going to work!\u201d\u201cYour words are\u2026.too much\u2026\u201d However, Luisen inwardly agreed with Ruger\u2019s rude remarks. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not taking me along because I\u2019ll be of some particular use.\u201d\u201cThen why?\u201d\u201cMaybe he\u2019s taking me hostage\u2026Or maybe he\u2019s going to use me as a meat shield\u2026.?\u201d\u201cThat arrogant little\u2026Honestly, how could a peasant like him sit on his undeserving seat and order nobles around like that?\u201d Ruger\u2019s face distorted in disgust.\u201cI told you to watch your words.\u201d\u201cBut, this is quite frustrating. My duke, you\u2019re going to have to ride a horse if he\u2019s only taking cavalry.\u201dThat was actually the biggest issue. Luisen\u2019s horseback riding skills were awful. It wasn\u2019t that he was simply bad at riding\u2013he was a catastrophic failure. If someone didn\u2019t hold onto the reins, Luisen was unable to climb up onto the horse\u2019s back. He could barely keep balance while the horse trotted, let alone galloped.But to ride with Carlton\u2019s skilled cavalry? Even to Luisen, this expectation was ridiculous.\u201cCan you just tell him you can\u2019t ride a horse?\u201d\u201c\u2026.I\u2019ve told him.\u201dLuisen told him that he would only be a disturbance with his skill level, but it was clear that Carlton was deaf to his complaints. A noble who couldn\u2019t ride a horse? It seems like Carlton held those kinds of dubious thoughts, dismissing Luisen\u2019s words as some ridiculous lie.\u201cI think he thinks I\u2019m making excuses to be excused from the journey.\u201d\u201c\u2026.What should we do?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019ll somehow manage to follow along\u2026.\u201d Luisen said.Ruger wanted to point out the flaw in that statement but held his tongue. What good would it do to ruminate on this matter further? There was nothing they could change now!!Luisen and Ruger strolled down the hallway, silent and solemn. However, the two then began to hear an animated conversation from somewhere nearby.\u201cHey, wasn\u2019t our lord pretty impressive? He forced surrender from all those nobles with Carlton and managed to block the locusts.\u201dIt was a conversation that tempted their ears. Luisen and Ruger stopped walking and looked for the origin of the muffled sounds. Their voices traveling through an open window, a few servants were obliviously discussing in a vacant lot. They didn\u2019t seem to know that Luisen was passing by.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem that smart, but I guess even he has hidden depths.\u201d\u2018Hmm\u2026\u2019, the corners of Luisen\u2019s lips twitched. \u2018I guess there\u2019s a lot of people who look favorably upon me nowadays.\u2019People had stopped cursing or sighing at him in the hallways and were now greeting with transparent courtesy. The older servants were moved at the sight of their now slightly matured duke, and one maid had even shyly handed Luisen some cookies she had baked herself.\"\"\u2018Can I let myself feel good and take pride?\u2019Compliments were always thrilling. And, it felt all the more exciting since they came from those that had always denigrated him. His pride had risen almost as much as he suffered these past few days.But, just then, another voice cut into the conversation with jeers.\u201cHe probably just got lucky.\u201d\u201cHow could this be pure luck? He predicted the events of the future, and Carlton, that jerk, is leaving quickly as well. I will not ignore my lord anymore.\u201d\u201cHow could a spoiled noble stuck in a castle know about a potential swarm? Neither the general nor the treasurer saw this coming.\u201d\u201cHe was in the capital a lot right? Maybe he heard from there.\u201d\u201cWhat bullshit. In the capital he was always drunk and fooling around with famous female actors.\u201d\u201c\u2026.In any case, this has really reminded us of the status of the duke!\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this just him rebuilding the prestige that he himself had destroyed?\u201dThe two servants seemed to be at odds.\u201cDid I\u2026.play around with actresses\u2026.?\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d Ruger looked at Luisen suspiciously. Luisen furtively avoided his gaze.Meanwhile, the conversation between the servants continued.\u201cBut our lord, don\u2019t you think he\u2019s suddenly changed?\u201d\u201cThe last time I had quarreled with Carlton\u2019s soldiers, he showed up to defend me. \u2018If you have complaints about my servant, tell them to me,\u2019 like that.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not drinking, he\u2019s finishing his meals cleanly, he\u2019s thrown no temper tantrums\u2026He\u2019s become good-natured and easy going.\u201d\u201cHe even restrained himself when Carlton was really grinding our lord\u2019s bones with work. Was he always such a patient man?\u201d\u201cNo, never. Before, he wasn\u2019t even as patient as my five year old son. It\u2019s real; people change in times of crisis.\u201dThe servants slowly began to notice the changes in Luisen. His efforts in protecting the servants from unreasonable treatment had paid off. His actions came as a great surprise to those in the castle.However, for one every person who thought positively of him, there were those who thought the opposite. The better Luisen\u2019s reputation was, the more those people would grit their teeth and deny it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But, he\u2019s just been too much up till now. If he couldn\u2019t get the territory out of the situation that he himself caused, then he\u2019d be a fool.\u201d\u201cHey, that\u2019s too much\u2026\u201d\u201cHonestly, if it weren\u2019t for our lord, would we have suffered this much? He reaped what he sowed. The village below is now\u2026.\u201dRuger could no longer stand the conversation and stepped forward. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d he shouted through the window. The servants quickly ran away at the sound of his voice.\u201cI\u2019ve seen all their faces. I won\u2019t let rudeness lie.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even know their names,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cJust leave it. People will speak ill of the king when no prying eyes are about.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d Ruger stilled at Luisen\u2019s quiet murmurs and tactfully followed behind him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t mind them. They\u2019re only cursing you because sentiment about my duke is changing for the better. Everyone\u2019s been complimenting the duke.\u201d\u201cI said I don\u2019t care,\u201d Luisen grumbled.\u201cIt\u2019s true. Everyone has been saying that my lord has established the proper authority of a duke.\u201d\"\"\u201cAh, okay.\u201dRuger kept trying to comfort Luisen despite Luisen\u2019s insistence that he was fine. Annoyed, Luisen kept responding in rough, choppy remarks.Luisen wasn\u2019t paying lip service; he truly did not mind.In the past, Luisen would have drank and sobbed at such criticism. At this moment, Ruger was struck by how much his master had changed\u2013his blunt disposition was entirely unfamiliar, as if the man had experienced all kinds of hardships.*****Amidst the anxious atmosphere, the date to march into battle was set. Luisen wracked his brain to think of any excuse to stay behind, but every attempt went down the drain.And like that, time passed until it was the day before deployment. Deep into the night Luisen tossed and turned, unable to sleep, when out of nowhere an unexpected guest came to visit him...Part 3: Unexpected HappeningsThe visitor was a middle-aged man, a head taller than Luisen.He was the knight commander of the duchy. However, he looked different than usual. He was always proud of his gray beard, normally kept trimmed neatly, but it was now left neglected. The sight pained Luisen.\u201cKnight commander? Ah, please, come in.\u201d\u2018What could be the problem?\u2019 Luisen wondered, but invited the man in. It was late, so Ruger had returned to his own quarters. Luisen had been alone in his room. The two sat face to face at the table.As the candlelight hit the man\u2019s face, his wrinkles seemed to dig deeper into his skin. His face looked so old and tired; Luisen looked at him with an ambiguous mood. This was someone who had died a long time ago, and seeing him alive now seemed like a new experience.The knight commander hesitated before speaking, \u201cYour complexion looks so much better lately.\u201d\u201c\u2026Does it?\u201d Luisen touched his face awkwardly\u2013it was embarrassing to receive such a compliment. \u201cSo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI heard that my lord is marching into the battlefield tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes. So, you\u2019ve heard the rumors.\u201d\u201cWe should be the ones to follow you into battle. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The knight commander bowed his head deeply.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. Carlton wouldn\u2019t have allowed you all to come.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dActually, if Luisen had demanded to bring his knight battalion, or if the knights insisted on accompanying their lord, Carlton would not have refused. But Luisen swallowed this truth and offered up niceties. Perhaps the knight commander also realized this truth; he looked uneasy and ashamed.After an awkward silence, the knight commander took out a small pouch he had been holding to his bosom. Inside was a sleek bracelet made of platinum.\u201cThere\u2019s strong magic in this. If you swing your arm while wearing this bracelet, it will shield you from harm.\u201dDeep within his foggy memories, Luisen recalled that the knight commander had cherished this bracelet. After a great accomplishment, he was presented with this magic accessory by the duke\u2019s ancestors. The knight commander polished and shined the bracelet every day; it became his most cherished keepsake and a symbol of his pride.\u201cIs it all right to give this to me?\u201d\u201cI sincerely hope you won\u2019t need to use it, but just in case. I\u2019m so sorry that I have nothing else to give when my lord is leaving for battle.\u201d\u201cPlease, it\u2019s alright\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not being used here anyway,\u201d the knight commander said despondently.The fragile candle flame flickered with the strength of someone\u2019s\u2013Luisen didn\u2019t know whose\u2013sigh. Luisen moistened his dry lips as he observed the deep shadows that cut across the other man\u2019s tired face. With effort, he uncovered his heart and spoke the words he wished to tell the knight commander long ago.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201dThe knights the commander had carefully trained were sent to support the second prince; their fate\u2013whether they were alive or not\u2013was still uncertain. Nevertheless, he stood to protect his duke and the territory without complaint during the battle against Carlton and his men. Of course, Luisen had made such sacrifice meaningless with his surrender. With the knowledge from his regression, Luisen knew that this was the best course, but the knight commander didn\u2019t know the future.The knight commander was silent for a brief moment before saying with a heavy voice, \u201cWe are knights that serve the lord. I don\u2019t dare complain about how you decided to use us.\u201d\u201c\u2026..\u201d\u201cBut to be honest\u2026I can\u2019t always maintain that poise. As a knight of the Anies Duchy, we take pride in protecting the territory. It\u2019s coldhearted for the duke to not acknowledge that.\u201dThe commander hadn\u2019t had the chance to even confront Carlton. The battle he fought became meaningless\u2013the deaths of the militia were all in vain with the surrender. And, Luisen had acted on his own without the blessings of his advisors.All of that informed the knight commander of Luisen\u2019s inability to trust his advisors, thus both his pride and his feelings were wounded.\u201cI know my lord does not like his homeland, and my lord is also uncomfortable with his retinue. But still\u2026couldn\u2019t you have tried to convince us just a bit more? Trusted us with your desires?\u201d\u201c\u2026..My heart was in a hurry.\u201d Luisen had no other choice in that situation. The window of opportunity was slim, and that was the best decision possible at that moment. However, the nuances of his surrender would be lost on those that were ignorant of the future.The awkward silence hung heavily on their shoulders.Flowery words may have appeased the commander, but Luisen didn\u2019t want to be insincere. Luisen\u2019s apology, therefore, held more weight. The knight commander abruptly stood up; the conversation ended cleanly, as if he had only arrived to deliver the bracelet.\u201cI\u2019ve brought up something useless. I should get going.\u201d The knight commander quickly left the room. Luisen maintained his polite demeanor until the door closed, at which point he sighed in relief.The commander still had residual resentment against Luisen. Nevertheless, he couldn\u2019t let Luisen go to such a dangerous place without protection, so he offered his most prized possession.\u201cWhat a painfully honest noble.\u201d******A man with such a personality must be affected more by this incident. It was also difficult for Luisen to see his long-time servant suffer through such mental hardships.If only he had appreciated the hard work of the good people around him. If only he suited the title of the duke better.It was meaningless to dwell upon \u2018what ifs\u2019 and alternate scenarios, but Luisen couldn\u2019t shake away the vague feeling of bitterness.The quiet, sleepless night passed slowly.*****Without fail, time passed and morning arrived. Ruger woke early to solemnly dress and prepare Luisen for his journey.Luisen wore chainmail over his usual dress shirt and a tough, waterproof leather coat over that. He didn\u2019t forget to wear the bracelet given by the knight commander on his right wrist. Though unused and a bit rough, all of the armor had been created for Luisen so the fit matched well.Although Luisen didn\u2019t look like a knight, his delicate looks and sleek appearance made him look like a prince. He stepped out into the vacant lot where Carlton and his men were already gathered.They all burst into laughter, as if some grand joke had been made. The atmosphere was light, as if they were departing on a hunting journey.\u201cIsn\u2019t it good that you didn\u2019t wear plate armor?\u201d Ruger whispered.Luisen nodded. At first, he tried to pack plate armor that covered his entire body and a lance as well. Wouldn\u2019t it be safer to be fully armed in combat?On further consideration, however, Luisen had no formal training as a knight, and he wouldn\u2019t have been able to move around agilely in plate armor. It would have been far more difficult to ride a horse with stilted movements\u2013so he gave up on full cover with tears in his eyes.Carlton\u2019s men, though cavalrymen, looked quite different from what he had expected. Few wore armor from head to toe; few wore chainmail. Most of them were clad in tough leather armor with a few iron plates covering the important areas.Plate armor was incredibly expensive and cost a lot of money to maintain. It was complicated\u2013impossible to take on or off alone. Considering these details, perhaps it was obvious that mercenaries, closer to common folk than noble soldiers, wouldn\u2019t be armed with full equipment.\u201cYou look too prepared right now compared to the other soldiers, but with plate armor, my lord would have become a laughingstock.\u201d Ruger nodded.Why did Carlton\u2019s men have no sense of crisis even as they were about to go to war?\u2018They seem like they\u2019re just going on a training trip.\u2019Luisen\u2019s mind began to conjure strange suspicions. \u2018Maybe he\u2019s attacking the Vinard territory as a training exercise, such that his men don\u2019t let their skills rust.\u2019Carlton\u2019s joyful attitude only furthered his doubts. Wasn\u2019t it weird to leave the infantry behind and only bring the cavalry, a small group?Carlton approached Luisen as soon as their eyes met. \u201cDuke, we\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d\u201cI just hope I won\u2019t be a hindrance.\u201d\u201cAll you have to do is follow behind us.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThen Carlton skillfully mounted his horse. He was so natural, pulling the reins and steering the horse\u2019s direction. It seemed as if he and the horse shared one body. He embodied a strength that could not arise from training\u2013and certainly Luisen, who had barely learned for less than a decade, could not follow his grace. Riding on a horse, Carlton was certainly worthy of admiration.\u2018I\u2019ve also tried to learn to ride horses in my childhood, so why\u2026.Is this the result of talent?\u2019 Luisen was depressed.\u201cDuke, you should mount your horse,\u201d Ruger said.\u201cAh, Uh\u2026.Please hold onto it well.\u201d\"\"\u201cOf course.\u201dWith Ruger\u2019s help, Luisen managed to clamor onto the horse. The sudden elevation made him dizzy, and spots appeared in his vision. He gripped the horse\u2019s reins as if they were a lifeline. He hoped desperately that the horse hadn\u2019t noticed his anxiety.\u2018Um\u2026.Ugh\u2026.\u2019 Luisen groaned.\u201cRide fast, with all your might! No one here forgot to ride their horse during their break, right?\u201d Carlton shouted.\u2018Here. Me.\u2019 Luisen wanted to raise his hand, but he also had no desire to suffer through the inevitable disdainful gazes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a noble servant, he was an excellent rider. \u201cI\u2019ll be by your side, assisting my duke. The road will be flat; you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll put my trust in you\u2026.\u201dThe party began to depart.\u2018Let\u2019s just quietly follow. What could go wrong?\u2019 Luisen took a deep breath and spurred his horse.At that time, Luisen didn\u2019t realize how hard it was to plaster oneself to the horse like a dead body\u2013how hard it was to fulfill the \u2018easy\u2019 deed to follow the party!****They were left in the middle of a village.Only Luisen and Ruger remained on the road. Carlton and the rest of the group had long faded into the horizon.Luisen had been left behind before he and his attendant could even properly get out of his territory.\u201cHaaaah\u2026..\u201d Luisen let out a long sigh.Ruger looked at Luisen as if he was at his wits end. Luisen also could only sigh more, as he had no easy solution.\u2018Was I\u2026..truly this bad at riding\u2026.?\u2019It had been okay at first.The party departed slowly. Luisen was quite unsteady, but he was able to follow along. But, perhaps everyone was so excited to leave the castle after such a long time of being stationary? Or perhaps the problem was that there were no obstacles in front of them on this open road?Carlton and his men gradually began to increase speed; after a minute of regaining their senses, their horses began to gallop.Luisen\u2019s poor riding was unable to keep up with these skillful warriors. The duke was part of the leading retinue at the beginning of the journey, but as time went on, he was gradually pushed backwards until he could no longer touch the tails of the horses before him.They had to follow after the rest somehow. Luisen had no doubt that Carlton would find some way to find fault with him\u2026but\u2013the bigger issue\u2013he was embarrassed!Luisen\u2019s heart was in a hurry, but his body couldn\u2019t follow along. Frustration simmered within him. Luisen had directed his temper to his horse, trying to urge it to move with polished but curt words, and the annoyed horse refused to move.\u201cPlease. Horse. Why are you doing this? Can\u2019t we quickly go? Hmm?\u201d Luisen shook the reins and dug into the sides with his heels. He did everything, but his horse had only snorted his refusal.Simultaneously, Carlton and his men were quickly disappearing in the distance. Anxiously, Luisen called out to them, but his voice was buried underneath the clopping sound of hooves. Nobody looked back\u2013Luisen was sure he was forgotten.Ruger did not forget his duty and remained by the side of his master.\u201cCome on, you\u2019re a good horse, right? Will you move for us?\u201d Ruger dismounted and tried to coax Luisen\u2019s horse. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will work, it\u2019s not budging. The horse is incredibly upset.\u201d\u201cThey said it was the mildest of horses in the duchy though\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026.\u201d\u201cI guess even I\u2019d be annoyed to be the steed of such an incompetent rider.\u201d Luisen sighed again. Ruger continued to fret, voicing his worries\u2013not one tail of Carlton\u2019s horses was now visible.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Ruger asked.\u201cWhat can we do? Even if we walk, we have to follow somehow.\u201d If they continued to walk on this road, maybe Carlton would notice their absence and return for them. Or, if the cavalry continued to the Vinard territory without them, Luisen would be thankful.Anyway, it was important to maintain the image that he tried to follow along. Luisen needed to show that he hadn\u2019t intentionally fallen behind. Furthermore, there was no use standing still in the middle of a village.Luisen clambered off his horse.The insolent horse extraordinarily became calm as soon as Luisen dismounted. It\u00a0followed Ruger tamely as he took the reins.Luisen, Ruger, and their two horses began to walk along the quaint road.\u2018Now that I think about it, I haven\u2019t been outside the castle since my regression.\u2019 Luisen had been busy circling the castle and its outskirts, running errands for Carlton. Even while surrendering on that fateful night, Luisen had taken the forest path and avoided the village.\u2018It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen the village\u2026I thought I\u2019d never see it again.\u2019 The village below the castle had disappeared when the duchy burnt down. Though Luisen had been away for a long time, the memory of his hometown was still vivid in his mind.\u2018That\u2019s the flower shop, right? And there\u2019s the tobacco refinery next to it? I think there\u2019s a greengrocer somewhere around here as well\u2026.\u2019Luisen, lost in longing, made eye contact with a woman who stood by the window of a two-story building. She didn\u2019t greet Luisen nor hide from him; she just stared. Perhaps due to her deep set eyes, her gaze was quite piercing.\u2018Who\u2019s that?\u2019Luisen did not know this woman. Luisen had quite the loud dating history in the capital, but he had never made a partner on the estate. However, her penetrating glare made his steps falter.Luisen noticed the strange sense of disharmony stagnating in the air. He was absorbed by nostalgia, but as he cleared his mind, something was definitely wrong.\u2018Why is it so quiet?\u2019The main road connecting the outer and inner districts was one of the busiest places in the village. It had always been crowded with people, horses, and wagons. But now it was quiet for the first time in Luisen\u2019s life.Not a single person was seen on the street\u2013there was no one except for Luisen and Ruger. Unbelievable\u2026even if the gate was sealed, people would still be living in the village. However, Luisen couldn\u2019t hear any signs of life. The village sounded like an abandoned ghost town.\u2018What\u2026\u2026?\u2019While Luisen was lost in anxiety, Ruger, sticking close to his master, said grimly, \u201cMy duke, It would be best for us to mount our horses.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dRuger was looking at a distant location. Following his wary gaze, Luisen saw a small crowd.The people who were hiding in the alleyways or inside their houses came out one by one and approached Luisen. They had no strength in their bodies, and their faces were caked with dirt. Their cheeks were gaunt\u2013like walking corpses. Each desperate eye was bloodshot; Luisen was horrified.\u201cWhat happened to these people?\u201d he murmured.\"\"The Anies territory was rich; ordinary villagers were also able to gain weight and sport supple skin. The generosity of life exuded from their appearance. The villagers of the castle footholds, especially, lived a particularly wealthy life as they were close to the duke\u2019s castle. Normally, they were people who would have lived without knowing hunger for all their lives.Though the village was quarantined, there still was plenty of time before winter. Additionally, the cold season shouldn\u2019t have been a problem as the village should have stocked food supply reserves in advance.One of the villagers stepped forward and asked, \u201cMy lord\u2026You\u2019re the lord, aren\u2019t you?\u201dLuisen wasn\u2019t willing to confirm anything. \u2018The atmosphere is alarming\u2026.\u2019 He wondered if a riot was about to break out. The villagers\u2019 faces seemed to all be filled with anger. It would be better to approach more covertly and ask what had happened.While Luisen was carefully choosing his words, Ruger stepped forward. He covered his master with one arm, protecting him, and shouted at the people.\u201cThat\u2019s right. This man here is Luisen, the Duke of Anies! Knowing that, how dare you block his path?!\u201d\u2018\u2026Crazy Ruger! Shut up!\u2019 Luisen panicked.\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, my lord. Now that they know you\u2019re the duke, they\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d\u2018No, no. The issue is that you\u2019ve revealed my identity!\u2019 Luisen dropped his head into his hands.\u201cIt\u2019s the lord.\u201d\u201cThe lord is here!\u201d\u201cThe lord came out of his castle!\u201dLured by the uproar, more people gathered in no time. The crowd was so intimidating that Luisen plastered himself by Ruger\u2019s side.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Ruger was shocked by the unexpected reaction and gave an indignant shout.\u201cWe\u2019re from the village! We have something to demand from the lord!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something we need to ask!\u201dRuger quickly declined all the requests with one single stroke, \u201cIf you have any questions, go through the proper formalities!\u201d Luisen didn\u2019t even have the chance to calm the crowd and hear them out.\u201cFormalities? Procedures??\u201d\u201cEven if we go through them, you won\u2019t listen to us at all!\u201d\u201cDid you go through the proper procedures when you robbed our granary and storehouses?\u201dLuisen was in shock. \u201cWait, what? What did you say?\u201d he asked.At his words, dozens of people aired out their grievances. \u201cGive us back what you took!\u201d\u201cAll the grain foodstuffs have been taken, the distributed rations have disappeared, and we\u2019re barred from leaving the grounds? Are we supposed to die?!\u201d\u201cOutside the castle grounds, the fields are laden with wheat, but the inner city is left to scramble for crumbs and starvation!\u201dThe sky shook with the villagers\u2019 loud cries of fury and resentment. More shouting layered upon tears. The many voices began to mix together and created a confusing cacophony.\u2018What are they saying? They\u2019re starving to death? How could they be starving to death? Why?? What are they saying we took, and what are these distributions?\u2019 Luisen was puzzled.What had happened to the village at this time of the year? What had happened after the war? Luisen couldn\u2019t remember. Or, more accurately, Luisen didn\u2019t forget, but these details were lost to time in the future.\u201cPlease, slowly tell me the details. I\u2026..I don\u2019t know anything\u2026.\u201d Luisen said.However, Ruger blocked Luisen from moving forward. \u201cPlease stay still, Duke. It\u2019s dangerous. I\u2019ll take care of it. You don\u2019t need to work directly with these ruffians.\u201d\u201cWhat? Did you just call us ruffians?\u201d A very angry man rushed to grab Ruger by the collar, but Ruger simply overpowered the man and threw him forward. An ordinary, starving villager was no match for a noble youth who had trained in martial arts.Ruger, angry at being threatened by the townsfolk, finally raised his bow. He aimed at the man on the ground.\u2018T-this is crazy!\u2019 Luisen panicked and quickly grabbed Ruger\u2019s arm.\u201cDon\u2019t stop me! How dare these commoners attack the nobility!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense and lower your bow! These are my people!\u201d Luisen managed to take away Ruger\u2019s weapon, but it was too late.\u201cThe servant of the lord tried to kill the people of this land!\u201d\u201cNo, calm down!\u201d However, now no one would listen to Luisen. The crowd\u2019s patience, which had been stretched tight like rubber, had finally snapped. Ruger\u2019s behavior sparked an uncontrollable spread of anger.The crowd had become agitated, losing all reason. The situation had instantly distorted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You don\u2019t have to deal with every single violent mob or riot,\u201d Ruger said.\u201cWe\u2019re not a violent mob!\u201dAbsolutely insane. Why could these villagers hear Ruger so well, anyway? Luisen felt like he was about to go crazy.Why did it turn out like this? Until just a moment ago, Luisen had been enjoying a quiet walk.\u201cPlease, mount your horse. We have to get out of here first,\u201d Ruger said.Luisen tried to mount the horse as Ruger requested. However, the horse kept stepping away; Luisen\u2019s feet could not reach the stirrups.\u201cThe lord is trying to run away!\u201d Those who saw Luisen trying to mount the horse crowded closer in a last ditch effort to get his attention. When Luisen tried to force his way through the crowd on top of the horse\u2019s back, the people rushed at him, frightening the horse.Neigh!!The horse shook its body and raised its front hooves. Luisen, who was about to sit in the saddle, was thrown to the ground.\u2018Nngh!\u2019 The impact made Luisen\u2019s body curl up. At that moment, something sharp flew towards him.Luisen reflexively swung his right hand.Clank!Something bounced off the small but hard shield that the bracelet had created. The metallic clang sounded like a dagger.\u2018What? Where did this come from? Who did this?\u2019 Luisen looked up in surprise, but he was already surrounded on all sides by agitated villagers.\u2018Ah\u2026.\u2019The people looked down upon him. The sunlight poured in from behind, creating dark shadows on their faces. Dozens of eyes, all with burst capillaries, were fixed upon Luisen, penetrating the young lord with their glares.Hungry and angry people.In his past life, these types of people had been everywhere. Luisen, powerless after wandering around as a beggar, was easy prey for them. No matter if he was begging, working, or just standing and existing, he was often beaten half to death, surrounded, just like this situation, by a volatile crowd.\u2018I-I have to run.\u2019 Once again, old memories began to arise. A deep-seated sense of fear seized Luisen. Fear consumed reason and paralyzed his senses. He was once again nothing more than a poor and powerless duke\u2013with no nobility and no hometown, he had returned to a life of endless wandering.His heart was pounding, but his two legs would not move. In such a state of extreme confusion, his body would not listen.Someone grabbed Luisen by the collar.\u201cWe\u2019ve got the lord!\u201dWhile Luisen reeled from the impact, someone else grabbed his arm. With an audible rip, the sleeve of his shirt tore off. Luisen swayed between eager hands like a paper doll, bruising everywhere.Luisen\u2019s spiritless body was thrown here and there.Then, a familiar, unforgettable voice rang out, \u201cDuke! Lord Anies! Where are you?!\u201dIt was a black knight riding on a black horse.Carlton had come looking for him.\u201cSir Carlton! Over here!\u201d Luisen shouted. However, it did not seem that Luisen\u2019s voice could be heard over the deafening din of the crowd. \u2018What can I do?\u2019 Carlton\u2019s gaze was scanning the opposite direction. Like this\u2026Luisen\u2019s savior may ride away.\u2018I can\u2019t let that happen!\u2019 Luisen had quickly thought of a solution in that moment. Even if humans couldn\u2019t hear him, a horse surely could.Luisen freed his arms with all his might and brought his left hand near his mouth. Forming a circle with his fingers, he blew into his hand. A long, clear whistling sound, often used in riding training, cut through the air. The sound was not as piercing as it could have been, competing with the roaring crowd.The black horse, with its sensitive ears, turned towards Luisen, and Carlton didn\u2019t miss the small shift in his steed. His eyes followed the horse\u2019s gaze and locked onto Luisen.Carlton reacted immediately. He pulled on his horse\u2019s reins, urging his steed to leap a considerable distance. Luisen had no idea how the knight managed to move so nimbly in such a crowd. The gigantic black horse, after vaulting over the people\u2019s heads, landed in front of Luisen.\u201cGet away from him!\u201dCarlton\u2019s fearsome movements terrified the crowd. They were ordinary folk, and though they were incensed with anger, they knew they were no match for Carlton, who had fought on the front lines numerous times. The villagers finally released their hold on the lord.Carlton snatched Luisen away without even having to swing his sword. As if he were holding a mere child, he hefted Luisen\u2019s light body up and held him effortlessly against his side.\u201cDon\u2019t struggle,\u201d Carlton whispered.Luisen closed his eyes and nodded. Thinking of the last time he\u2019d been on this horse, there was certainly nothing good about opening his eyes.And Luisen was proven right. Carlton took off, horse leaping into the air similarly to how he had approached Luisen in the crowd. Luisen tightly clenched his jaw and swallowed a scream; he felt as if he were flying through the sky.Carlton easily jumped through the angry crowd and quickly escaped the riotous situation. No one dared to block his way.***When the two arrived at the entrance to the village, Carlton finally released Luisen.\u201cU-urk.\u201d As soon as his feet touched the ground, Luisen gagged. Carlton looked at his prone figure calmly, with neither sympathy nor contempt.\u2018That could have been a disaster.\u2019 After a while\u2013when his dizziness had faded\u2013Luisen looked up. Carlton handed him a water canteen to rinse his mouth.\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Luisen felt stable enough to pay attention to his surroundings.\u201cWe\u2019re at the village outskirts.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve saved me twice now.\u201d\u201cYes, well\u2026\u201d Carlton was also very surprised. He had thought Luisen was following behind closely, but as he waited for the territory\u2019s gates to open, he realized he could no longer see Luisen nor the lord\u2019s servant.\u2018I was too excited. After only signing paperwork all day long in the castle, I was too excited to ride through the open fields of the south.\u2019 Carlton\u2019s blood boiled at the brief freedom. He and his men had gradually increased their speed, vying for the lead and competing against each other. In the midst of their fun, Carlton had completely forgotten about Luisen.After realizing Luisen was no longer in sight, Carlton had thought the lord would soon follow. After all, all nobles learned to ride horses as soon as they could walk. Horses were expensive creatures; riding skillfully was seen as a symbol and privilege of the nobility.He hadn\u2019t known that Luisen was such a terrible rider.Later Carlton had hurried back and retraced his path to find Luisen. By the time the knight arrived, the villagers had already started a riot, and Luisen was already buried in the crowd.Carlton\u2019s soldiers stationed at the castle had also mobilized when they\u2019d heard the news of the riot in the village. If Carlton had been one step behind, Luisen might have gotten seriously injured.\u201cThat could have been dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Luisen bit his lips and recalled, one by one, the various grievances the villagers had yelled at him. \u2018They said their food and water supplies were taken. Rations had stopped being distributed.\u2019Slowly, he pieced together the clues in his mind.During war time, all granaries and excess supplies were seized from the territory\u2013quite standard for wars involving territorial disputes. The ruling household would then ration necessities for a living.However, when Luisen had suddenly surrendered, a glitch in the well-oiled system appeared. As Carlton\u2019s soldiers seized the castle, the administrative system completely collapsed. The day to day operations were dismantled, and distribution was suspended.All the soldiers were detained and the castle\u2019s servants were too busy waiting upon Carlton\u2019s men. On top of that, all the officials went on strike, refusing to work underneath Luisen and Carlton\u2019s rule. Only Luisen had retained freedom to work, but he was completely unaware of the situation.\u2018Is it all my fault, after all?\u2019 Luisen grasped his head.Finally, he understood the treasurer\u2019s despair at his abrupt actions, the hostility from the servants, and Carlton\u2019s ridicule. Carlton\u2019s question came to mind, when he\u2019d asked about Luisen\u2019s interest in the village\u2019s situation. He must have known something was wrong there.\u201cYou\u2026.did you know about the state of the villagers and the village?\u201d Luisen asked.Carlton nodded, as if this knowledge was obvious. \u201cYes, of course I knew. The duke truly had no idea?\u201d\u201c\u2026If I knew, then I wouldn\u2019t have ignored their plight,\u201d Luisen murmured, flagellating himself. He couldn\u2019t raise his head, shoulders heavy with pity for the villagers and shame for himself. Carlton looked down at the rounded crown of the young lord\u2019s head.Finally, the time had come to laugh at the lord. Carlton had secretly looked forward to this opportunity ever since he had seen Luisen\u2019s noble poise. How could a lord not know when the people in his territory were starving?But, his laughter did not come.Luisen had a pale face, as if he were about to faint. His shock and regret were plainly evident in his expression. The elegance that had been crafted since birth, the noble arrogance, had left him. Only the image of a young, ignorant, and vulnerable man remained.Luisen stood on the precipice of despair; a single push could send him hurtling into an endless pit of depression.\u2018Let\u2019s just leave it alone.\u2019This and that, everything was just too annoying. Carlton decided to wait on ridiculing the lord until the situation was sorted out.\u201cIf you\u2019ve sobered up, then let\u2019s return to the castle. I\u2019ll escort you there,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cWait a moment. I have a favor to request from you.\u201d Luisen grabbed Carlton by the wrist. \u201cI want to see the situation in the village for myself. With my own eyes.\u201d\u201cNo. That\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you. I\u2019ll be safe with you.\u201d\u201cWhy would I\u2026.\u201d Carlton attempted to shake off Luisen\u2019s hand. However, at that moment, their gazes connected. Luisen\u2019s blue eyes were filled with fervent hope, as if Carlton were his only savior.\u2018Honestly, it would be better to just take him to the castle.\u2019Luisen\u2019s shock shouldn\u2019t have mattered to Carlton. Rather, the young duke\u2019s actions had distorted his original plans\u2013anger would have been an apt response. If Carlton escorted Luisen back to the castle, he and his men could leave for the Vinard estate without getting dragged into the territory\u2019s issues.But, going against his own thoughts, Carlton nodded. He had been ready to refuse, but was struck speechless by Luisen\u2019s gradually brightening and sunny expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cThank you. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll repay this favor, someday,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cWe\u2019re only doing one lap of the village.\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s fine. I can\u2019t shamelessly hope for more than that.\u201dCarlton had once again seated Luisen on the saddle and started his horse. Luisen held tightly onto Carlton\u2019s clothes\u2013fear was forgotten for determination.\u2018Why did I agree to this?\u2019 Carlton thought. He could feel tension passing from Luisen\u2019s body to his. The lord\u2019s tremors could have easily gotten on Carlton\u2019s nerves, but the feel of his body eased his senses.For Luisen, whose body had been plastered against Carlton\u2019s back, the knight he had been so afraid of was temporarily no longer his biggest concern.The town\u2019s situation was too severe.The people who took to the streets were in better condition\u2013they at least had the energy to move and shout. The rest of the villagers simply didn\u2019t seem to have the strength to leave their houses. Thus, many of the roads were empty, and all normal activity had halted. With no promise of when this crisis would pass, the villagers were engulfed by endless anxiety.One corner of the village housed people that had fled their homes for the castle or its outskirts: farmers who had thought that the castle surroundings would be safer, and the families of the conscripted soldiers. They lived in temporary tents and used worn blankets for beds. The cold season had not started in earnest, but still the weather was not kind to the homeless. Tired and ill, they could only roll their eyes to follow Luisen as he passed by.Their eyes were incredibly lethargic; in their unfocused pupils, Luisen perceived deep hunger.It was a pain that Luisen knew well.\"\"Starvation made one hungry, at first. Then, the intestines will twist in pain, and the brain will only be filled with thoughts of food. Only animal instincts remained.Rotten fruit, moldy bread, muddy grass roots\u2026For the sake of eating, for the sake of filling the stomach, starvation drove you to ignore nausea and stuff anything you could grab into your mouth. You would do anything for a crumb\u2013hard labor, begging, stealing, even prostitution.Then, when the hunger was temporarily sated and you would return to your senses, you\u2019d be horrified at your behavior. Your ego would cry out in misery and disgust. And yet, even as your pride crumbled, the food\u2013wretched morsels\u2013would taste so sweet.Luisen sympathized with the anguish these villagers were currently feeling.He groaned. \u2018Why couldn\u2019t I have checked in on the village before the situation got so severe? Why didn\u2019t I notice the signs when I was riding through? I can\u2019t believe I congratulated myself for being a good lord when such pain was brewing right underneath my nose.\u2019 A sense of shame filled his being.\u201c\u2026.Let\u2019s just return to the castle,\u201d Luisen said, voice filled with emotion. His heart would carry the villagers\u2019 misery with him.Carlton silently rode the horse back to the castle.***After arriving at the castle, Luisen headed straight for the general\u2019s room. There was no one more knowledgeable than him, the lord\u2019s deputy.\u201cGeneral!\u201dA frantic Luisen burst into the room. The general\u2019s eyes widened at Luisen\u2019s appearance\u2013where had the prince-like figure loved by minstrel songs gone? He had been clean when he\u2019d left, but here his clothes were torn, as if he had rolled around in the underbrush.\u201cWhat happened? What about the battle?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s been cancelled. I fell behind and was left in the middle of town and got caught up with the villagers.\u201d\u201cWas there a riot?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe general was greatly surprised. He knew that his lord would struggle while riding, but he didn\u2019t think Luisen wouldn\u2019t even be able to leave the castle outskirts. The path was a straight, well-travelled road! Even without further explanation, the general could imagine the chaotic situation. A lord appearing in the middle of a frenzy of hungry citizens; it was obvious something dire could have happened.\u201cAnd what about Ruger? What was the chief attendant doing, if not protecting you?!\u201d the general said. Ruger had learned martial arts specifically to safely accompany Luisen as his aide and escort.\u201cIt was too chaotic. But more importantly, it seems you knew about the town\u2019s situation?\u201d\u201cI was expecting something of the sort\u2026.but I didn\u2019t expect that you wouldn\u2019t even be able to make it through the territory gates\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not talking about that!\u201d Luisen shouted in a fit of anger. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that all the villagers were starving to death? Are you telling me that you lapsed in your duty while the people were living so poorly?!\u201dThe general frowned and opened his eyes wider. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026.You had no idea of the current state of the territory?\u201d he asked as if he couldn\u2019t understand Luisen\u2019s words.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cTo fund support for the second prince, I reported that we must commandeer the nearby village and requisition their warehouses. Afterwards, rations would be distributed to the people. I\u2019m certain I got your consent for this.\u201d The general was a thorough man; he wasn\u2019t one to implement drastic measures without the lord\u2019s say so.Luisen had really forgotten all about this.He was clumsy with paperwork. From the age of six, Luisen had merely signed the papers the general had placed in front of him. He had frantically signed countless documents and letters, his eyes growing tired beneath the terrifying amount of work. The young lord had never fully read all the papers.In addition, that paperwork was years ago for Luisen now. The shock of burning fields and rampant death was enough to make one forget relatively trivial matters.But, those were paltry excuses now\u2013especially in the face of the villagers\u2019 pain and suffering.Luisen felt a deep sense of shame. Tears welled up in his eyes.\u201c\u2026.Did you really forget? How could you\u2026Didn\u2019t I personally explain these details?\u201d The general was similarly taken aback. Luisen had signed this proposal by his own hands\u2013not one year ago, but only a month ago. He would have never imagined the lord would forget; he\u2019d assumed Luisen knew of the village\u2019s plight but could do nothing because of Carlton\u2019s interference.So, the general had hushed all information regarding the village and had been secretly considering methods to rescue them.\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d the general plainly expressed his disappointment.\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you, time and time again\u2026Don\u2019t forget that you\u2019re the master of these golden fields.\u201d\u201c\u2026And the true treasury of this kingdom are these golden fields. And that the Anies who govern this place are an honorable family, so I must act accordingly to protect this land. I know, General.\u201d Luisen had heard these words from the general\u2019s mouth ever since he was young. Though it seemed, whether past or present, Luisen had not once fully embodied this message.Luisen was too anguished and distressed to sit still. The general\u2019s gaze pierced him like many tiny needles. The lord sprang up from his seat before pacing around the room. He walked to an open window.The plains stretching beyond the shallow, rolling hills were drenched in the colors of the sunset. Gold, yellow, and red\u2026.the view was upsetting, so Luisen closed his eyes.However, in the dark of his own mind, blocking the view only amplified his feelings.After returning to the past, he felt as if he was only making more stupid mistakes and committing more wrongdoings.\u2018What can I do? What was I even thinking?\u2019Just as Luisen had regained some confidence, he once again became disappointed in himself. Suddenly, he felt the urge to hide forever in shame.In his despair, Luisen habitually asked himself, \u2018What should I do, Saint-nim?\u2019In the past, when Luisen had woken up from his nightmares and sobbed for fear of the dead, the saint had kindly wiped his back.The saint had said, \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of the dark, don\u2019t cover yourself with a blanket and hide from it. Open your eyes and turn on the light. The more you avoid and avert your eyes, your fear will grow endlessly and weigh you down.\u201dLuisen thought\u2026and thought again.\u2018That\u2019s right. I can\u2019t avoid this.\u2019The young lord opened his eyes. He took in the beautiful scenery of his hometown and recalled how badly he missed this view. How much he wanted to return to this time.The general looked at Luisen without much expectation.The young Luisen had a weak temperance and a tendency to give up at any sort of obstacle. In particular, he hated to be criticized. \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll cry and give up,\u2019 the general thought.But the Luisen that returned to the table seemed somehow different.\u201cAs I have said before, I have no regrets with surrendering. Like you said, the Duke of Anies has a responsibility to protect this territory. I did my job.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd, about the starvation issue\u2026.Since I\u2019ve forgotten them, it\u2019s my fault. I\u2019ll fix it immediately.\u201d Luisen\u2019s eyes belied his firm will; he was determined not to compromise.The general was greatly surprised. A hard wicker spine had formed inside of a soft cotton doll. In Luisen, who now looked strangely mature, the general had found the vestiges of the preceding duke, whom he had admired for most of his life.\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d The general\u2019s tone became unwittingly polite.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

One order from his lips could refill the warehouses or bring in harvested wheat from the fields. Yet he chose to stay still and do nothing. My lord, what do you think that means?\u201d\u201cThat Carlton\u2019s help will solve all our problems?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\u201cI know. You meant that it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll extend a helping hand. However, that does not mean I can simply back down.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll deal with Sir Carlton, so you all should gather the people. Make a plan to rescue the people of the lower village immediately once permission is granted.\u201d\u201cWill Sir Carlton allow us to gather the villagers?\u201d\u201cIf any of his men stop you, drop my name. I received his permission.\u201d\u201cWill it truly be alright?\u201d The general looked anxious. Could they really do as Luisen said? What recourse would they have if their actions brought more trouble?\u201cI personally persuaded Sir Carlton to prepare for the locusts. I\u2019ll find a way, somehow. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Perhaps that was stretching the truth, but Luisen furtively swept reality under the rug. At this time, it was more important to show confidence to his people and to reassure his general and the other retainers.\u201cIt\u2019s for our innocent people. Even if you bear any grudges against me, please think of them.\u201d Luisen bowed his head deeply. The sight shook the general\u2019s composure.Luisen, at six, lost his parents to an infectious epidemic that ravaged the territory. The couple struggled day and night for their people and eventually succumbed to the same disease they had so desperately fought. In the end, the plague was quickly quelled by the foundations his parents had laid; it was a noble and honorable death befitting the rulers of the duchy.As a result, Luisen had become a lord at such an early age.On the day of his duke and duchess\u2019 funeral, the general hugged the young lord and vowed to protect him for life. He had raised Luisen with all his overprotective heart, worried that the young lord would get hurt or become spirited away if without supervision. However, such sheltering turned Luisen into an incorrigible brat. The general couldn\u2019t help but be disappointed and despondent at his behavior.Even so, Luisen was his dearly beloved lord.The person whom he had nurtured with every fibre of his youth\u2019s affections and devotions.There was only one answer possible for the general when such a lord asked for his help.\u201cI will obey your orders, my lord.\u201d The general bowed deeply to Luisen.\u2018With the general\u2019s aid, the remaining work will fall into line quite nicely.\u2019 Luisen smiled with relief. \u2018Now if only I can manage to persuade Carlton\u2026\u2019Vowing to obtain his permission at all costs, Luisen left the room.****As Luisen met with the general in his room, Carlton found his way to the general\u2019s office. This office contained almost all of the estate\u2019s administrative documents.Carlton searched for a document that authorized the seizure of rations and food supplies for the war. He was certain the retainers wouldn\u2019t be so bold as to commandeer property without the lord\u2019s explicit permission. There was bound to be some official statement.Just from looking at the office, Carlton could tell that the general was a competent individual. All of the paperwork had been systematically organized, and Carlton quickly found what he was looking for.After quickly leafing through the papers, he found the desired document with the Duke of Anies\u2019 signature clearly demarcated at the bottom.He briefly glanced at the document, and though the signature was messy due to the urgency of the situation, it was undoubtedly Luisen\u2019s.\u2018What\u2019s this\u2026So he did sign off on it.\u2019 A corner of Carlton\u2019s heart chilled.While touring the village together, Carlton had been observing the lord\u2019s expressions. His pale face had revealed apparent shock and\u00a0confusion.So, Carlton had expected foul play.As Luisen had no real power in his duchy and the retainers\u2019 influence was strong, Carlton wondered if the retainers had committed the deed without Luisen\u2019s knowledge.But that obviously wasn\u2019t the case. The seizure was something Luisen himself had allowed.\u2018So you truly didn\u2019t know? If you\u2019ve lied, I won\u2019t let this go.\u2019Had he been pretending when he\u2019d trembled and so desperately clung onto Carlton\u2019s back? Had he been lying when he said he wanted to fully survey the village\u2019s crisis?Carlton kicked the desk, and a loud noise reverberated throughout the room. He felt unpleasantly irritated.\u2018Once again, a noble has proven he is nothing more than the other bottom-feeding nobles out there. Yet, why am I feeling so disappointed?\u2026I was just briefly fooled by his face. I\u2019m just angry that I\u2019ve once again been deceived by another aristocrat. That\u2019s it.\u2019Carlton tried to justify the unpleasant feeling within his heart. \u2018It\u2019s his face that\u2019s the problem\u2026that face\u2026\u2019One of Carlton\u2019s men came to see him as he was venting his anger on the innocent desk. \u201cUm\u2026.Boss?\u201dThey had originally scattered to search for Luisen and had just returned to the castle after hearing news of his safe arrival. A representative had come to find Carlton in order to hear his next orders.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Carlton turned and left as if nothing had happened. The subordinate, used to Carlton\u2019s fits of temper, followed his captain out of the office.\u201cWhat happened to the village?\u201d Carlton asked as they walked down the hall.\u201cIt\u2019s been roughly sorted out. They\u2019re only villagers; they all scattered on their own when the soldiers arrived. So, there was no big conflict\u2013I could only catch those who were unable to run away and placed them in prison.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll only hold them for a brief while. Release them tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dAfter thinking, Carlton added, \u201cAnd prepare a meal for them.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the subordinate answered. \u201cAh! I believe the duke\u2019s servant was caught in the commotion and has also been captured. Won\u2019t it be an issue if the duke\u2019s servant is held in custody?\u201d\u201cThat guy?\u201dCarlton recalled his interactions with Luisen\u2019s attendant. Pompous bastard\u2013he constantly looked condescendingly at Carlton from behind his master. Though he seemed quite slick and compliant, his uniquely arrogant expression had distorted his face such that his appearance did not shine.That man had gotten on Carlton\u2019s nerves plenty of times. Though he was angry at the servant for openly disdaining him and his men, the duke\u2019s servant was not someone he could easily touch.\u201cIs he an impersonation?\u201d Carlton said.\u201cWhat? We\u2019ve identified him.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid that some villagers may be pretending to be the duke\u2019s servant to escape punishment.\u201d Carlton grinned. A duke\u2019s servant could not be contained\u2026but a villager has no such political power and can be left alone. Luisen had angered him, but Carlton felt slightly better while thinking of Ruger, who would surely suffer an uncomfortable night in prison.\u201cAh, yes.\u201d The subordinate snickered as he agreed. Everyone knew of Ruger\u2019s arrogant words and actions; among Carlton\u2019s men, there was no one who hadn\u2019t engaged in minor conflicts with the servant.He didn\u2019t expect for Ruger to wait patiently while sharing a cell with the very villagers he\u2019d fought.\u201cIt\u2019s time for that guy to taste some of the bitterness of the world.\u201d\u201cPeople have to suffer a little to live.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u2018As expected of our boss,\u2019 the subordinate thought. \u2018He never misses an opportunity!\u2019 Once again, Carlton\u2019s men reflected on their deep respect for their captain\u2019s viciousness.******Carlton and his subordinate returned to his requisitioned office. All the other senior subordinates had already gathered for a drink, and they were suggesting they set out again tomorrow morning.At that moment, Luisen appeared, entering the room with firm resolution.\u2018It\u2019s not as if he\u2019s some prisoner of war or slave entering enemy lines.\u2019 Carlton didn\u2019t like his attitude.\u201cI came to tell you something\u2026but I see you\u2019re joined by others. I\u2019ll be waiting outside.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Carlton stopped Luisen from leaving. \u201cJust say what you need here.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201dThe gazes of Carlton\u2019s men pierced Luisen.Each stare provided tremendous pressure, as each mercenary was twice Luisen\u2019s size. The gazes were neutral, but certainly not good\u2026After all, Luisen was the reason today\u2019s schedule had gone awry.Luisen did not back down, however. He continued to delve into his grim business, \u201cI\u2019d like to resume distribution to the lower village.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Carlton said directly, without giving it a single thought. He\u2019d already thought about the answer to this question.\u201cI need to return to the warfront tomorrow. I can\u2019t afford to give attention to this matter. There\u2019s no manpower, time, nor supplies to distribute to the villagers.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re short on manpower, then how about using the duchy\u2019s men? The general will be in charge, not me. He\u2019s very reliable, right?\u201d\u201cI suppose.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll gather the necessary foodstuffs ourselves. The portion needed for war compensation won\u2019t be touched.\u201dLuisen was so insistent that Carlton couldn\u2019t help but to continue questioning the lord. \u201cUnless you gather foodstuffs from outside, you won\u2019t have enough to feed them all, will you?\u201dIn the first place, the village\u2019s granary was requisitioned due to a lack of supplies in the castle. Self-sufficiency, beyond the provisions set aside for the war efforts, was impossible unless the gates were reopened.\u201cThose gates will never be opened. Don\u2019t even dream about it.\u201d\u201cI have another way. Would you allow that?\u201d\u201cI see. But still, I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Carlton replied in a petulant heartbeat.Luisen still did not back down. \u201cYou know the state of the people in the lower village. They\u2019re all sick and starving. If you leave them as is, they\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201cAnd so?\u201d\u201cThose people are innocent. They\u2019ve just gotten tangled in political matters.\u201d\u201cPerhaps it is also a sin for these ordinary people to meet such a foolish lord. Even if they live hard, their lives are wasted like common house flies at the stroke of a noble\u2019s hand,\u201d Carlton said angrily, pointing out Luisen\u2019s incompetence.\u201c\u2026Please have mercy on them,\u201d Luisen begged pitifully. But his earnest appearance now looked plastic to Carlton\u2019s indignant eyes.\u201cDoes the duke think I have come to play around?\u201d\u201c\u2026.No.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come to conquer the region, not to serve its people. Why must I show mercy?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You\u2019ve been complacent this whole time, haven\u2019t you? So then why, on the day we return to the front lines, are you suddenly concerned with ration distribution? Don\u2019t you find this sudden interest suspicious?\u201d\u201c\u2026.That\u2019s because I truly just found out now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been less than a month since you signed the document. Have you already forgotten?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that I forgot. I truly did not know.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026I\u2026.didn\u2019t read it well,\u201d Luisen earnestly tried to explain how he didn\u2019t often read the documents\u2013how he signed without understanding their contents. By then, his face began to glow red from embarrassment.\u201cSo, you didn\u2019t know its meaning and just signed what you were told to sign?\u201dLuisen nodded.He felt incompetent as a human.He truly did not want to admit it, but in order to convey his innocence, he must endure the shame.\u201cWhat can I do for you to trust in my sincerity?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cWho knows.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you want. I can promise you the future. Should I kneel for you again?\u201d Luisen once again dropped to his knees. Carlton\u2019s men gasped.One of the four great nobles in the kingdom was once again kneeling to Carlton, a common mercenary!If this news spread, there was no doubt that Luisen\u2019s authority would plummet to the ground, and he would be ridiculed by his peers.But Luisen was not in the least bit ashamed by his current actions. His face held great determination\u2013his desire to do anything to save his territory. His noble figure was something out of storybooks, asynchronous with the current political state of affairs between the blue blooded and the common folk.The beautiful lord kneeling before the grim mercenary.The scene left a bitter taste in Carlton\u2019s mouth. It looked as if Carlton was a villain threatening the citizens\u2019 lives while Luisen was a saint sacrificing himself to their unfair demands.\u2018But this was the lord\u2019s fault! It should be his job to pick up the pieces.\u2019\u2018Why does it feel like I\u2019m the bad guy?\u2019 Carlton was frustrated.\u201cAnything? Then, do you think only your knees would suffice? Then you might as well bare your entire body to show your sincerity.\u201d\u201cMy body?\u201d Luisen struggled to find meaning in the mercenary\u2019s carelessly spoken words.\u2018So he wants my body? In\u00a0that\u00a0sense?\u2019 Luisen\u2019s eyes shook as if an earthquake was wracking his insides. Carlton seemed very amused when he saw Luisen\u2019s hesitation.He had merely thrown out those words to insult Luisen\u2013he wasn\u2019t expecting Luisen to take the proposal so seriously.\u2018Look at him. Even if he pretends to be merciful, he still places the utmost importance on his own ego.\u2019 Carlton didn\u2019t think Luisen could withstand such disgrace. He waited calmly for Luisen to throw a fit about the insult. \u2018At this point, maybe we\u2019ll have to throw him in jail too. A perfectly detained duo\u2013the lord and his servant.\u2019But Luisen\u2019s internal agitation ran on a different wavelength than Calrton\u2019s thoughts. He knew Carlton was trying to get a rise out of him\u2026but what if he would actually accept this kind of deal?\u2018I could feed everyone in the lower villages by spending one night with him? I\u2019ve followed and debased myself for promises akin to a few pages out of a fairytale book\u2026Relatively speaking, this deal is just too profitable, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Luisen thought.Anyway, it was definitely good to be a noble. The payment for one night had been very different when he\u2019d been a simple wanderer. There was nothing more to worry about, and so Luisen readily consented.\u201cAll right.\u201dUpon hearing the lord\u2019s agreement, everyone in the room united in their shared confusion. \u2018What did I just hear?\u2019 They all doubted their own ears.Carlton also looked at the lord incredulously. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked.\u201cI said, fine. Didn\u2019t I say I\u2019d do anything to show my sincerity?\u201d Luisen was very nonchalant. The insult didn\u2019t seem to register, nor did he get angry. It was as if Carlton had told him he needed to pay money to buy bread\u2013a natural transaction.Eventually, Luisen loosened the lavish cloth around his neck. The collar of his shirt spread, revealing his white neck. His hand movements were bold and without hesitation.Cough cough!Carlton\u2019s men were frightened, and they cleared their throats in vain. Although they, like their boss, would often ignore the gravity of their status difference in a reckless manner, they also knew well how outrageous this situation was.As wandering mercenaries, they were lower than even the villagers\u2013lower than the peasants that farmed the territory. To them, the most distinct nobles like Luisen were existences far beyond the clouds.\u2018This isn\u2019t just any old nobleman; he\u2019s one of the great nobles\u2026kneeling before the captain and undressing\u2026.Is this reality?\u2019Technically, Luisen had only bared his neck, but for Carlton and his crew, it was no less shocking than completely baring himself.\u2018I-is this okay?\u2019 Carlton\u2019s men alternated their gazes between Luisen and their boss. Carlton\u2019s expression looked quite complicated, his cheeks set stubbornly ablaze.\u2018This is a disaster!\u2019Carlton notoriously had a large temper and hated to lose. Once he recognized the situation as a fight, he truly fought from the bottom of his heart. Even if his opponent was a nobleman, he would act no differently. Rather, he\u2019d be even more stubborn in this small war of nerves.That tenacity was one of the many reasons Carlton had managed to climb to where he was now. But the soldiers knew that catastrophe often followed that stubborn look on their captain\u2019s face. The men turned blue in despair.\u00a01Carlton, as his men expected, was filled with an unyielding spirit.\u2018Does he want me to call his bluff?\u2019 Carlton truly did not believe in Luisen.Luisen had too readily replied with his consent. Would it have been so easy for Luisen to answer if he had really intended to deliver his body to him?Carlton didn\u2019t think so. \u2018You thought that if you offered yourself up, I\u2019d stop you in surprise, right? I\u2019ll show you I\u2019m not such an easy opponent.\u2019\"\"After all, what kind of aristocrat would give up his own body to save the people of his land?That\u2019s how aristocrats were. They were all born with a sense of arrogance and privilege, squeezing the use out of their peasant citizens, calling for their worship, and taking their respect for granted. Evil and selfishness was in their blood.He was certain the lord was simply virtue signaling for show.\u2018Fine. Let\u2019s see who wins,\u2019 Carlton thought.\u201cEveryone leave.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Carlton\u2019s men asked in confusion.Carlton spoke clearly, eyes fixed on Luisen, \u201cUnless you\u2019re curious about his precious naked body? If that\u2019s the case, then stay.\u201d\u201cAh. No, sir.\u201d Carlton\u2019s men quickly stood up. They left the room hastily, like they were running from a predator, and closed the door tightly as if scared they would become ensnared in whatever catastrophe was about to occur.Only Carlton and Luisen were left in the room. Luisen had his eyes cast downward with an indifferent expression on his face, as always. In contrast, Carlton\u2019s expression was grim, as if he would bite at any provocation.\u201cYou wanted to show your sincerity, right?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dAt Carlton\u2019s urging, Luisen slowly crawled on his knees.Luisen\u2019s knees pressed into the carpet as he moved forward. His shoes were heavy against the floor; as both legs rubbed against each other, the sound of rustling cloth filled the silence. That little noise made Luisen more nervous, and it also scratched at Carlton\u2019s ears.Little by little.Slowly, and a bit timidly, the distance between the two narrowed.Carlton watched, waiting for Luisen to give up and stand back on his feet. However, Luisen felt strongly drawn to the other\u2019s gaze.\u2018This is crazy.\u2019 Luisen\u2019s heart was trembling, like death was gripping it. It was good to be bold and drastic, but now that he was kneeling in front of Carlton, his mouth felt dry. \u2018How rough will Carlton be? I\u2019m scared to make eye contact\u2026but I have to do this.\u2019 He worried whether he could push past his fear or not.The sound of his heart beating grew steadily louder.And yet, Luisen did not back down; he had no desire to run away again. He\u2019d promised to do anything, and this much, his dignity, was not worth sparing.Soon, Luisen\u2019s knees touched the tips of Carlton\u2019s toes. Luisen put his hands in his lap.\u2018This\u2026I\u2019m going crazy. Until when is he going to keep up this pretense?\u2019 Carlton internally spat many curses. He felt dizzy, although he was determined to win this war of nerves.He had practiced abstinence for too long and masked all his feelings with alcohol. It felt too stimulating to have Luisen, a perfect aristocrat, sit at his feet obediently. To feel this way about the Duke of Anies\u2026perhaps he had lacked comfort these past few years.When Luisen reached for Carlton\u2019s pants, he wanted to scream, \u2018Just stop! How far will you go to trick me?\u2019As Luisen began to untie the knot in the mercenary\u2019s trousers, he raised his head, flustered. The two locked eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m not going to do it\u2026it\u2019s just\u2026this isn\u2019t working\u2026\u201d Luisen\u2019s eyes watered as if he were about to cry. His hands were stiff and unable to untie that simple knot. His voice trembled and his whole body seemed to be helpless.The pressure he felt was conveyed to Carlton through his shaking touch.\u2018What? Is he for real?\u2019 Finally, his sharp intuition pierced its way through Carlton\u2019s mind. He had great faith in his animal instinct, so he immediately snapped into action.He grabbed Luisen\u2019s hand.\u201cAh, I was trying to do\u2026.\u201d Luisen trailed off. Carlton couldn\u2019t understand how Luisen had interpreted his actions\u2013what he thought Carlton wanted. The young lord attempted to pull out his hand and once again resumed untying his trousers.\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Carlton said gruffly.\u201cHuh?\u201dCarlton shifted his hands to support Luisen\u2019s arms and raised him up. The young lord, light as paper, was dragged to his feet.TL: They really played gay chicken\u2026Remember, this is the journey of both characters learning to be better people >.<FootnotesThis is an idiom\u2013for example, take how in anime, characters get blue lines on their face to show despair or sadness or exasperation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His body reeked of sweat and was covered with dirt from the scuffle at the village. His palm was stained dark red\u2013he had skinned himself when he fell during the riot\u2013and blood had clotted in the wrinkles of skin. His rich clothes had turned ragged and were torn here and there.\u2018I look terrible enough to avoid,\u2019 Luisen thought.He was so focused on the village\u2019s situation that he failed to notice his own dirty appearance.\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten myself\u2013I look more horse than human right now.

Had the duke\u2013through either innocence or stupidity\u2013really believed this absurd, vulgar joke and prepared to give up his body?\u201cNo.\u201d Carlton became serious.\u201cYou\u2019d like it better if I don\u2019t wash?\u201d Luisen asked with an ambiguous look on his face.\u2018Was this noble always this hard of hearing?\u2019 Carlton thought. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cThis is crazy. I said, enough. You can stop now. My words were only meant to mock you, my duke. Nothing was genuine.\u201d\u201cYou were mocking me?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m not that kind of trash. I didn\u2019t know that the duke would take my words to heart.\u201d\u201cIf I weren\u2019t truly sincere, why would I go this far?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Carlton hesitated. \u201cA war of nerves\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I would do anything? What\u2019s the point of fighting with you so stubbornly just for pride?\u201d\u201cWell, nobles would usually engage in wars of nerves even with a knife placed at their throats.\u201d\u2018Is that so?\u2019 Luisen fumbled around in his memory to search for the answer. Indeed, there were those courageous nobles who would pick petty fights with him, a great lord. But would they have done the same with Carlton?He was a hotheaded, noble-hating man who ran wild until he was abandoned by the first prince\u2026\u00a01Luisen supposed that could have been possible. For some, pride was more important than anything else. To Luisen, however, it didn\u2019t matter to him whether or not Carlton\u2019s request was genuine or pure mockery.\u201cThen, have I properly shown my sincerity now?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201c\u2026.Yes. It\u2019s enough,\u201d Carlton replied, a strange bitter taste lingering in his mouth. \u2018Is that all you have to say?\u2019Carlton felt as if he had really avoided certain disaster by a hair\u2019s breadth. Had he not stopped Luisen, the lord really would have pulled off his pants. And then\u2026anyone could imagine what would have happened next. Even though the two were in such a disgraceful situation, his opponent, Luisen, didn\u2019t seem to care.\u201cThen, you\u2019ll give permission?\u201d Luisen\u2019s eyes glistened hopefully.The shining blue eyes reminded Carlton of summer rays reflecting off a brook.\u2018Is this how it is? A truly magnanimous noble? He has no ulterior motives?\u2019 Carlton suddenly grew anxious as he looked at Luisen\u2019s fair complexion, like a child abandoned at the shore. \u2018Most people wouldn\u2019t go this far, would they?\u2019Luisen was far too reckless. And Carlton concluded that predicting his behavior was pointless. They would have to compromise.\u2018I\u2019d rather keep an eye on him now rather than learn about the bizarre things he\u2019s done behind my back later.\u2019 Though he hated to acquiesce since it felt like he was being dragged alongside the lord\u2019s pace, Carlton chose the path that made him less anxious.\u201cAll right. Do as you please, my lord.\u201d Carlton granted his permission after much consideration.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. But, as you proposed, you must mobilize the manpower and supplies on your own.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Luisen laughed. At that moment, the room became brighter, as if another candle had been lit\u2013his smile was too angelic.It was a smile worth seeing, Carlton thought.\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d Carlton wanted to know why Luisen smiled so brightly\u2013what the duke believed he could do.\u201cI\u2019ll have to talk to my advisors about the details. After all, I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t come here with a plan? What are you planning to do about the food shortage!?\u201d\u201cFor that\u2026there\u2019s something I need to check\u2026I\u2019ll tell you later, so don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t hide anything from you. Now then, I\u2019ll be taking my leave to visit the general,\u201d Luisen spoke with confidence and left the room.\u2018It\u2019s more nerve-wracking when he says not to worry.\u2019 Carlton stared at Luisen\u2019s back as he walked out. He wondered what strange thoughts were rolling around in his round and pretty head.As soon as Luisen left, Carlton\u2019s waiting men all entered the room, and they seemed to be covertly biding their time until they could deny knowledge of whatever had happened inside. Their faces reflected the many questions they wanted to ask; their gazes cautiously observed both the room and their boss. They were so curious, yet hesitant, to know what had happened after they had left the room.\u201cThe duke looks like he\u2019s going somewhere?\u201d A subordinate spoke up timidly. He shiftily glanced around, not wanting to light this powder keg atmosphere. Carlton\u2019s expression alone had alerted them that something extraordinary had happened.But Carlton was not interested in sating his men\u2019s curiosity. \u201cI\u2019m delaying the battlefield deportation. Do as the duke wants\u2026.and keep an eye on him, as well as the general and the knight commander. Let me know if there\u2019s anything suspicious, especially with the Duke of Anies.\u201d\u201cWill you be away?\u201d\u201cTraining grounds.\u201d Carlton had said all that he wanted to say and abruptly marched out. His subordinates were driven even more crazy with curiosity\u2013Carlton\u2019s grim expression had stimulated their imaginations. Suspicions of illicit acts rose within their minds.\u201cSo, do you think the captain and the duke did it? Or not?\u201d\u201cHe told us to let the duke do as he pleased. If they didn\u2019t, the boss wouldn\u2019t say that.\u201d\"\"\u201cOhhh\u2026.the two of them\u2026..\u201dThe servants who had arrived to clean the room also overheard Carlton\u2019s men\u2019s frantic whispers. From what the subordinates were saying, the servants began to believe that Carlton had indeed made such a request and that Luisen had complied. Their suspicion was reasonable, as Carlton seemed to bend for Luisen\u2019s favor after spending time alone together.Thus, a strange rumor began to spread, and neither Luisen nor Carlton had any idea.*****Luisen headed straight for the conference room. The other advisors had all already convened, thanks to the general\u2019s efforts and Luisen\u2019s orders.When Luisen walked in, all the advisors were greatly shocked. His sturdy leather coat was torn and covered in dirt, and his fine hair was a bird\u2019s nest. Blood had dried on his palms, and his noble knees could be seen through the rips in his trousers.\u201cMy duke!\u201d\u201cAre you okay? What kind of suffering have you endured in the lower villages, for goodness\u2019 sake?\u201dThey had heard about the riots from the general, but they had no knowledge of their lord\u2019s injuries and were stunned.For fear of hurting their lord, the advisors could not rush up to him and check on his injuries themselves. No matter how they disdained his abilities as a ruler, Luisen was like their child. Seeing him hurt pained their hearts.\u201cMy lord! Your hands are bleeding. Call the doctor first\u2026Doctor!\u00a02\u00a0Is he not here?! Huh?!\u201d\u201cFor now, let\u2019s apply some medicinal herbs. Oh lord\u2026are you feeling nauseous? Where else are you hurt? Ah! First, please sit down.\u201dFor Luisen, this was a familiar routine of overprotectiveness. The duchy\u2019s retainers tended to inadvertently shelter their lord from all harm. It had been so long since Luisen had others fuss over him like this\u2013he was at a loss.\u201cEveryone, please, calm down. Our lord can\u2019t speak over your din.\u201d The frenetic atmosphere calmed with just one order from the general. After silencing the chamber, the general looked meaningfully at Luisen. All eyes followed, and they waited for the young duke\u2019s orders.\u201cYou all know the situation, correct?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLuisen scrutinized his retainers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This was something I should have taken care of on my own. But, this is also on you all as well. It\u2019s common knowledge that I\u2019m an incompetent lord\u2026No matter how much you resent me, you can\u2019t abandon your work.\u201dThe crowns of the retainers\u2019 heads could be seen as they slumped down with the heavy weight of regret. How shameful it was to blatantly ignore the plight of the people in the lower villages and instead complain, \u2018I wish the lord would mature.\u2019 However, Luisen had apologized first, so the weight on the retainers\u2019 shoulders felt many times heavier.\u201cDon\u2019t reprimand the villagers for what happened today. The fault lies with you all and with me. Let\u2019s do our best to put the past behind us and get through this crisis.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll do that.\u201d\u201cSir Carlton has bestowed upon us permission to counter this dilemma. So, from now on, you\u2019ll prepare to distribute supplies to the lower village,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cReally? That man gave his permission?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLuisen nodded proudly. \u201cYou must not touch the food I have set aside for Sir Carlton and his men. We have to scrounge up something else on our own.\u201d\u201cBut to feed all the people, they will have to starve for a few more days until we can find some solution.\u201d\u201cMany are trapped within the confines of the castle. If the gates are opened and food is bought in from nearby areas, the problem will be easily resolved.\u201d\u201cSir Carlton will not open the gates. I\u2019ll solve the matter of the food source\u2013calculate how many days we can last with what\u2019s in the castle. And also count our human resources.\u201dThe ever-childish and untrustworthy lord seemed to have brokered a deal with that dreadful Carlton for his people. Everyone present was surprised and greatly impressed by the glimpse of leadership that shone in his poise.\u201cI\u2019ll wrack my brain for this. There shall be no waste.\u201d\u201cYes. Then\u2026 as for the manpower\u2026?\u201d\u201cWith all the servants and knights within the castle, we may be able to run some sort of operation, even though resources may be tight,\u201d Luisen responded.\u201cI\u2019ll reassemble the guards that secure the outskirts of the castle grounds. We can also utilize the soldiers who stayed behind after the army was disbanded.\u201dThe advisors skillfully continued the conversation after Luisen threw out a few suggestions. The long-time experience of those who had been running the estate could not be discounted. Pity for the villagers, as well as Luisen\u2019s dashing figure, were what spurred their drive.TL: Thanks for being patient this week!

    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018There\u2019s nothing more I can do here.\u2019 Luisen crossed his arms and observed the fervent conversation brewing between his retainers. Though he had been trying to sincerely follow along, the arguments had begun to give him a headache. \u2018I\u2019m sure the general will lead the efforts well.\u2019Luisen decided to leave matters to someone with far more leadership and administrative abilities than himself. As for the lord, he resolved to use this incident and further events to slowly learn about his territorial duties.The young duke looked towards the general, who nodded his head when their eyes met. The interaction was small and insignificant, but within the benevolent gaze and polite acknowledgement, a distinct pride for his ward could be felt. He looked like he\u2019d had a revelation where, in the time he hadn\u2019t seen him, Luisen had finally matured into an adult. Not a single word of praise was uttered, but Luisen recognized the implicit compliment.The general acknowledged Luisen\u2019s efforts and his attempt to become a better lord. For the first time, Luisen felt relief when he looked at his beleaguered closest advisor.\u2018That\u2019s good.\u2019 Luisen slipped out of the conference room with a spring in his step. Then, someone rushed after him.\u201cMy lord.\u201d It was the knight commander. The old knight\u2019s wrinkled eyes were moist and red. He resolutely kneeled in front of his young master. Luisen, embarrassed, tried to stop him, but the knight commander didn\u2019t even give him the chance to refuse his fervor.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord.\u201d\u201cHuh? For what?\u201d Luisen asked blankly. Why was he on his knees?\u201cI should have followed and protected you, my lord. After seeing how you\u2019ve suffered, I now see I was wrong. My stubbornness\u2013my pride\u2013has put my lord in jeopardy\u2026\u201d The old knight bowed his head guiltily. \u201cYou\u2019ve been injured like this\u2026.Really, you could have met some huge disaster. I have no right nor honor to face my lord nor his predecessor.\u201dThe knight commander seemed truly guilty. If Luisen\u2019s knights had followed, perhaps he and his servant would not have been abandoned in the village.He was well aware that Luisen had poor horseback riding skills and had little to no skill in martial defense. He knew that his lord would not have been able to keep up with those seasoned mercenaries. After realizing all this and still having done nothing, the commander was resentful of his own complacency.\"\"What if Carlton had not found Luisen? What if his lord had continued to be buffeted by the riotous crowd?It was dizzying and horrifying to even imagine the possibilities.\u201cPunish this unworthy servant, my lord. I must not be forgiven for putting my emotions before my duty as a knight.\u201d\u201cHonestly, what do you mean \u2018punishment.\u2019 It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cNo, you mustn\u2019t let this transgression slide. I\u2019m a wretch that doesn\u2019t deserve to be my lord\u2019s knight.\u201dLuisen felt lost while he listened to the knight commander\u2019s passionate self-blame. \u2018No, why to this extent\u2026.\u2019He crouched down in front of the man, wondering what he should do. He was embarrassed by this scene. \u201cI would have refused if you insisted on following me.\u201d\u201cEven still, I should not have accepted it without a fight. Not when it concerns my lord\u2019s safety\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat can you do? You dislike me\u2026and for a good reason. I\u2019m ignorant of issues that happen right underneath my nose.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not my lord\u2019s fault! The retainers should have more closely observed the situation and assisted you.\u201dLuisen shook his head. \u201cNo. Since I signed off on the proposition, I\u2019m at fault. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, my lord. Though the territory was scrambling for a while, these events happen as we go through life. Do you think there has never been such crises during the late duke\u2019s reign?\u201d The knight commander began to comfort Luisen, and the conversation seemed to oscillate between the two as they tried to comfort each other. As tiresome as the situation had been, Luisen knew how present he was in his knight\u2019s mind\u2013a silver lining to this catastrophe.\u00a01\u201cThose are wise words. Yes, people will make mistakes as they live.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know the depths of your loyalty? You gave me a magic item that you care for as much as your own life.\u201d Luisen revealed the bracelet given to him by the knight commander\u2013the very same accessory that guarded him against some attacks from the crowd aimed at his blind side. He carefully removed the bracelet and placed it back in the commander\u2019s hands.\u201cThanks to your care, I was able to get back to the castle safely. Thank you for lending me something so precious,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cMy lord\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t spare some consideration for your feelings.\u201dThe commander, more than anyone else, had stood by his principles and moral virtues. This upright but stubborn man had protected the territory even after he was abandoned by his masters, one through death and the other through negligence. Such fierce loyalty, which did not retreat in the face of death, deserved respect.Luisen didn\u2019t think he deserved the man\u2019s apology, as he had died a dog\u2019s death in the previous timeline.\u00a02\u2018Who would dare to punish whom?\u2019 Luisen thought. \u2018I ran away and he stayed.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019ve always done your duty. I\u2019m the one who should apologize.\u201d Luisen knew that no matter how many times he would say sorry, the deep guilt could not be conveyed.Though no one else could access that long lost memory, Luisen couldn\u2019t forgive himself, to stop mourning the staunchly loyal commander\u2019s death.Luisen silently took the commander\u2019s hands in his own. \u201cThank you. Always.\u201d\u201cMy lord\u2026.\u201dOn the other hand, the knight commander was surprised at Luisen\u2019s touch. Those hands used to be small and soft, like sprouting leaves blooming in early spring. Now, however, these hands had grown larger and were firmly supporting themselves.A knight who seeks punishment; the master who feels the need to apologize instead\u2013when did he become so reliable?Tears spilled from the corners of the knight\u2019s eyes, soaking the deep set wrinkles on his face. Each large droplet was as heavy as the years he had lived.\u201cI will never take my lord lightly again. I will trust and follow your orders faithfully,\u201d the knight commander vowed.\u2018That\u2019s..not it though. Why would he trust me? What is there to trust?\u2019 Luisen questioned his wisdom, but he wasn\u2019t so uncouth as to throw the older man\u2019s goodwill back in his face.\u00a03\u00a0Instead, in a dignified and elegant manner, Luisen finished comforting the old knight and sent him back to the conference room to fulfill his duties.\u2018I\u2019m thankful\u2026but they shouldn\u2019t trust me too much\u2026.I\u2019ll only lead them into trouble\u2026.\u2019Thanks to his knowledge of the future, Luisen had seemed intelligent for a while, but Luisen ws originally someone who didn\u2019t like to use his brain and was inattentive. He knew his unreliable self the best.He\u2019d have to fix their misconceptions sometime. Luisen grumbled and quickened his pace.*****There were several prisons in the duke\u2019s estate. Luisen had asked Carlton\u2019s men in advance where the villagers were being confined\u2013the basement dungeons. It was a prison for the criminals with clear charges, a place to isolate them from the others before trial.Generally, those caught in riots would be exiled from the territory. In some cases, fines or communal labor may replace a harsher sentence, depending on the lord\u2019s discretion.\"\"But, harming the lord or the Anies family would often result in the death penalty. For those who lived underneath the protection and mercy of their noble ruler, any physical retribution was a serious act of treason that threatened the stability of the system. No noble family would ever let such crime slide.The people captured during the day were hardly the ones who directly injured Luisen.But, their fates depended on the lord\u2019s perspective; whether or not he viewed them as those caught in the flow of anger or those who had participated in intentional harm against the ruling family. The Duke of Anies had the right to judge crimes committed on his territory.Carlton currently held the right to hold trial, but their fates still depended on Luisen\u2019s whim\u2013Carlton had given permission for Luisen to do as he pleased.Though stepping inside the duke\u2019s castle would usually be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the villagers, their visit was tainted by being confined in the basement dungeon. A distinct anxious atmosphere filled the prison. When Luisen climbed down the stairs, many entreaties were lobbed at the duke, who held the key to their life or death in his hands.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lord!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d never attack you, my lord, I swear!\u201dEach cry reverberated off the stone walls, creating a dizzying cacophony. Within the panicked cries, a familiar voice could be heard.\u201cMy lord! My lord! It\u2019s me! I\u2019m over here!\u201d\u201c\u2026Ruger?\u201dRuger was locked up in a cell which he shared with five or six other villagers.\u201cWhy are you there?\u201d Luisen said, surprised. He walked straight to the cell.Ruger molded his body to the iron bars and desperately called out to his master. \u201cMy lord. Oh, my lord. You\u2019ve finally come to save me, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were here? Why are you here anyway?\u201d\u201cI was captured earlier in the day, after Carlton had taken my lord away. I tried to follow behind, but I got caught up in these peasants\u2019 riot.\u201dNo wonder Luisen couldn\u2019t find his servant. Honestly, Ruger had reaped what he sowed, but the experience must have been quite traumatizing. His eyes were moist with tears, and Ruger\u2019s physical condition seemed quite poor.\u201cCome on out for now.\u201d Luisen motioned for the guard to open the door. Ruger flopped out of the cell with sloppy movements. He could not straighten his back properly, and his joints creaked like a rusty hinge.TL: Thank you guys for reading <3FootnotesThe original novel states that Luisen was quick to grab onto the horse\u2019s tail\u2013aka to seize something (in this case, to seize the good aspects of the catastrophe.) Idiom~\u00a0A dog\u2019s death = a grim/horrid death, not befitting a human. A death that defies human rights.\u00a0the original idiom is to throw ashes in the face\u2013aka to be ungrateful or rude in a heartwarming situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luisen looked inside the prison cell confining his servant. The people trapped in there were quite different from the other prisoners. They didn\u2019t beg Luisen for release and instead looked at him with chaotic eyes. Their repulsed gazes seemed to convey complete disregard for their lives, daring the young lord to do as he pleased.One could roughly guess the hardships Ruger had suffered while confined in a cell with those kinds of people.\u2018Maybe\u2026Was he purposefully jailed in such a situation\u2026?\u2019 Luisen thought.It would fit with Carlton\u2019s vindictiveness. Everyone was well aware of Ruger\u2019s condescension and derision for the low-born.Luisen knew that one day retribution would come for his loose mouth.\u00a01Honestly, he deserved some of it. Luisen hadn\u2019t known in the original timeline, but he was now privy to some of Ruger\u2019s despicable ingrained behavior. He was quite good to his master and the other nobles, but the low-born servants and Carlton\u2019s men would have desperately wished to just punch him in the back of the head. How ugly must he have seemed in their eyes.\u201cUgh, I\u2019m dying! My duke, those people are truly evil. Even though they knew I was the duke\u2019s servant\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sure you provoked them.\u201d\u201cAh! My lord! It\u2019s absolutely unfair!\u201d\u201cThen, why must you always talk in a way that raises others\u2019 ire?\u201d\u201cMe? What did I do wrong?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always like that. Just consider what happened at the village today. Did you truly need to provoke the villagers in that situation? It\u2019s like you\u2019re trying to create trouble.\u201d\u201cI would never! I wouldn\u2019t dare! Those scoundrels were rude to the duke first; I said what I needed to as your chief attendant.\u201d\u201cWhy did you wield your bow?\u201d\u201cYou knew how dangerous the situation was! I was the only one who could protect my lord in that situation! I had to do something. I\u2019ve only done my job\u2026how mean of you to side with those bastards\u2026\u201d Ruger cried, claiming injustice. His pitiful form loosened the sternness in Luisen\u2019s heart.\u201cMy duke is not to blame\u2013those bastards are bad people. They\u2019re pretending to be good little villagers, framing me and deceiving my lord.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHow dare they attack their lord! Please, execute them. They don\u2019t deserve life.\u201dWas Ruger originally this extreme? Luisen clicked his tongue. \u2018The death penalty\u2026\u2019At that thoughtless word, the dungeon became a quagmire of chaos again. Screaming and pleading, the cries of the prisoners made Luisen\u2019s ears throb.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Enough\u2026Please calm down. I won\u2019t execute you.\u201d\u201cMy duke! You must show your dignity through harsh sentences!\u201d\u201cEnough! I\u2019m not killing anyone. I\u2019m not in the position to recklessly do that. Helping me and the territory will be punishment enough.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Both Ruger and the villagers were greatly surprised. The villagers in particular had pleaded to escape death but still expected extreme corporal punishment or exile. The crime of attacking the lord was that serious.\u201cTheir punishment is to help my lord?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll be heading down to the village soon. Shouldn\u2019t we distribute food to the villagers as soon as possible?\u201d\u201c!!!!\u201dThe villagers collectively widened their eyes as Luisen spoke.\u201cYou mean\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve decided to reinstate the distribution of rations; the retainers are currently ironing out the details. The full large-scale operation will take much time, so I\u2019ll go down to the town first and distribute as much food as I can. To do this, I\u2019ll need your hands. Those who still have energy left within them, come with me.\u201dLuisen predicted that the advisors\u2019 conference wouldn\u2019t end until after sundown. Nothing could be done in the dark, so rationing would have to be properly implemented the next day.However, he couldn\u2019t stand to sit around on his hands; he wanted to feed his people and soothe their anxieties, even if it was just one hour earlier. Luisen judged that, although he wouldn\u2019t make a large difference, he could at least stabilize the situation and care for the people.No manpower in the castle could be spared, so he could instead make use of the most energetic prisoners.Ruger strongly opposed Luisen\u2019s plans. \u201cMy duke! Those scoundrels attacked me. Hitting his servant directly challenges the duke\u2019s authority\u2013what a filthy bunch!\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s fine. It seems, rather, like you\u2019re challenging my authority now?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t dare\u2026.\u201dLuisen\u2019s stern demeanor silenced Ruger\u2019s complaints. \u2018In the past, he used to passively listen to everything I said, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 Ruger thought.Since when did his master start drawing firm lines in the sand like this? Ruger couldn\u2019t hide his embarrassment as he quieted down.\u201cGo get treated for your wounds.\u201d Luisen turned his back on Ruger and ordered the guards to open the jail cell doors. \u201cNow, everyone move. Ah, unless you have no more strength left. Have you eaten anything?\u201d\u201cA while ago, some of the soldiers gave us some water and biscuits. They said they were following their boss\u2019 orders.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dHow surprising of Carlton. Luisen thought that perhaps the mercenary was more sensitive than he seemed.There were quite a few able-bodied men among the prisoners, whether through the power of the biscuits or through hope. Luisen chose five or six of them and brought them to the warehouses.A cart packed with a large cast-iron pot, firewood, hardened bread, and dried jerky had already been prepared. After running around fulfilling Carlton\u2019s errands, Luisen was better able to navigate the geography of the castle and the hidden stashes of supplies in the warehouses.In a way, he was able to prepare this much in such short notice thanks to Carlton\u2026though the lord had no intention of voicing such thoughts.The sun was gradually beginning to set by the time Luisen arrived back in the village. The usually bustling town was as quiet as death.\u201cLet\u2019s get settled before the sun sets.\u201d Luisen led his crew towards the largest square in town. All the shops surrounding the square were closed, but a curious crowd had still gathered.News had already spread during the day that the lord had been embroiled in the riots. As Luisen drew closer, the people retreated quickly. The tension in the air could be cut with a butter knife.\u201cWill this be alright?\u201d The knights who were following him had raised their blades in preparation for conflict. Though Luisen was scared inside, he resolutely raised his chin and attempted to show confidence.\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Let\u2019s just start here.\u201d Luisen divided the recently released villagers into two groups. One group was sent to gather the rest of the denizens and the other was left behind to help in his plan.He had the people arrange the firewood and create supports for the pot\u2013a large vessel usually used for feasts. The pot was enough to contain several dozen servings of soup.Immediately, water was drawn from the well; the bread and the beef jerky were torn into many small pieces. While hard bread and jerky were normally hard to chew, the foodstuffs turned mushy with the moisture. Eventually, they all combined to create a thin, boiling soup.Luisen had a small taste.The soup was created without stock or broth ingredients. Bread, water, and jerky; that was all. Yet, the saltiness from the jerky and the butter from the meat leaked out to create a passable flavor. This much was fit to eat.If the amount was insufficient, more water could be poured in. If the soup became too watery, more bread would be added. If it was too bland, beef jerky could substitute for seasoning. Too salty? They could once again add more water. As long as the fire burned, the soup could be boiled continuously\u2013forever, even.The food was rough and unappetizing; most wouldn\u2019t have given it a second glance. However, for a person who had starved for a long time, it was a godsend. Proper bread and meat would not digest well in a malnourished stomach and would cause health issues. Luisen knew this fact well: during his wandering, he had developed a great stomach ache after eating bread given by a kind-hearted madame.In his experience, it was better to consume watery soup to fill up the stomach and warm the body. Additionally, such soup could be quickly and easily made in large quantities with a small amount of ingredients.\u201cMy lord, let us distribute the food.\u201d The attending villagers tried to take the ladle from Luisen\u2019s hands. They couldn\u2019t allow the lord to serve them in good conscience.However, Luisen declined. It was important to follow through with his convictions and to personally feed his citizens. \u201cNo, that\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll handle this. You all should just make sure to secure the surroundings.\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s decisive words, the villagers nodded. The knights stood on guard, their eyes flashing with spirit.\u201cThis way! The lord is personally handing out soup!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something to eat here! Bring a bowl or a cup! Come over!\u201dAs ordered, the villagers scattered here and there while shouting. People gathered at the edges like rain clouds on the horizon as the smell of savory soup spread throughout the village square. However, no one was willing to approach any closer.They were fearful of the untouchable lord standing with a ladle, situated between extraordinary knights. They couldn\u2019t bear to turn their eyes and noses away from the food, but the memory of the earlier riots froze their feet.\u2018This is going to take all night.\u2019Luisen looked around and pointed at the youngest-looking boy among the crowd. \u201cYou over there. Come here.\u201d\u201cM-me?\u201d The boy, who was wiping his drool with his grubby hands, startled.\u201cCome quickly,\u201d Luisen gently urged. The boy approached him with a nervous heart. He couldn\u2019t defy the lord\u2019s request, but his pulse could not hide his fear.TL: Ruger really is a product of his upbringing\u2026..FootnotesThe original novel said \u201crunning around with your mouth open\u201d which translates to having a loose mouth. I chose to substitute it here, but I may consider leaving some of these sayings in later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Though the boy looked up at him suspiciously, he accepted it cautiously. \u201cEat this and wait. The castle will distribute rations tomorrow, so tell the grown-ups, okay?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes widened in shock.\u201cThat\u2019s right, things like flour and firewood\u2026But do you all have the energy to make bread?\u201dIt would have been better to bake and distribute the food over distributing food ingredients, but, regrettably, the castle had too little manpower.Could the starving properly cook and prepare their dishes? Hunger often claimed reason. It would be a big problem if in their hunger-driven craze the people simply ate the raw ingredients; thus, Luisen went down to the village to boil soup for them.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit difficult right now, but I\u2019ll even return what we requisitioned to the castle, eventually,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cReally? When? My lord, do you have money? Actually, are you sure you\u2019re our lord? I\u2019ve never seen you before.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really the lord of this land. Of course you\u2019ve never seen me before. When would you get a chance to see someone like me?\u201d Luisen answered each and every rambling question, voice gentle compared to his aloof face.The boy began to speak more courageously, \u201cBut, are we ruined because we lost the war?\u201d\u201cRuined? Do you think the Anies duchy would be ruined over something like that? Once the gates open, it\u2019ll all somehow work out.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t bluffing; he had spoken the truth. Now that the locusts had been exterminated, the plentiful valleys of wheat had been harvested and gathered in many warehouses across the territory. It\u2019s just that those bushels couldn\u2019t be transported inside the estate gates. The duchy\u2019s economic situation was not dire.Though the civil war had left holes in the administration and personnel affairs, Luisen predicted it would quickly stabilize after those ministers held captive were released in return for the duchy\u2019s gold, jewels, and bonds.Come to think of it, Carlton was the only major problem left. Why wouldn\u2019t he just unlock the gates?However, it was hard to bad-mouth the mercenary. After all, it was Luisen himself who instilled the fear of the first prince\u2019s nobles within him.\u201cAnyway, don\u2019t worry about it. I promise to you, with the duke\u2019s honor, that it will be alright. And I\u2019m so sorry to have made you all suffer.\u201dThe boy\u2019s ears turned red at the unexpected apology. He never could have imagined that such a sky-high, untouchable lord would apologize directly to an ordinary villager like him. And above all, at that moment, Luisen\u2019s face was so pretty.\u201cUm, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cGo and eat; you must be hungry.\u201d Luisen patted the boy on the shoulder. The boy began to walk away in a daze, looked back at the lord, and began to hurriedly slurp the soup. Though it was watery and contained no spices, the taste was strangely good. Above all, it warmed up his icy body.The villagers, after watching the boy\u2019s interaction with Luisen, slowly approached. They carefully asked, \u201cIs this really okay for us to eat?\u201d\u201cEat, eat.\u201d\u201cDid you just say that rationing will resume soon?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. We\u2019re aiming to restore food distribution as quickly as possible. Everyone is discussing the details in the castle.\u201d Luisen continued to answer every question while scooping soup. He answered calmly while keeping in mind the possible consequences of his words. He wouldn\u2019t forget the promises and apologies he made to the young boy.As a result, each response was quite slow, but the people could see his words were authentic and thoughtful. Luisen\u2019s heartfelt feelings and promises were delivered with every bowl of warm soup.\"\"Had another person distributed the soup, the promises wouldn\u2019t have felt so genuine. The words were so effective because Luisen, the Duke of Anies, was standing there, holding a ladle.Though Luisen had long been known as a scoundrel who neglected the territory, the people did not easily forget their regard for the Anies household as a whole. Watching Luisen\u2019s actions, the villagers were reminded of their long-forgotten faith in their noble of the golden fields.\u2018That\u2019s right\u2026if the duke is doing this much\u2026\u2019\u2018He\u2019s our lord\u2026we must trust in him\u2026.\u2019\u2018Even though he\u2019s been unreliable, we have no choice but to wait and believe\u2026\u2019Those who at first stared at Luisen with distrust and resentment slowly began to soften their stance.The people of the duchy were originally as generous and laid back as the territory\u2019s mild climate. While the wartime fears ruined their easy-going attitude, the original personality did not disappear. When their lord personally came to the village to comfort the people, the rough villagers began to return to their gentle, sheep-like disposition.Even though the sun had set and night had flooded the square, more and more people began to crowd around. The arm holding the ladle felt numb, and Luisen\u2019s throat was sore. Still, Luisen did not budge from his spot.\u201cDraw more water and pour it into the pot. Tear more bread into the soup. And you guys, help those that have mobility impairments.\u201d Luisen barked out orders as he continued to distribute the food. Knowing how miraculous one bowl of warm soup could be, he couldn\u2019t afford to grow tired.****Soon one could see the bottom of the pot that had originally held what seemed to be an endless amount of soup. Torches had to be lit, as no lingering rays of sunlight were left in the sky. Moving at night wasn\u2019t good for either Luisen or the villagers.\u201cWe should return to the castle now. Staying longer than this would be dangerous.\u201d\u201cBut there are still people left\u2026\u201d Luisen looked at those gathered. Would it be better to continue or to return? As he was agonizing over the decision, he spotted Carlton standing alone among the crowd. No matter how many people flooded the area, it wasn\u2019t hard to recognize him, as he stood a full head over the others.Since when had he been standing there?As soon as their eyes met, Carlton drew closer.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call to me after you arrived?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cIt was hard to squeeze through. It\u2019s late, so let\u2019s call it a day.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Okay.\u201d Luisen had no choice but to listen to Carlton\u2019s words.As he began to leave, the villagers chimed in.\u201cLet us handle the cleanup!\u201d\u201cMy lord, you can\u2019t bear that weight. We\u2019ll carry that.\u201dLuisen left the villagers to their own devices. During that time, Carlton simply stared at him. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019 Luisen thought.Luisen, feeling burdened by his insistent gaze, asked, \u201cWhy do you look at me like that?\u201d\u201cAh, no\u2026.\u201d Carlton bit back what he had originally intended to blurt out. \u201cHow did you find the resolve to return to the village after what happened during the day?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you believed in for you to act so recklessly.\u201d Carlton stepped closer. Luisen felt nervous as the giant man\u2019s body approached him. Carlton\u2019s uniquely sharp gaze pierced through him. \u201cSeeing you now, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re fearless.\u201d\u201cAre you mocking me?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cNothing like that. I\u2019m just fascinated.\u201d\u201cWith me?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d go to this extent,\u201d Carlton explained.\u201cI couldn\u2019t just sit around and do nothing\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d be participating in the meetings in the castle, and instead you came here\u2026out of nowhere. I was quite shocked.\u201d\u201c\u2026I had to check on my citizens\u2026Besides, this time I came with the knights. I\u2019ve been keeping safety in mind.\u201d\u201cYeah, well, if you didn\u2019t bring the knights, I would have thought you\u2019d actually gone mad.\u201dLuisen looked up at Carlton. Did the mercenary perhaps\u2026follow him because he was worried? \u2018No way\u2026It\u2019s Carlton\u2026.there\u2019s no way he\u2019s worried me.\u2019 Luisen threw those suspicions far, far away.\u201cI was thinking that things were too orderly. Maybe it was because you were watching?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cI didn\u2019t help any. I\u2019ve just been watching.\u201d\u2018Did I say anything about helping? Why is he so serious about it anyway?\u2019 Luisen inwardly vented his annoyed feelings.Carlton continued, \u201cNext time you decide to do something unexpected, let me know in advance.\u201d\u201cWould something like this happen again?\u201d Luisen said. However, Carlton didn\u2019t seem to believe his slight denials. He looked at Luisen as if he were an alcoholic who had vowed to quit drinking.\u201cLet\u2019s return together. If the duke gets hurt, I\u2019ll be held responsible,\u201d Carlton said.Luisen wondered about his abrupt change in heart but felt it was strange to insist upon returning separately.*****The advisors\u2019 meeting was almost over by the time Luisen returned to the castle. The people of the castle were bustling, waiting for the sun to rise and their duties to resume. Each minister scattered to deal with their respective departments. Since Luisen had no further business, he returned to his room at the urging of his advisors.He washed up, changed his clothes, and laid in bed, thinking about the roller-coaster of a day he had. \u2018From leaving for war, falling behind, getting involved in riots, Carlton and I\u2026..we almost\u2026if Carlton hadn\u2019t stopped me\u2026.\u2019Luisen quickly jumped out of bed.He couldn\u2019t fall asleep because he kept thinking about useless things. His arms and legs were heavy; his whole body throbbed, but his mind was wide awake.Sitting still in bed reminded him of the people he saw during the day.\u2018Will the villagers make it through the night okay?\u2019They had something to eat today, but tomorrow? The day after? When would Carlton open the gates?Thinking about this and that, anxiety began to weigh down upon Luisen\u2019s shoulders.\u2018I can\u2019t do this.\u2019 Luisen got out of bed and threw off his pajamas messily. \u2018You have to move your body at times like this.\u2019 He quickly put on his outdoor clothes and left the room.The castle was quiet at night. Only the occasional torches held by the patrolling soldiers were visible. In the dead of night, it was too burdensome to call on either Ruger or the soldiers, so Luisen quietly headed to the barn alone.The duchy was large, and people did not often travel to the less plodded areas, full of unknown grasses and trees. In particular, the area near the barn was incredibly dense because it was not managed by the groundskeeper.Luisen dragged a shovel by his side and wandered among the weeds, searching for something. He couldn\u2019t see well because of the lack of light.\u2018I think it\u2019s around here somewhere.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuisen was searching for a poisonous plant known as the \u2018buried old hag.\u2019The buried old hag was seemingly an ordinary weed except for its roots, which looked like demonic spirits much like the legendary mandragoras. The fist-sized roots were deeply wrinkled, like the face of a nasty old hag, and the people had named it as such. Normally this plant was not eaten because it caused severe diarrhea and stomach pain.In the poorer neighborhoods, the people fed horses and pigs with this plant, but in the rich and prosperous south, even the poorest of livestock did not chew on it.Though it was currently treated as poison, the root became an indispensable foodsource in the following years.After the civil war, during the long famine, the people searched far and wide for anything edible. Some even peeled the bark off of trees.Others began to take away the buried old hags from the pigs, grilling them with the desire to die with a full belly. However, after a taste, the buried old hag tasted much better than previously thought. The people felt full and didn\u2019t die! They didn\u2019t develop diarrhea or stomach aches either.As the rumors spread far and wide, the people discovered after some research that the poison generated by the plant was caused by light. If they peeled and cooked the old hag right after digging it up from the ground, it was safe to eat!The buried old hag grew well in various places and was able to be harvested in far larger quantities than wheat and other crops. It needed less manpower as well.For a starving kingdom, the hag was a singular ray of positive news. Nationwide, the people were encouraged to grow and eat the old hags. The king himself demonstrated the proper cooking methods.After such efforts, the buried old hag became an indispensable ingredient in the lives of the common folk.What? They call it the buried old hag? The devil\u2019s food? It should rather be respectfully called the \u2018buried elder!\u2019Later, the people would begin to revere the plant and call it their precious elder.Luisen also greatly appreciated this plant.Especially when he would help with farming, an old woman would serve a heaping bowl of well-stewed \u2018old hags.\u2019 The scrumptious taste could drive one to weather any hard labor.Luisen rummaged through the grass, recalling the rare fond sentiments of the past. Since he had often dug this plant up, he could easily identify it.\u2018I got it!\u2019 With a shovel, Luisen dug underneath the plant\u2019s stem and lifted gently. Then, out of the soil emerged the hideous roots bearing a witch\u2019s face.Just the sight of it whetted Luisen\u2019s appetite. How could something so dreadful in appearance look so tasty? Strangely enough, the uglier the root, the tastier it was. Thinking of the unique sweetness of the slightly dry and soft flesh, Luisen released a bubble of laughter.These old hags could contribute greatly to the distribution of rations to the villagers in the future. There was nothing better to replace the lack of foodstuffs.Originally, he was only going to dig up a few roots to show to the general, but Luisen soon changed his mind as he saw all the old hags in the ground. It was just the right time for a late-night snack. His stomach felt hollow; his mouth was bored.\u2018I should just harvest a few more and grill them.\u2019 Luisen glanced around. \u2018Good, there\u2019s no one around\u2026although I doubt people would begrudge me for a late-night snack.\u2019Of course, no one would scold this behavior, but he truly wanted to save some face.As Luisen\u2019s head was filled with thoughts of snacks, Carlton, who was hidden among the dark shadows of the thicket, was bewildered and dumbfounded.While Luisen crept out of his room, Carlton, too, tossed and turned, unable to sleep.He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the lord distributing the soup and comforting his citizens. In his mind\u2019s eye, Luisen had been alone\u00a0except for a few knights, surrounded by the warming hearts of the villagers, completely ignorant of danger!It was an idyllic and picturesque scene only found in fairytales. And, he couldn\u2019t remove the mental image of that gentle duke; strangely, his insides felt as if they were beset by butterflies at the image.After failing to sleep, Carlton eventually left his room as well. While walking in the night air, he continued to recall Luisen\u2019s face.A noble who embodied his aloof yet elegant expression. A fragile young man, whose face contained the anxiety of a kid abandoned. An ideal leader who knows how to care for the people, who unconventionally throws his body and soul away for their safety.Carlton pondered which one would be the closest to Luisen\u2019s essence. But, for the life of him, he couldn\u2019t decide on any single description. The more he contemplated, the more complicated his thoughts became.Luisen was very strange.If he was as clever as he seemed, how could he indulge in the foolishness that brought war to his estate? If he was selfish, how could he sacrifice his own body to a mercenary? If he was a meticulous man, he wouldn\u2019t be reckless enough to throw himself away either. But, if he loved his estate, how could one explain his ignorance?Words, actions, his past behavior\u2026None of it fit into the current context.Today alone he embodied that selfish hypocritical aristocrat, that clumsy and vulnerable young man, and that devoted leader. His personality fluctuated, as if he became someone else from moment to moment.Carlton wondered if he contained many personalities\u2026and entertained other such vivid imaginations.\u2018Why had he knelt there\u2026.so disturbingly?\u2019 Carlton wouldn\u2019t have agonized this much about the young lord if Luisen hadn\u2019t kneeled at his vulgar joke, if Luisen hadn\u2019t approached him with such trembling fingers.His eyes and pale cheeks, flushed with nervousness, were pitifully beautiful. He hated to admit it, but the thought of Luisen, seated between his legs, made heat plunge from the top of his head to below his waist.\"\"Then, during Carlton\u2019s agonizing night walk, Luisen suddenly appeared out of the darkness in front of him, as if the lord had sprung from his own mind. Looking closely, it seemed as if Luisen was sneaking off to someplace with a shovel.\u2018Again\u2026.what is he up to\u2026.?\u2019 A combination of curiosity and anxiety had Carlton following the lord, quietly tracing his footsteps. Finally, Luisen stood in an open space near the barn and began digging.\u2018What could you be searching for at this hour? Some hidden treasure?\u2019Considering Luisen\u2019s confident boast that he would take care of both the food and manpower shortage, Carlton thought he might uncover at least one hidden secret. The mercenary stood and watched quietly.But, contrary to his expectations, what Luisen dug up was nothing more than a root, about the size of a fist and shaped like a human head. The blurry moonlight only dimly lit the area, but Carlton recognized it with just a glance. It was the buried old hag, a famous poisonous weed.Hehehe.Luisen\u2019s insidious giggle resonated throughout the field. His greedy expression reflected in the moonlight looked as if it was tinged with madness.The lord\u2019s odd behavior didn\u2019t end there. Luisen collected dry grass, started a fire, and threw the washed poisonous plants into the flames. He squatted in front of the makeshift bonfire and cautiously rolled the old hag around with a long stick. The scene seemed like some kind of ritual.\u2018What kind of outrageousness is this?\u2019 Carlton couldn\u2019t readily intervene in such an odd, bizarre scene. A lord who secretly digs up poisonous grass in the dead of night while laughing maniacally\u2026It wouldn\u2019t have been surprising if Luisen turned out to be a devil worshipper.If, after a while, suspicious black smoke rose from the flames, Carlton would have immediately fled to a temple to file charges. Fortunately, however, nothing mystical emerged. Luisen took a root out of the fire and took a bite without even peeling its skin.\u2018Why is he eating that?!\u2019 Unable to stand by calmly any longer, Carlton leaped in front of the lord. \u201cWhat have you eaten now?!\u201dCarlton grabbed Luisen by the chin and forced him to spit out the buried old hag.\u201cTha\u2013mmph. Mmph!!\u201d Luisen\u2019s resistance was as weak and meaningless as a dragonfly\u2019s wings against human hands. After confirming the lord had spat everything out, Carlton released Luisen\u2019s jaw. Luisen simply stared at him.\u201cWhat kind of tomfoolery is this?\u201d Normally people wouldn\u2019t touch dogs when they eat. Why on earth would Carlton pop out of nowhere to interfere with his meal? \u2018Does he truly want to bully me like this?\u2019\u201cMy duke, it seems that I have saved your life once again,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cSave me? Because of you, perfectly edible food has been wasted!\u201dThe carefully grilled old hag had been crushed into the ground and was no longer fit to eat. Luisen\u2019s brows wrinkled. \u2018What a waste. I don\u2019t suppose I can just pick it up and eat it, right?\u2019\u201cFood?\u201d Carlton was dumbfounded. The lord had planned to eat this poisonous plant for a late night snack?In Carlton\u2019s hometown, the buried old hag was often used to supplement horse feed. Every year, there would be a bizarre sight: the old hag heads piled high like a mountain in the stable. Not many approached the grim scene, but every year, several children always collapsed after a curious taste.A nobleman of Luisen\u2019s stature would be in no danger of death\u2013especially with the care of his personal doctors\u2013but he would have suffered greatly.\u201cMy lord, do you even recognize what you just tried to eat?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This is the \u2018buried old hag,\u2019 isn\u2019t it?\u201d Luisen said.\u201cYou know? And still you want to eat it\u2026.? Is this some form of self-harm?\u201d\u201cSelf-harm? Why would I do that?\u201d Luisen realized that Carlton was operating under some sort of misunderstanding. \u201cYou must have misunderstood something. A freshly harvested old hag is not poisonous at all. I came here to dig these up with the intention to bring them to the general\u2019s attention tomorrow, to consider if they can be used as a replacement for wheat.\u201d\u201cThen why were you trying to eat one?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard to harvest them; I should at least have a taste!\u201dAt the sight of Luisen talking about the old hag as if it were some ordinary food, like bread or fruit, Carlton was dumbfounded.\u201cThe poison begins to develop in the plant as soon as it is exposed to sunlight. So, the sooner you grill the old hag, the better,\u201d Luisen added.\u201cHow does the duke know that? Are you sure?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure. I\u2019ve tried them in the past.\u201dIn the future, research would support Luisen\u2019s claims. However, for the time being, Luisen had nothing but his own words and experiences to rely on.Carlton was not easily convinced. \u201cWhen? Why would the duke eat something like this? Don\u2019t say that the south has differing tastes. I know that the people\u2019s sentiment towards this plant is the same here.\u201d\u201cHuh? Ah\u2026..It was a long time ago.\u201d Luisen had no choice but to be evasive. \u201cOnce upon a time, when I was young, I ate a lot of old hags in secret.\u201dHow would Carlton know to doubt Luisen\u2019s childhood experiences, anyway? It was the perfect excuse.Luisen continued to insist, \u201cI ate alone, so many others don\u2019t know what I know. I no longer harvested them after I became an adult, but I suddenly remembered some bygone memories. The buried old hag is safe, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026..You\u2019ve eaten a lot of these?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. To the point where If I didn\u2019t eat the root, it meant that none were available.\u201d Luisen nodded as he remembered the past. When he could find no buried old hags, he almost starved to death. It was a cold and rough winter in the northwestern part of the kingdom; too cold to dig for roots. If the one-armed pilgrim had not found him, Luisen would have died.\u201cThere were times when I wished I could eat this so that my stomach would feel full.\u201d With the one-armed pilgrim, he did not starve, but he also could not afford to eat his fill either. Cold and hunger\u2026such were the fate of wanderers.Luisen\u2019s eyes briefly dimmed as his mind lost itself in memories.Carlton\u2019s eyes shook slightly. \u2018He\u2026ate a lot\u2026of these? But why?\u2019For Carlton, the buried old hag was used mostly as fodder for cows and pigs. In the south, better feed was given to the pigs than that\u2013only the pitiful would lay their tongues on a hag.How could Luisen, a king of these golden wheat fields, eat the grass that even the lowest of commoners would not eat?\u201cIt may seem a little disgusting on the surface, but beneath the insides are sweet and delicious when cooked well. Soft, digestible, and nutritious. If you boil soup with this\u2026..\u201d Luisen diligently explained how the buried old hag could be turned into a proper dish.This fervor made Carlton even more confused. \u2018Listening to what he\u2019s saying, it really does seem like he\u2019s eaten a lot of them\u2026.\u2019 No performance could replicate that sincerity. \u2018But why? Everything in these rich lands is yours, isn\u2019t it?\u2019Why?How?Did no one in the duchy feed the duke\u2026.?A hypothesis, like a lightning bolt, struck Carlton\u2019s head.What if Luisen grew up neglected or abused by the retainers?In one\u2019s lands, a lord is an absolute existence. The retainers swore allegiance, as they might to a king, and obeyed every order. The hierarchy between the lord and his vassals was guaranteed by law, absolute immutability. However, things in the world did not always go as they should.Sometimes there would be fierce power struggles over the management of the estate\u2013a political battle between the lord and his advisors. In particular, the younger and more malleable the lord may be, the stronger the vassals were.And if the lord was young and had no close relative to look after him?He would have valued bloodline but nothing else to his name, no more than a scarecrow. In fortunate cases, neglect was the extent of the crime; in serious cases, the vassals would unite and abuse the young lord. This story may not be common, but they were an occasional occurrence.\u2018They said the duke became a lord at the age of six. He was raised by his advisors.\u2019\u00a0 No matter how brilliant and important the duke of Anies may have been, he would have just been a six year old child. It would have been easy for seasoned advisors to take control of the castle and ostracize Luisen.Young Luisen left to his own devices in a gigantic castle. He must have been hungry and struggled to search for food. Then, when he saw a pig eating, he must have thought the buried old hag was edible.Perhaps that\u2019s why the duke of Anies knew the poisonous plant so intimately.\u2018Yeah. That\u2019s plausible\u2026..No, there\u2019s no other possible explanation.\u2019If Luisen had received proper care, he would have been eating all sorts of delicacies instead of scrounging for pig feed. Unless Luisen truly had bizarre taste buds and preferred to harvest his own meals from the dirt.No, even if Luisen had this habit, loyal advisors would not have allowed him to eat a known poisonous plant. So, an abused\u2013or at least neglected\u2013childhood could be the only rational reason.\u2018Unbelievable.\u2019 A wave of dizziness washed over Carlton. The lord who at first seemed to have received the best of care, growing up wearing only the finest clothes\u2026.he hid such a poor childhood under that elegant noble face. Carlton could have never imagined such a twist.\u2018No, wait. This is no time for wild guesses.\u2019 Carlton tried to maintain a rational and calm attitude.Ignorant of Carlton\u2019s inner turmoil, Luisen looked anxiously at the buried old hags in the bonfire. \u2018What a waste! They\u2019re all going to burn!\u2019Luisen carefully spoke, \u201cExcuse me, if the misunderstanding has been cleared, I\u2019m going to take these out. If we leave them, they\u2019ll all become burnt.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.Do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Luisen quickly pulled the old hags out of the bonfire. They were a bit charred but not inedible\u2013in Luisen\u2019s eyes, at least.Luisen looked up at Carlton; he held out a buried old hag to the mercenary. \u201cWould you like to eat one?\u201d\u201cNo. Definitely not,\u201d Carlton said with an intense and serious expression.\u201cAh, okay\u2026.\u201d Luisen pulled back his outstretched hand awkwardly. He then peeled the root, blowing on his fingers periodically. Soon, the white flesh was revealed; the delicious scent unique to the old hag stimulated his appetite.\u2018Let\u2019s just eat comfortably\u2026I\u2019ve already ruined my reputation anyway.\u2019 He had already kneeled and crawled between someone\u2019s legs\u2026what could be worse?Luisen sat on the floor and began to eat. Carlton just stood there and looked at him as he consumed the plant so happily.In Carlton\u2019s eyes, the old hag was about as pleasant as a burnt witch; seeing Luisen so happy with it made his head throb. \u2018Ha\u2026.He\u2019s really\u2026..eating that thing?\u2019Luisen flinched and lowered his eyes when Carlton\u2019s gaze became too intense.\u2018Seeing him like this\u2026\u2019 Carlton thought over their previous interactions. Perhaps Luisen avoided his gaze out of fear rather than condescension for the low born.\u2018How was this guy raised for him to end up with such low self-esteem?\u2019Was his psychological state so damaged that he would believe nonsensical jokes? Be driven to crawl on his knees for another man? Luisen\u2019s behavior was certainly not normal.Carlton was not so soft as to feel pity over the duke\u2019s difficult childhood; he was objectively a bastard.However, Carlton\u2019s conscience was, very slightly, pricked. Perhaps Luisen\u2019s actions, which he had dismissed as strange and suspicious, were the actions of a person struggling to overcome abuse.He felt like he\u2019d kicked over a child trying to drag along baggage larger than his own body.Bastards will screw over someone who\u2019s on par with them or better, but trash will pick on the weak. Right now, Carlton felt like trash. Some may think there\u2019s no difference between the two, but to Carlton, there was a huge difference.\u201cHmmm\u2026This one\u2019s too burnt\u2026There\u2019s not much to eat here.\u201d Luisen smacked his lips with regret. He picked up the burnt roots one by one, face somber and reverent like a king mourning a cherished servant. He looked at the root he had dropped earlier due to Carlton\u2019s interference. \u2018That one\u2019s cooked just right\u2026and it\u2019s just rolling around in the grass now.\u2019Carlton\u2019s keen eyes didn\u2019t miss Luisen\u2019s line of sight. \u2018There\u2019s a vast field of poisonous roots. Why fixate on that one?\u2019Carlton couldn\u2019t empathize with Luisen, but on the other hand, he wondered what events led to this moment. He must have endured a time where he was denied even poisonous plants. Carlton felt annoyed for an unknown reason.\u201cI can harvest some more. Will one more suffice?\u201d Carlton picked up the shovel that Luisen had thrown.Puzzled, the young duke replied, \u201cUm\u2026.Ah, I\u2019d like to dig up three more.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Carlton scanned the open grounds and deftly dug up the roots. Even in shoveling, his form was excellent. The freshly harvested roots were quickly shoved into a sack.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Why would you do that?\u201d\u201cDo you have complaints about my assistance?\u201d\u2018It\u2019s not that I\u2019m complaining\u2026I\u2019m just nervous.\u2019 Luisen hesitated.Carlton heaved a deep sigh. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d The mercenary was far from a patient man, and he took the lead at his own discretion.\u2018What\u2019s he doing, honestly?\u2019 Luisen felt uncomfortable with Carlton\u2019s mysterious behavior and gaze. Still, the lord followed in the mercenary\u2019s footsteps while observing his face. The moon cast a soft light over his manly but agitated features. \u2018What\u2019s wrong with him? Is he crazy?\u2019Luisen couldn\u2019t understand Carlton\u2019s ever-changing mindset, nor could he understand why Carlton was bothering to help him. Luisen was a tactful man\u2013a quick-witted man as well.He had known that Carlton was operating under some huge misunderstanding. He\u2019d been angry enough to throw down the buried old hag at one moment, and then suddenly helped him harvest three more in another moment. However, he had no idea what that misunderstanding could be.****\"\"The next day, the duchy was spurred into motion as soon as the sun rose. All the servants were mobilized; warehouse doors were opened, and carts were loaded with a bounty of supplies for the village.Most of the servants were not allowed to leave the castle\u2019s domain. Despite the increased workload, no one complained due to the dire situation. Many had family, friends, or even lovers that lived in the lower village, so they worked as if it were their own crisis.Luisen had stayed awake all night. After hearing the bustle, he had finally realized morning had come. Yesterday, he had harvested some buried old hags and brought them to the general for consultation; afterwards, he double-checked the ledgers. \u2018I never thought in my life I\u2019d spend the whole night reading books.\u2019Luisen stood up, pressing his fingers down over his stiff eyes. He had an appointment with his advisors over breakfast. Under Ruger\u2019s steady assistance, he prepared himself and left the roomThe duchy housed a large banquet hall. Unlike the restaurant-like dining hall used for dinners, the banquet hall was a cozy and comfortable space made for more casual gatheringsWhen Luisen arrived, all the seated advisors stood. Every single face was haggard and fatigued. \u201cYou\u2019ve arrived, my lord.\u201d\u201cDid you lose sleep last night? You have bags under your eyes.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026Just a bit,\u201d Luisen replied.\u201cOh no\u2026Please take breaks as we continue.As Luisen took his seat, the meal began with no further fanfare as the attendants brought in the food.As the south was an area rich with food, the duke\u2019s table would usually sample from various different cuisines, plates filling every inch of space. But this time, the table only had just enough to eat.It was a table comparable to a farmer\u2019s, but Luisen, who had fallen in love with any and all food due to his previous nomadic life, enjoyed his meal. In the past, he would have complained heavily; the advisors all admired his new maturity.Over the meal, the retainers informed Luisen of what they had decided on during yesterday\u2019s meeting. The structure of the report was formal, and Luisen did not understand every word, but still, they felt respect for the lord who attempted to digest all of the information.As the conversation moved onto the heavier side of the operation, the treasurer lightly changed the subject. \u201cBy the way, did my lord go down to the village last night and directly hand out soup? That was quite effective.\u201dThe knight commander added, \u201cI also heard from the knights that returned from the village. In contrast to what other knights may have observed during the day, the village had a calmer atmosphere than they expected.\u201cThe story of the lord handing out soup himself had endeared the people to the castle. So, at sunrise, many people gathered at the gate to help with the distribution. Thanks to your help, everything has been made much easier.\u201d The regard the advisors held for Luisen had changed greatly from just a few days ago. They were impressed with his boldness, braving the village after being caught in the riot.They thought the more difficult a situation the duchy had been plunged in, the more he showed how worthy he was of his title: guardian of the golden fields.\u201cTruly amazing. You saw such viciousness yesterday\u2026If it had been me, I may have been too scared to step outside the castle.\u201dLuisen\u2019s ears flushed red at all the praise pouring in for him.He was so embarrassed, he could die. The atmosphere felt similar to when he was seven years old\u2013a time when even just walking was considered brave and praises followed his every small act. \u201cI\u2019m glad it helped.\u201dDespite his misgivings, Luisen continued to receive praise for his maturity.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s too early to relax. If we run out of food right now, we\u2019ll have another riot on our hands,\u201d the captain of the security responded\u2013a salient point.\u201cAbout that. I\u2019d like to show you all something.\u201d Luisen gestured, and a servant brought in a large plate piled with buried old hags. These were the roots that Carlton had harvested yesterday.As the roots were peeled, it looked completely different from its original horrid appearance. The yellow flesh inside was appetizing and smelled savory.\u201cWhat kind of crop is this? I\u2019ve never seen it before. It smells terrific,\u201d the gluttonous and food-savvy treasurer asked. His hands twitched to reach towards the roots, tempted by the smell.First impressions had gone over well. \u2018I\u2019m glad I peeled the skin. People definitely can\u2019t ignore visuals,\u2019 Luisen thought. \u201cThis is the buried old hag\u2013the very same one we all should know.\u201d\u201cThis?\u201d asked the treasurer, eyes wide open. His grasping hands stilled and shrank back.\u201cShould it not look more like\u2026.a human head?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been grilled in the fire and peeled. Like this, the old hag looks like a completely different plant, right?\u201d\u201cYes. But\u2026Why would you\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not going to feed that to the people instead of wheat, right? It\u2019s not such a potent poison that it would kill most straight away, but it would be a terrible catastrophe to feed it to them now under their current circumstances.\u201d\u201cNo, listen to me.\u201d Luisen gestured to Ruger to hand him a book. The book itself was large, about a hand\u2019s width thick. The title on the cover said, \u2018The Chronicles of the Duke of Anies,\u2019 a record of all the large and small events in his family.\u201cIsn\u2019t that an old record?\u201d someone asked.\u201cYes, this was written by my grandfather\u2019s father. If you look here, there\u2019s a story in which he ate a buried old hag when the cold front hit.\u201d\u201cHe ate that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That winter must have been particularly harsh. If you look here, the text refers back to the 56th crop diagram.\u201d Luisen beckoned everyone\u2019s attention to the specific page. This time, Ruger handed over the encyclopedia that Luisen\u2019s great grandfather wrote. This encyclopedia of crops was a historical relic containing information about edible crops\u2013a culmination of his ancestor\u2019s studies.\u201cIt says here that the buried old hag develops its poison when exposed to sunlight.\u201d\"\"It was the general who had dug up Luisen\u2019s ancestor\u2019s records late last night. After Luisen had shown him the harvested roots, the general had remembered reading about similar experiences in the records.When Luisen heard that, he immediately checked the book. As he wasn\u2019t a fast reader, he had stayed up all night and barely found what he needed.\u201cThen, why haven\u2019t we been eating these things?\u201d\u201cWhy should we? We\u2019ve never run out of food before, nor have we been desperate enough to eat these buried old hags. Since they look so gross\u2026\u201dCentered in an overflowing food basket, there was no reason to delve into the ground to harvest something that looked like a rotting head.\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026..\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s the record of one of your predecessors, it must be credible\u2026\u201d\u201cFor your information, the general, Ruger, and I ate these roots last night\u2013a great little late night snack. We haven\u2019t even had symptoms of a stomach ache.\u201d\u201cMy lord ate this kind of thing himself?\u201d\u201cI even dug it up as well!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.!\u201d The advisors were greatly surprised. Luisen had to hold onto the knight commander who attempted to rush out to call for the family doctor.\u201cAs the book said, nothing bad happened. How about you, General?\u201d Luisen said.\"\"\u201cI\u2019m fine as well. It tasted all right, too.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd Ruger?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also well\u2026\u2026\u201d Ruger frowned in spite of his words. He still had no desire to eat something like the buried old hag.\u201cWell\u2026If you\u2019re truly feeling fine\u2026\u201d The others in the banquet hall muttered.\u201cWell, it is handwritten by one of the duchy\u2019s forebears\u2026.so it must be reliable\u2026\u201d With Luisen\u2019s personal experiments added to the word of his ancestor, the retainers\u2019 opinion became more accepting to the root. Viscerally, they may feel disgust in their hearts, but their brains were convinced.\u2018Thank you, Great Grandfather!\u201d Luisen sent his sincere gratitude to his ancestor. Even in death, his family was helping this scum descendant.Luisen placed the buried old hags on a plate and chopped them into bite-sized pieces with a knife. After a sprinkle of salt and pepper, Luisen, and even the general, popped the sample into their mouths.The treasurer, who watched the two nervously, couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and reached out to take a bite of the old hags as well. His strong appetite overpowered his apprehension.\u201c\u2026.What do you think?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s different from how it looks\u2026.It\u2019s delicious.\u201d The treasurer somehow felt lost. After his testimony, the others also carefully lifted a few roots onto their plates.\u201cSince the buried old hags are everywhere in the castle grounds, it\u2019ll be easy to supply and distribute.\u201d\u201cOnce it\u2019s recognized as foodstuffs, the villagers can also find and harvest it on their own. As an alternative, this root is ingenious, but\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut do you think the people will obediently eat this?\u201dThat was a good point. However, Luisen had an idea in mind.TN: I usually update earlier in the day but I was in a plane today! I\u2019m on vacation this week \u00a0(But don\u2019t worry, I have some chapters stockpiled so it shouldn\u2019t affect updates\u2026although the stockpile will look sad when I come back T_T) In other news, I really wanted to eat roots while I was TLing on the plane\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luisen planned to co-opt that proven procedure.\u201cIn addition to the records, if the duke himself goes out\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy lord, you will have to go to the village many times. Will that be okay? Our lord\u2019s safety is paramount.\u201d\u201cI visited yesterday, and it seemed fine,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cThis is a plan worth trying, my lord. I think the citizens will understand. Moreover, the situation calls for extreme measures.\u201d\u201cOf course. Of course.\u201d When the old hags were recognized as edible foodstuffs, the advisors quickly plotted measures to spread the information.\u2018As expected, the duchy\u2019s vassals are competent.\u2019 Luisen liked it when he only had to open the irrigation waterway and the water would flow on its own. Emboldened by success, he smiled at the general.\u2018With polish, Luisen is also one of the great dukes of this land. He won\u2019t lose to his predecessors,\u2019 the general thought. Though Luisen modestly pushed all of his achievements to the ancestors\u2019 wisdom, the general did not fail to notice the young lord\u2019s own efforts. If Luisen had been the same brat as before, no matter how trustworthy the ancestral records were, the advisors would not have deigned to listen to him.Since Luisen had tried to stand firm against Carlton, predicted the locusts, and taken responsibility for his land\u2019s citizens, the advisors now had positive evaluations of the lord\u2019s plans. Faith was slowly piling upon him.\u2018Since when did I become so proud?\u2019 The general was surprised by the innovative crop but even more so by the fact that Luisen had worked all night and day. The general smiled sincerely and raised a small thumbs up underneath the table.At the end of the meal, Luisen ordered some servants to harvest more buried old hags. While his order was being executed, he had some free time, so Luisen took Ruger to the greens in front of the castle.Servants were busily coming and going; there wasn\u2019t much they could do to help. However, Luisen found a sack of flour that had yet to be loaded into the cart.\u201cLet\u2019s carry this together.\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s suggestion, Ruger\u2019s face cycled through many different colors.\u201dAh, my duke. Let\u2019s just go to your room. Why should we move this? Leave it to the servants.\u201d\u201cSo noisy. We should at least do something. Hurry and grab the other side.\u201d\u201cBut, why are we even bothering\u2026?\u201d Ruger grumbled but lifted the other corners of the flour sack. Luisen also rolled his sleeves up and lifted his corners as well.At that moment, the butler rushed in from somewhere. \u201cOh my! My lord! Let your servants deal with this kind of manual labor.\u201d\u201cI can at least do this much,\u201d Luisen refused.\u201cAbsolutely not! You\u2019ll get hurt like that! Ruger, you lout! How could you let the lord partake in menial work like this\u2026You\u2019re his chief attendant!\u201d the butler roared at Ruger. His voice was a far cry from the gentle, spring-breeze-like voice he used with Luisen.Ruger looked chagrined\u2013wrongfully accused. \u201cI\u2019m carrying this because the duke ordered me to.\u201d\u201cEven still! You should have convinced him! Please, rest here my duke. Let me take this lout back for proper training.\u201d The butler had already disapproved of Ruger, as he had been hired from outside the duchy. He dragged the attendant away as if he needed nothing more than an excuse.Luisen, left alone, tried to drag the bag of flour all by himself. However, soon the servants rushed over and took it away, forcing him to go someplace else.Luisen wandered around the castle. He had tried to sneakily insert himself into some work, but they all sent Luisen back to rest and did not allow him to handle anything exhausting. After attempting to hold an axe to chop firewood, amidst the panicked dissuasions from his servants, Luisen had given up. He trudged into a peaceful corner of the castle and leaned back against the wall.\u2018Ah. This feeling. It\u2019s been a long time.\u2019Everyone had been treating him like a droplet of dew\u2013afraid that he may pop as soon as something jostled him.Almost as if they\u2019d readily breathe for him to spare his lungs the work.It was an all too familiar overprotectiveness.Luisen became nostalgic: this was how he was treated originally. He had taken for granted how he had been raised so preciously. Back then, he couldn\u2019t understand the nervous hearts of the advisors that watched over the only heir to the duchy.But\u2026He wouldn\u2019t get hurt just from carrying a small sack of flour! Plus, he\u2019d gotten so good at chopping firewood!If Luisen was truly weak and frail, he could not have enjoyed his scum life in the capital. Spending, drinking, and partying every day was not possible for those without healthy bodies.During his nomadic era, he farmed, shadowed woodcutters while felling trees, and tried all sorts of manual hardships. After sleeping on the streets in the cold, he realized, \u2018I\u2019m just clumsy! I\u2019m not weak at all!\u2019Being weak and being unable to take advantage of one\u2019s body are two different problems. Because everyone had treated him so fragilely, Luisen really thought he was frail!\u2018I appreciate their care\u2026.but it\u2019s weird to treat me as if I\u2019m going to break at this age\u2026isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Luisen wasn\u2019t a six-year-old child anymore. How long into his adult age would he continue to be pampered like this?If others saw his predicament, Luisen would be filled with shame.By the time Luisen wrapped his head around his indignancy and cooled down, he noticed a strong gaze piercing the back of his head. Turning around casually, he noticed Carlton standing by the window.He looked disapprovingly at Luisen with his arms crossed.\u201cS-Sir Carlton! How long have you been standing there?\u201d\u201cSince you lost your axe to your servants.\u201d\u2018Then you\u2019ve seen that embarrassing interaction?\u2019 Luisen\u2019s face flushed red. To a perfectly self-made man like Carlton, he worried he would look like a child.\u201cIsn\u2019t that too rude?\u201d Carlton asked. \u201cThe duke\u2019s trying to help his people, and they won\u2019t let him chop firewood\u2013drove him out, in fact.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026I\u2019m the duchy\u2019s sole heir\u2026.\u201d\u2018Of course he doesn\u2019t understand! I just look like a fool! It\u2019s not my fault the others are so overprotective, but why am I feeling so shameful?\u2019 Luisen mumbled as he tried to justify the actions to himself.The young lord couldn\u2019t have imagined what sort of misunderstanding those words caused within Carlton or that Carlton would interpret his words in his own special way.\u2018The duchy\u2019s sole heir\u2026Since no one was around to protect him, he\u2019s been treated like a fool and an invalid.\u2019 Carlton had been watching Luisen for longer than he had stated. He saw Luisen wandering around the castle, being rejected here and there.Luisen was neither a child nor a sick man. He was a grown, able-bodied man. An adult has the agency to do whatever he or she wants according to his or her own will\u2013whether that is to be a fool or a productive human being. What\u2019s the use of driving out a man who was already helping to chop firewood so well? Carlton could only see that the others seemed to ignore Luisen\u2019s agency. If anyone did that to the mercenary, they would suffer at his fists.As he watched, he noticed how the duchy treated Luisen as a fool who couldn\u2019t do anything. And it was clear Luisen was used to such treatment. Last night\u2019s doubts grew larger and larger.When Luisen grew up, power was naturally brought back to him by birthright. There was only one option for those who did not want to be deprived of that power: prevent Luisen from being a proper lord even as an adult. They may have deliberately left him uneducated and alienated him from the duchy\u2019s responsibilities. Perhaps, as Luisen grew older, he may have been forcefully driven to the capital.Luisen would then go to the capital and meet his maternal relatives: the queen and the second prince. They probably had been friendly in order to make use of Luisen, and Luisen, who had grown neglected and lonely, would not have rejected their affections.Considering that context, Carlton understood why Luisen poured everything he had into the second prince and supported him. He may not have cared about sending his land to war when they were the only people he could rely on.Then, when he returned to his estate, Luisen may have tried to reign in his vassals and recollect his authority. However, the retainers would not have acquiesced to such demands. They would have objected to Luisen\u2019s opinions to suppress him, hindering his every move.\u2018\u2026Perhaps, that\u2019s why he risked his life to come alone and surrender at the enemy camp.\u2019Because Luisen tried to enforce his will and get out from under their thumb, the retainers had gone on strike. When Luisen did better than expected, especially in the face of a major crisis, they were forced to end their strike early.\u2018Yeah. If you look at it this way, it all starts to make sense.\u2019Luisen\u2019s extreme actions, his disregard for his dignity, the way he tried to solve everything without the advisors\u2019 help\u2026These contradictions inherent in his character and actions.When Carlton seriously considered the hypothesis that he grew up neglected and abused, all the questions were solved. It was as if he pulled at a string to the puzzle, and everything unraveled.Carlton looked down at Luisen\u2013his eyes were red, as if he were about to cry.\u2018Haah\u2026No wonder. I knew everything felt off.\u2019Carlton was completely sure. There was a painful past behind what seemed to be a perfect and aristocratic nobleman.The mercenary felt something stab at his heart. He didn\u2019t know the other\u2019s circumstances and treated him like any other trash noble, those who were adored by their parents and breathed pride as if they thrived on it instead of air.\"\"\u201cHas everything worked out the way you desired?\u201d Carlton asked with interest. His tone was friendlier than it had ever been.TL: The what pad fic continues\u2026\u2026lmaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAh, yeah. It went well, thanks to my ancestors.\u201d Luisen modestly told Carlton how he was greatly helped by his great grandfather. Somehow, the words fell glibly off his tongue. \u201cAs you\u2019ve said, I owe it all to my forebears.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Carlton stuttered uncharacteristically.Luisen took no notice of this oddity and continued, \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m thinking of going back to the town square. I need to show people how best to eat the buried old hag.\u201d\u201cWill you be alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m good at, it\u2019s eating.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t it be dangerous? Will the knights be following you?\u201d\u201cWell, since the cart needs to be escorted\u2026maybe one?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dCarlton\u2019s words were not getting through Luisen\u2019s imagination. If Carlton had been a bit more tender-hearted, he may have shed some tears at the pitiful lord who seemed to do everything by himself. Instead, Carlton frowned disapprovingly. \u201cThen I\u2019ll go with you to the village.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Why would you do that?\u201d Luisen asked reflexively.\u201cI\u2019m just going to watch. Don\u2019t expect any help.\u201d\u2018\u2026So, he\u2019s not following to help?\u2019If Carlton escorted him, then the assigned knight could do other work that needed to be done.Luisen stared at the mercenary. His prideful eyebrows and high nose beneath his wrinkled brow was quite striking\u2013creating a handsome appearance. Luisen didn\u2019t often have the time to appreciate his handsome features because Carlton always looked as if he was going to brutally murder someone.\u2018Huh?\u2019 Come to think of it, Luisen realized Carlton\u2019s stare had looked less bloodthirsty lately. Somehow his ferocious spirit seemed to have softened, and the man didn\u2019t look quite so frightening. Perhaps that was why he could look so comfortably at his face; previously, Luisen would have lowered his eyes. \u2018No wonder the conversation is flowing so easily.\u2019It was the first time he didn\u2019t feel so threatened by the mercenary. Luisen was shocked at this ease.Carlton spoke bluntly, \u201cIs there a reason why I shouldn\u2019t follow?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a bit\u2026.\u201d What could Luisen say?\u2018Why are you asking me this all of a sudden? You\u2019ve become so kind, but why am I feeling so tense?\u2019 the lord thought.\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then go alone.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019d appreciate it if you escorted me.\u201d Luisen swallowed the doubt in his heart. He wasn\u2019t stupid enough to spoil a good opportunity with meaningless interrogation. Besides, he had a strong hunch that he shouldn\u2019t voice these questions.***Soon afterwards, Luisen climbed into a cart containing the buried old hags. Next to him, Carlton rode on horseback.The two arrived in the town square, and the young lord quickly began to inform the villagers of the new crop. After catching their eyes, he began boiling one of the roots to make soup at that spot.Public response wasn\u2019t very accepting. Some people grew angry at being made to eat pig feed. The atmosphere soon grew riotous, but Carlton played his part well.Carlton stood beside Luisen, looking over the crowd with his arms folded over his chest. Just that imposing figure deterred anyone from moving forward. Even without a weapon, his strong body and large forearms were plenty threatening; to the villagers, his muscles may have very well been iron armor. Moreover, the man was known for his brutal nature; his presence, like an angry bull, was overwhelming enough to bow the villagers\u2019 heads.Thanks to this, Luisen could confidently grill the buried old hags in safety. The root\u2013a remnant of an era of struggle\u2013was always delicious.The villagers could no longer protest when Luisen proudly began to eat the old hag in front of the people, providing evidence that this was no mere prank. In addition, Luisen went so far as to declare publicly that he would only eat food made of these buried old hags for some time.As Luisen struggled, back at the castle carts continued to be loaded with supplies.Since distribution was urgently implemented in a situation where both manpower and resources were lacking, progress was slow. However, thanks to Luisen\u2019s efforts in the town square, the people were soothed and encouraged. The villagers patiently waited for their food, confident that their nobles would help them.Like that, three days of rationing passed.In the morning, Luisen woke up and headed for town. When he arrived at the town square, the villagers had already gathered. No matter how close the lower village was to the duke\u2019s castle, the villagers would not easily have another chance to have the young lord right before their very eyes. They had all gathered when they heard that Luisen intended to eat every meal at the square. Since Luisen preferred there to be a larger crowd to drum up interest in the new crop, the lord calmly accepted the attention.Tables were exclusively set up for Luisen\u2019s demonstration in the town square\u2013a provincial stage. When the lord sat at the table, after a moment servants would bring the buried old hags, roasted in fire.With a fork and knife, Luisen skillfully peeled off the thick skin and ate the soft flesh of the root.\u201cOh!? He\u2019s actually eating it?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? He\u2019s been eating nothing but that for three days and he\u2019s fine. Can\u2019t we have some too? There\u2019s a bunch in the vacant lot over there.\u201dThe villagers murmured as they watched Luisen eating contentedly. A young man from the crowd stepped forward as if possessed, asking, \u201cExcuse me my lord. Could I try\u2026.?\u201dLuisen could see at one glance that this young man was starving. His usually robust limbs held no power, and he was unable to tear his gaze away from the steaming old hags.\u201cOf course.\u201d Luisen forked one of the grilled roots and held it out to the young man. The young man hesitated, recalling the innate repulsion he had for the ugly root, but ultimately he was too hungry to refuse. The man had used the flour and the other commodities to feed his younger siblings, but not enough was left over to fill his big belly.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look quite so bad when it\u2019s peeled, right?\u201d Luisen kindly asked.\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026.\u201dThe buried old hags smelled savory and delicious\u2013the smell could even entice a person to chew on stones.The young man closed his eyes and popped the old hag into his mouth; a sweeter taste than he could have ever imagined captivated his tongue. The guardedness in his mind lowered at the fluffy texture that contrasted with its hideous exterior. In an instant, the young man ate up all that Luisen had offered and smacked his lips.\u201cSit here and eat before you go. There\u2019s enough, so eat your fill\u2026and take some to go.\u201d\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201dThe young man sat down at the table. Motivated by his bravery, a couple more villagers showed interest in the old hag. Luisen also granted them permission to squeeze a seat around the table.The son of a farmer who was chained down in the village after the army disbanded, the heiress to the linen store, an old man caught by surprise while visiting the castle\u2026.and the Duke of Anies.It would normally be impossible for all of them to sit at one table and eat together\u2013the image left a strong impression in people\u2019s minds.Carlton was involuntarily struck with admiration. When he saw the lord digging around in the ground in the middle of the knight, he thought Luisen was insane. But he managed to overcome the prejudice they had for this hideous root\u2026.\u2018He\u2019s had such a harsh childhood, he deserves to indulge in some gluttony\u2026\u2019Luisen peeled the old hag flamboyantly with his fork and knife and distributed the cut pieces onto the others\u2019 plates. A persistent yet subtle smile spread across his face.The same was true of Carlton. When the prejudice of a trash-like aristocrat was removed, he could better assess Luisen\u2019s various faces. If he looked closely at the seemingly indifferent expression, he could distinguish when Luisen had no other thoughts and when he was planning something with determined will. When he was hungry, the lord looked fierce; on the contrary, his sated face became bright and languished, like a drowsy cat. Though he looked the happiest when full, that same expression appeared as he fed the hungry villagers and watched them eat their fill.\u2018The duke may have been a good lord if not for his retainers\u2019 machinations.\u2019 No matter what, there would be power struggles everywhere. Carlton looked at Luisen with a mixture of pity and sorrow in his heart.Two servants eyed their interaction meaningfully. One of them mentioned to the maid, who was flipping the buried old hags in the fire, \u201cLook, Sir Carlton can\u2019t tear his eyes away from our lord.\u201dThe maid took a sly glance at the two and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Look at his eyes. His gaze isn\u2019t normal.\u201d\u201cSee? The rumors are true! I\u2019m right!\u201dAs the crisis showed signs of hope, Luisen\u2019s popularity soared as high as the sky. His achievements, which had been devalued by his detractors, began to be reevaluated.However, bright lights bring dark shadows.As Luisen\u2019s every move drew attention, the servants began to circulate suspicious rumors.It started with Carlton\u2019s men. They wondered if Carlton and Luisen had spent a short but intense moment of passion together. However, one of the duchy\u2019s servants had overheard their conversation; stories spread from lip to lip, friend to friend. Of course, everyone had been lukewarm on the veracity of those rumors, but Carlton himself stoked the fires by chasing Luisen everywhere, giving the excuse that he was simply \u2018watching over\u2019 the young lord.Carlton asked Luisen for his body by ransoming the rations!Carlton is romantically chasing Luisen!These were the two main points of the rumor. Many were hushed and told to be quiet, but the nature of rumors couldn\u2019t be stopped. Nothing could stay secret forever. The rumors spread amongst the servants and eventually fell into the butler\u2019s ear, who informed the general of what he had heard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Asking for his body\u2026Sir Carlton isn\u2019t some neighborhood bandit.\u201d\u201cThough he may be called \u2018Sir,\u2019 isn\u2019t he still a simple mercenary?\u201dSince the butler\u2019s expression was so serious, the general slowly lost any traces of amusement. He asked, \u201cDo you have any evidence?\u201d\u201cOur servants have heard Carlton\u2019s men talking amongst themselves. According to them\u2026for recompense\u2026.Haah, this is too disgusting to say\u2026\u201d The butler wetted his lips and could barely continue. \u201cIn front of all his men, Carlton demanded Luisen bare his body, and our lord knelt down on his knees. Then he chased all of the others out of the room. At first, the man was completely against reinstating rationing, but he completely changed his mind and told everyone that they were allowed to do as they pleased.\u201d\u201cHuh! So then the reason for why he\u2019s following our lord so closely\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s bound to have vulgar secret designs on the lord\u2026\u201d\u201cHe said he was simply conducting surveillance\u2026\u201d The general gasped.\u201cIt\u2019s all an excuse. He could have simply ordered his men to do that. He\u2019s acting like that even now\u2026What surveillance? He\u2019s using that excuse to stay close and trick our lord.\u201dThe general felt a sudden surge of vertigo and grasped the wall.Luisen, who used to follow him with a short lisp. Luisen, who would fall down all the time and beg for hugs and for the general to carry him everywhere.He raised this child preciously. He couldn\u2019t have possibly loved a blood-related child more. This was the small and young master he raised, unable to discipline him even with a few slaps.He may have despaired that such upbringing had brought forth a scoundrel and trash of a noble, but\u2013before his very eyes\u2013that same scoundrel became a wise lord and led the duchy through crises. This old man believed he could die in peace from Luisen\u2019s newfound dignified poise\u2026The general was suddenly filled with rage. \u201cThat son of a bitch! How dare he disgrace our lord like this!\u201d\u00a01He grabbed a knife hanging on the kitchen wall.The startled butler blocked the general with his whole body.It was ridiculous for a man who, in his twilight years, had done nothing but stand by a desk to pull a knife on someone.\u201cAh, sir, general\u2026Please calm down\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could I calm down right now! Could you keep calm when rumors like this are circulating?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m angry too. I\u2019m angry but\u2026these are just rumors.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be wise to blow this up into an even bigger situation. The lord may be ashamed to know that these rumors are even circulating in the first place.\u201d The butler had a sensible point. If these rumors were to get too big, it could damage Luisen\u2019s reputation. The lord\u2019s perfect existence should never have been stained with Carlton\u2019s manipulation.The general took a deep breath and lowered the knife. He knew that he needed to return to his senses in order to properly protect Luisen from Carlton\u2019s ministrations.\u201c\u2026.The lord knows nothing?\u201d the general asked.\u201cYes. It doesn\u2019t seem like he knows. I\u2019ve ordered the servants to keep quiet for now.\u201d\u201cGood job. The rumor should never spread any further than this,\u201d the general sighed.The butler nodded, agreeing with the other\u2019s words.\u201cThe problem is that bastard Carlton\u2026We must never leave him alone with the lord. You, the butler, and I should always stay by the lord\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll also tell his chief aide, Ruger, to not leave him alone. Although, since he often leaves his post, he\u2019s not a very reliable man\u2026\u201d\u201cEither way, protecting the lord should be our first priority.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe general and the butler determinedly locked gazes.After that, the general waited tenaciously for Luisen to return to the castle. His heart desperately wanted to go down to the village, chase Carlton out of the territory, and safely bring Luisen back into the confines of the castle\u2026but he knew that patience rewarded far more than rash actions.Soon after sunset, it was finally time for the young lord to return.\u201cThe lord has passed through the inner gates.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll go to pick him up.\u201dAt the words of a knight, the general rushed out the front door. He could see, in the distance, Luisen approaching on a horse. The lord\u2019s hair glistened orange, his back to the sunset. His figure on a white horse was like an aristocrat out of a minstrel\u2019s story.Just as pride swelled in the general\u2019s heart, he saw Carlton stuck to Luisen\u2019s side. Carlton couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of Luisen\u2013even the general could understand that all his attention was directed towards the young lord.\u201cHnn. At least his eyes have taste.\u201d The general thought Luisen was superior to all others\u2013yet he lamented his lord\u2019s ignorance to Carlton\u2019s innermost insidious thoughts. His lord was courteous, engaging in conversation without guile.Before he knew it, Luisen and Carlton\u2019s horses stopped in front of the general.\u201cHave you returned, my lord? You\u2019ve worked hard today as well.\u201d The general only saw his former ward.\u201cI\u2019m here as well?\u201d Carlton questioned.\u201cYes.\u201dThe general blatantly ignored Carlton. \u201cWhat brought you here on the back of a horse? I thought you took the cart when you left?\u201d\u201cWhen it was time to return, I couldn\u2019t find it again. Since Sir Carlton offered to teach me the proper way to ride, I thought I\u2019d challenge myself.\u201d Luisen sighed. He felt the weight of his previous experience when he had fallen off in the middle of the village. \u2018I can\u2019t leave my riding skills like this!\u2019So he cautiously asked Carlton, an excellent rider, to be his teacher.\u2018I must be crazy! What am I going to learn from him?\u2019Carlton wasn\u2019t a particularly good teacher. He naturally knew how to use his body by instinct. The whole way here Carlton nagged, but Luisen still couldn\u2019t understand a single thing. Carlton was constantly frustrated and Luisen was dying to throw a tantrum as well.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you trying,\u201d the general said, stepping between his lord and the mercenary. \u201cThere\u2019s something we\u2019d like to discuss with the lord, so let\u2019s go together.\u201dDespite the natural ease at which the general inserted himself, Carlton was unnaturally good at perceiving others\u2019 negative feelings for him. He did not miss the hostility the general and butler had so skillfully hidden.\u2018Look at these people,\u2019 he thought. It was obvious the retainers wanted to separate him and Luisen. Since when did these people ever discuss the territory\u2019s logistics with Luisen?They must have been feeling a sense of urgency due to Luisen\u2019s soaring popularity. Furthermore, it was obvious the lord was able to move freely thanks to Carlton\u2019s company\u2013by separating the two, the retainers may be able to drive a wedge between their relationship or coax the young lord to behave once again.Carlton swore he had no intention of involving himself with the dispute in the duke\u2019s inner circle. Luisen\u2019s circumstances were unfortunate, but, in this day and age where it was every man for himself, who would make the effort to help him? \u2026He was definitely only following Luisen around because he was concerned about the man\u2019s flushed face as he exerted himself, running here and there.However, it was very unpleasant to see the others on edge\u2013wary of him\u2013as if they were a cat and he had trampled on their tail. If someone doesn\u2019t like you for no reason, don\u2019t you want to properly give them a reason for their hatred?Carlton chuckled and pulled on the reins of Luisen\u2019s horse\u2013the horse and rider followed along.\u201cFirst, you should get off the horse. Can you get down on your own?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t.\u201d After some contemplation, Luisen shook his head. The horse\u2019s back was too tall for someone like him. In addition, the horse had been snorting and huffing, unhappy with its rider.\u201cI\u2019ll hold you as you dismount.\u201d Carlton reached out his hand.As a result, the general could no longer stand still. \u201cPlease, hold my hand, my lord.\u201d The general also extended a hand towards his lord. A tense situation, in which two hands were outstretched to the stranded Luisen, appeared. Carlton and the general\u2013the two shared a fierce glare.Between the two of them, Luisen was completely absentminded.\u201cDon\u2019t push yourself too hard, General. You have a bad back, and Sir Carlton is here anyway.\u201d Luisen grabbed Carlton\u2019s hand.Grasping his steady hands, the lord barely managed to get off the horse. Carlton grabbed and steadied Luisen\u2019s body, which staggered as soon as he landed on the ground. Though the lord\u2019s weight must have been considerable\u2013especially for one hand\u2013Carlton\u2019s hands stood firm and unshakeable.As the mercenary held onto Luisen\u2019s body, he gave a triumphant look.The general flushed red. \u201cThis despicable\u2026\u201d\u201cGeneral, are you alright? Your face is so red\u2026are you hurt somewhere?\u201d\u201cIt must be the hue from the sunset,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cAh, is that right?\u201d Luisen peacefully looked up at the sky.The butler\u2019s heart became complicated as he saw his ward so comfortable, without noticing the silent war waging over his well being. No matter how he may have suddenly changed, his apathy and obliviousness to all that surrounded him had not gone away.The general squeezed in between the two, separating them. Carlton frowned as he automatically let go of the lord\u2019s hand.\u201cThere\u2019s an urgent matter to attend to. My lord, let us leave.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really? Then I should go.\u201d Luisen complied.However, Carlton placed a hand on Luisen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThat \u2018urgent matter\u2019\u2026. I\u2019m curious as to what it could be.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the duchy\u2019s internal affairs. Sir Carlton should rest. It must be tiring to follow the lord around all day long\u2013you don\u2019t have a reason to escort him at night, right?\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I escort him? It all depends on how you see it\u2013after all, I\u2019ve gotten quite close with the duke. I\u2019ve a keg of alcohol I brought from the north\u2026as he worked hard today, learning to ride a horse, I thought I\u2019d offer some as a reward.\u201d\u201cNorthern liquor!?\u201d Luisen exclaimed. \u201cThen, after talking with the general, I can share some drinks with Sir Carlton, right? I\u2019ll find you in your room.\u201d\u201cUnacceptable!\u201d the general huffed.\u201cOf course.\u201d Carlton grinned. It was a real pleasure\u2013always, whenever and wherever\u2013to stake victory over another. He loved winning so much.TL:Carlton \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m blunt and I don\u2019t feel sorry for or any other feelings for this lord\u201dAlso Carlton \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m going to intentionally aggravate people and flirt with the guy because people don\u2019t want me to. Also create a multi-chapter fanfiction about his backstory in my head.\u201dFootnotesThe original says \u2018treat as if no better than a female dog.\u201d Which uh\u2026in English would probably better be translated as \u201cdisgrace.\u201d lmao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was Carlton\u2019s men who broke the tension during this bizarre standoff.\u201cCaptain! Captain!!\u201d Carlton\u2019s men rushed in as if they had been waiting hours for his arrival.Carlton felt a bit annoyed as a distraction appeared right at his moment of victory. \u201cWhat?\u201dCarlton\u2019s men, accustomed to his blunt attitude, did not shrink back in fear. Instead, they took a deep breath and said, \u201cThe surrender envoy from Vinard estate has arrived.\u201dAt that moment, everyone\u2013the general, the butler, Luisen, and Carlton\u2013immediately turned their attention towards the men.Among the southern lords who supported the second prince, Vinard was the only estate which did not surrender to Carlton. Carlton had mobilized to punish them, but the schedule was delayed by Luisen\u2019s failure and the subsequent distribution of rations. Following the original plan, Carlton would have broken into their front gates by now and held a knife to the lord\u2019s neck.\u201cYou\u2019re saying they\u2019ve come to surrender now?\u201d Carlton grew serious under these unexpected circumstances.It was later than late! It had already been days since the locust storm passed the duchy. Thanks to the thorough preparation and the village\u2019s support, they had been told that the swarm of locusts had split into multiple groups and were no longer such a threat.\u201cIf they were going to surrender, they should have done so immediately. Why would they send an envoy now?\u201d Luisen looked towards the general, but the general also seemed to be oblivious.Carlton\u2019s men continued, \u201cBut the envoy from Vinard\u2026it seems they\u2019re in a strange state.\u201d\u201cStrange how?\u201d\u201cThey claim that we\u2019re deceiving them\u2013babbling and causing all sorts of mayhem. They claim they \u2018don\u2019t believe it,\u2019 and are asking us to bring forth the Duke of Anies.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Luisen\u2019s eyes grew round.\u201cYes. You, sir duke. They refuse to say a word until the duke arrives.\u201dNext to him, Carlton\u2019s face twisted violently. \u201cIs it time for them to kick the bucket? If they can\u2019t believe anything, then let them stay that way. What\u2019s there to \u2018believe?\u2019 Since when were we the type to talk things out?\u201d\u201cHaah. You\u2019re right, Captain.\u201dCarlton\u2019s boorish comments made his subordinate giggle. Carlton and his men always seemed to match each other well\u2013harmonious as always.Shouldn\u2019t the subordinate at least pretend to restrain his leader at this time?Luisen was forced to step in. \u201cSir Carlton, please calm down. Why don\u2019t I go with you? I\u2019m also wondering what is happening.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Carlton seemed reluctant, but he had no strong objections.But stubborn opposition sprang forth from an unexpected source. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dIt was the general.\u201cEven if Vinard\u2019s lord may be a lord, he is a mere vassal compared to you. Perhaps if he personally came to request an audience\u2026as it stands, he has no right to order you to come and go as he pleases.\u201d\u201cThis situation is peculiar.\u00a01\u00a0I\u2019m also curious as to what\u2019s with the behavior of Vinard\u2019s envoys.\u201dCarlton\u2019s purpose was to subjugate the southern lords under the first prince\u2019s banner.Once Vinard\u2019s surrender was clarified and confirmed, there would be no reason for him to stay in the south. The mission would be over. Carlton would then leave the duchy, and freedom would be restored to them. The shackles that bound the retainers and Luisen would disappear, and all authority would be returned to the duke.That was a moment everyone in the Anies duchy had been waiting for with bated breaths. Therefore, Vinard\u2019s refusal to surrender was also an important issue to Luisen.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s safety the general is concerned about, then there\u2019s no need. I have Carlton, after all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also a problem,\u201d the general grumbled.\u201cIf the surrender envoy was in danger while on his way to the duchy, it\u2019s not something to be taken lightly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d The general\u2019s resolve slightly relented at Luisen\u2019s persuasion.\u201cHm.\u201d Carlton wasn\u2019t too inclined to take Luisen to the meeting with the envoy either. However, when the general opposed his participation, a desire to act like a green frog popped up.\u00a02\u201cAlright then. Let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cYes. But you must promise to stay close to me and not cause any trouble.\u201d\u201cAm I a child?\u201d\u201cWould you like to peacefully remain at the castle?\u201d\u201cNo! I won\u2019t make trouble. I promise.\u201dCarlton gave a small chuckle at Luisen\u2019s quick turnaround.\u2018He\u2019s definitely changed,\u2019 Luisen thought.He didn\u2019t smile as if he were pretending to be kind, as he had before. His laughter lacked some sharpness and sarcasm. Luisen thought the mercenary had gotten nicer as well. So, lately, he\u2019d been less scared of Carlton in the past few days. Luisen did not know the reason for this sudden change, but he liked it.\u2018I mean, I think I\u2019m doing pretty well these days. Maybe that\u2019s why Carlton\u2019s gotten softer on me. Haha!\u2019\u201cThen, I shall follow you as well,\u201d the general squeezed in. He was determined not to leave the two, Luisen and Carlton, alone.However, Luisen refused to cooperate. \u201cYou should guard the castle. The acting lord and the lord should not both leave the premises.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s no reason for the both of you to go,\u201d Carlton chimed in.At that impudence, the general\u2019s anger soared to the tip of his head. \u201cThen, at the very least, you\u2019d better bring your servant. Let\u2019s call for Ruger.\u201d The general rushed into the building, attempting to find Luisen\u2019s chief attendant.As soon as he left, Luisen turned to Carlton. \u201cLet\u2019s get going.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re alright with leaving your attendant behind?\u201d\u201cThat punk is probably idling\u2013hiding from his job\u2013in some hidden location. If we wait for him, the whole day might pass us by.\u201d\u201cWell then.\u201d Carlton mounted Luisen onto his horse. He had no choice: if Luisen were to ride his own horse, they may get separated or the ride down would take all night. If the general had seen it, he would have fainted\u2026but Carlton and Luisen left before the man returned.******The thoroughbred warhorse quickly carried the two, galloping at breakneck speed along the straight stretch of road leading to the gate. It was so quick that Luisen, who had been distracted by various worries, arrived far faster than he had expected. When the guards confirmed that Carlton was present, the gate opened.There was a tent built just outside the gates\u2013previously, this was where all the surrender envoys had been received and dealt with. The guards approached their captain; they were surprised to see Luisen in Carlton\u2019s arms.\u201c\u2026It seems the duke has tagged along.\u201dCarlton dismounted first and, very naturally, he held the duke with both hands to help him get off as well. Though the men knew Luisen couldn\u2019t easily get off the horse alone, they were still so surprised they were rendered speechless. \u2018What on earth is going on??\u2019\u201cThe envoy?\u201d\u201c\u2026.Te-tent\u2026Let\u2019s go inside.\u201d Carlton men led the two to their destination with trembling faces. Five men stood inside the tent\u2013four of them were wearing armor, and the other donned clothes made of soft cloth. He was immediately recognizable as the chief envoy sent to broker the terms of surrender.\u201cYou. Are you in charge of delivering the news of surrender?\u201d Carlton asked. The envoy snorted and raised his head. Since the man was sitting down, he looked up at the mercenary, but it somehow felt like he was looking down at Carlton instead.Luisen could infer exactly what kind of man he was: a noble who did not yet know how high the sky was.\u201cAre you Carlton? I\u2019m Bolton, the heir and eldest son to the Vinard territory. I\u2019m in charge of this procession. It\u2019s said that you\u2019re a common man\u2026don\u2019t you know how to pay respects to nobles?\u201dSure enough, Bolton was blue-blooded through and through. He wasn\u2019t daunted by Carlton and instead provoked him for what he\u2019s worth. It was clear he was immersed in the advantages his station of birth afforded him and mistook himself as absolutely superior in any situation.Carlton took an angry step forward; only then did Bolton flinch.\u201cF-fine. Looking at you, it\u2019s not as if you look educated. I\u2019ll show you mercy this time. Why don\u2019t you speak with me\u2026your men were speaking some nonsense to me.\u201d Bolton attempted to get a handle on the situation.Luisen grimaced and grabbed Carlton by the arm\u2013he was sure the man was about to kill the Vinard envoy.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I won\u2019t kill him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not about killing. If you hit an envoy, you\u2019ll gain more notoriety and the surrender negotiations could go awry.\u201dCarlton\u2019s expression softened slightly as Luisen clung anxiously onto him. Then, Bolton noticed Luisen\u2019s presence.\u201cOh! Uh! A-aren\u2019t you the duke?!\u201d Bolton leapt to his feet and humbly greeted Luisen. His head bowed down as deep as it could, almost reaching his knees. \u201cGoodness me, how are you, my duke? I am Bolton Vinard. We met briefly last year at the New Year\u2019s celebration.\u201d\u201cDid we, now?\u201d\u201cYes. We even talked for over five minutes at that time\u2026In anycase, have you come all this way for us? The duke\u2019s generosity makes this Bolton\u2019s head hang low and his heart overflow with gratitude.\u201d Bolton acted as if he was moved to tears as he kowtowed towards Luisen. Carlton, on the other hand, was dumbfounded at how the Vinard heir seemed to be a completely different man.Luisen also felt awkward, as it had been a long time since he had received such blatant flattery. \u2018Just from the way he speaks, it looks like he\u2019s fine.\u2019On the surface, it didn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d run into much trouble. The envoy\u2019s clothes had become dirty after travelling a long way, and his face was lined with fatigue. But, he didn\u2019t seem to have suffered much hardship\u2013rather, the journey seemed to have been quite smooth.\u201cLet\u2019s stop with the useless small talk. Now, tell me, why have you made such a fuss and requested my presence?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean fuss? How could we dare cause trouble? We were just so frustrated and outraged at the unfairness of it all that we simply raised our voices a little.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so unfair?\u201d Luisen asked. Simultaneously, Bolton angrily glared at Carlton, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to openly show such hostility in front of the duke, so he restrained himself.TL: Sorry for a bit of the delay guys >.< But the chapter\u2019s here!FootnotesOriginally, the novel says \u201cthis situation is a situation,\u201d In korean, repeating like that often implies something special\u2026It might not translate through well, so I found the English equivalent.\u00a0Acting like a green frog is basically acting like a contrarian. You want to do the opposite of whatever others say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cDidn\u2019t you issue an official letter from the duchy a while ago? As you know, we\u2019re a smaller estate. Even if we work hard, we cannot afford to fight both a war and the locusts.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cSo, the Lord sent me, his son, to surrender. We have decided to come\u2013no pretense\u2013and bear ourselves diligently before the duke of this land. The nonstop journey between our estates took around three days.\u201dLuisen nodded. Carlton had said earlier that the ride would take that long.\u201cThree days after the official document was issued, we left; now we\u2019re here, three days later.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Luisen noticed the oddity in his testimony. More than six days had passed since the official document was spread.\u201cBut now that I\u2019m here, they\u2019re telling me that it\u2019s been longer than that and that the swarm of locusts have long passed? What nonsense! It\u2019s only been six days! Can\u2019t you see why we\u2019d be so dumbfounded and upset at the unfairness of the situation?\u201d\u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSix days\u2026it\u2019s been way longer than that. Other lords have all visited and surrendered and the plague has passed us by.\u201d\u201cT-that\u2019s impossible! We came here without rest! Sure, there was a foggy area on the way, but, even if we were slower\u2026we never stopped once! Right?\u201dBolton looked to his party for confirmation. Bolton\u2019s party also nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right, we moved nonstop while the sun was still in the sky\u2013exactly three nights!\u201d they said, shouting in disbelief.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Luisen asked Carlton for his opinion.Carlton laughed. \u201cWeren\u2019t they just stubborn while the others surrendered? And, when another war was around their corner, they finally sent an envoy. They\u2019re making up nonsense now that they\u2019re embarrassed.\u201d\u201cWe of Vinard have a proud and venerable history as a noble house in the south. We wouldn\u2019t use such dirty tricks. I\u2019m telling you now; it\u2019s been six days since the official letter has been issued!\u201d\u201cWell, it hasn\u2019t. More than ten days have elapsed.\u201d Luisen scrutinized Bolton. His eyes looked fine, and he didn\u2019t seem to have eaten anything off. But the man still seemed to be confused.Bolton also looked at Luisen with suspicion. \u201cMy duke, if you were forced by these punks in an unsavory way\u2026\u201dLuisen crumpled his forehead. How like an aristocrat, flattering without pride and then immediately changing his tune when he feels at a disadvantage. \u201cAre you saying that the Duke of Anies, under threat, is lying?\u201d Luisen spoke coldly.\u201c\u2026Ah, no\u2026I\u2019m not questioning the duke\u2019s integrity. How could I dare? I\u2019m just so frustrated. If what the duke says is true\u2026then what in the world happened to our time\u2026?\u201d Bolton murmured as if in a trance. He was so sure that Carlton\u2019s men were lying, but, at Luisen\u2019s confirmation, his confusion had reached a fever pitch.Because Bolton and his party seemed to no longer be in the right state of mind for further conversation, Luisen left the tent. \u201cIs he telling the truth?\u201d\u201cOf course he\u2019s lying. The Vinard\u2019s heir is a good actor.\u201d Carlton did not believe in Bolton, but Luisen thought differently.\u201cIf they were going to lie, why wouldn\u2019t they have come up with something more plausible? Like being stopped by bandits in a highway robbery?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s perhaps true, but those people are truly claiming nonsense.\u201d\u201cMaybe they were captivated by an evil fae. Or a wizard?\u201d\u201cIf a wizard was the cause, there would have been some traces. They looked too normal to have been possessed or bewitched.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d The stories of the envoys were far too unbelievable to trust, but Luisen felt uncomfortable dismissing these testimonies. He was extra nervous because this issue happened within the borders of his duchy.\u201cYou should just go back to the main castle.\u201d\u201cWhat about the negotiations?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t negotiate at this rate\u2013we\u2019ll have to continue tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAre those people going to be alright?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll come to their senses if we leave them alone for a day.\u201d Carlton barked a few instructions to his men and lifted Luisen onto his horse.Even his action of placing Luisen on the saddle felt natural\u2013Carlton\u2019s men stared blankly at their disappearing back. \u201cI guess the rumors from the castle\u2019s servants were true.\u201dThe servants from the castle had muttered to them, \u2018Sir Carlton harbors an unrequited love for the duke.\u201d Of course, Carlton\u2019s men couldn\u2019t have imagined that the rumor\u2019s origin started with them.Their captain was usually quite blunt and kept kind words close to his chest. Their doubts turned into certainties.*****\"\"The two\u2013the only ones who had yet to realize what supposed affection existed between them\u2013leisurely returned to the castle. Carlton guided his horse to trot slowly, and Luisen could comfortably look around at his surroundings.The two were alone on the wide road. Since it was deep into the night, everything was quiet. Every time Luisen was taken slightly off balance by the horse\u2019s undulations, his body fell into contact with Carlton\u2019s front. At each touch, he could feel the warmth of the other\u2019s body and the thudding of his heart.It struck Luisen once again that he was truly peacefully riding together with Carlton through the lower village\u2013life truly couldn\u2019t be predicted more than a few steps ahead. The years spent mired in the delusion of being chased by the black knight felt so distant.\u201cWhen the surrender negotiation with Vinard is over, is your mission over as well?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cYes. After all, the Vinard family is the last.\u201d\u201cThen you won\u2019t have any more reasons to linger here. Will you return to the capital?\u201d\u201c\u2026I suppose I have to go back.\u201d Carlton had waited impatiently to return, but, in the end, something tugged at his heart. \u201cWhat are you going to do, my duke?\u201d\u201cMe? I\u2019ll just be here. I\u2019ll have to catch up on my work and study. I\u2019m considering taking up the mantle of a proper lord that I had previously thrown away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. In my view, this is a good opportunity to push out your retainers and restore your authority.\u201d\u201cWell, no need to go to the extent of pushing them out\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re doing something like this, you need to be firm about it.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Luisen thought that something was odd but was convinced that such a ruthless and extreme answer was quite like Carlton.\u2018Once Carlton leaves\u2026\u2019Before his regression, Carlton\u2019s appearance had completely overturned his life.Now, after one death, he returned to the middle of the war. His surrender was like a new beginning\u2013the opening of a door\u2013for both of them. Perhaps that was why Carlton\u2019s departure felt like curtains falling upon the stage after the end of a performance.In the dark, a cold wind brushed over them. It felt as if the wind blew from within their hearts.\u201cI\u2019m still bothered by what the Vinard envoys say they have been through. Watch your surroundings for the following days and prepare thoroughly before leaving,\u201d Luisen advised seriously.Carlton looked down at the top of Luisen\u2019s round head. If he were to leave the duchy, there would be no more reason for him to take the duke horseback riding like this. Before his brain could properly filter himself, words escaped his mouth. \u201c\u2026Then, we\u2019ll never see each other again?\u201d\u2018What am I even saying? I sound pathetic.\u2019Luisen\u2019s advice and his words were completely out of context.Uncharacteristically chatty, Carlton continued, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like my duke has plans to visit the capital anytime soon. And there\u2019s no reason for me to visit the south\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s the duty of one of the great lords to prepare for the coronations, so I\u2019ll be going to the capital then. Perhaps I\u2019ll see you at that time.\u201d\u201cThe coronation\u2026It\u2019s a long way off.\u201dPerhaps the mercenary had been separated far too long from the prince\u2019s side\u2013perhaps this night was just too still and timeless\u2013the coronation felt so distant.\u201cMany things will be different then compared to now,\u201d Carlton murmured.\u201cI guess so. Why? Are you having second thoughts now that you\u2019re leaving?\u201d Luisen said, mischief laced through his words.\u201cOf course not. Never. I want to go back to the capital as soon as possible. My feet are already marching up and down.\u201d Carlton exaggeratedly stomped to a beat\u2013however, he didn\u2019t sound as excited as he acted. He himself did not know why he felt like this. At this moment, he was more concerned with how Luisen\u2019s trembling laugh spread through the touch of their bodies.***As soon as Luisen returned to the castle, he told the general what Carlton and he had heard from Vinard\u2019s delegation. However, neither the general nor the other retainers could easily guess the cause of what had happened to the envoys. As far as they knew, there was no immediate danger in the duchy or the surrounding areas.The next day, Luisen headed for the town square of the lower village.\u201cMy lord, aren\u2019t you tired of eating the same thing all the time?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s always delicious.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking\u2013you always look like you\u2019re enjoying what you eat.\u201dThe citizens comfortably approached their lord, perhaps because of Carlton\u2019s conspicuous absence. Two knights were still on guard, flanking both of Luisen\u2019s sides, but their presence was weak compared to the mercenary.Carlton did not follow Luisen this time because he had yet to conclude the negotiations with Vinard\u2019s envoys. Fortunately, however, there was no great danger since public opinion viewed Luisen so favorably.\u201cI baked bread using the buried old hags. I thought it was pretty well done, so I brought some for you to taste.\u201d One of the citizens stepped forward.\u2018How did they know that bread made from this root is considered a delicacy? I didn\u2019t even teach them how to make this bread!\u2019 Luisen was glad the new crop seemed to have been accepted by the people of his territory.TL: This was super romantic in an emotionally constipated way <3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA villager brought a basket loaded with bread and handed its contents to the people milling about in the plaza. Luisen sat around with the villagers and ate the bread\u2013it was a taste he hadn\u2019t experienced in a long while. The insides were not soft, but chewy\u2013the longer one chewed, the sweeter it was.\u201cHow is it, my lord?\u201cDelicious. You really brought through the innate sweetness of the buried old hag.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a bit wistful for the taste of butter.\u201d\u201cWhat can we do\u2013we don\u2019t have any.\u201dThe villagers comfortably talked to each other in front of Luisen. The young lord was proud that his citizens seemed to have grown used to his presence.While eating the bread, Luisen began asking some questions, \u201cHas there been any strange happenings at the estate?\u201d\u201cSomething strange?\u201d\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s gotten unduly foggy lately\u2013then people may disappear? Or perhaps they\u2019re confused about the dates? Have there been people who\u2019ve been through something strange like that on their way to the duchy?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cHmm\u2026I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201d\u201cMissing persons cases happen every now and then, but\u2026\u201cHow about rumors of a magician? Or an evil fae?\u201d\u201cA lot of creatures live in the forest, but I\u2019m not too sure about fae\u2026\u201d The villagers didn\u2019t seem to particularly recall anything important.\u201cAh, I guess the fog\u2019s been heavier lately. The fog\u2019s been rolling in from that direction ever since the new reservoir\u2019s been built this past spring.\u201d\u201cBecause of the reservoir? And not for any other reason?\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s been exceptionally bad ever since the reservoir was built.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Luisen nodded. So the fog that the Vinard envoy had forded through was a natural phenomenon?Luisen, who was suspicious of supernatural interference\u2013magic or its ilk\u2013lost some steam. \u2018So they were lying? Why would they lie so blatantly like that?\u2019Last night the general had told him he\u2019d known Vinard\u2019s lord and his son for quite some time; they were loyal to the Anies family. In his opinion, the envoy\u2019s testimony should not be written off as pure lies.Luisen spent the entire day asking around for information until his head hurt\u2013still, there was nothing to show for his efforts. \u2018These people, like me, have been locked up in estate bounds for over a month\u2026they couldn\u2019t possibly know the situation outside.\u2019Luisen tore huge chunks off the bread he was holding; even in times of crisis, his appetite was voracious.****While Luisen was darting here and there in the village, Carlton finished up the surrender negotiations. After leaving them alone for the night, Vinard\u2019s envoys seemed to return to reality. They wanted to finalize terms quickly and return home; Carlton, in turn, drafted compromises that sat well with both of them.After signing the terms of surrender, the Vinard envoys hurriedly left the duchy. Carlton and his men also were on their way back to the castle\u2013already in a celebratory and self-congratulatory mood.\u201cFinally, it\u2019s time to leave. The food was delicious, and the servants served us well.\u201d\u201cSounds like something you\u2019d never say. You said you were frustrated at the missed opportunities to march into battle.\u201d\u201cEven so, the food here was delicious. Somehow, even fresh water tasted divine.\u201d\u201cThen, when are we departing? The day after tomorrow? Tomorrow? We\u2019re not leaving today, are we?\u201d Carlton\u2019s men thought their captain, who always grumbled about being in the south, would immediately order their squad to mobilize. However, Carlton seemed apprehensive.\u201cWell.\u201d Carlton remembered his conversation with Luisen the night before. \u201cAfter observing our surroundings for one week, we should prepare to leave.\u201dIt was an answer quite unlike their captain\u2013hesitation trembled in his voice.\u201cHuh? A whole week?\u201d The men looked at Carlton in surprise.At that time, Carlton was distracted by golden, glistening hair as he passed through the town square. His attention was captivated by Luisen having his meal, surrounded by his subjects.\u2018I told him to be careful, but he\u2019s completely defenseless.\u2019 Carlton frowned disapprovingly.The vice captain of the squad fell into deep contemplation at the sight of his boss\u2019 wandering eyes. \u2018Those two seem to be getting very intimate these days\u2026Some suspicious rumors have been circulating\u2026Don\u2019t tell me, is he delaying departure because of the duke?\u2019Involuntarily, a question slipped from the vice captain\u2019s mouth. \u201cCaptain, do you truly like the duke?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhat kind of ridiculous joke is that? Carlton smiled, throwing the question back at him, but his lieutenant\u2019s face was far too serious.\u201cWhy are you spouting that kind of nonsense with such a serious demeanor?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m serious. There are already all sorts of rumors floating around\u2013that our captain is chasing after the duke.\u201d\u201cHa. Rumors. Do my men believe those servants\u2019 words?\u201d Carlton\u2019s expression twisted.At their captain\u2019s snarl, his men proceeded carefully. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you exceptionally nice to the duke?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019ve been following him around, taking care of situations that pop up around him, and even escorting him safely. You even gave him a ride yesterday. After escorting a perfectly fine and healthy duke, wouldn\u2019t it be natural for some people to start wondering and talking?\u201dCarlton was bewildered. \u2018Me? Liking the duke?\u2019Impossible. Carlton\u2019s taste tended towards men who were smart and mature\u2013those who could rely on themselves. Luisen, though quite clever, was a far cry from mature. Rather, he still seemed like a lost, abandoned child.He felt sorry for Luisen\u2019s hidden circumstances, so he paid extra attention to the lord. However, he didn\u2019t expect to hear these outlandish tales. It was unbearably humiliating to hear that he would chase after such a pathetic fellow.What Carlton loved most was victory. His only goal was to tear down those who had underestimated him and stand tall on their ruins; he couldn\u2019t afford to divide his attention and concentrate leisurely on his love life. Nor did he want to.In addition, Luisen was a noble.\u2018Me? Have a crush on a nobleman? Who would say such a horrible and disgusting thing?\u2019 Carlton shivered with a low groan.Of course, he had to admit that Luisen was a rare beauty\u2013made more divine by the halo of his attitude and status as a great lord. But that was merely an objective assessment\u2026not that he looked special or pretty in his eyes.\u2018No. Absolutely not.\u2019 Carlton adamantly denied it all.\u201cIf not, I\u2019m glad to hear that\u2026We\u2019re busy enough trying to take care of ourselves.\u201d The deputy handed Carlton a small note. It had arrived from the capital while the surrender negotiations were underway. \u201cThis letter is from Ennis, from the capitol.\u201dEnnis was the prince\u2019s maid, a woman who had already joined Carlton\u2019s cause before he headed down to the south. Her letter meant there was a situation brewing against the mercenary in the capital.Carlton read the letter with a grim expression before setting it down. The letter was written in a predetermined cipher such that no one else could uncover its meaning. However, he felt dizzy from the muddled scrawl.The contents were quite short. Ennis informed him that the nobles had recently brought news of various conflicts and advised him to return to the prince\u2019s side as soon as possible. She added that he should be careful as the circumstances of the southern lords seemed suspicious.\u2018Be careful of what?\u2019The Anies duchy was so peaceful, and it seemed as if the aftermath of the chaotic struggle of the kingdom\u2019s throne had not reached this area. Was there something happening out of sight?\u2018I have to let the duke know\u2026.Ah, no. No.\u2019 Carlton couldn\u2019t afford to be caught up in any more southern struggles. If he were to be involved in this power struggle, he may not be able to find even a silver lining in the aftermath. As Ennis said, it was right to quickly leave the south now.In the aftermath of the civil war, Carlton had the most substantive troops. In the case of conflict, Carlton was the most likely candidate to send to the area of dispute.In this situation, the peaceful nature of the south made it seem as if they were laying the groundwork to send Carlton to various places that didn\u2019t truly need his force. If he couldn\u2019t step foot in the capital, he would be unable to undermine the nobles\u2019 efforts.Carlton gritted his teeth; he was sick and tired of these nobles\u2019 tricks and schemes. He wanted to strangle them all, though that was an impossible dream.\u2018I need to go back to the prince\u2019s side, one day sooner than normally possible.\u2019Now the only one who could protect Carlton was Prince Ellion. The prince owed Carlton a great debt\u2013the only way he could settle down in the capital would be to provoke the prince\u2019s conscience.If the body moves away, the mind travels far\u2013gratitude would soon be forgotten. The prince wasn\u2019t a pushover, but he was still a human being.Carlton had to return soon; there wasn\u2019t time to lay around and relax at the duchy. The vague anxiety and nervousness he felt when he first came down to the south came back.\u2018Yes. It\u2019s hard enough to fend for myself,\u2019 he thought.Whether or not Luisen was bullied by his retainers or embroiled in a power struggle with the southern aristocrats mattered not to Carlton. Now, he couldn\u2019t afford to worry about others\u201cIf we prepare to leave all day and night, how long until we are ready to leave?\u201d the mercenary asked.\u201cAround three days.\u201d\u201cTwo days. Be finished with the preparations in two days. Divide those that are fleet footed and those that are slow. After the division, we\u2019ll ride to the capital without rest.\u201d\u201cAre you going to split the troops?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019ll just proceed like we did when we first arrived in the south. Understood.\u201dUnaware of everything that had happened, Luisen was still enjoying his bread. He then suddenly raised his head, looked around, and found Carlton on the horizon. The young lord raised his hand and waved at the mercenary. Under the clear blue sky, his smile shone brilliantly.At first, Luisen had trembled and struggled to make eye contact with him. But when Carlton saw Luisen\u2019s changed attitude, even he had realized the two had gotten too intimate.TL: You get back there mister and say your proper greetings to Luisen!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCarlton sighed.It was reasonable that such a ridiculous rumor that he had affections for Luisen had emerged. He must have been concerned enough about the young lord that it seemed unusual to others.Hesitating to leave because of worries over a noble?That sounded so pathetic.He\u2019d been living too comfortably\u2013immersed in the relaxed and indolent atmosphere unique to the south. He\u2019d become too relaxed. There hadn\u2019t been any battles, and there was no sense of crisis as wealth just rolled in. However, it was time to tighten his resolve sharply again.Alarmed, Carlton vowed to himself, \u2018Keep distance from Luisen and focus on my work.\u2019Carlton deliberately turned a blind eye to the lord\u2019s smile.*****That night, the general gathered Luisen and his retainers in the conference room. There, Luisen heard unexpected news: Carlton and his soldiers had decided to leave in two days.The retainers, who were originally quite anxious, broke into a festive mood. They cheered and hugged each other as if Carlton had already left and all their troubles had come to an end.While everyone was delighted, Luisen was bewildered. He felt increasingly burdened as everyone else said he did well and thanked him.He didn\u2019t feel any better when he returned to his bedroom, took a bath, and changed into his pajamas. Ruger hummed as he combed Luisen\u2019s hair. As Luisen was in a particularly melancholic mood, the song agitated him. \u201cYou seem to be in a good mood.\u201d\u201cOf course! Carlton is leaving! My duke, aren\u2019t you happy?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201d Carlton\u2019s departure would mean that all the hardships he had expected when he returned to the past were over. He had been looking forward to this day for a long time; but, somehow, he was more upset than joyful.The Anies duchy had survived. What now? What should they do now? Thinking of the future made his heart sink, and he became gloomy. It felt a bit similar to staring at a blank exam without being able to write down a single answer.Anxiety made unnecessary worries manifest. \u2018Just, why is he leaving so suddenly? Isn\u2019t two days far too soon?\u2019The road to the capital was long; it was doubtful whether or not Carlton\u2019s troops could finish preparations for that trip within two days. In addition, he was also worried about the Vinard household\u2019s envoys\u2019 testimonies. If what they said was true, there was an unknown danger lurking outside the castle. They\u2019d be traveling with a large amount of supplies and wealth; they should at least send a small advance team to scout the area.Last night, Carlton seemed to accept Luisen\u2019s suggestion to be careful. He thought that the mercenary would spend a few leisurely days preparing and finishing up their duties. \u2018Why did he suddenly change his mind?\u2019Furthermore, he did not directly hear this change from Carlton himself but, instead, from the general. Luisen thought the other would at least let him know when he had planned to leave. The abruptness was strange and upsetting.Ignorant to Luisen\u2019s innermost thoughts, Ruger said excitedly, \u201cMy duke, you\u2019re happy, aren\u2019t you? When Carlton leaves, we can pack quickly and return to the capital!\u201d\u201cThe capital? There\u2019s a lot of things left to do here.\u201d\u201cWhat does my lord have to do here?\u201d\u201cI need to take care of the estate\u2013I\u2019m the lord after all.\u201d\u201cSince when have you paid attention to your noble duties? Even if the duke isn\u2019t there, the general will be present; the duchy will be fine without you,\u201d said the attendant.Luisen became depressed at Ruger\u2019s words\u2013he wasn\u2019t completely wrong, after all.\u201cTell the others to do those boring and difficult things. Isn\u2019t that what retainers are for? They need things to do as well. Let\u2019s go to the capital and party and drink\u2013have fun\u2013like before,\u201d Ruger said.\u201cWhat party\u2026All our friends are dead\u2026\u201d\u201cThen we should make new friends. Everyone\u2019s impatient to get to know you, my duke. Why must you continue to only say such depressing things? As expected, the capital and the city fit us better. Being stuck in the countryside has only made you worry and be bleak.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious right now\u2013our future is bleak.\u201dThe thing Luisen was most scared of was that his knowledge of the future was now useless due to all the changes in the timeline. So far, he had made up for his lack of ability with his knowledge of the future, but that nest egg was soon running out.Ruger gently patted and smoothed his hair as if to console him. \u201cWhat is my duke worried about when he has me?\u201dThen, he talked about how bad the situation was in the duchy and how they could have enjoyed themselves in the capital. His smooth talking was so efficient that his words could have crafted memories that didn\u2019t even exist. However, none of his flamboyant speech penetrated Luisen\u2019s ears.\u2018I should tell Carlton to go slower. I need to steel myself as well,\u2019 Luisen thought.It was too late today\u2013tomorrow, then.He\u2019d meet Carlton again and try to convince him.\"\"*****The next day, Luisen headed to the general\u2019s office instead of going to the lower village. Now that Carlton was preparing to leave and the gates to the estate were opening, other work had appeared.Luisen shadowed the general to learn about his duties and met with the retainers in the conference room to discuss the next steps after Carlton\u2019s departure. All he did was sit at the head of the table and listen to the others\u2019 words, but the retainers were very satisfied with that alone. They found it miraculous that their lord, who was usually busy running away and playing around, had sat through the whole discussion.In his free time, he completed the homework and studies given to him by the general and the treasurer.The lack of rest felt unfair, but Luisen was reaping his own karma.In between all that, Luisen tried to meet with Carlton. Before, he used to be able to see the mercenary whenever he wished, but recently he hadn\u2019t been able to see even the tip of his nose.Of course, Luisen was also busy. Whenever Luisen tried to visit Carlton, a servant or one of the knights suddenly appeared from somewhere and dragged him away, saying that the general was calling for him. Then, when he visited the general, he was only given more homework.\u2018This is too strange?\u2019But the biggest problem was not the retainers who followed Luisen around like baby birds, but Carlton himself.Before, Luisen could find the mercenary without much effort; today, he couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. After waiting for him, Luisen had decided to visit him first. However, his efforts were in vain, as the other was always said to be busy or not present. He waited\u2013eyes wide open\u2013and when he saw Carlton appear at the castle, he chased him, but the mercenary disappeared again.\u2018Are you avoiding me\u2026?\u2019 As understandable doubt began to arise within him, Luisen slowly grew angry.\u2018No, I\u2019d understand if we\u2019re too busy to meet. But don\u2019t you think you should say goodbye before leaving?\u2019 No matter what others may have said, Luisen was still the owner of this castle. If one settled down in another\u2019s castle for more than a month, it would be polite and proper to leave their greetings before they left. Of course, the two didn\u2019t meet under the best of conditions, but they\u2019d been doing well since. Furthermore, they may meet again in the capital or city in the future\u2026Now that it had come to this, Luisen was agitated even by Carlton\u2019s choice to ignore Luisen\u2019s greeting down at the lower village. \u2018Was this because I kept trying to feed him the buried old hags? I was only joking\u2026why is he avoiding me? Did I give him any reason to do so? He even asked if there was a chance we could meet again in the capital.\u2019Recalling that night, Luisen felt as if he hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. The atmosphere at that time was harmonious and pleasant.\u2018In fact, there was no problem if we just left it like this,\u2019 Luisen thought. \u2018As the others have said, it\u2019s supposed to be great news that Carlton can leave quickly.\u2019 It was none of Luisen\u2019s business whether or not Carlton would rush himself into an accident.However, Luisen did not want to part with the man like this.Carlton\u2019s departure from the duchy meant more to him than the others. The war that changed Luisen\u2019s life had ended; the long journey to correct his mistake of abandoning his estate and fleeing his troubles had finally come to an end.Luisen had long been chased by the mercenary and had been afraid of him for a very long time\u2013his appearance had destroyed the foolish young lord\u2019s perfect life. Many things had changed since the regression. He felt as if Carlton had acknowledged him to some extent, and Luisen was also not as afraid of Carlton as he was before. The relationship with the mercenary was like a symbol of the correct choices the lord had made after regression.That was why Luisen wanted to see Carlton off.\u2018In this situation\u2026.\u2019The saint had said that those who hesitate and procrastinate would eventually find their life had come to an end. If your target is avoiding you, you should confront them when they can\u2019t escape.Luisen waited deeply for the quiet, lonely night to fall upon the castle.***He sneaked out of the room at the right time\u2013if Luisen were to meet any servants, they may block his efforts, so he observed his surroundings carefully as he headed to Carlton\u2019s room.The lights were off in his bedroom, and Luisen charged right in. The room was dark, but Luisen knew the layout well since this room had once been his. Getting to the bed was no real trouble.Carlton was laying on the bed.\u2018He\u2019s sleeping so well.\u2019However, sleeping well or not, that wasn\u2019t going to stop the motivated Luisen. The lord approached Carlton carefully, taking caution not to wake him, with outstretched hands. But, before that hand could reach Carlton\u2019s shoulder, Carlton pulled on Luisen\u2019s wrist\u201cHuh? Hnnrk!?\u201d Luisen was dragged along, just like that. His body was turned halfway around and thrown onto the fluffy bed; his eyes were spinning from the rapid change in momentum. Carlton held down Luisen\u2019s chest tightly with one arm, and in one smooth flourish,\u00a0he held a dagger to the lord\u2019s throat with his other.TL: Well that\u2019s going to fan more rumors! How bold~ going to a man\u2019s bedroom late at night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Me.\u201d\u201cDuke\u2026.\u201d Carlton frowned, still half-asleep. His voice also sounded guarded.\u201cYes, I\u2019m the duke. You understand now? Let\u2019s take away this dagger first.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. In my sleep I just\u2013.\u201dHe brandishes his dagger in his sleep? This person\u2013wasn\u2019t this a big accident waiting to happen? This was a horrible sleeping habit. In addition, Carlton was naked; because Luisen was dressed only in pajamas, his bare skin could be felt through the thin cloth.The definition of his firm muscles was clear. In particular, the touch of a certain area alongside Luisen\u2019s thigh was very, very explicit. Was this a leg? Did he have another leg? The presence and size of\u00a0that thing\u00a0was just intense.Cold sweat ran down Luisen\u2019s back.\u201cWhy is the duke here? In this flimsy outfit.\u201d Carlton fiddled with the bunched-up cloth at Luisen\u2019s waist without hesitation.\u2018Is he still not yet awake?!\u2019 Luisen rubbed at his arms. Carlton was only touching his clothes, but it felt as if he was directly rubbing him instead. \u201cThe only thing I had to wear was pajamas. The last time I snuck out of the room, I was caught digging up the buried old hags by Ruger. After that he took away all my clothes, telling me not to walk around alone at night.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why you crawled into this bed in only your pajamas this late at night?\u201d\u201cAs for the bed, you pulled me into it. Who said I crawled in\u2026\u201d Luisen explained himself even though he didn\u2019t understand why he had to make such excuses to Carlton. The lord\u2019s gaze wandered at nothing particular. Carlton\u2019s eyes were strangely persistent, and it was hard to make eye contact. But it was even more embarrassing to look down; he could see everything from his smooth chest to his washboard abs\u2013and to what was underneath. The strange atmosphere was driving him crazy.\u201cOf course, why would the duke\u2026\u201d Carlton stared down at Luisen before saying something mysterious.\u201cWhat are you saying? Get off now! And wear some clothes! This is so embarrassing\u2026\u201dCarlton finally got out of bed and dressed himself. Luisen also rushed out of bed, feeling like it wasn\u2019t proper for him to be there either.Luisen sat upright at a table, and soon Carlton sat in front of him. The lord finally felt at ease when he saw that the other was dressed properly, both top and bottom.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Carlton asked. He was straightforward, cutting to the point rather than running in circles. He could have asked more courteously, but he was distracted by the previous situation.\u201cWhy are you leaving so soon? You said you were leaving in two days? Actually, it\u2019s been a day, so you\u2019re leaving tomorrow?\u201d\u201cIt just happened that way.\u201d\u201cThen, are your preparations for departure going well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need anything?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u2018What in the world, why are his answers so short and insincere?\u2019 Luisen was displeased. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot you need to take. If you leave on such short notice, there\u2019s bound to be some trouble.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Did you come here just to talk about this? It\u2019s already been decided,\u201d Carlton replied testily, furrowing his eyebrows. His curt tone was the same as usual. However, Luisen noticed Carlton had turned his words around on him because he must have also been aware he was overdoing things.\u2018That\u2019s right. Two days was far too hasty. Why are you in such a hurry when even you realize this foolhardiness.\u2019There must be a reason; Luisen squinted his eyes and examined the mercenary. Carlton raised his chin slightly, as if to say, \u2018What of it?\u2019\u201cDid you check out the Vinard envoys\u2019 stories?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHow about you send reconnaissance first for safety? You don\u2019t know what danger may lie ahead.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t afford that kind of leisure.\u201d\u201cWhat would happen if you were to get attacked? You could encounter some weird occurrences like what happened to the Vinard men.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re prepared for an attack.\u201dLuisen was worried, but none of that seemed to make it through to the mercenary.\u201cIf there\u2019s a problem, I can solve it. If anyone attacks us, we\u2019ll destroy them. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing so far. There\u2019s nothing that can block my path.\u201d Carlton expressed absolute confidence in his ability to take matters into his own hands. His strength was overwhelming enough that nothing else could compare. His leadership was outstanding, his mind was quick, and he had a youthful spirit of determination, ready to solve anything in his way.His arrogance was understandable, considering he rose to his position solely through his own abilities; but Luisen, who had already lived through his eventual downfall, was nervous.Would Carlton\u2019s situation be better compared to how it was before his regression?Luisen was lost in thought.The mercenary hadn\u2019t done anything extreme, and his relationship with Luisen was good. The power that the south could have lost was preserved, and substantial spoils were obtained. But, that didn\u2019t secure his future. There were still nobles who viewed Carlton as an eyesore as long as he retained the first prince\u2019s trust.During that time, Luisen had been busy being chased out by friends and relatives alike. Body trembling at the betrayal, he vowed revenge for the first time in life, completely out of his mind. Later, he had heard that Carlton was sent to the northwest to eradicate monsters and was kicked to the country\u2019s peripheries.At those thoughts, Luisen realized why Carlton was in such a rush.\u201cI see you\u2019re trying to get back to the first prince\u2019s side as soon as possible. Has something happened in the capital? Are they sending you to battle someplace else?\u201d\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d\u201cNo, I just guessed.\u201d His guesses were based on past memories, but he could only vaguely explain himself because he couldn\u2019t tell the truth.\u201cThe duke\u2019s brilliance surprises me once again.\u201d Carlton was suddenly dispirited.\u2018Who\u2019s worried about who now?\u2019 the mercenary thought. It felt foolish to ignore Ennis\u2019 advice to not get tangled in the southern aristocracy\u2019s fight and tell Luisen that the situation in the south was suspicious, especially with respect to what was happening in the capital.He was worried about leaving Luisen here, where he had not a single ally; he had thought about asking the lord to go with him to the capital. When he saw Luisen\u2019s fumbling form and his gullibility, his heart weakened, so he purposely avoided seeing him. But, all that effort was in vain.No matter what, he was still a smart, wealthy great lord. Right now his prospects may have been gloomy, but his future was bright. Luisen was completely different from him\u2013a small lantern in a windy field.For a very short time, due to the extraordinary circumstances of the civil war, Carlton had the upper hand over Luisen. But he and Luisen were from two completely different worlds. Did that mean Luisen was safe no matter how many mistakes he may make, and that the mercenary would be in an unstable position no matter how many times he may win?Could they meet again in the capital? He was not confident he would be able to hold out and stay in favor until Luisen arrived.A long-held sense of inferiority wriggled and burned in Carlton\u2019s stomach.Not much would change in one or two days.Luisen\u2019s attitude was based on his pre-regression memories, but it didn\u2019t seem quite so straightforward to Carlton. Carlton was nervous because he didn\u2019t know how the prince\u2019s mind may change as every minute\u2013every second\u2013passed, let alone one or two days.\u201cIt\u2019s not something the duke should be concerned with,\u201d Carlton cleared his expression and said icily.\u00a0 His sharp, pointed, and somewhat aggressive tone pierced Luisen\u2019s ears. \u201cHave you forgotten? I\u2019m here to occupy the duchy. Shouldn\u2019t you, rather, be grateful for my quick departure?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re done talking, then you should leave.\u201dWith the driest of blessings, Luisen left the room despondently.Disregarding whether or not others saw him, Luisen trudged away with concerned steps. Carlton\u2019s men and several patrolling servants confronted him, asking why he had been in Carlton\u2019s room, but Luisen only gave half-hearted answers.Hadn\u2019t they gotten too close to grasp at straws over their technical status as enemies?On one hand, he was deeply saddened by Carlton\u2019s remarks that drew a line between them; on the other hand, he understood his deep concerns over his troubling and precarious situation. Luisen realized why Carlton\u2019s heart seemed so burdened ever since he\u2019d announced he would leave soon. \u2018He\u2019s nervous\u2026\u2019The same was true of Luisen, whose future was now uncertain.Luisen truly thought he had done well after regression. Both the duchy and its citizens were safe, and he had been recognized by his retainers. His reputation in the south had also improved.The duke had shown off both inside and outside the castle, so the risk of losing everything futilely, as had happened before regression, had disappeared. He assumed that if he maintained a duke\u2019s dignity, even the first prince would not be able to mess with him very much.Everything had gone well, but Luisen still held ambiguous feelings.He\u2019d done well so far. He\u2019d changed a lot of things.But that was the problem. With the knowledge of the future, he was able to overcome the crisis facing him well. In the future, however, Luisen would approach the unknown future step by step; there would be unknown crises. There would come a time when his knowledge of the future would be of no help. What was he supposed to do then?Luisen had an optimistic temperament, but he was infinitely pessimistic about his own abilities.\u2018What if I make the wrong choice again?\u2019During his trips back and forth to the village, Luisen had realized just how influential he was. Many people\u2019s lives were controlled by his actions; a thoughtless judgment could destroy the lives which the ordinary citizens had built painstakingly and sincerely.TL: Carlton canonically\u00a0large(Sorry, I have nothing particularly intelligent to say besides that.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayGuardian of the golden fields.The title, which felt as lofty and hazy as a cloud, materialized in reality, gaining skin and eyes through the young lord. The weight of that title weighed heavier than ever on Luisen.He\u2019d made wrong decisions before, so was there any guarantee he wouldn\u2019t mess things up again? There wasn\u2019t. Luisen became miserable, caught up in vague fantasies of everything that could go wrong. Fear ate reason, pushing him into anxiety and depression\u2013making it hard for him to think.\u2018It\u2019s not good to dwell like this\u2026.\u2019 Luisen shook his head. \u2018What did the saint say to do when one becomes depressed? He said to make the body exhausted.\u2019Luisen was a faithful believer and walked tirelessly through the palace halls, as if he believed that such continual pacing would end his anxiety.****Time flew by, and soon it became the day of Carlton\u2019s departure.With the sun dimly shining in the sky, it was even quieter than nighttime; the cold early morning air was icy. The preparations for departure had finally finished.As soon as Carlton walked out, his men brought the horses. He patted at the horse\u2019s glossy mane, checking its condition. They planned to make the long trip to the capital without stopping. Those who could not keep up with their captain\u2019s speed would set off on a different path, earlier than the others.In a way, he was more cautious going back to the capital than he was coming down south. Carlton had wondered if there was a need to go this far, but he was bothered to hear about the schemes that the south\u2019s nobles were conspiring.As Luisen had advised, he wished he could send an advance reconnaissance team, but he couldn\u2019t afford that.Carlton looked back at the duke\u2019s castle.It was an incredibly large and old building. He remembered how shocked he was to see such a grand building when he first arrived. Even then he was eager to leave even a day faster and return quickly; now that it was time to leave, he felt bittersweet. He had run into many headaches and annoyances here, but despite everything, he had been more comfortable here than anywhere else.There was food all over the place; the skies were always clear and blued. He felt relaxed and merciful just looking at the open fields. Perhaps this was why the southerners were so relaxed and complacent: living their whole lives in places like this, there must not have been much to worry about.\u2018This is the last I\u2019ll be here; maybe I should have said my proper goodbyes.\u2019 Regrets still lingered in him. However, it was already time to leave.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cYes.\u201dAt Carlton\u2019s order, everyone mounted their horses. Just as Carlton mounted his horse, a glistening head of hair popped out of the castle through the early morning fog. It was Luisen.\u201cAh, what a relief. You haven\u2019t left yet.\u201dCarlton was surprised by the lord\u2019s unexpected appearance. \u201cI thought we decided that send offs were unnecessary?\u201d His tone was rough but curiously soft.\u201cAh, I wanted to ask you for a favor with this.\u201d Luisen held out a small package and a letter. Carlton looked down at his outstretched hands without taking it. \u201cWhen you get to the capital, would you please hand this to Marquis Natrang?\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t Marquis Natrang the former commander-in-chief?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Though he\u2019s just a retired man now.\u201d\u201cEven though he may be retired, the Marquis wouldn\u2019t deign to meet with a man like me.\u201d\u201cIf you use my name, you\u2019ll be able to meet him. Please say it\u2019s a belated birthday present and make sure to give it to him.\u201d\u201cDid you run out of the castle just for this?\u201d\u201cIt just crossed my mind a moment ago.\u201dCarlton creased his brows. It felt too forced, remembering an acquaintance\u2019s birthday present all of a sudden and insisting on Carlton as his messenger. After all, now the duke could send one of his own men. That would reflect better on his image.Heedless of Carlton\u2019s thoughts, Luisen quickly continued, \u201cMarquis Natrang is an ill-tempered but romantic old man. He\u2019ll kindly view your warrior-like spirit and temperament. When you go to the capital, search out people like him\u2013those who know the horrors of the battlefield and will value your reckless ambition the most.\u201d\u201cThen, this is\u2026\u201dThe gift and the letter were an excuse to give Carlton a chance to meet the Marquis. Carlton, who made the largest contributions in the war but had the worst reputation, had no title or land to his name. If he wanted to meet somelike like Marquis Natrang, he\u2019d have to make use of Duke Anies\u2019 handwritten letter.In reality, it was a gift to Carlton. The mercenary never thought he\u2019d receive such a parting gift; he looked at him suspiciously. \u201cWhy are you helping me?\u201dConsidering his actions, Carlton would have nothing to say to defend himself if Luisen held a grudge against him. When his temper ran out of control, he behaved awfully with the young lord.\u201cWho knows,\u201d Luisen said.The young lord spent all night thinking and ran out to hand him a present\u2013and all Carlton had to give in return were his doubts.That was so like Carlton, Luisen couldn\u2019t help but smile. Last night, after talking to Carlton, Luisen had been locked down by his anxieties and kept thinking about him. Carlton\u2019s rush to leave also tugged at his mind.\u2018Why?\u2019 He searched for the reason, but was only able to reach a conclusion just a while ago.\u201cI want you to be successful,\u201d Luisen said.Before regression, Luisen and Carlton had both made wrong decisions in the Anies duchy. Carlton was still a troubling existence for Luisen, but he hoped, nevertheless, that Carlton too would face a different future.After all, if his future changes, won\u2019t Luisen\u2019s future change as well?It was an irrational and superstitious belief\u2013and their future had nothing to do with each other\u2013but Luisen would feel at peace if the other lived his best life. He had to give an excuse, create some pretext to hide that he had been running around all night, to hide his ridiculous logic.\u201cHurry and take it.\u201d Luisen forced the package into Carlton\u2019s hands. The mercenary stared blankly at Luisen while holding the package.Carlton had never heard something so shameless in his entire life. No one\u2013no parents, brothers, nor friends\u2013had said something like that to him. \u2018Really\u2026There\u2019s people like him in the world?\u2019He received another blow from Luisen; the young lord was really a man who exceeded expectations till the end.Carlton\u2019s heart pounded violently. His pulse raced, chills traveled up his spine, and his face felt flushed with heat.The sounds in the background seemed to grow further away; everything except Luisen was erased. It felt like he and the lord were the only ones left in the world. All of his senses were directed on Luisen.Luisen\u2019s blue eyes wandered the air before refocusing on Carlton; the wind tousled his hair. The mercenary\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but look at the slight movement of his hair and the pale red of his blush. Luisen\u2019s low laugh, hiding his embarrassment, shook his heart.\u2018Why am I like this? Why is my heart racing so suddenly? Am I just shocked?\u2019 Carlton was confused.At that moment, Carlton\u2019s men called out to him, \u201cCaptain.\u201dAs if someone had poured cold water on him, Carlton came to his senses; his men and Luisen looked at him strangely.\u201cWe have to leave.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve held up someone who has a long road ahead of him, it seems. Have a safe trip.\u201dCarlton almost blurted out that he was fine, to continue to take up his time. Fortunately, or unfortunately, logic returned and he chose the appropriate words carefully. His goodbyes. \u201c\u2026\u2026Yes. Take care of yourself too, Duke.\u201dLuisen ran back into the castle afterwards. Somehow the growing distance between him and the lord\u2019s retreating back was so bittersweet; Carlton couldn\u2019t take his eyes off of him. Only when Luisen closed the door did he manage to remount his horse and set off. And even then, again and again, he would look back in regret, but he was unable to stop his horse.*****Luisen woke up in the middle of the day after making up for the loss of sleep the night before. Carlton and his men had disappeared neatly, without a trace.Luisen had returned to the lord\u2019s chamber, which had been turned over to Carlton. Not one echo of the mercenary remained in the tidy room. The cleanliness was all thanks to the butler and the servants who worked hard to prepare the room for Luisen, but the emptiness felt somehow unfamiliar. Luisen stared blankly at his desk for a while.The entire castle was in a festive mood; it was their long-awaited liberation day.No more monitoring of the people in the castle; no more restrictions on their actions. The displeasure of watching strangers walk around the castle as if it were their own home had ended. There was no longer a need to walk on thin ice with bated breaths.The wide open front gates were like the symbol of the end of hardship.\u00a0 Those who were looking forward to the official opening cheered. As if it were waiting on the other side, a cart carrying wheat came in; families and lovers who had been separated due to unavoidable circumstances reunited in tears.Under a clear autumn sky, the people\u2019s laughter spread around the town.Carlton, famous for his cruelty, brought forth a dismal mood of death when the duchy fell under his control, but now that he had left, the duchy had not lost much. Few people had died and the castle\u2019s infrastructure remained intact.With this situation, public opinion, those who were previously mocking Luisen\u2019s surrender, had also been turned on its head. He became known as the clever lord who had gained much by putting aside his pride. They had praised the Duke of Anies as one who was adaptable and able to modernize.Without paying attention to how the people gossiped, Luisen led a busy life.He had to collect taxes, run delayed trials, and return the administrative structure to normal. The other southern lords would probably send men for their own safety and spying, so he had to prepare to deal with them. Before, Luisen might have left this work to his retainers, but he, with the intent to learn, slowly made some progress in his duties.He just had to try.He had been so nervous before Carlton had left, but as the days passed, his anxiety diminished.\u2018As the saint said, humans are fascinating individuals\u2013when a crisis approaches, they will do whatever it takes.\u2019 Luisen once again praised the saint\u2019s wisdom.TL: The end of an arc~ I do find it fascinating how the dynamic has changed between the two and how the power struggle has shifted.Also, a note for those that aren\u2019t in the discord, I\u2019ll be going on a vacation for 11 days, so my updates will be more sporadic. I won\u2019t stop, but I might also have less time to TL!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was a knight named Godric, claiming to be a messenger from the first prince. Luisen had also seen this man a few times around the royal palace.Luisen greeted him personally; the man seemed incredibly exhausted. \u201cDid you travel all the way here from the royal palace without taking a break? You look very tired.\u201d\u201cNot at all. I had stopped by Count Dubless\u2019 estate on the way here and rested. However, I got lost in the woods and got into a fight with a swarm of monsters.\u201d\u201cJust where did you wander to for you to encounter monsters?\u201d The road through the woods was familiar to Luisen; there was little chance for him to stumble into a monster encampment.\u201cI don\u2019t know either. It was incredibly foggy in the forest. So, I lost my way and wandered for a long while.\u201dFog?When he mentioned the fog, Luisen was reminded of the thick fog that the Vinard envoy reported. The main road to Vinard was far from the forest\u2013and fog was a common weather occurrence there as well\u2013so the two may have been unrelated. However, he felt discomfited.\u2018Is Carlton going to be okay?\u2019 Luisen was worried for the man, but for now, he had to deal with an envoy in the present; he shoved the worry to the back of his mind.\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve suffered on your journey here. What brings you here?\u201d\u201cI bring a message from my prince to the duke.\u201d Despite the tired lines on his face, Godric pepped up and delivered the first prince\u2019s message. The content was quite simple, if one were to cut out the lengthy wordiness as required by etiquette.\u201cHe desires my presence in the capital? Right now?\u201d\"\"\u201cYes. I sympathize with the current messy state of affairs, but we thought it would be more secure for you to arrive alongside Sir Carlton. Come to think of it, where is Sir Carlton?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026already left\u2026.\u201d\u201cHuh? I hadn\u2019t heard about that.\u201d This was a large setback for Sir Godrick. \u201cHas it been long since he left?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a few days\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a shame. He\u2019ll probably already be far on his way. What should we do?\u201d Godric contemplated for a while before proposing something else, \u201cI\u2019ll leave before the duke and ask Sir Carlton to turn around. In the meantime, please prepare yourself for the journey.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m a bit busy currently with the internal estate affairs. I\u2019ll send a representative.\u201dGodric was flustered when Luisen flatly refused. Luisen Anies rejected a trip to the capital? But the lord seemed sincere. Godric observed his surroundings before carefully leaning towards Luisen, whispering, \u201cOur majesty is in poor health.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s always been in poor health.\u201d\u201cIt seems that this time it\u2019s quite serious.\u201dLuisen\u2019s expression froze. The situation had changed. If the king was truly in critical condition, Luisen had to go to the capital. It was his duty and right as a great lord to nominate the next king and prepare for the coronation. \u201cDo the other great lords know of the king\u2019s critical condition?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI see. If that\u2019s the case, then I must go.\u201d Luisen ordered a servant to guide Godric to rest. He then called in the retainers that were waiting outside.\u201cThe prince is asking me to come to the capital,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cIs that the reason for the messenger\u2019s visit?\u201d\u201cYes. The public excuse will be to discuss the repatriation of prisoners of war. However, the reality is that the king is gravely ill.\u201d Luisen nodded.\u201c\u2026It seems that the prince is asking you to prepare for the next era.\u201d\u201cAre all the other great lords gathering at the capital?\u201d\u201cNot yet. It seems I was the first one he\u2019s called.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Then the first prince must have other issues he\u2019d like to discuss with my lord,\u201d the general pointed out sharply.\u201c\u2026Doesn\u2019t it feel a bit suspicious?\u201d the treasurer questioned. The knight commander agreed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s strange that the messenger arrived as soon as Carlton departed. And saying how he wandered around in the forest because of fog and monsters. That doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201dThe retainers had a point. Luisen also inwardly held suspicions about the situation because of all of these strange coincidences. \u201cBut all we have are suspicions. That\u2019s no excuse to disobey the words of the king.\u201d\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d\u201cHa, I thought we\u2019d be able to finally take care of the estate business\u2026\u201d the treasurer lamented.Luisen and his retainers talked more afterwards, but everyone concluded that the lord had to go to the capital. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I need to do in the capital, please let me know in advance. I\u2019ll need to settle some credit while I finish my business there.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAnd if the king dies\u2026I\u2019ll have to stay for quite a while in order to prepare for the coronation. I\u2019ll have to trouble the general with the work, as I have done before.\u201d\u201cNot at all. My lord, you have more important things to do.\u201dLuisen had tried to concentrate on his lordly duties, but even that plan fell apart. He had never been so reluctant to return to the capital.\u201cThe messenger said he spent a few days in the woods, right? Then you must hurry. We do not know how the conditions of the area have deteriorated by now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re busy, but I\u2019ll have to rush you all,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. We\u2019re more worried about your escort than anything else. The number of knights still left in the estate are\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry about that. The messenger said they would depart ahead of us and call for Sir Carlton.\u201d\u201cCarlton?\u201d The general was startled at his words. This was true of the other retainers.\u201cWhy, of all people, would they call that son of a bitch again? I\u2019d rather you take all the knights in this land!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll follow you instead.\u201d\u201cTraveling alone to the capital with a scoundrel like him? Absolutely not!\u201dLuisen was mystified.Was this truly something that required them to protest so vehemently\u2013blood veins popping out in their necks?\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Sir Carlton will be good to me. He\u2019s not such a rude person.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be an issue for him to be *good* to you!\u201d The chancellor couldn\u2019t exactly explain in detail because he was worried it would be too shocking for Luisen. The older man was angry and his chest felt incredibly stuffy. He didn\u2019t live to such an old age to see something like this!!At any rate, despite how the retainers felt, Godric would, after his break, leave to call upon Carlton. The road they\u2019d take would be the same, so they should meet halfway.Luisen began preparing to head for the capital.Preparing for this type of trip was no ordinary business. Usually, he brought the servants, attendants, and knights attached to Luisen\u2019s personal detail; with Luisen\u2019s luggage and the luggage of his escort detail combined, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say an entire mansion would be moving. This time, he had to hurry more than before, so he reduced the detail and omitted a lot. However, he still had much to pack. Putting his chief attendant in charge of the journey, Ruger became incredibly busy.Luisen thought that Ruger would like this change, since he begged and begged to return to the capital; but now that the hour had arrived, he didn\u2019t seem so pleased. His chattiness decreased, and it seemed that a lot was on his mind.\u2018What\u2019s wrong with him?\u2019 Ruger\u2019s behavior bothered Luisen, but he had too much to do before he left for the capital. Luisen couldn\u2019t afford to also ask after the concerns in Ruger\u2019s heart. He discussed with the retainers the work that was needed to be done in the estate during his absence, the work to be done at the capital, and the necessity to watch one\u2019s conduct in front of others.It was not long before Luisen left his estate.*****The carriage drove without a hitch along the far-reaching straight stretch of the road. No matter how much they traveled and traveled, there was no end to the vast fields next to the roads. Then, when it was time to rest for meals, they stopped and ate; at night, they slept in nearby villages.The villagers remained calm despite the appearance of the lord and his retinue because this was the road that Luisen often took on his journeys between the capital and the duchy. The journey started with a great deal of frustration, but the road was surprisingly smooth.Luisen laid a book on his lap and looked out of the window. The wind blew gently; he could hear the sounds of his knights\u2019 conversations. At first, they were so nervous that they kept quiet, busy being wary of the surrounding areas, but as time went on and the plains continued without any problems, joking commenced.A boring, sluggish atmosphere enveloped the party.Luisen turned his head and looked at Ruger. Ruger was lost in thought, gaze far away. He used to sing about his desires to return, but Ruger seemed distracted throughout the entire trip.\u201cHow much longer do we have?\u201d\u201cA little further and we\u2019ll be out of the duchy.\u201dAs soon as Luisen asked, Ruger answered. When Luisen stretched his neck out of the window, looking straight at the horse, he saw a small forest in the distance. \u201cI see there\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re drowsy, please go to sleep.\u201d\u201cNo, if I sleep now, I won\u2019t be able to sleep tonight.\u201d Luisen yawned and leaned his head against the wall of the carriage; his eyelids became heavy. Ruger covered Luisen with a thin blanket and neatly arranged his hair. The touch seemed quite affectionate, and Luisen was soon falling asleep.\u201cJust go to sleep. If you sleep, the journey will be finished soon.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be that fast, Luisen tried to say, but he was so very sleepy. Luisen\u2019s eyes closed.***\u201cMy lord!\u201dScreams and cries awoke Luisen with a start\u2013there was a commotion outside.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 What had happened while he briefly closed his eyes?He couldn\u2019t even see Ruger within the carriage.When Luisen opened the carriage door, the weather was foggy enough to make it hard to see an inch ahead, even in the middle of the day. Wolf-like monsters were attacking the party\u2013Direwolves.\u2018Why are there Direwolves here?\u2019 This road was frequently used by travelers, so monsters were regularly exterminated here. It was not a place where Direwolves would often come out in throes like this. Although individually they weren\u2019t that powerful, in a throng the wolves become difficult and dangerous through group strategies.Dozens of pairs of red eyes could be seen through the fog.\u2018Awoooooooooo.\u2019 The Direwolves\u2019 cries echoed through the air. Then, they all looked at the carriage in unison.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At times like this, it was better for someone weak like him to be holed up somewhere instead of getting in the way of those more talented than him\u2013staying still would help the knights.\u201cProtect the lord!\u201d\u201cForm a defensive line around the carriage!\u201dIt was a sudden ambush that no one had expected; furthermore, the fog was so thick that they could not even see an inch ahead of their noses. Still, the knights moved as they were trained, in perfect synchronization, to protect Luisen.But the fog was too thick to cope with the monsters\u2019 attacks. On the other hand, the direwolves attacked the knights as if the fog weren\u2019t an issue.Their formation collapsed in an instant. A direwolf broke through the line of knights and hit the carriage; the carriage fell on its side.\u201cArgh!\u201d Luisen slipped to the side alongside the carriage. Simultaneously, he hit his head on the seats; his head felt dizzy\u2013the hit ringing through his brain. Meanwhile, the direwolf ripped off the carriage door.\u201cThis mongrel bastard, how dare it!\u201d A knight staked the direwolf with a spear, but three other direwolves rushed into the carriage. One bit at the knight\u2019s arm, and another grabbed onto Luisen with its maw. Somehow, they seemed to be aiming to capture the young lord.Luisen swung his book wildly. \u201cGet away!\u201dLuisen was resisting in his own way, but the monster would not retreat. Gripping onto Luisen\u2019s leg, they crawled out of the carriage; the direwolves\u2019 sharp teeth dug into his calf.\u201cAhhh!!\u201d\u201cMy lord!\u201dAfter being dragged out, he could see that the situation outside was, to put it nicely, in shambles. Through the thick fog, he could see direwolves unilaterally attacking his escorts. One person collapsed with a scream, red blood splattering everywhere.\u2018Where did all these direwolves come from?\u2019Even the thick fog surrounding his party seemed unusual.The fog.This fog continued to be a problem, throughout the Vinard envoys\u2019 and the first prince\u2019s messenger.The direwolves gave Luisen no time to think calmly. One of them bit Luisen\u2019s cape and began to run away. Luisen struggled, but he was not good enough to escape from the monsters; he was dragged along. The areas where the direwolf bit were swept along the ground, chafing and bringing great pain.The cape strangled the lord, suffocating him and making him dizzy. The direwolf dragged Luisen up the hillside; though it nimbly avoided all obstacles, Luisen was not nearly so lucky. He was hit by various branches and stones. It felt as if his bones had broken, and his flesh was torn, bleeding profusely.\u201cNnngh\u201d Luisen was flung and hit his head on the ground and had to swallow rising nausea. He tried to curl up and cough.The direwolves didn\u2019t approach the lord. Instead, they stayed at a certain distance, circling around him; they growled a warning as soon as Luisen raised his head.\u2018What do they want me to do?\u2019 Luisen\u2019s mouth felt parched. A wolf the size of the carriage was horrifyingly glaring at him. Its big fangs seemed ready to bite him at any moment. He was completely suppressed by the monster\u2019s bloodlust and couldn\u2019t move.But, even in the midst of fear, he noticed something strange. There were only two reasons for monsters to attack humans: their territory had been invaded, or they were trying to grab a meal.Direwolves were quite clever for a monster, but they were still monsters in the end. There was no reason to capture a human alive and throw him in some empty clearing to\u2026appreciate him? Luisen had heard that direwolves would intentionally save weak prey to teach their young to hunt, but he couldn\u2019t see the pups anywhere.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Luisen was incredibly puzzled. What was with the fog, and what was with these monsters\u2019 strange behavior?At that moment, he could hear the sound of footsteps. A human\u2019s footsteps.A familiar face quietly emerged from amongst the thick bushes.\u2018Ruger!\u2019 Elated to see him, Luisen almost called out to him. But he managed to shut his mouth, unwilling to bring attention to his attendant\u2019s approach. \u2018He\u2019s come to rescue me!\u2019Luisen was so happy to see Ruger\u2013he was driven to tears. He had been wondering where his attendant had vanished!But Luisen\u2019s pleased feelings did not last long: Ruger was alone.No matter how talented Ruger was with swordsmanship for a servant, Luisen knew he wasn\u2019t capable enough to deal with ten direwolves alone. If he had that kind of ability, he would have become a knight and not an attendant.In other words, the situation had not changed much even if Ruger had arrived.\u2018Damn. If it were Carlton who appeared instead\u2026\u2019The first prince\u2019s messenger had set out first to contact Carlton, but there was still no news on that front. If he had known this would happen, he would have insisted on travelling with Carlton\u2013how regretful.\u201cMy duke.\u201dLuisen panicked when Ruger called out to him. \u2018I thought you were sneaking up to stab the monsters in the back; what\u2019s the use if you call out to me?\u2019Ruger did not even try to hide his approach; he stalked closer to Luisen with great dignity.His poise was so strange.\u2018That punk, why is he so calm?\u2019 The master he was in charge of was surrounded by monsters, at the brink of having his limbs torn apart. It would be normal for Ruger\u2019s face to express anxiety, tension, or urgency\u2026but the attendant looked nonchalant.It felt as if he viewed this situation as nothing unusual. He didn\u2019t even look at the direwolves. How could he be so indifferent when he didn\u2019t know when they would jump on him, tearing at his neck? He looked as if he was sure he wouldn\u2019t be attacked.At least, that\u2019s not how the Ruger Luisen knew would have acted. He would have been alarmed to see his master in danger and rushed in to save him. Though he may have been arrogant to others, he was still Luisen\u2019s devoted servant.Come to think of it, he looked different from usual. Ruger\u2019s pale face was stiff as a corpse. His unique, silly aura gave way to something more sleek\u2013well defined and sharp, like a sword. His red-colored armor matched well with his red hair\u2013for those who did not recognize him, he may have seemed like a famous knight who had lived his life without knowing setbacks. At first glance, anyone could see that it was far too good an armor for a servant.It was possible for Ruger to have owned good armor. After all, the salary Luisen had paid him was quite considerable. But, the issue was he was far too well-dressed. This monster attack was something no one had expected; however, wearing the armor caused a sense of disharmony, as if he had predicted conflict.\u2018Don\u2019t tell me, he knew the monsters were going to attack?\u2019 His mouth was dry as a desert. An ominous, foreboding sensation passed chillingly through Luisen\u2019s spine.\u2018No, that\u2019s not possible.\u2019 Luisen vehemently denied it. With all his might, he hoped that his hunch was wrong. It was Ruger. Before regression, he\u2019d protected Luisen until his final moments, blocking Carlton from capturing him. Such a devoted servant couldn\u2019t possibly attack him.The reality at hand was brutal. Ominous hunches were never wrong.As Ruger approached, the direwolves retreated, wagging their tails like a dog. They laid their heads on the ground and opened a path for the attendant, avoiding his path as if they were dealing with a very frightening and difficult being.\u2018Nothing is\u2026making any sense?\u2019Luisen had never heard of monsters obeying people. However, it was clearly not the time to debate the plausibility of such submission. Luisen witnessed everything clearly: the direwolves were following Ruger. If so, it would be prudent to assume that the direwolves dragging the lord to this empty clearing was actually Ruger\u2019s idea.\u201c\u2026Bastard, what are you doing?\u201d Luisen glared at him.Ruger whistled in admiration. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be bawling and sobbing, but you\u2019re actually quite calm? You don\u2019t seem surprised either.\u201d\u201c\u2026How can I cry when I\u2019m so dumbfounded. What are you going to do now that you\u2019ve kidnapped me; who bought you out?\u201d Luisen guessed that Ruger wasn\u2019t acting alone. No matter how pathetic, there were only four great lords in this country. For fear of consequences, he must not be acting alone.\u201cThat\u2019s strange. How can you say such smart things?\u201d\u201cDid you think I was an idiot?\u201d\u201cNo, you truly are an idiot; I know the duke better than anyone else. The duke is not the kind of person who can keep calm under these circumstances.\u201d Surprisingly, Ruger spoke like usual\u2013a mixture of cheek and politeness.Luisen was rather horrified to see him act no different from before.\u201cThoughtlessness and complacency were the duke\u2019s greatest strengths\u2026Why did you change so suddenly?\u201d Ruger pressed a scratch on Luisen\u2019s face with his gloved hand. Then, very gently, he rubbed at it. The touch of cold leather, brushing over the wound, felt so foreign. \u201cYou\u2019ve hurt yourself. I didn\u2019t want to be this extreme; I wanted to remain your faithful servant until the very end.\u00a0 If you had just run away with me that night, you wouldn\u2019t have been hurt like this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Luisen had no choice but to interject. Just what was he saying right now? All of his memories of Ruger were shattered and slowly pieced together to reassemble that night, pre-regression.Back then, Luisen fled the estate. Everything needed to escape\u2013the escape path, the method, the supplies\u2013were all prepared by Ruger.\u2018Did I ever order him to prepare to flee?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuisen did not order any of it. He did not refute Ruger\u2019s suggestion to escape but instead accepted at face value that he should leave immediately. That\u2019s why he was just dragged alongside Ruger. It was stupid, it was passive, and it was definitely something Luisen would have done before regression.Who was the first to whisper to him that he should run away from Carlton? It was Ruger. It was Ruger who terrorized Luisen by delivering such terrible rumors to his ears.At the time, Luisen was terrified, so overwhelmed by the first serious crisis of his life that he couldn\u2019t make proper judgments. Besides, Luisen was originally quite passive and wouldn\u2019t do anything on his own anyway.Would he have thought of running away from the estate without Ruger?For the first time, Luisen questioned the events of that night. He chose to run away under the cover of darkness, but could he really say that was purely his will?After sifting quickly through his tumultuous thoughts, Luisen could only utter one thing, \u201cWhy?\u201dWhy would he do that? Luisen trusted Ruger as his chief attendant. The other could kill or kidnap Luisen at any time he wished. Why would he entice Luisen to leave the duchy on his own? Why would he go through all that trouble?Suddenly, he thought back to when he first hired Ruger.It was about five years ago. At that time, Luisen had a senior servant carefully handpicked by the general after a strict screening. Then one day, a carriage accident suddenly injured the chief attendant; the new hire was temporarily conscripted through nearby networks.It was a temporary job in the first place\u2013and Luisen stayed alone in the capital\u2013so he just haphazardly chose anyone he liked. That was Ruger.Ruger acted as Luisen\u2019s tongue and taught him many fun games. As time went on, the return of the original chief attendant was postponed and Ruger stayed by his side.\"\"There were many employees around the young lord, and they showed up and left for a variety of reasons. Luisen was used to the constant ephemerance of his retinue, so he didn\u2019t care much that the original chief servant never appeared again, nor that Ruger took his position as if that were the natural order of the world.Luisen had only thought, \u2018At least I have a funny servant this time.\u2019 Luisen might have forgotten Ruger if he had not died on his behalf before regression.\u2018Wait a minute. Ruger died for me before regression. Did he truly die?\u2019 What kind of spy would die for his prey?\u2018Then what? Was his death a lie too?\u2019The back of his head ached. Ruger, who he believed had died on his behalf, was actually a spy and intentionally pushed his master face-first into the mire.The feeling of betrayal shook through him; his attendant\u2019s meticulousness was frightening.\u201cWho\u2019s behind you? For what reason did you do this to me?\u201d In the previous timeline, Luisen fell into Ruger\u2019s trap and walked the road of ruin and collapse.\u201cDoes the man behind this with not for my death but my downfall?\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s words, Ruger gave a disappointed look. \u201cI\u2019ve betrayed you and that\u2019s all you\u2019re curious about?\u201d\u201cThen what else do you want?\u201d\u201cSomething like \u2018why I betrayed the duke.'\u201d\u201cWhy should I care about that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really\u2026how fitting of a duke. I like my duke\u2019s arrogance. A great lord should be like that.\u201d Strangely enough, Ruger sounded admiring to Luisen\u2019s ears. Ruger had often said it,\u00a0 but it felt dirty to hear the same things in this situation. \u201cNow, enough talk.\u201d Ruger took out a tough strap of leather and tied Luisen\u2019s hands and feet.Luisen thought about rebelling but desisted. The back of his head tingled; he could make neither head nor tail of the situation and its progression, but his long-standing wandering mentality allowed him to postpone the shock and judge the chances of survival coolly.Something behind the scenes seemed to be trying to craft a story or embellish something by sparing Luisen\u2019s life. He had no strength to run away on his own; if he got hurt for no reason while rebelling, it would only be a disadvantage to him.If he disappeared, everyone in the duchy would mobilize themselves to find him. It would be more beneficial to calmly pretend to follow while leaving some clues behind.While Luisen was wracking his brains, Ruger pulled out a medicinal vial and placed it underneath Luisen\u2019s nose: a sleeping scent.\u00a01\u00a0\u201cSleep\u2013you\u2019ll arrive at your destination soon.\u201dThe scent smelled simultaneously floral yet disgusting. As the smell continued to assault his nose, the young lord began to feel dizzy and sleepy.\u2018Ah, wait. This..isn\u2019t\u2026good\u2026\u2026\u2019 Luisen shook his head; his eyelids became heavy, and his body began to droop.It was then, in the distance, horse hooves could be heard rushing closer, and a short spear flew towards Ruger\u201cNngh!\u201d Ruger cut at the spear but couldn\u2019t resist the power the shortspear held; he stumbled back. Carlton followed shortly behind.\u201cDuke!\u201d\u00a0 He instantly beheaded three direwolves that rushed at him. A normal person couldn\u2019t handle the sudden movements of several wild dogs, let alone monsters, but the direwolves\u2019 giant body split in two; the sight of both halves falling away was bizarre enough to make the lord want to faint.Between the monsters\u2019 attacks, Ruger swung his sword at the mercenary, which was blocked without much difficulty. Carlton looked at Ruger and said, without facing Luisen behind him, \u201cThis punk is the duke\u2019s servant, right? What\u2019s going on with these monsters?\u201dLuisen couldn\u2019t answer his question. Luisen\u2019s spirit, which barely endured the sleeping scent, was exhausted from the blatant bloody cruelty.Carlton observed Ruger, Luisen\u2013who had fainted\u2013and the direwolves around them.After he\u2019d left the duchy, he\u2019d galloped like a mad man, trying to forget the lingering attachment he had for the duke. Frustratingly, he could not move as quickly as he wished, for the group carried a lot of luggage. Suddenly, though, the first prince\u2019s messenger had followed behind and relayed to him the order to escort Luisen to the capital.Looking at the sky and the field, he was consumed with the thoughts of Luisen\u2019s visage, so the sudden change in plans was a windfall. He quickly turned around and went back the way he came on the road. He didn\u2019t even take notice of whether or not his men followed. He traveled fast and thought he would soon come upon the duke\u2019s party, but instead he arrived to see Luisen being dragged away by the direwolves.He never imagined such a reunion; why was Luisen in danger every time he saw him?Carlton rushed after the young lord\u2013that was the current situation. He\u2019d roughly grasped what had happened.\u2018He was a spy all this time, and he\u2019s controlling these monsters.\u2019 He had no idea how the other was controlling the monsters, but Ruger\u2019s betrayal came as no surprise to Carlton.\u201cYou son of a bitch, I\u2019ve been suspicious of you for a long while.\u201d\u201cA subject knows nothing of the heavens. It\u2019s not your business to interfere.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018not my business?\u2019 It\u2019s my duke\u2019s business.\u201d Carlton fixed his grip on his sword and blocked the way in front of Luisen. Ruger glared at the mercenary with piercing eyes; he glimpsed bloodthirst and deep grudge within. The way Ruger held the sword and his aura were all unusual.\u201cYou seem sharp for an attendant \u2013you must have been hiding your skills.\u201d If Carlton was ignorant until now, that meant Ruger\u2019s swordsmanship was excellent. The desire to win boiled within the mercenary; Carlton was always thrilled to win against strong opponents. Even more so when his opponent was one who had always condescended him.However Luisen was behind Carlton. It may have been fine if he were alone, but it was dangerous to fight while protecting another. Furthermore, he had a hunch that these monsters would run away with the young lord if he started combating Ruger.Then, there was only one thing Carlton could do.\u2018Let\u2019s run.\u2019Quick judgement made, Carlton immediately acted. He flung his sword at Ruger. In an effort to stop the mercenary movements on his horse, Ruger sidestepped the sword and attacked Carlton\u2019s horse. Simultaneously, the direwolves attacked Luisen.It was all as Carlton expected. Carlton quickly dismounted his horse so that it could more easily avoid Ruger\u2019s attack. Then, he quickly ran to Luisen and slashed at the approaching direwolf\u2019s neck.A gap formed in the wolves\u2019 formation; Carlton held Luisen in his arms and threw himself through that crack. Cleverly, Carlton\u2019s horse followed its owner, briefly slowing down and allowing the mercenary to mount.First, he slung Luisen onto the horse, and then Carlton mounted.\u201cDo you really think I\u2019ll let you run away!?\u201d After realizing he had been tricked, Ruger roared. Carlton didn\u2019t think the other could catch up; after all, he had no horse. But, something unexpected happened. Ruger climbed on top of a direwolf and began to chase them.\u2018Monsters allow people to ride upon their backs?\u2019He wouldn\u2019t have believed it if he hadn\u2019t seen such a scene with his own eyes. The more he saw, the more unbelievable it was.The hunt took place on the hillside; the terrain presented an overwhelming disadvantage for Carlton. The horse could hardly speed up because of the many obstacles and underbrush. On the other hand, the direwolf ran around the hillside as if it were in its own territory. Over and over again, the wolf\u2019s teeth nipped at the horse.Ruger swung a long spear; Carlton ducked by flattening his body. The timing was right for a counterattack, but he couldn\u2019t afford to attack\u2013not while holding the reins with one hand and Luisen with the other.\u2018We\u2019re all going to die if this continues.\u2019 Carlton desperately wracked his brain. With his sharp senses, he detected the fishy smell of water and the sound of a waterfall.\u2018Direwolves are weak in water.\u2019 Carlton made his decision. He stroked the horse\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t think I can take care of you too. Survive on your own.\u201dCarlton galloped faster. Then, analyzing the perfect moment, he took out a dagger and threw it at the direwolf. Carlton\u2019s aim was accurate; the blade dug precisely into its eye socket.Carlton\u2019s body, however, tilted from throwing that dagger. Because of that, Carlton\u2019s horse staggered as well. The direwolves, excellent hunters in their own rights, did not miss that opportunity.Carton hugged Luisen tightly and threw himself in the direction he had scoped earlier.Below was a distant waterfall.The direwolves, who leapt to attack the mercenary, floundered in the air in bewilderment; however, it was too late for them to return to safe ground. Following Carlton and Luisen, several direwolves fell down and were trapped in the waterfall.Splash!Ruger, who had followed belatedly, looked down the cliff. Carlton and Luisen had already disappeared beneath the white bubbles.\u201cHow dare that peasant bastard\u2026\u2026\u201d Ruger\u2019s anger erupted like a volcano; he beat the direwolf he was riding to death. Even though one of their kin was brutally murdered, the remaining wolves simply watched, trembling.Soon after, Ruger finished venting and left to search the base of the waterfall. The fog lifted and the hills returned to its tranquil state, as if nothing had happened. Even the cries of the injured horse, calling after its lost owner, were quietly buried under the roar of the waterfall.TL: Nooo!!! The horse!!!Footnoteslike chloroform etcPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He opened his eyes; Luisen realized someone was hugging him.In front of him was someone\u2019s naked chest\u2013a solid wall. It was a very attractive chest, but why was this the first thing he saw after waking?Luisen rolled his eyes around. He was held close, hugged by someone, so he couldn\u2019t see the other\u2019s face just through his wandering gaze. The man\u2019s body temperature clung onto and warmed Luisen\u2019s tightly cradled arms and legs.It had been a long time since he\u2019d woken up staring at an unfamiliar chest, but the situation wasn\u2019t unfamiliar to him. Having lived as trash, he knew that the other would make a fuss if he were to startle; so, he tried to calmly raise himself up. However, the other was faster.\u201cHave you woken up?\u201dThis voice belonged to Carlton. Carlton, after Luisen woke, had awoken himself. Luisen sat up quickly; at his sudden movement, the leather cape covering the two slipped off. Luisen\u2019s gaze crept towards Carlton\u2019s lower body.Carlton was wearing pants; Luisen was only wearing underwear but was not completely naked.\u2018Ah, what a relief.\u2019 Luisen glanced at Carlton\u2019s face, while thoughts flashed through his mind. \u201cWhat in the world happened?\u201dLuisen straightened up and looked around; they were in a very long and narrow cave. The fishy smell of water, soil, and a slight stench of animals were mixed together. The two of them were alone in this cave.\u201cWhere are we? Why are you\u2026embracing me?\u201d the young lord asked.\u201cDo you remember what happened?\u201d\u201cI can remember up until I fainted.\u201dMonsters had attacked out of nowhere from the fog. Ruger turned out to be a spy, and he had fainted with Carlton\u2019s sudden appearance. Everything was vivid.\u201cAfter that, I grabbed you, Duke, and ran away. After leaving our hunters behind, I discovered and entered a cave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026And our clothes?\u201d\u201cBecause we jumped into a waterfall, they got soaked. They\u2019re drying over there.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026jumped into a waterfall?\u201dWaterfall? Did he just hear something crazy\u2026?Looking where Carlton pointed, Luisen could see their clothes. As he had said, they were damp. \u201cYou really jumped\u2026.\u201dAlthough he was unconscious then and had no memory of that incident, Luisen felt dizzy just imagining it. \u2018What would make him think of jumping into a waterfall? I\u2019m alive after all that?\u2019Carlton misunderstood Luisen\u2019s silence and continued his explanation, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be helped since core body temperature will decrease when you wear wet clothes. And if we light a fire, those bastards may chase us down. But it would be folly to spend all night naked, so I embraced you.\u201dCarlton was vehemently claiming that not even his fingertips held a black heart or ulterior motives. \u201cThere was no other choice. Truly.\u201d\u201cI understand. This situation is the cause. You must have had a hard time.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to explain himself; Luisen wouldn\u2019t have misunderstood. After all, Carlton wouldn\u2019t have designs on him like that.\u201cYes\u2026\u2026\u201d Carlton seemed embarrassed by Luisen\u2019s straightforward answer.\u201cAnd the others?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about that. I was too busy running away with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.I see.\u201dThere were knights in the escorting party, but there were far more noncombatants whose duty was to attend to Luisen\u2019s life. Could those people have avoided the monsters\u2019 teeth flying towards them from places hidden by the fog?When Luisen was dragged out of the carriage by the direwolves, he could hear, even in that short hectic moment, people screaming both close by and in the distance. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine what might have happened to the party. More than a few people probably died. Feeling nauseous, Luisen tightly closed his mouth.The fact that this was all caused by Ruger tore at Luisen\u2019s chest. He pretended to be calm, like he felt nothing in front of Ruger, but that couldn\u2019t be more wrong. He was the one who hired Ruger and kept him by his side, after all.\u201cNow then, Duke, tell me your side of the story. Ruger, what is he? He seemed like a completely different person,\u201d Carlton said.Luisen nodded slowly. Ruger *did* seem like a completely different person. He looked like a competent knight, not an arrogant servant, with all of his fine armor equipped. The frivolous speech pattern that didn\u2019t fit the knightly look was ironic, because that was Ruger\u2019s usual way of speaking.So it hit the young lord even harder that the Ruger he knew was false. The man had the same reproachable mouth, but the facade of a loyal servant was all lies. \u201cRuger was a spy.\u201d\u201cI see. Did you find out whose spy he was?\u201dLuisen shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind him. You don\u2019t seem very surprised? I was utterly shocked to discover Ruger was a spy.\u201d After he had escaped the situation and came to a safe place, the emotions he had temporarily delayed came roaring in like waves and overwhelmed Luisen\u2019s head. His heart ached with a sense of betrayal and shock.\u201cI\u2019m not too surprised; he seemed like someone who could do such things.\u201d\u201cRuger seemed like that to you? To me, he was a faithful servant.\u201d\u201cMy duke, you seemed particularly comfortable with him, but I can\u2019t say he was loyal. Hasn\u2019t he always disappeared from time to time? Even when you were left behind in the village, he deliberately provoked others.\u201d\u201c\u2026..Ah.\u201dCome to think of it, when he was abandoned in the village and got caught up in the riots, a knife flew at his blind spot. Was Ruger also the culprit of that?In retrospect, that wasn\u2019t the only suspicious occurrence. After Luisen surrendered to Carlton, Ruger often disappeared when significant incidents passed by.\u201cActually, I don\u2019t know what the duke believed and saw in him,\u201d Carlton said.Luisen shut his mouth abruptly. \u2018For my sake, Ruger was caught and killed by you.\u2019So, the young lord ignored his suspicions and buried them away. He didn\u2019t doubt despite the suspicious happenings; Ruger proved his loyalty with his death.But Ruger spoke as if Luisen\u2019s midnight escape would also function to secure his own safety, and because the young lord surrendered and did not run away, the attendant had to reveal himself.If that was the case, did Ruger truly die in the previous timeline? Was getting captured on behalf of his master all part of a plan? Luisen did not see Ruger\u2019s body and only strongly believed in his death due to the circumstances.\u201cI suppose. I was a fool.\u201d\u00a0 Luisen lowered his head into both hands in distress.The lord\u2019s face was as pale as a corpse, and his half-dried hair hung limply. His gaze wandered anxiously through the air. Perhaps that was why Carlton felt even more sorry for him; the mercenary\u2019s hand flinched.Usually, Carlton would have laughed at him for believing in that kind of bastard like a fool, but instead he just felt sorry for Luisen. Would he have trusted Ruger if he was suffering alone, lonely? He thought that no matter how vigilant he was to those with ulterior motives around him, he was bound to have been deceived.That was too much. Carlton tried to wrack his brains to say something to comfort the young lord. However, he had nothing to say, since he was more familiar with sarcasm than consolation.\u201cDuke, are you alright?\u201d This was all he managed to squeeze out.Luisen looked up, started. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was lost in thought for a moment. First of all, thank you for saving me.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing. Since I\u2019ve been ordered to safely escort the duke to the capital\u2026it should be me that\u2019s apologizing.\u201d\u2018Can\u2019t I sound more friendly?\u2019 Carlton\u2019s usual dry tone tugged at his own heart.In the meantime, Luisen tried to steel himself and look determined. He didn\u2019t want to seem pathetic to Carlton anymore. \u201cYou must have met the first prince\u2019s messenger. Are you alone? What about all your men?\u201d\u201cIt seemed urgent\u2026so I took off first. There must be a lot of distance between us and them, so the men don\u2019t yet know of all that had happened.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026..\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take you, my duke, safely to the duchy.\u201d\u201cTo the duchy??\u201d Luisen blinked his eyes.\u201cAre you not returning to the duchy?\u201d the mercenary asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019m thinking of going to the capital like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to the capital right now?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dCarlton shook his head with a frown. \u201cIt would be better to stop by the duchy and gather a proper team before setting out. There are suspicious men after your life, and I am the only one with you right now. It would be hard to reach the capital like this.\u201dCarlton had a point, but Luisen had another idea. \u201cRuger will be waiting on the road back to the duchy. Going back now would be like walking into his grasp.\u201d\u201cSince I\u2019m with you, going back to the duchy will be no problem.\u201dThough Carlton was confident, Luisen shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a problem even after we return to the duchy. I need to reach the capital as soon as possible, but the duchy doesn\u2019t have that sort of manpower.\u201d\"\"The number of people who were in Luisen\u2019s party when he first set out for the capital was the optimal amount of manpower that could be removed from the duchy and the castle. As the lives and deaths of those personnel were unknown, it was unlikely the situation would change if they regrouped at the castle.\u201cWhy not stay at the duchy for a while?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cThe prince will understand if you were attacked. I\u2019ll relay your situation to him personally.\u201d\u201cI have an obligation to go as one of the great lords. At the risk of my life, I have to go to the throne, to his majesty\u2019s side.\u201dCarlton was not obtuse; he immediately realized the underlying meaning behind Luisen\u2019s words.TL: So sorry for the late updates you guys. I\u2019ve been so frazzled with the new academic year onboarding process T_T There\u2019s so much to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cNo way\u2026The king\u2026\u201d the mercenary mumbled.Luisen nodded his head.Carlton released a short sigh. The death of a king was an extremely urgent, important issue\u2013worth risking your life for a visit to the capital.\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be in danger anway, it\u2019s better for us to not drag our feet and act beyond Ruger\u2019s expectations,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s join up with your men and go to the capital together. You\u2019ll be slowed down because of me, but\u2026I\u2019ll make the reward worth your time.\u201dCarlton thought about it. As Luisen said, if the king was truly in critical condition, then they must set off on the road to the capital in a hurry. Both Carlton and Luisen must arrive before the current king dies.Moreover, considering the duchy\u2019s history, it was better for the young lord to temporarily join his army, even if he suffered for a few days. The question, though, was whether or not Luisen could endure the hardships of travel until they met up with Carlton\u2019s army.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a tough road. We will be homeless on the road\u2013bedrooms, let alone high-quality ones\u2013will be a dream. There won\u2019t be any attending servants either.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s enough.\u201d There was no hesitation in Luisen\u2019s reply. He\u2019d been through much worse conditions and hardship than that. After enduring so much to return to this timeline, he couldn\u2019t possibly lose it all just because of a bastard like Ruger.\u201cThrough various instances, many members often get left behind; thus, we\u2019ve predetermined some set locations and rules for reunion. About\u2026three days\u2026from here\u2026\u201d Carlton glanced at Luisen\u2019s thin legs. Only then did Luisen remember that he was almost naked; the young lord grabbed the cape that had fallen on the floor and covered himself. Carlton regretfully averted his gaze.\u201cIt\u2019ll take more than a week; just leaving the mountains will take about a week,\u201d Carlton continued as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything.\u201cI\u2019ll hold out far better than you expect from me. So please, don\u2019t worry too much\u2013I won\u2019t be too much of a bother to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not that I\u2019m bothered. I\u2019d rather feel more at ease to have the duke by my side, since I don\u2019t know what sort of trouble he\u2019ll get caught up in alone.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t exactly\u2026refute that.\u201dCarlton had appeared to him and saved him at every crisis, so Luisen had nothing to say even if Carlton were to view him as a pain in the neck.\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave this whole journey to you. Even if you\u2019re frustrated, please don\u2019t throw me away in the middle.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t happen. I\u2019ll take you to the capital without a single scratch or a strand of hair out of place.\u201d Carlton was determined.\u201c\u2026.I was just kidding, though,\u201d Luisen awkwardly mumbled. He couldn\u2019t overcome the awkward atmosphere of sitting face to face, in his undergarments with the cold air brushing past his skin.*******After the conversation, the two sat apart and waited quietly for the sun to rise. Luisen leaned against the wall of the cave and examined himself. His body was throbbing here and there, and it turned out his skin was riddled with scratches and bumps he\u2019d received from being bitten and dragged along by the direwolf.Still, there were no major injuries that would need immediate treatment. The direwolf\u2019s vicious teeth could have amputated Luisen\u2019s leg, but given the various scratches, it probably didn\u2019t mean to hurt him from the start.\u2018What a silver lining. I can walk like this.\u2019He had a vigorous and healthy body full of youth\u2013it could definitely endure. No, there was no choice but to endure. Luisen glanced at Carlton; the mercenary was leaning against the opposite wall with his eyes closed.\u2018I can\u2019t be a burden.\u2019 Luisen folded his arms across his chest and closed his eyes. His head ached with fatigue and stress. The cold that seeped through from the cave walls chilled his bones. In this wintry, dreary mood, Luisen curled up.He recalled his nomadic days\u2013a time of loneliness, despair, and perpetual chill.Luisen pressed the center of his brows firmly with his hands. He struggled to never experience those days again, but now he was running away from someone once more.Did this mean that a person\u2019s fate didn\u2019t change so easily?\u2018No. No, no\u2026It\u2019s not like before.\u2019The duchy was alive and well, and the duchy\u2019s citizens did not resent Luisen. The duchy would expend all of their efforts to rescue him. Carlton, who was his enemy before, was sure to stand by Luisen and protect him. Everything was different\u2013compared to before regression, he was in a good situation. This was the result of all his hard efforts.\u2018Since I\u2019ve done well so far, it\u2019s going to be fine.\u2019 Like that, he tried to cheer and console himself, but it wasn\u2019t easy to get rid of negative emotions easily. There were still so many things he didn\u2019t know.Just why would Ruger try to drag Luisen away in such a complicated method at this time? For what reason? Who did he do this for? Maybe there was another actor behind his downfall\u2013both now and back then. But who? Why? For what?The future was already frightening enough of a subject; coupled with Ruger\u2019s betrayal and the appearance of an unknown enemy made it worse. The amorphous fear engulfed Luisen\u2019s rationality and kept driving his thoughts into negativity. The achievements he had made in the meantime were forgotten; the cold and pain seemed to be the only thing that existed.He crouched down and hugged his arms over his legs, but the loneliness didn\u2019t seem to fade away. He had no choice but to silently wait for the time to pass.It was not long before the sun rose. Luisen and Caarlton exited the cave in their half-dried clothes. Their surroundings looked a hazy blue.Luisen sighed once again. \u2018We truly are deep in the middle of the forest.\u2019The trees were densely packed everywhere. Wherever direction he looked seemed the same, so it was hard to take the first step. There were no horses to mount nor foodstuffs to eat; if he wanted to moisten his throat, he had to lick the leaves and drink the morning dew.\u2018Where do we go?\u2019The way forward was murky from the very beginning. What path must they take to avoid Ruger? Where must they go to reach their destination?\u2018What did the saint say to do at times like these?\u2019 Nothing came to mind when thinking of his teachings. Luisen\u2019s chest felt stuffy; hopeless and bleak, he felt his vision dim.\u2018Is this my future?\u2019Anxiety sneaked up on him. It felt like everything was going to go wrong, and the ground beneath his feet was crumbling away. Stunned, Luisen stood still.At that moment, Carlton tapped Luisen on the shoulder.\u201c?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing staring off into the distance? We should set off.\u201d The mercenary took the lead.Luisen followed suit, still in a daze. \u201cDo you know the way forward?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dEverything looked the same to Luisen. There was nothing that resembled a road, and no matter where he looked it was an endless, thick forest.\u201cI can estimate where my men will be waiting for me. Since this place is often travelled by the military, I\u2019m familiar with the terrain.\u201d\u201cBut you still don\u2019t know exactly where we are, right?\u201d\u201cThe sun is rising now: that way is east. If you can orient your direction, the rest is simple. You just need to note the direction as you go.\u201d Carlton spoke as if what he did wasn\u2019t particularly impressive. Could Luisen trust that and follow? He was still nervous but trudged along because there was no viable alternative.The two walked along the hilly path. There was barely enough space for animals to pass through, let alone humans. The bushes were thick, so Luisen had to lean down in order to step forward. Sometimes he cut his hands on blades of greenery, and it wasn\u2019t unusual to hit his legs on protruding branches.Everytime he was hit, Luisen crouched over to swallow the pain. Each step delivered fresh pain. Their clothes were also an issue: the suit absorbed no sweat, and his shoes slipped easily.\u2018I\u2019m exhausted.\u2019Still, there was no time to rest. After all, resting did not guarantee that the situation would improve, and he didn\u2019t want Carlton to consider him tiresome.As his legs silently trudged along, various thoughts filled Luisen\u2019s head. \u2018Why did Ruger want him to escape to Dubless County? Just because it was close? Or was there another reason? Is Count Dubless behind Ruger?\u2019Luisen tried to recall Count Dubless\u2013he just seemed like a polite and mannerly aristocrat. Despite the fact that they shared a border through the forest, the two did not interact much. They had a generation gap; the count was the age of Luisen\u2019s father. Since he had little reason to contact Luisen, the distance between them was natural.The last time he saw the count was when the young lord had arrived at his territory during his midnight escape.\u2018What was he like back then\u2026\u2026?\u2019He had waited a long time and barely met the count; but, let alone comfort, Luisen was locked in the drawing room and kicked out after saying what he had to say. At the time, he was outraged at being treated so poorly, but he had forgotten about it later due to other happenings. Luisen couldn\u2019t even remember the contents of their conversation at the time\u2013and seeing how no specific memory stuck out, it must not have been very important.But Luisen was suspicious of his own memory.\u2018Was there really nothing special? Could it be that I can\u2019t remember?\u2019He couldn\u2019t trust his past self who was so indifferent to the world at large and others.\u2018\u2026.Useless.\u2019\u00a0 Luisen felt so pathetic that he became depressed. He inadvertently felt around his chest; there had always been a piece of beef jerky there\u2026but nothing was there now.It had been lost while they were on the run. A jerky was needed to uplift depressive thoughts, but without that morsel, he felt lost. Luisen was deeply distressed. \u2018 I\u2019m hungry. Tired. Hurt.\u2019With his stomach feeling so empty, he kept thinking about the old days\u2013the memories of the nomadic life and the pain he had felt overlapped into the present.TL: Hi guys >.< I\u2019m feeling very guilty because I disappeared on this series for a while. It was a combination of classes and the fact that this series I don\u2019t have the raws ripped (vs my other main series which I do have all raws in a text document/folder.) It\u2019s easier to tl from a text document during/in-between classes, vs\u2026ripping raws while dodging student\u2019s eyes >.< Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone swooped in and took the project bc I\u2019m updating so slow haha.Still, thanks for waiting for this chapter you guys.

    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Even if we continue like this\u2026what can I even do?\u2019Could they reach the capital safely? It wasn\u2019t like all would be safe once they\u2019d reached the capital either. What should he do when he gets there? What could he even do? \u2018The guy who I thought sacrificed his life for mine turned out to be a spy.\u2019A guy who can\u2019t even solve his own hunger\u2013what can someone like him do?Luisen started to see everything in a pessimistic light. His body was already exhausted. When the spirit that supported the body was broken, the strength in his legs instantly vanished. Luisen faltered.\u201cHnngh!\u201d He fell. Luisen curled up as he tumbled towards the ground. However, contrary to his expectations, he did not strike the forest floor. Carlton had quickly turned around and grabbed Luisen\u2019s arm, assisting the young lord.\u201cAh, oh my\u2026\u201d Luisen\u2019s head fell down, depleted of energy. Carlton clicked his tongue.\u2018If you\u2019re having a hard time, then you should have told me.\u2019 Carlton inwardly clicked his tongue. Even though Carlton didn\u2019t outwardly express his concern for the young lord, in fact, all of his mental power was directed at Luisen. Luisen\u2019s breathing was getting rough, and his body was bending and losing consciousness.Honestly, Carlton thought Luisen would ask for help if the going got tough. It was still early in the day, so he had been patiently monitoring Luisen\u2019s stamina. If the lord were to say he couldn\u2019t continue any longer, he thought about carrying him on his back.However, Luisen didn\u2019t even say that he\u2019d been having a hard time until he was about to collapse. Carlton didn\u2019t expect him to last this long.\u201cI\u2019ll be careful from now on.\u201d Luisen blinked. Carlton sighed softly when he saw how blank the young lord\u2019s eyes looked. He had been determined to do well on his own, and so he was. No, was this the lord not knowing the extent of his limits?\u201cLet\u2019s take a break before we continue.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s just go.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not. If you continue to walk while in this state, you\u2019ll only get hurt.\u201d\u201c\u2026All right.\u201d Luisen ultimately did not reject Carlton\u2019s proposal.Carlton sat Luisen upon a small rock. \u201cWill you be okay if I leave you alone for a moment?\u201d\u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d\u201cYes. Wait here. I\u2019ll return soon. Don\u2019t go anywhere and wait here patiently.\u201d\u201cFine. Don\u2019t worry about me and return soon,\u201d Luisen replied readily.But Carlton still looked doubtful. \u201cDon\u2019t go following me because you think you\u2019ve seen something weird. Don\u2019t wander around for no reason. If something strange appears, you must call for me\u2013don\u2019t try to deal with it on your own, understand?\u201d\u201cDo you think of me as a child?\u201d\u201c\u2026..Anyways, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dHuh?Did he just avoid answering? Luisen opened his eyes wide. Carlton, till the end, continued to make requests of him. Luisen folded his arms sullenly and watched Carlton move away from him.He took a deep breath. \u2018Phew, I feel like I\u2019m going to live now that I\u2019m sitting down.\u2019He didn\u2019t even have the strength to amble around. \u2018My feet are killing me.\u2019 Luisen took off his shoes and rubbed his feet.The clear sound of wind passing through the branches could be heard. In between, the grasshoppers spread their song. Sitting alone in a forest\u2013no people, no animals, and no clear paths\u2013he felt as if he were all alone in the world.He had a more complacent and lazy body than he had remembered; it was unclear whether or not the journey ahead would go well. Luisen pressed on his temples.Time passed just like that, and Carlton quickly returned.\u201cEat this.\u201d The mercenary had brought back an herb that looked similar to a child\u2019s palm.\u201cThis is the sal-sal herb isn\u2019t it? It grows around here too?\u201d\u00a01The sal-sal herb had a fever and pain-reducing effect; Luisen knew about it because the herb was one of the medicinal products the one-armed saint had taught him about long ago. By the time the two had met, Luisen\u2019s health had been severely diminished, so the pilgrim would harvest the herb to help relieve his pain.\u201cCorrect. How did the duke know about this?\u201d Since most poor, ordinary peasants couldn\u2019t visit apothecaries or doctors, they utilized the benefits of this plant. Most aristocrats had no knowledge of the sal-sal herb.\u201cI\u2019ve tried it before\u2013someone I knew gave it to me.\u201d\u201cThis? What a unique person they must have been to give someone like the duke a plant like this. They could have just called a doctor.\u201d\u201cThere were times when it was too difficult to call for a doctor\u2026 I grew up in a pleasant situation, but there were times when I suffered.\u201d He was, of course, talking about his times wandering an empty kingdom. Luisen spoke very casually.Carlton inhaled sharply\u2013if the lord were talking about a time where he couldn\u2019t call for a doctor then he must have been talking about his childhood abuse by the vassals. \u2018How bad must it have gotten for a child to resort to eating grass without reporting his sickness to others?\u2019Carlton regretted that he couldn\u2019t bother the duchy\u2019s retainers more than he did. The next time he saw them, he wouldn\u2019t let them go easily.Luisen munched away at his herb gently without any notice of Carlton\u2019s misunderstanding. The taste wasn\u2019t nice\u2013the smell of grass wafted up his nose alongside the overpowering sour taste. He felt nauseous as he tried to swallow it. Though he hadn\u2019t had anything to eat since lunchtime yesterday, he felt like he was going to cry while eating something so foul.Tears welled up; Luisen felt even more desolate. Carlton could no longer silently keep watch over him, so he begrudgingly spoke, \u201c\u2026The duke didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cAnyone will go through hard times. Furthermore, this was brought about by Ruger\u2019s actions.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026? I\u2019m fine though.\u201dBecause the young lord kept on saying he was fine with that kind of face, Carlton, feeling frustrated, spoke even faster. \u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re fine, especially with that face that looks like you\u2019ve been abandoned by the world? There\u2019s no one watching, so you can be honest: you\u2019ve been thinking negatively this entire time, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cY\u2026..yeah. How did you know?\u201d\u201cIt all shows on your face. It seems like you\u2019re thinking of Ruger, but\u2026 something like, \u2018if you knew of his nature, would you have been stabbed in the back?'\u201dLuisen furrowed his eyebrows. His expression looked as if the young lord was trying to hold back tears; Carlton\u2019s heart dropped. He quickly continued, lest his words be misunderstood, \u201cIt\u2019s natural that you had no idea\u2013he tried his hardest to hide all that. Though I thought he\u2019d try something in the future\u2026\u201dCarlton thought he was eloquent in his own way, but right now his tongue was so stiff. \u201cIn addition, he had some strange tricks up his sleeves\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about how he summoned those monsters?\u201d\u201cYes. How could one not be fooled by someone so determined\u2013with those kinds of skills? It\u2019s just a relief that the bastard had no intention of killing the duke. If that was his scheme, then in one go the bastard could have\u2026\u201d Carlton wanted to plunge his fist into his mouth. Why was he chattering like this? Was he trying to console the young lord or pick a fight?\u201cYou have to stay alive in order to shatter that bastard Ruger\u2019s skull. It wasn\u2019t my duke\u2019s fault that you were fooled\u2026 In any case, what I\u2019m trying to say is\u2026 it\u2019s fortunate that you\u2019re safe and sound.\u201dIn one way or another, Carlton said all he wanted to say. But\u2026Afraid to look at Luisen\u2019s expression, Carlton turned away and coughed in vain. After the mercenary stopped speaking, silence stretched through the forest clearing. It was so awkward.It would be easier to jump into an enemy camp armed with only a knife.Carlton realized, for the first time in his life, that consoling someone was really difficult. After all, when had he ever had the chance to comfort someone? Instead, he offered Luisen something he thought the young lord would like. \u201cI saw it on my way here, so I\u2019ve brought it. Eat it.\u201dCarlton offered two Buried Old Hags. It was clear the man took care to hold the roots in his embrace so they wouldn\u2019t be exposed to sunlight.\u201c!\u201d Luisen opened his eyes wide.It was a Buried Old Hag!Something to eat!Food!At that moment, Luisen thought there was a halo shining from behind Carlton\u2019s back.\u201cSomething precious like this\u2026Is it okay for me to eat this?\u201d Luisen was so moved that his voice trembled.Carlton felt rather awkward though\u2013it wasn\u2019t all that precious. There was no need for the young lord to be so moved.\u2018Maybe I should have just given him this thing instead of speaking.\u2019 Somehow, it seemed that giving him something to eat was more effective than Carlton\u2019s words. However, the mercenary was glad at least something worked\u2026\u201cThen, do you think I brought this for myself to eat? It\u2019s too difficult to set fire right now, so you\u2019ll have to eat it raw.\u201d\u2018So, you brought this for me?\u2019 Feeling overwhelmed, Luisen responded with a big nod. \u201cOkay!\u201dLuisen ate the Buried Old Hag in one bite. He shuddered as the sweet juices moistened his tongue, accompanied by a crunching sound. Some people found it uncomfortable to eat a Buried Old Hag raw, but Luisen also liked this sort of taste. The unique firm texture, subtle sweetness, and unique aroma that only spread when eaten raw\u2013the root was still delicious.Luisen quickly consumed the Buried Old Hag in an instant. Afterwards, he let out a long sigh. It felt as if his depression had escaped his body with that one breath. As his stomach became full, the young lord began to feel optimistic\u2026as if he had never been melancholic.\u2018People should never be hungry.\u2019 Luisen then vowed to carry a Buried Old Hag at all times.He could now afford to leisurely consider Carlton\u2019s words. While wandering around the kingdom alone, he had almost died several times and tasted the bitterness of reality. Furthermore, he had actually died. For Luisen, Carlton\u2019s clumsy attempts at comfort uniquely touched his heart.\u201cYour words are right.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf Ruger had actually tried to kill me, I\u2019d have departed this world already. I\u2019m lucky that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d If he died, then that was it\u2013it would be over. Didn\u2019t he uncover hidden truths in his struggle to return to the past and live a good life? It would all work out. He would go to the capital and see what his next actions should be! Besides, didn\u2019t he do well in saving his dukedom and get to this point in life?And, above all, he had someone who would retrieve food and medicine for him! While lost in the mire of negative thoughts, Luisen had forgotten this fact, but the young lord now had Carlton!Wasn\u2019t Carlton the person that changed the most after his regression? Luisen wasn\u2019t currently being chased by Carlton and was, instead, escaping with the mercenary. That fact alone quenched his anxiety; Luisen was convinced that everything would be different from the original timeline.As he thought, it felt like his body became lighter. The sal-sal herb\u2019s effects couldn\u2019t be ignored either. His mind was healthy when he wasn\u2019t feeling sick and his stomach was full.\u201cYes?\u201d Carlton doubted his ears. Was the lord being sarcastic? He felt automatically dubious. However, Luisen was smiling at him with such a refreshing expression.Footnotes\uc0b4\uc0b4\ud480, honestly sal-sal = gently or easily in Korean\u2026but it\u2019s hard to make a full name out of it so I just put it in phonetically. If someone wants to give me a good name, I welcome it haha.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAre you okay\u2026?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cMm, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m actually rather grateful. Because of you, I was able to properly organize my mind,\u201d Luisen answered.Carlton couldn\u2019t understand how his words left a deep impression. Rather than words\u2026the mercenary felt that the Buried Old Hag was more effective. That could be possible\u2013Luisen was unique in various ways. Whatever worked, worked; it was good if Luisen had a little more energy in him. Inadvertently, Carlton\u2019s lips drew into a firm line. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor that I could be of some help.\u201d\u201cWithout you, I would have most likely been kidnapped by Ruger. Ruger, that son of a bitch. He eats the food I give him and stabs me in the back? Did you know? He received a huge salary. The next time we meet, I\u2019ll make him vomit it all out.\u201d Luisen clenched his fist and punched the empty air.\u201cIt\u2019s not just Ruger\u2013I\u2019ll find out the person behind Ruger and get revenge on him as well,\u201d Luisen pledged.\u201cI agree. You must call me when you\u2019re about to crush him.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m suffering like this because of that bastard\u2013you must allow me to join.\u201dNow that Luisen took a proper look at him, Carlton looked ridiculous. His pants were muddy, his hair messy, and his beard was growing quite scraggly. They had no idea when they\u2019d arrive at the capital; he had been separated from his subordinates and even his cherished horse. There were plenty of reasons to hold a grudge against Ruger and Ruger\u2019s shadow backer.\u201cAlright. You\u2019ll join too.\u201d Luisen reached out his hand, and Carlton readily grasped it. The hand was dirty, but he didn\u2019t really care all that much. The mercenary shook so hard that it felt like his shoulder would fall off before releasing the young lord\u2019s hand. Luisen took the remaining Buried Old Hag, divided it in half, and handed one half to Carlton. At times like this, people would often share a drink, but this was all he had. Swept up in the moment, Carlton impulsively took the root.The mercenary had no intention of eating the Buried Old Hag. He knew that it\u2019d be safe to eat the root, but he still didn\u2019t feel so good about it. But, when Luisen placed the root in his hands, he couldn\u2019t ruthlessly say no as he had done in the past.\u201cLet\u2019s share this and cheer up together!\u201d Luisen then emptied his mind of \u2018what-ifs\u2019\u2013what if Ruger had caught him\u2013and thoughts of whether or not Ruger was Count Dubless\u2019 man. Before his expression could darken at the gloomy situation, he took another bite of the Buried Old Hag, brightening up once more.While docilely watching that scene, Carlton also took a bite of his given share. When he saw Luisen eating so deliciously, he didn\u2019t feel so repulsed anymore; the mercenary couldn\u2019t tell if the root was as delicious as Luisen had praised, but the taste was decent.***After eating the Buried Old Hag, they started to walk again. Since there was no horse to ride, the pace was quite slow. They just continued to walk like that. Then, reaching his limit, Luisen asked Carlton for a break; while Luisen sat down and rested, Carlton retrieved water or things to eat.Though Luisen\u2019s body still felt tired, his exhaustion was slightly relieved because the mercenary held onto his hand along the way. Whenever the young lord inadvertently fell into depressive thoughts, Carlton held his hands tight and pulled him forward, stopping the young lord from spiralling further.Then, at sunset, they stopped walking. The two found Carlton\u2019s well-used abandoned beast cave and settled there. The cave was too narrow and they couldn\u2019t light a fire, so Carlton and Luisen fell asleep, clinging together underneath a draped cape.Luisen tried not to be too entangled with the mercenary, but when he woke in the morning, he must have fallen asleep while hugging the other. Perhaps winter had come early since they were in mountainous regions\u2013the night must have been cold.It was the dawn of the third day, their journey seeming endless.Luisen was exhausted. No matter how well Carlton took care of the young lord, they were still on a\u00a0 tight schedule. The two did not let go of each other\u2019s hands throughout their walk. Whenever Luisen faltered, Carlton held onto Luisen firmly, respecting the young lord\u2019s determination to not delay the mercenary\u2013even for a moment.\u2018He has more grit than what his looks would suggest.\u2019 The young lord looked like someone who\u2019d be extremely picky and spoiled. However the man had a firm spirit\u2013patience and tenacity. That fact made Carlton chuckle from the corners of his lips.After all that effort, the two finally discovered what seemed like a proper footpath. The road was narrow enough that two people, standing side by side, were enough to fill up the entire width\u2013but it was still a path!\u201cIf we go straight on this road, we\u2019ll finally be free of these awful mountains.\u201d\"\"\u201cNow that we\u2019ve come this far, we can assume that they\u2019re no longer chasing us.\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019ll be able to light a fire?\u201d Luisen\u2019s eyes were shiny. They weren\u2019t able to start any fires for fear of being chased down. Yesterday, Luisen was so exhausted that Carlton promised to hunt and cook for him if they had travelled far enough to light a fire.\u201cThen, as promised, I\u2019ll catch some meat for you for dinner.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Luisen clenched both hands together and cheered quietly.When the young lord laughed, Carlton could help but casually laugh along. Honestly\u2013who\u2019s so happy about wild animals for dinner? \u201cHowever, we\u2019ll have to eat Buried Old Hags for now.\u201d\u201cStill, at least we have that!\u201d Luisen took out the precious roots that were carefully wrapped in their coats. They had dug some up in advance so he wouldn\u2019t become depressed; they took care to store them well so that the roots wouldn\u2019t see the sunlight.Once again, he divided the Buried Old Hag in half and gave Carlton his share before eating his half immediately. Used to this by now, Carlton received the root from the lord and ate it. Honestly, he still didn\u2019t feel too good about eating the root, but eating together with Luisen\u2013watching the young lord eat\u2013made it better. \u201cSince there\u2019s a road, it\u2019s bound to lead to a village. Shall we go looking for it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be okay\u2013we\u2019ll stand out. You can see that I\u2019m not ordinary with just one glance. My face isn\u2019t one that can be forgotten easily.\u201d This might sound self-congratulatory and despicable, but it was the truth. He may have walked all day, sweated, and slept on the dirt without washing properly, but Luisen\u2019s face was still delicate and pale. His blonde hair was still sparkling. No matter what, he looked like a nobleman; rather, he would stand out even more from the strange circumstances of his travel.\u201cThat\u2019s true. It would have been nice if we could cover your face,\u201d Carlton gently admitted. \u201cI have nothing for that purpose.\u201dLuisen and Carlton\u2019s clothes did not have hoods to cover their faces. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t practical to cover him with the cape.\u201cStill, I think it\u2019s best to stop by the village.\u201d Even if it was a little risky, Carlton thought it would be best to rest while eating warm food in a building with a roof and walls. He could see\u00a0 Luisen becoming more and more tired. Even if one rested within the forest, they wouldn\u2019t be able to rest properly. Though they needed to push forward due to their circumstances, the mercenary was worried for his companion.\u2018He won\u2019t even listen to me when I offered to give him a piggy-back ride. I wish I at least had my horse.\u2019It couldn\u2019t be helped in their situation, but he felt quite heartbroken to lose his warhorse, which could easily carry two adult men. If his horse were here, they would have been able to travel twice as fast.\u2018Should I go to the village and steal a pony or something while Luisen is sleeping?\u2019The road was quiet; the wind blew softly. The sunlight shining through the tree canopies was beautiful; the sound of Luisen crunching on the Buried Old Hags harmonized with the sound of crickets. It felt too peaceful for their situation\u2013destitute and running away from the pursuit of unknown forces\u2013and felt more like a picnic walk.Suddenly though, Carlton felt some dissonance in this calm atmosphere. Someone was approaching. As soon as he felt that, Carlton pulled on the young lord\u2019s hand and hid Luisen behind him; without delay, the mercenary pulled out his sword.\u201c?\u201d Luisen was puzzled.One beat later, five men jumped out from behind a large tree.For how impressively they jumped out, they looked a mess. Perhaps they hadn\u2019t been able to eat well. The men looked starved; like ill patients, their complexions shadowed, and their lips were chapped. Blood veins spiderwebbed in both eyes, creating a hideous effect. The men used things like axes, pickaxes, and shovels as weapons as they blocked Carlton and Luisen\u2019s path.\u201cS-Stop!\u201d\u201cIf you want to pass through this path alive, you\u2019ll have to give us everything you have!\u201d\u201cS-Starting from what you\u2019re eating right now, give it all up!\u201d The men shouted.Luisen stared at them blankly; Carlton smirked and laughed.\u201cI was wondering who they were, but they\u2019re just thieves. Let\u2019s just move on.\u201d As if he were looking at something ridiculous, Carlton placed his sword back in its sheath. A weapon was unnecessary against these opponents.The thieves were greatly shaken. They exchanged glances and whispered\u2013Luisen could hear their quiet voices well.\u201cThey said they\u2019ll just pass through\u2026what should we do?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have to block them!\u201d\u201cBut that guy looks super strong\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re five people, and they\u2019re two! Furthermore, they have things to eat!\u201dHonestly, everyone could hear them\u2013what were they doing?These people were better suited to be farmers than highway robbers, looking at those clothes and the agricultural equipment they were using as weapons. Honestly, farmers should have been preparing for the winter\u2013what were they doing thieving in the mountains? Besides, this road was probably one that didn\u2019t see many travellers due to the difficulty of its path.\u201cThey\u2019re so clumsy.\u201d The men were so foolhardy that even Luisen chuckled.\u201cMy words exactly. They must be newbies.\u201d\u00a01\u00a0Carlton looked at the robbers and pointed out one of them. The man had a similar physique to Luisen. \u201cWhat do you think of his shoes?\u201d\u201cHuh? They look comfortable,\u201d Luisen replied absentmindedly. Why was the mercenary suddenly talking about shoes?\u201cThen, let\u2019s go with that,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dCarlton grinned and approached the highway robbers.Footnotes\ucd08\uc9dc is slang for rookies, newbies, anyone new to a field. It doesn\u2019t sound quite old-timey\u2026but what can you do lmao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuisen docilely watched, wondering what Carlton would do.\u201cD-Don\u2019t come closer!\u201d The highway robbers swung their weapons recklessly, but they weren\u2019t threatening at all. Moreover, in front of Carlton, the men looked so diminutive; the weapons were like children\u2019s toys.\u201cHey.\u201d Carlton made a show of flexing his muscles as he clenched his fist and turned his wrist around. \u201cGive us all you have.\u201dCarlton rushed at the thieves; Luisen dropped his own head into his hands.So, he was going to flip the script and rob the thieves?\u2018Should I stop him? Do I need to stop him?\u2019 While agonizing, Luisen stepped back to stay at a distance. This behavior wasn\u2019t\u00a0appropriate, but his feet hurt so much.\u2018Honestly, that\u2019s why they should have chosen their opponent with eyes wide open\u2026\u2019Luisen sent a prayer for a peaceful afterlife for those clumsy robbers.Carlton dealt with his opponents with only his fist. He avoided their knives and grabbed one of the robbers\u2019 arms and twisted it. He batted away the bamboo spear flying at him with the robber\u2019s axe, threw the robber away, and knocked down the foolish men, one after another.For farmers, even if they were five well-built adult men, they were no match for Carlton. Carlton had no intention of going easy on them, and the robbers were flung around like toys.\u201cS-Save\u2026Save us\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up and go over there.\u201d Carlton hit the robber again to quiet him. Then, he took the shoes off of one of those men and brought them back to Luisen. \u201cPlease wear them. Though they may not be good shoes, it\u2019ll be better to wear them for the long journey.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201d The owner of those shoes dropped like a living corpse as he looked at his shoes.\u2018At this point, who was the robber and who was the upstanding citizen?\u2019 Luisen wondered.\u201cHonestly\u2026Why did you even try to rob us\u2026\u201d Since he wasn\u2019t in the position to show mercy for the highway robbers\u2019 circumstances, Luisen tried his hardest to look away and change into the shoes. Moreover, the robber\u2019s boots were much more comfortable than going barefoot. Because they were used by those living in the mountains, the soles were strong and thick\u2013far better than the shoes of those that lived in the valleys.Carlton looked satisfied. \u201cIt seems like those guys live in a village near here. We should spend the night there.\u201dWhen did he have time to find that out while beating up those thieves? Luisen gave the defeated men a sidelong glance. It felt a bit uncomfortable to go to the robbers\u2019 village. \u201cWill it be fine?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve already seen our faces; we\u2019ll need to silence their mouths. It\u2019s easy enough to deal with the brigands.\u201dDeal with them? It sounds like the mercenary was going to bury them somewhere. It didn\u2019t seem that Luisen was the only one to come to this conclusion\u2013the robbers all flinched and trembled.\u2018Well, if Carlton says so.\u2019 Luisen nodded. The young lord knew that he was nearing his limits, so he decided to compromise.Carlton approached the fallen robbers and lightly kicked them. \u201cLead us to your village.\u201d\u201cV-Village? We can\u2019t! If you go there, there will be\u00a0trouble!\u201d The robbers were frightened when they heard that they were headed towards their village.\u201cWhy? Because it\u2019s your stronghold? I guess the robber commander is there?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that, my lord. We were originally farmers from this mountain. In the village\u2026 The village is really dangerous now\u2026\u201d The robbers\u2019 faces were clearly full of fear. Rather than reluctance to take Luisen and Carlton to their residence, they seemed truly scared of something within the village. What could be so scary?\u201cWhat\u2019s in your village?\u201d Luisen asked, unable to resist his curiosity. The robbers hesitated; it looked as if they were talking to each other with their eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re not answering?\u201d Carlton threatened.The robbers immediately closed their eyes and cried out, \u201cMonster\u2013There\u2019s a Monster there!\u201d\u201cMonster?\u201d\u201cSome guy dragged in a monster and took over our village! We can\u2019t go back there!\u201d The thieves shed tears.What kind of story was this? Luisen and Carlton gave each other meaningful glances. The young lord felt that this wasn\u2019t something that he could just ignore. Carlton nodded, as if he felt the same way.\u201cSlow down\u2013tell me what happened.\u201d Luisen soothed the men on the ground. The robbers wept and hurried to explain. Water bursting forth from their tear ducts as if floodgates had sprung open; they began to weave their story. It was all very confusing as each man was focused on his story, but to summarize below\u2026These men weren\u2019t originally highway robbers; they were slash-and-burn farmers living in the mountains.\u00a01\u00a0They had lived in a small and provincial village that was common across the lands. However, ten days ago, a lone man appeared with a monster by his side. He had the monster attack the village for no apparent reason.\u201cA human controlling a monster? Do you think that\u2019s believable?\u201d Carlton deliberately lashed out at the thieves in an attempt to pry more information.\u201cW-We\u2019re telling the truth. We couldn\u2019t believe our own eyes; the man really did all that! He really ordered the monster to attack our village.\u201dThese five men said they were lucky enough to escape with their lives. However, afterwards, they were too scared to return back home and they had nowhere else to go. Therefore, they had been circling familiar surroundings.Then, as they ran out of things to eat and could only suck on the tips of their fingers, Luisen and Carlton appeared on the road. They had lost their sanity when they saw Luisen eating something and decided to become highway robbers.\u201cBut why would you resort to robbery? You should have gone down to the nearest town, told them the truth, and brought help,\u201d Luisen rebuked.The men looked as if they were about to cry, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026because we\u2019re refugees\u2026\u201d the robbers said in a faint voice.Hearing that, Luisen sighed. Refugees were people who did not belong to any land and wandered nomadically. They became migrants due to avoiding war or tyranny, running away after a crime, exile, or ruin of farmland.There were many reasons to become a refugee, but most people shunned them. In this world, it was natural for most people to live and die in the village they were born in, so people were often suspicious of strangers with ambiguous statuses. Even if the refugees wanted to settle down somewhere, others wouldn\u2019t accept them.Therefore, many of them lived secretly in mountains or forests. Since this was clearly illegal, they were unable to go anywhere.Luisen had also experienced a time when he had wandered through the kingdom; he said no more to the men because the young lord understood how they felt. Instead, he asked something else, \u201cSo some strange man brought a monster to your home?\u201d\u201cYes. After giving a command, the monsters swarmed the village.\u201dThe robber\u2019s story reminded him of Ruger. After all, it wasn\u2019t common for people to order monsters around. Luisen looked into Carlton\u2019s eyes and grabbed his sleeve.\u2018Similar to Ruger, right?\u2019Carlton nodded with a rigid expression. Luisen continued his interrogation, \u201cWhat kind of monsters?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t really know their names, but\u2026 They were as big as bulls but looked exactly like dogs.\u201d\u201cDogs? Do you mean that they looked like wolves?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Similar to a wolf. Incredibly scary\u2013and their teeth were so sharp\u2026\u201dListening to their descriptions, the young lord had the hunch that the monsters were Direwolves. \u201cHow long ago was this?\u201d\u201cI think\u2026it\u2019s been about ten days.\u201d\u201cten days\u2026\u201dTen days was long before Luisen and his party were attacked by the Direwolves.Luisen stood close to Carlton and whispered so that the robbers couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cDo you think they\u2019re telling the truth?\u201d\u201c\u2026It doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re lying.\u201dMmm. Luisen made a low rumbling sound. If what they said was truth, then it was highly likely their situation was related to Ruger. \u201cIt feels strange\u2026to just pass this off as coincidence.\u201d\u201cI feel the same way. Why don\u2019t we go to their village?\u201d\u201cWhat if there\u2019s really monsters there?\u201d\u201cI believe the monsters that attacked the village have already left. We haven\u2019t heard any wolf howls on our way here.\u201d\u201cAh. That\u2019s true.\u201dDirewolves would howl every night. Looking back, Luisen never heard anything resembling a wolf. Just in case, he asked the robbers and they said the same.Luisen and Carlton decided to go to the robbers\u2019 village. Using the five robbers as guides, they all headed for the village. On the way, Luisen inquired about various things. \u201cThe man who brought the monsters\u2013did you see what he looked like?\u201dThough the robbers found Luisen difficult to deal with, they answered steadily. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get a proper look\u2026 That person wore pilgrim clothes, so we couldn\u2019t see their face. They seemed small in stature though\u2026\u201d\u201cI remember the atmosphere felt somewhat unpleasant and gloomy. The monsters even grinned as they killed the villagers.\u201dThe man in the descriptions was incredibly different from Ruger. Was it someone else?\u201cYou had no idea the monsters were going to attack, and yet you still got a good look at him, huh?\u201d Carlton said.\u201cIt was so strangely foggy that day\u2013I couldn\u2019t even see the people standing next to me\u2026 However, I could see that man very well. It was as if the fog was receding for him.\u201d\u201cFog?\u201d\u201cYes. This place isn\u2019t usually very foggy, so I remember that\u2026everyone thought it was weird.\u201d\u201cFog\u2026\u201d Luisen murmured.Was that ill-begotten guest, fog, popping out again? The fog seen by the Vinard House delegation, the fog seen by Luisen when he was attacked by the direwolves\u2026and the fog that appeared when the village was attacked.Luisen felt disturbed\u2013everything seemed to be related.Their conversation eventually led them to the village the robbers had escaped from.TL: Quick update before I drown in work again D:FootnotesSlash and burn agriculture is a widely used method of growing food in which wild or forested land is clear cut and any remaining vegetation burned. The resulting layer of ash provides the newly-cleared land with a nutrient-rich layer to help fertilize crops. Usually the farmers are rural and nomadic, changing locations once the nutrient in the burned soil has run dry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 49Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe village was surrounded by a wooden fence as tall as Luisen. It was rare to see such wonderful woodwork in such remote mountains.\u201cDoes this region usually have a lot of monsters?\u201d\u201cNo. Since we\u2019re in the midst of high mountains and deep valleys, there are many large beasts\u2013the walls were built high for those. As for monsters\u2026we occasionally saw some goblins.\u201dLuisen waited outside with the robbers as Carlton went ahead and scouted inside the village walls.The village was deathly quiet. As Carlton had guessed, the monster swarm had already left.\u00a0 At the mercenary\u2019s signal, Luisen and the robbers followed him into the village.The place was in shambles\u2013akin to ruins. Agricultural tools and other bits and bobs were scattered along the roads; they could see broken houses and dried blood stains here and there. Crying, the robbers hurried to find their own homes, and Carlton and Luisen were left to examine the ruined settlement together.\u201cSir Carlton, here.\u201d Luisen pointed at the wooden door of some building. There were traces of several scratches made with sharp claws on the wood frame. As the residents closed the door to hide inside, the monsters must have scratched at it to break it down.Following that, the two found footprints left by four-legged beasts, teeth marks, and something that appeared to be fur.\u201cThese all seem like direwolf tracks, right?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cYes. It seems like they belong to a direwolf. From the state of the blood spilled on the ground, I\u2019m certain that it\u2019s been at least ten days, as the robbers have said.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ten days\u2026 That\u2019s seven days before I was attacked. Do you think this was done by the same group that attacked me?\u201d\u201cIf there aren\u2019t two groups of direwolves\u2026 It would mean the monsters that attacked this town and my Duke must be the same group\u2026\u201dLuisen and Carlton may have moved a fair distance as they winded around the mountain\u2013in terms of distance alone, the place where Luisen was attacked and this village were not too far away. In that time, the direwolves could definitely have crossed that distance.Moreover, it was uncommon to see monsters that obeyed human orders. It would be reasonable to assume that the two attacks were conducted by the same group of monsters.\u201cBut ten days ago Ruger was with me in the castle. It couldn\u2019t have been him who had brought the direwolves into this village.\u201d\u201cIf not Ruger, maybe a collaborator?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible.\u201dLooking at these circumstances, it was highly likely that Ruger was in some sort of criminal posse.Ruger had been busy\u2013out of his mind\u2013with packing for his master. Had he been in touch with his posse then, readying for an attack on himself?\u201cNo wonder he looked so harried,\u201d Luisen muttered. That damn son of a bitch. After doing all that, he dared to whine to his master about how tired he was? The flames of ire blazed within Luisen.Carlton patted Luisen on the shoulder. Afterwards, the young lord released a long breath and swallowed his anger. Suddenly, the robbers came running back to them; they were spouting gibberish with dazed expressions, as if they had been possessed by a ghost.\u201cSpeak clearly! What is it?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cNothing. There\u2019s absolutely nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Carlton was annoyed, threatening to punish them if they continued to speak nonsense.The robbers shrieked and paled. \u201cThere\u2019s bloodstains, but no one\u2019s around!\u201d\u201cSince monsters have appeared, all the survivors must have run away.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that\u2026 We can\u2019t even see the dead folks. So\u2026\u201d While the two robbers who had arrived before could only speak gibberish, their companion, following close behind, cried. \u201cThe corpses! We can\u2019t see any corpses!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Luisen inquired.The robbers hurried and crowded around the young lord and the mercenary. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s nothing! There should be some people\u2013there should at least be corpses left behind\u2026!\u201dAfter the monsters attacked, they did not return to the village. Therefore, the bodies of the dead villagers should have remained. However, there were only scattered blood stains. The robbers were shocked no bodies were left behind.\u201cCouldn\u2019t someone have cleared the corpses away? There could have been other survivors,\u201d Luisen raised a counter argument.The men were easily persuaded by the young lord\u2019s illogical statement because they wished to believe there were other living villagers. \u201cI-Is that so?\u201d\u201cThat could be possible!\u201d The men said brightly.As he watched the scene, Carlton muttered in a low tone that only Luisen could hear, \u201cI don\u2019t believe the villagers would have been responsible for cleaning up. There\u2019s no signs of the bodies being moved.\u201dCarlton had already noticed strange inconsistencies with what the robbers had found.\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cIf a villager were to come back and move the body, there should be drag marks on the ground or long trails of blood. But, nothing like that exists.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cAt the very least, they certainly wouldn\u2019t have gotten up and walked away on their own two feet.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThey must have been bitten and taken away or eaten\u2013cruel things that Luisen didn\u2019t want to imagine. The young lord grew pale.As soon as he saw that, Carlton thought to change the subject. There was nothing good about staying in a village that had seen such strange happenings. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s anything else to see here. Let\u2019s get going. We should find a place to stay before sunset.\u201dAt Carlton\u2019s urging, Luisen looked over the ruined village once more. Though the place was small and poor, he could see it was a home that was cultivated with care and tenderness. Thus, this village\u2019s tragedy hit the young lord with more melancholy.\u201d\u2026Understood.\u201d Luisen felt pity and sympathy for the disaster that had befallen this village, but there was nothing he could do immediately. If direwolves had passed through this place, then they could come back at any time, after all. Not only were the two being chased, but Luisen could hardly help anyone without Carlton.\u201cIf you know anything, please let me know. My parents were killed by those bastards. Wouldn\u2019t anyone like to know who their enemies are?\u201d The robbers cautiously made a request as Carlton and Luisen were talking. In one night, they had lost their homes, neighbors, and families; they would definitely wonder what was happening. They had no choice but to wander around the area because they had no capabilities, but they had never, not even once, felt comfortable with what had happened.Looking at how earnest they were, Luisen choked with guilt. \u2018If I were their target, then they should only have attacked me. Why attack an innocent village?\u2019\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything either. Even if we knew, it\u2019s better for you to stay ignorant as well,\u201d Carlton replied firmly. His words may have been harsh, but there was wisdom sprinkled there. This matter was intertwined with the Great Lord of the south and the unidentified forces aiming for him. These enemies clearly had extraordinary power and had been gunning for Luisen for many years; there was no way the culprit would be an ordinary person.Carlton and Luisen both knew that knowledge of their identity alone would forge a motive to kill them.Instead, Luisen apologized sincerely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t tell you more. Please don\u2019t worry too much. More than that, what will you do now? Are you going to continue to stay in these mountains?\u201d\u201c\u2026We\u2019ll have to leave. Maybe due to those monsters, the animal populations and greenery in these mountains have dried up\u2026 we have no way to make a living here.\u201d\u201cIs there any place you can go?\u201d\u201c\u2026There isn\u2019t,\u201d the robbers replied, embarrassed.Luisen wasn\u2019t a stranger to having nowhere to go. How terrible must it feel to lose your home, one that you\u2019ve had for decades, and be left with nothing? Even though the young lord was almost robbed, Luisen couldn\u2019t help but give them some advice\u2013he was too anxious to ignore them. \u201cGo west from here and you\u2019ll come upon a field. If you walk about two weeks south, you\u2019ll arrive at a village. The population there has declined quite considerably recently, so they\u2019ll accept you all.\u201dWhile Luisen was studying his duchy, he had found a village that was suffering from a shortage of manpower. The young lord also taught them about the Buried Old Hags. Now if they could sate their hunger, they wouldn\u2019t commit robbery anymore.This amount of information wasn\u2019t much for Luisen, but the robbers didn\u2019t think of it so casually. They bowed over and over, thanking him. \u201cThank you, my lord, thank you!\u201dFor those wandering around roads without a purpose, it felt very meaningful just to have a destination. Moreover, this information was guaranteed by Luisen, someone that anyone could tell was a nobleman at a surface glance.Since Luisen had played the role of a good cop, Carlton then stepped up. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve seen here should never be told to anyone. If any of this is disclosed\u2026\u201dCarlton tapped his knife, reminding them to keep their mouths closed. Luisen\u2019s advice and Carlton\u2019s warning made the robbers feel just the right balance of appreciation and fear, making them even more determined to be cautious.The men gave Luisen and Carlton their parting farewells and left their village behind. They had steely resolve, as they had already lived hard lives.The young lord and the mercenary also resumed their journey. Soon the sun set, and they found a place to stay. The two sat beside a bonfire as they burned some Buried Old Hags. Even though they had a fire, once again, they simply had the same old roots.The two filled their stomachs and organized the things they had brought from the village. Afterwards, they laid a blanket on the floor and arranged their sleeping positions. Lying side by side, Luisen stared blankly at the sky. He couldn\u2019t sleep because, when he closed his eyes, images of the village flooded his mind.The young lord tossed and turned. Because they were lying next to each other, Carlton\u2019s face filled his view. There were dark bags under his eyes, and a scraggly beard was growing in. Though it wasn\u2019t usually an appealing look, such a rough, messy, wanderer\u2019s look suited Carlton\u2019s masculinity. The mercenary\u2019s eyes were closed, but Luisen could see the man\u2019s eyes moving underneath his eyelids.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50\u201dCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d Luisen asked. Carlton\u2019s eyes immediately flew open. The young lord could see his dim reflection in the mercenary\u2019s dark pupils.\u201cWhat about you, my duke?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little worried.\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cAbout the direwolves. Why do you think they attacked the village?\u201dCarlton thought for a moment before answering, \u201cThere was nothing special about that village.\u201d\u201cExactly. It\u2019s a village founded by refugees; most people wouldn\u2019t even know that there\u2019s a village there, right?\u201d\u201cThey must have noticed it while passing by. Direwolves probably wouldn\u2019t have traveled along the road, in order to avoid attention; rather, it may have been easier to find a village hidden deep within the mountains.\u201d\u201cThen they should have simply passed by. Why did they attack?\u201d\u201cPerhaps they wanted a meal. Or perhaps it was for training.\u201d\u201c\u2026 It could have been both, I suppose.\u201d Luisen was struck speechless with misery. Recollections of bloodstains all over the place gave him an eerie, chilly feeling.Watching Luisen toss and turn, Carlton continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not the duke\u2019s fault that the town was attacked by those bastards. It\u2019s just bad luck.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not it.\u201d\u2018I\u2019m from the future,\u2019 Luisen wanted to say but swallowed those words. He could possibly have prevented this if he had been a little smarter\u2013if he was more perceptive. Just as how he had prepared for the locust attack.\u201cMy duke can\u2019t possibly know about everything in the world. And, even if you knew, you couldn\u2019t possibly prepare for everything. Everyone knows that winters are severe, but there are always people who freeze to death.\u201d Carlton spoke as if he had looked inside Luisen\u2019s heart.Luisen was astounded. \u201cEven so, I feel sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s already happened. What would change because my duke is feeling sorry? Sleep instead. Be worried during the day instead\u2013there\u2019s nothing else to do while walking, right?\u201d Carlton\u2019s words were unsympathetic and cold, but he wasn\u2019t wrong. It was time to get some sleep and replenish his strength for the work he\u2019d have to do tomorrow.Luisen forced himself to close his eyes, trying to ignore the guilty thoughts that crept into his consciousness. He then began to feel sleepy.\u201cJust as you said, I won\u2019t think about it for now\u2026 When we arrive at the capital, I\u2019ll search for more survivors from that village. I\u2019ll give them some land to craft a farm and help them settle down,\u201d Luisen murmured, half asleep.\u201cThey probably aren\u2019t part of your duchy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the south\u2019s great lord. Even if it\u2019s part of someone else\u2019s estate, I should be able to do that much.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Of course.\u201d\u201cIf you have power, you should use it. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d Luisen immediately fell asleep right after.\"\"\u201c\u2026My duke?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cLuisen Anies?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no reply; Carlton looked at Luisen\u2019s fast asleep face and stood up. Then, he carefully walked over to Luisen\u2019s feet and took off his shoes and socks. Because the young lord had worn these shoes for quite some time, there was a musty smell, but Carlton didn\u2019t mind.Luisen\u2019s feet were smooth and soft\u2013without a single callous. They were shapely and beautifully pale. Carlton was perplexed by his urge to fiddle and tickle them.\u2018What is this? Why am I like this?\u2019It was just smelly feet; why was he feeling like this?Carlton pushed down his incomprehensible impulse and continued to his goal. He washed Luisen\u2019s feet with water he had taken from the village. Next, he carefully wiped the water droplets with cloth, massaging both feet and ankles. The muscles became softer as he skillfully massaged Luisen\u2019s stiff calves. All this would make it easier for the young lord to walk tomorrow.With ointment the mercenary had collected from the village, Calrton spread it on Luisen\u2019s skin. During that entire time, Luisen was asleep\u2013dead to the world.Carlton grinned and chuckled, \u2018Sleep well.\u2019If the young lord did not awake and was ignorant to someone fiddling with his feet, he must have been incredibly exhausted. Carlton felt proud that the lord didn\u2019t show any signs of harships, as if the young lord had no desire to become a burden.Carlton placed Luisen\u2019s shoes and socks back on again. Fortunately, Luisen didn\u2019t wake. Just imagining being caught secretly taking care of the young lord made Carlton cringe and wring his hands.Carlton laid next to the young lord once more. Though the two had left the bonfire lit, the surroundings still felt cold and empty when the mercenary closed his eyes. The dead silence aroused anxiety within him.He surreptitiously and gingerly hugged Luisen. Carlton could feel a warmth within his arms; when he closed his eyes, Carlton could hear Luisen\u2019s breath mingling with his own. All this made the mercenary feel relieved.***Luisen woke the next morning nestled in Carlton\u2019s embrace.\u2018Was it really that cold during the night\u2026?\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe he hugged the mercenary even though they slept next to a bonfire. Luisen fiddled with his hair, embarrassed. Carlton stood up immediately, told the young lord that he would hunt some meat and to stay quiet, and departed into the woods.If Luisen hadn\u2019t regressed back into his younger body, he would have already reached thirty years of age; to think he\u2019d be treated like a child now\u2026 Luisen pouted.\u2018Come to think of it, how old is Carlton?\u2019 Adding how old Luisen was before regression, the young lord was almost thirty years old now. He hadn\u2019t asked the mercenary for his age, but it was unlikely the man would be over thirty years old.\u2018I\u2019m probably his hyung\u2026?\u2019\u00a01The thought of Carlton calling him \u2018hyung\u2019 gave Luisen goosebumps, but at the same time the young lord was pleased by that thought.\u2018Next time I should ask how old he is.\u2019 With that thought in mind, Luisen waited, staring blankly at his surroundings. A short while after, Carlton returned. \u201cThere are no wild animals at all in these woods\u2026\u201dBecause the mercenary had promised to bring back meat, Carlton looked a little abashed. But something far more valuable than meat stood by the mercenary\u2019s side. It looked like a horse, but much more foolish, small, and clumsy. It was a donkey with lovable long, pointed ears.\u201cWhy do you have a donkey?\u201d Luisen asked.Looking at its reigns, there was little chance that it was a wild donkey. Luisen sprang to his feet and approached Carlton; the donkey brayed and shook its head playfully.\u201cOne of the robbers told me about him a while ago. There was a donkey shared among the village, but ten days ago it ran away. I searched for it\u2013just in case\u2013and brought him here.\u201d\u201cWhen did they tell you about him?\u201d\u201cOh, just a while ago\u2013anyway, ride this guy from tomorrow onwards. He\u2019s docile.\u201d Carlton stroked the donkey\u2019s neck. The donkey seemed so attached to the mercenary; it closed its eyes and looked as if it were smiling.The donkey\u2019s black, pleased pupils were so adorable. Luisen reached his hand out to pet it.\u201cAh!\u201dThe donkey moved to bite the young lord.\u201cIt\u2019s not docile at all,\u201d Luisen pouted. This was docile? Unlike how it behaved with Carlton, the donkey glared combatively at the young lord.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? You were so sweet and gentle to Carlton,\u201d Luisen grumbled. The donkey huffed as if it found Luisen\u2019s words absurd.Carlton burst into laughter. \u201cMy duke really isn\u2019t friendly with these fellows. My lord got along with none of the horses that were being raised in your castle.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it that you\u2019re just unnaturally good with them?\u201d Luisen complained.\u201cThese guys are just especially sensitive and wary. They don\u2019t like it when you approach so carelessly.\u201d\u201cFor now, keep your distance and deliberately and cautiously showcase your approach. You must wait until he can properly sniff you.\u201d Carlton demonstrated. The donkey ate the Buried Old Hag that Carlton offered with no hesitation.\u201cI think it just likes you.\u201d\u201cJust try.\u201dLuisen hesitatingly reached out a Buried Old Hag towards the donkey. \u201cH-Here\u2026something tasty.\u201dThe donkey didn\u2019t budge one inch. \u2018Honestly, what am I doing?\u2019 Luisen thought about eating the Buried Old Hag himself, but Carlton glanced at the young lord, telling him to be patient. After a while, the donkey sniffed and carefully ate the root.\u201c!\u201d\u201cNow, try slowly reaching out and touching him. Gently.\u201dLuisen cautiously reached out to stroke the donkey\u2019s head. Its fur was softer and warmer than he had imagined. Because the donkey was chewing on the Buried Old Hag, its muscles moved fascinatingly beneath the young lord\u2019s fingertips.Luisen giggled softly. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit cute.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Carlton\u2019s attention was fixated on Luisen.Under Carlton special instruction\u2013and after much trial and error\u2013Luisen was able to eventually ride atop the donkey\u2019s back. Though the donkey was shorter than a horse, it was still a great hassle to climb up without a saddle or stirrup. Luisen felt a great sense of accomplishment and clapped his hands with Carlton\u2019s.\u00a02***The two began to move again. Luisen rode the donkey; Carlton led its reigns.Thanks to that steed, they were able to travel comfortably and reach further distances. Luisen\u2019s riding skills remained the same, but thanks to Carlton\u2019s proper handling and comfort, the donkey never stopped in the middle of the road.As his body began to relax and be at ease, Luisen was assaulted by the worries he had tried to ignore during the night. He was worried they may run into another strange group while walking down the mountain road\u2013or maybe they\u2019d encounter Ruger\u2019s gang.However, nothing happened. The monsters had driven away all the wild beasts; Carlton and Luisen felt like they were the only ones left in the world while travelling through the quiet and still forest.The lord\u2019s initial tension began to vanish; the two ambled onward as if they were on vacation. They shared trivial stories\u2013though a few of their talks left a deep impression on each other\u2013to relieve their boredom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is that also why you\u2019re so good at handling this guy?\u201d Luisen stroked the donkey\u2019s back.\u201cI was just born with it. Even when I was a child, there was no adult that could ride horses better than me,\u201d Carlton flattered himself. Though his words were irritating, there was no way to figure out if the mercenary was telling the truth; Luisen simply glared at his companion.\u201cNow that I think about it\u2026back when you were left behind in the village near the castle\u2026how did you do that? You called for the horse, right?\u201d Cartlon spoke of the incident where Luisen was left behind in the village on the way to the Vinard territory. When Carlton came to rescue the young lord, everything was already a chaotic mess. However, Luisen was able to signal his location by silently whistling and drawing the horse\u2019s attention.\u201cThat signalling method\u2013it\u2019s to call back the horse after letting it loose in a pasture,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cAh, I learned from someone I used to know.\u201d\u201cIs that perhaps the same person who gathered the sal-sal grass for you?\u201d\u201cYep. That person.\u201d Luisen naturally talked about the one-armed pilgrim throughout the course of their conversation. He had no choice but to lie to hide the fact that he had regressed, fibbing on details such as when they met. But, Luisen\u2019s ardent feelings for the one-armed pilgrim could not be hidden.\u201cHe\u2019s someone that has travelled to many places and helped those in need. Wise and merciful\u2013he was a true saint.\u201d As Luisen spoke, he gradually became more and more enthusiastic. The young lord boasted how great the one-armed pilgrim was\u2013how the man had treated him well. \u201cThat man treated me incredibly well; he taught me a lot. Thanks to him, I was able to expand my horizons.\u201d\u201cWhat did he teach you?\u201d\u201cMm\u2026For example\u2026If a stranger on the street were to slap my cheek, show him the other cheek.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll be bewildered, right? He might even call me crazy. If I attack his vital point in the opportunity presented in that situation, I\u2019ll be able to take him down in one shot. I\u2019m not useful in a fight, so I must be creative.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what your pilgrim meant.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2013his words are more meaningful than that. I\u2019m not too intelligent, so that\u2019s all I could interpret.\u201d Luisen smiled bitterly.The more Carlton listened, the more his expression distorted. To the mercenary, the one-armed pilgrim was peerlessly suspicious. He doubted the pilgrim was that honorable.However, he certainly understood that Luisen worshipped the man so much that the young lord squeezed whatever lesson he could from their interactions and engraved it into his heart. Luisen was like a believer in a cult or a young man fallen deep into his first love.\u2018Does he really like that guy so much?\u2019 Carlton felt annoyed for some reason. \u2018Aren\u2019t I better than that weirdo?\u2019 Something different from anger welled up from within; the mercenary felt like something boiling inside.As they talked, they escaped the mountains and arrived at an inn at the foot of the mountain path.The aforementioned inn was a small cottage; it was old and dirty with a musty, fishy smell emanating from various corners. Luisen doubted the place would generate much money in such a deserted place, and the building\u2019s condition was still grave.As Carlton had said in the mountain, his men would leave clues about their positions in several places if they were ever separated. This inn was one of those places.When they opened the door and entered, the scene that greeted them was even more of a spectacle. The room was dark and received no sunlight; it felt as if the air was hazy and full of unknown particles. Drunkards were day-drinking, paying no mind to whoever came in.Luisen asked Carlton doubtfully, \u201cDo you really think your men left a message for you at this sort of inn?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2018Well, if he says so.\u2019 Luisen followed the mercenary to a table. Though he didn\u2019t order anything, a man\u2013the owner perhaps\u2013placed some beer and unidentifiable mystery soup on the table. Luisen held up his spoon and hesitated.\u201cDon\u2019t eat that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFollowing Carlton\u2019s advice, Luisen lowered his spoon. \u201cWhy are we at an inn if we aren\u2019t going to dine?\u201dThe unfriendly owner snorted. Carlton neatly ignored the man. \u201cI believe a friend of mine passed by this way not long ago.\u201d\u201cWho knows? I have little idea who your friend is, but you can check that bulletin board over there.\u201d The owner spun away from them. Luisen wondered why these innkeepers were all so unkind\u2013when he was a wanderer, they would always chase him away with anything club-like.In anycase, as the innkeeper said, there was a large wooden board perched against the wall in the far corner: a bulletin board that hosted rumors and newsletters from nearby villages or messages from fellow travellers. Luisen had also seen these at inns in the past.Luisen and Carlton headed to the board; old and faded paper notes were pasted to its face. Since this location wasn\u2019t often frequented by tourists, they were able to check all of the notes quickly.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the right place,\u201d Luisen said, flustered. The young lord couldn\u2019t find any note left by Carlton\u2019s men. Besides, wasn\u2019t it illogical to leave behind a note in such a public place after being attacked? Especially if the note\u2019s content detailed secret meetup plans?\u201cNo. This is it.\u201d Carlton tore off one of the notes on the board. The note was a love letter to \u2018My Dear Ennis.\u2019 The content was something like \u2018I miss you,\u2019 and \u2018The family\u2019s gone on ahead, and I\u2019m waiting for you with friends.\u2019\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t touch another person\u2019s love letter,\u201d Luisen admonished sternly.Though, he really couldn\u2019t understand people who left love letters in such a shabby inn.\u201cThis is it: Ennis. That\u2019s the name of one of my lieutenants\u2019 girlfriend.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cThis note is masquerading as a love letter.\u201d\u201cAha!\u201d Luisen was convinced. \u2018So, they\u2019re using secret messages that only the members of his group would understand?\u2019\u201cIt\u2019s exactly as it says. The family refers to our army; the friends must be a few key members. Perhaps when we disappeared, they divided themselves into two groups. One group takes the spoils to the capital and the other was left to search for us.\u201d\u201cAh, so that\u2019s how you read it. But, the letter didn\u2019t reveal where those men are, did it?\u201d\u201cAh, to know that, take a look at the peculiarly slanted letters.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Luisen glanced at the paper for a while. He had no idea what the mercenary was talking about\u2026He looked at Carlton with glum eyes, \u201cYou all\u2026live such complicated lives. So systematic. My own army doesn\u2019t go this far. Usually, don\u2019t most mercenaries not know how to read, let alone write?\u201d\u201cWhen we first conceived this system, it was quite a headache to establish. We really struggled to teach them; we had to capture members that ran away because they didn\u2019t want to study.\u201d\u201cImpressive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to drag around mercenaries while also being part of the prince\u2019s entourage, you know.\u201d Cartlon shrugged his shoulders; his expression belied self-pride.Indeed, Luisen admired his self-made nature, easy masculinity, and his quick rise in status. \u201cSo, where are we to meet them?\u201d\u201cConfosse.\u201d\u201cAh. There.\u201dConfosse Castle was located in a city at the crossroads between a large river that cut through the kingdom and a major road. Originally, it housed an important fortress for military endeavors, but the city naturally flourished because it was at the heart of transportation routes.Because of that, nobles did not favor travelling through Confosse. They viewed it as a disorderly and congested castle that often had a transient, floating population of strangers.\u201cHave you ever been?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cNo. If you go past that place, you\u2019ll come across a lake. There\u2019s a nice cottage there; that\u2019s where I usually stayed.\u201d Luisen had never even entered Confosse. If the Duke of Anies had dropped by, the residents would have begged him to stay the night.\u201cIt\u2019s disorganized and free. They don\u2019t even inspect visitors at the gate.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t conduct inspections?\u201d Luisen was surprised. In this kingdom, people weren\u2019t able to liberally move between most territories; access permits were usually required when entering castles.\u201cThey don\u2019t. Whether night or day, the castle gates are always open; they don\u2019t mind who comes and goes,\u201d Carlton responded.\u201cSo, places like that exist? Hmm.\u201d\u201cTherefore, all we have to do is go there\u2013no other preparation needed. It\u2019s a half a day\u2019s worth of travel from our current location.\u201d\u201cReally? Then, let\u2019s go quickly.\u201dAfter properly organizing the letter within their belongings, Luisen and Carlton left the inn and began to travel again. At the thought of reuniting with Carlton\u2019s men, energy surged throughout their bodies.****************Outside Confosse Castle\u2019s walls.Luisen and Carlton hid themselves in the bushes as they gazed over at Confosse\u2019s gates. An unexpected trouble awaited them.There was a checkpoint and a long line in front of the castle gates. Contrary to Carlton\u2019s words, four soldiers stood at the gate, carefully examining the IDs, passes, and luggage of those entering.\u201cI thought you said the doors were always open here.\u201d\u201cThat is what I said\u2013it wasn\u2019t like this the last time I came.\u201d Carlton didn\u2019t expect this at all.\u201cIs there something happening? More than that, do you have your ID?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t. What about the duke?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never travelled around with my identification.\u201dCarlton gave a sneaky glance towards Luisen. Though he couldn\u2019t properly see his face underneath the hood, the young lord\u2019s jawline and facial shape were slim and beautiful. It was clear he wasn\u2019t an ordinary man. \u201cYou certainly have an impactful face; it\u2019d be best to take more care to hide it.\u201d Carlton pulled Luisen\u2019s hood down over his chin as well.\u201cNo\u2026I\u2019m not talking about my face\u2026\u201dBeing part of a family as prominent as the Anies meant that, even without an ID, all castle gates opened for him; the lords of that territory would run out, barefoot, to greet him.TL: So, short translator note that doesn\u2019t really fit in any one footnote:It\u2019s really hard to consider what to do about dialogue here. Carlton has become much more polite to Luisen than he had been in the beginning of the novel\u2026but he\u2019s not speaking very flowery or prose-y either. He\u2019s quite brusque\u2013but politely brusque\u2013while maintaining all formalities and respect he should maintain with a noble. In a sense, he\u2019s admitting Luisen\u2019s high status.\u2026And yet that\u2019s really hard to convey in dialogue especially bc English doesn\u2019t have hierarchical formality sort of engraved into their language. Still >.< I hope this was somewhat informative.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We must enter the castle to find your men, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be a brief checkpoint.\u201dThe atmosphere outside the castle gates seemed too grave to be a singular, unexpected event.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Perhaps I should wait for night to fall and then climb the walls.\u201d\u201cClimb the walls? The castle walls?\u201d Surprised, Luisen looked between the walls and Carlton. His companion declared he would climb the wall\u2013which looked to be as tall as a three-story building\u2013without a ladder?\u201cIt\u2019ll be difficult and take a long time, but there\u2019s no choice. I\u2019ll carry my lord on my back.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you even a human being? Answer me truthfully. Your ancestry isn\u2019t mixed with trolls or the like, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m joking,\u201d Carlton said nonchalantly. However, Luisen thought it truly might have been possible for Carlton\u2013after all, this man had jumped off a waterfall with the young lord.Luisen felt dizzy. He couldn\u2019t do this; Luisen needed to step forward. \u201c\u2026Let\u2019s enter normally. Properly, with our two feet.\u201d\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026a haphazard one\u2026Follow me.\u201d Luisen took the lead; Carlton followed obediently behind, holding the donkey\u2019s reins. For the past few days, Luisen had walked while staring at Carlton\u2019s back; now their positions had been reversed. It felt strange. The two stopped and circled around the castle gates.Luisen wasn\u2019t aiming for the front nor the back of the castle but instead the ambiguous sides. Places that bordered the nearby forests and were particularly overgrown. Luisen concentrated in his search for those spots.Beside the thick walls was an unusually gnarled and well-grown tree. After brushing a branch to the side, the two could see a window behind them. It was just large enough for an adult man to squeeze through to enter the castle. However, the issue was the iron plates that blocked the window.\u201cWho knew that this would be here. However, this way is properly blocked.\u201d Carlton tapped at the iron plates. \u201cI think it\u2019ll make a loud noise if I were to pull it off forcefully.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what you do\u2013there\u2019s a trick to everything.\u201d Luisen picked up a fallen branch and, following the young lord\u2019s know-how, wedged the branch in the bricks around the iron plates. The bricks that were firmly welded to the iron plates began to shake. Carlton noted what Luisen wanted to do and pulled at the iron plates to add more force. Then, the plate, with the bricks attached, fell off.\u201cFor something like this, don\u2019t focus on the iron plate. It\u2019s easy to pull out if you extract the surrounding bricks,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cHave you ever been to Confosse?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s my first time here, but castles usually have secret entrances\u00a01\u00a0like these.\u201dNo matter how open the castle gates may have usually been, there would always be people who had no desire to enter through legal means.Luisen shrugged his shoulders.\u201cDid you learn all this from the pilgrim as well?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cNo, I learned this from someone else.\u201dThe one-armed pilgrim carried a pilgrim\u2019s pass and could confidently come and go from the main gates. Luisen learned this know-how from a generous beggar the young lord had met during his travels. In other words, this was a secret method available to those who couldn\u2019t enter the gates on their own merits.Luisen and Carlton entered the castle through the window. Luisen wanted to bring the donkey with him, but the poor beast wouldn\u2019t be able to fit through the window. Therefore, they were forced to let it roam free outside. Since the donkey had survived well in the woods on its own, it should be alright.The window was connected to a deserted dead-end.\u201cWhere should we go from here?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s first go to the central plaza.\u201d\u201cThe plaza has things like bulletin boards, right?\u201d Luisen had thought he had seen something similar to the boards in these plazas before. He had wondered who would ever use such things, but it seemed like people\u2013for example, Carlton\u2013actually utilized them.Luisen neatly groomed his clothes and made sure his face was well hidden; Carlton gave him the go-ahead. Afterwards, the two walked naturally out to the main road and mixed in with the crowds. Carlton\u2019s physique was somewhat conspicuous, but he suffered nothing more than a few glances\u2013this castle housed a mercenary\u2019s guild, after all.The castle\u2019s inner structure was quite ordinary, so it was easy for the two to locate the plaza. The place was so crowded\u2013a minor pandemonium. There were two bulletin boards here. One board contained the presiding lord\u2019s commands and decrees or other news relevant to those in the fief; the other could be used freely by anyone.It was hard for the two to approach the bulletin boards because too many people were crowding them, but Luisen had Carlton. Whenever Cartlon frowned and strode forth, the nearby people automatically moved aside.\u201cIt\u2019s here.\u201d The note was easy to find; similar to the one found in the inn, the note was addressed to \u2018my beloved Ennis.\u2019 However, the note\u2019s content was vastly different; the note didn\u2019t pretend to be a shy love letter nor were there secret passwords hidden within. The writer had left behind an incredibly concise comment.[ XX is doome d]\u2018\u2026\u2026?\u2019Did Luisen see wrong? \u201cAm I reading things incorrectly? There\u2019s something strange written there. Are you sure this is correct?\u201d\u201cI believe it\u2019s the right one.\u201d Carlton also looked perplexed.\u201cIt\u2019s saying something went wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Carlton looked at the note with a grave expression. Then, he suddenly rushed at the official, lordly bulletin board. He pushed everyone away and stood at the front; there, he could clearly see a prominent official decree.Luisen stuttered as he read, \u201cThe Duke of Anies has been kidnapped\u2026The culprit is\u2026Carlton\u2026?\u201d\u2018Me? I\u2019ve been kidnapped?\u2019No matter how many times Luisen read the official decree, the content didn\u2019t change. The decree was authorized by the duchy\u2013the Duke of Anies had been abducted by Carlton; if anyone knows relevant information, they should send a report. The general, authorized as an official agent of the territory, had signed the decree at the bottom, so the paper had not been forged.\u201cSo, this is saying\u2026\u201d Alarmed, Luisen looked at Carlton before looking once more at the crumpled note in the mercenary\u2019s hand.[ XX is doomed ]The succinct letters seared themselves into the young lord\u2019s eyes.Doomed.Yeah. It seemed so.\u2018Just what\u2019s happening here, General?!\u2019 Luisen shouted inwardly at his retainers back at the duchy. Even though he was puzzled, he could hear the noisy sounds from those gathered around the bulletin board.\u201cApparently a bunch of mercenaries and soldiers gave pursuit to the duke during their battle; in the bedlam, the duke was captured and taken away. Apparently, those people were Carlton\u2019s men.\u201d\u201cAre you certain? I heard that man\u2019s army went north and brought back some enormous trophy.\u201dCarlton\u2019s men must have managed to only leave behind this one note before being taken away by some soldiers. Luisen looked over at Carlton, whose face had turned pale. Carlton couldn\u2019t have missed what Luisen had just heard.\u201cIsn\u2019t the noble butcher the prince\u2019s right-hand man? So, why did he kidnap one of the great lords?\u201d\u201cI suppose he went insane.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a peasant who\u2019s elevated his status to well beyond his means\u2013do you think he\u2019d be sane?\u201dCarlton\u2019s felt like his insides were boiling. Sure, he\u2019d killed a few aristocrats\u2013sure he\u2019d bullied them\u2013but that was acceptable in civil war time. He had no motive to kidnap anyone, nor was there evidence that he had ever kidnapped Luisen.However, Carlton was treated as a criminal just because he and Luisen had disappeared together; his men were unfairly captured. He felt so unfairly wronged and furious.\u2018Ruger, the real asshole who tried to kidnap Luisen, was an aristocrat; it was obvious that the person behind Ruger would be of noble blood as well. However, my men and I are treated like this just because we\u2019re of low birth?\u2019 Carlton rolled his eyes.Anger sprouted from within his heart. He wanted to wring the necks of those laughing. When the mercenary reached out\u2013about to follow his anger and swing at those around him\u2013Luisen quickly grabbed Carlton\u2019s arm. \u201cCalm down, hm? Just hold it in for now.\u201dLuisen revealed his blue eyes from underneath his hood. Carlton paused, anger momentarily abated, when he saw the young lord\u2019s distorted expression\u2013as if he had been personally insulted.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to whatever you say\u2013whatever curses you want to shout. Okay?\u201d Luisen\u2019s soothing voice was slightly unstable.Carlton finally remembered his surroundings. \u2018That\u2019s right, I\u2019m not alone. Now\u2019s not the time to go wild; it\u2019s time to be patient. I still have to protect Luisen.\u2019\"\"With that thought, his anger quickly subsided. \u201cI apologize. I just felt so furious, I\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, Luisen had warned the mercenary to watch his temper before. Carlton eyed the young lord.Luisen was just relieved that Carlton had calmed down. His temper would eventually be his downfall. Still, what a relief\u2013the mercenary\u00a0 had endured the comments well.\u201cLet\u2019s first go someplace quiet,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cYes.\u201dThe two slipped out of the plaza, climbed through the same castle window, and exited the castle entirely. The donkey was grazing on grass. When the donkey saw the two, it approached Luisen and placed its head on the young lord.What a happy-go-lucky fellow. The donkey\u2019s fur was short and rough, but Luisen felt his trembling heart calm down as he gently stroked the steed. Perhaps this was why people raised pets. Luisen grabbed Carlton\u2019s hand and placed it on the donkey\u2019s head so that the mercenary might also receive some comfort.\u201cTo think they would think you kidnapped me. How could all news of the real kidnapper and the monster attack just vanish into thin air? What do you think?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cIt\u2019s probably all Ruger\u2019s doing,\u201d Carlton said with conviction. \u201cNobody knows he\u2019s a spy, correct? The only ones in the know are my lord and I\u2013and we\u2019ve disappeared together. It\u2019s understandable they would think I\u2019ve kidnapped my lord.\u201d\u201cHow is it understandable? No matter how one looks at it, you\u2019re not the kind of person to kidnap anyone.\u201d Luisen refuted his companion\u2019s words, but Carlton had a point.Footnotes\uac1c\uad6c\uba4d = Dog-hole.

    "Chapter 53": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 53Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was a high chance that Ruger had returned to the duchy, acted like a faithful servant, and spread false information. If that weren\u2019t the case, why would Carlton be accused of kidnapping Luisen?\u201c\u2026I apologize. You came to help me, but were repaid with accusations. Your men needlessly suffered as well.\u201d Luisen felt heavy with guilt\u2013if he had simply returned to the castle without insisting on travelling forth to the capital, Carlton would at least not be framed for his kidnapping.\u201cNo, this is actually better. Looking at this situation, I\u2019m certain that returning to the duchy would be the same as walking into his hands.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to be accused of kidnapping my lord than for you to have actually been kidnapped. At the very least, your safety is assured.\u201d Carlton coughed, a little shy. \u201cMy men\u2026they are not weak. If my duke arrives at the capital, safe and sound, their charges will naturally be cleared.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ll never forget all that you and your men have suffered. When we reach the capital, I\u2019ll make sure to see that you\u2019re paid several times over for these troubles,\u201d Luisen firmly declared.Carlton chuckled as he looked at the young lord, who had resolutely clenched his fist. Hardships change people\u2013the person would not be the same before and after.\u00a01\u00a0This especially applies to the aristocracy. Carlton did not believe in promises made by nobles, but he was convinced that Luisen would surely keep today\u2019s promise.\u201cThough perhaps this conversation should be shelved until we reach the capital.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Luisen sighed weakly. \u201cYour men have all scattered\u2026You\u2019ve become a kidnapper\u2026Ruger is still looking for me with all his might\u2026 He\u2019s even host to some unidentified power and has the support of some unknown comrades\u2026\u201dThe two were in an abysmal situation.The rescuing party was taken away as criminals; Carlton became a wanted man. These simple accusations were likely to be undone if Luisen came forward and proclaimed he wasn\u2019t kidnapped, but Ruger wasn\u2019t likely to give them this opportunity. Perhaps he\u2019d stage another monster attack.Burdened by these criminal charges, it wasn\u2019t easy for the two to go to the capital. All Luisen and Carlton had to their name were their bodies and a donkey.That was perhaps enough to cross the mountains for a few days, but the road to the capital was long and difficult. If they were to follow the main road, they had to cross the river with a boat and cross through various fiefdoms. Of course, the two needed artifices to prove their identities while travelling.The two needed to hide their true identities, though, to avoid Ruger\u2019s notice and to avoid Carlton\u2019s capture as a kidnapper.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to hide our identities\u2026if we hide our faces, others will think we\u2019re dubious individuals\u2026We have no money either\u2026\u201d How had Luisen travelled to the North all by himself in the previous timeline? He had just run like crazy\u2013as if he were being chased. Now that he thought about it, Luisen felt something was suspect.\u2018Come to think of it, that\u2019s strange. How was I, alone, able to go so far\u2013when I had no energy nor strength?\u2019At that time, Luisen had been suffering from the delusion that someone was chasing him, but now that he was thinking objectively, no one had been looking for him. No matter how his estate and territory were ruined\u2013even if all the retainers had died\u2026 No matter how ridiculed Luisen was\u2026Even if he was a shame to all nobility, someone would probably have searched for him, either to profit off his perceived wealth or his status as a great lord.\u2018Am I just remembering wrong? Was I too harried to observe what was happening around me? Or, did that have anything to do with Ruger\u2019s gang?\u2019 Luisen inadvertently grabbed his head. It felt very disturbing and depressing to doubt his own experiences.Just as Luisen was about to spiral again, Carlton spoke out and cut off the young lord\u2019s string of thought, \u201cLet\u2019s disguise ourselves.\u201d\u201cWhat disguise?\u201d\u201cIf you disguise yourself as a pilgrim, you won\u2019t be suspected even if you were to cover your face.\u201d\u201cOf course\u2013all pilgrims cover their faces and hide their names.\u201dPilgrims didn\u2019t settle down in one place and wandered around the kingdom, deeply contemplating upon the teachings of God. In this era, it was one of the few jobs in which people could wander around from place to place with no set destination. Since it was common for them to hide their faces and their name, as Carlton said, a pilgrim was a perfect disguise for those that wanted to shroud their true identities.However, someone could not become a pilgrim just by wearing a hood and claiming to be one. A pilgrim carried several necessities: a bible, a holy item, and a pass issued by the Church. In particular, the pass was what guaranteed one\u2019s status as a pilgrim; one could be recognized as a pilgrim if they had a pass, even if they didn\u2019t have the other items.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a pass. That\u2019s something that can\u2019t be forged\u2013the Church engraves its signature into such things,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cThat\u2019s alright.\u201d Carlton suddenly untied his trousers.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Luisen shouted as he shut his eyes tight\u2013the young lord had even covered the donkey\u2019s eyes.Carlton chuckled and laughed mischievously, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing that my lord hasn\u2019t seen before, why are you making such a fuss? In fact, you\u2019ve done more than just seeing \u2018it.'\u201dHe referred to the time Luisen had knelt down in front of the mercenary and attempted to take off his trousers. Luisen\u2019s ears burned bright red, \u201cBack then\u2026I only untied your drawstrings. Technically, I didn\u2019t take off your pants.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. And, this time also, I won\u2019t take them off. I\u2019m merely untying the strings.\u201dLuisen peeked through narrowed, half-closed eyes; Carlton really didn\u2019t take off his pants. The mercenary reached inside and tore off a bag that had been sewn inside the pant cloth. He then re-tied the strings again. There was a round piece of copper within that bag.\u201cJust what is that for you to hide it inside your pants?\u201d\u201cThis is a pilgrim\u2019s pass.\u201d\u201cWhat? That?\u201d Luisen furrowed his brows as he observed the metal fragment\u2013it looked nothing like a pass. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a pilgrim\u2019s pass once before. It was far more delicate and beautiful than this. Also, it was made of silver. We can\u2019t scam anyone with such a clumsy fake.\u201d\u201cThis truly is authentic. I gilded its surface to dissuade robbers. If we take this to a blacksmith, he\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d\u201cIt really is a pilgrim\u2019s pass, then? Why do you have this?\u201d\u201cI found it on a dead pilgrim\u2019s corpse. I saved it for instances where accidents happen and I\u2019ll need to escape quickly\u2013I\u2019ve been holding onto it like a life-saving elixir.\u201d Carlton continued to say that this was incredibly\u00a0*incredibly*\u00a0precious.Luisen was astonished at the mercenary\u2019s meticulousness. The rumor\u2013one that had been a common conspiracy theory before the young lord\u2019s regression\u2013that Carlton had not been executed but, instead, had escaped had suddenly risen in plausibility. \u201cBut, we only have one pass, don\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m planning to disguise myself as a mercenary. Pilgrims from wealthy families often hire mercenaries as a guide.\u201d\u201cMmhm, that\u2019s right. As a mercenary and pilgrim, we may stand out, but at least we won\u2019t be taken away for being too suspicious. As for pilgrims, religious folk will occasionally provide them with food, a place to sleep, and sometimes money\u2026 We won\u2019t have to worry about travel expenses.\u201d\u201cDo you think you can pretend to be a pilgrim?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s easy enough.\u201d As Luisen followed the one-armed pilgrim around, he had watched his movements and actions closely. He knew intimately how pilgrims behaved when talking about faith and dealing with believers. It wouldn\u2019t even be hard to imitate him.Carlton\u2019s plan was very feasible; Luisen immediately agreed.\u201cLet\u2019s return to the castle\u2019s city. After stopping by the mercenary\u2019s guild and blacksmith\u2019s shop, we\u2019ll finally have our identities. Let\u2019s stay underneath a decent roof for the first time in a long while,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cAh, wait. But we\u2019ll need immediate spending money.\u201d Since the mercenary had taken out his hidden ace, Luisen couldn\u2019t sit still. Luisen took off his hood and brushed his hair to one side. \u201cCut it.\u201d\u201cYour hair?\u201d\u201cYes. Long, golden hair sells for a large amount. I haven\u2019t cut mine for that reason\u2013just in case.\u201dBefore regression, when Luisen ran out of money and was left to suck on his fingers in hunger, someone had approached him and suggested he sell his hair. At that moment, Luisen found out that hair could be used as currency. Since then, he had often cut and sold his hair. Although, after some time, his nutrition had deteriorated enough that he couldn\u2019t grow enough hair to sell.Because of such memories, even after waking in the new timeline, the young lord had grown his hair without trimming it. Even if Ruger had suggested a small trim, Luisen adamantly refused.\u201cDid you expect to find yourself in this sort of situation?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cHow could I? I\u2019m someone who loathes throwing out small pieces of bread\u2013it\u2019s a waste to trim my hair.\u201dAn aristocrat who refused to cut his hair because he couldn\u2019t afford one loaf of bread\u2013that man was the owner of a land where fields of wheat flowed out past the horizon. Carlton was simultaneously dumbfounded and saddened. How was it that a noble like him learned how to sell his hair?\u201cNow, hurry,\u201d Luisen urged.Carlton took out his dagger and carefully grasped Luisen\u2019s hair with his opposite hand. Luisen\u2019s hair was rich in color and shiny\u2013like real gold. The texture beneath the mercenary\u2019s fingertips was surprisingly soft\u2026yet smooth and taut as well.Anyone would be jealous and want to covet this hair. In addition, it suited Luisen so incredibly well. The young lord had a beautiful jawline and delicate, elegant features; he looked like a lovely, gilded statue.Carlton couldn\u2019t help but rub the golden strands.TL: For a mercenary, Carlton sure waxes poetic on how hot he finds Luisen.Also, thank you so much, Kate, for the Ko-fi! This bonus chap is dedicated to you!Sadly, I\u2019ll probably have to slow down next week (thesis writing + I\u2019m currently sick T_T) As always, I have my schedule on Discord so ya\u2019ll can grab updates from me.FootnotesThe original is actually an idiom: a person before going to the bathroom and after going to the bathroom is not the same.

    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCarlton couldn\u2019t help but to paw at Luisen\u2019s hair. \u201cIt\u2019s such a waste.\u201d\u201cMy hair will grow again.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s true, cutting one\u2019s hair wasn\u2019t a big deal. However it didn\u2019t sit right with Carlton that the young lord was cutting his hair for money. Cutting and selling their hair was a last resort for wives of poor families.\u201cBesides, there\u2019s nothing better than this for quick money,\u201d Luisen said.The young lord\u2019s words were correct. Because they had no coin on them currently, it would be hard to restore the pilgrim\u2019s pass. The mercenary had been considering hiding Luisen up in a tree and breaking into the castle, alone, to steal the money. However, it was far better to sell hair than to steal. Still, Carlton couldn\u2019t help but hesitate.Luisen looked sullenly at Carlton before deciding to take care of it himself. \u201cGive it to me.\u201dLuisen took the dagger from Carlton\u2019s hand. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, the young lord grabbed his hair and cleanly cut it off. The dagger was incredibly sharp because Carlton had been grinding it against the whetstone this morning; before the mercenary could stop him, Luisen had cut his hair.\u201cOkay, that\u2019s enough, right?\u201d Luisen handed the bundle of hair to Carlton.The mercenary looked down at the strands in his hand. It was beautiful\u2013like a bushel of golden thread\u2013but Carlton\u2019s mind felt conflicted.The mercenary tore his gaze away from the golden hair and looked at Luisen. Because the young lord had cut just below his ears, his hair began to spread out in all directions; it was as if a mouse had begun nibbling at its ends. Carlton couldn\u2019t laugh at all\u2013instead, his heart felt weighty at how bare the lord\u2019s neck looked.In the past, one of Carlton\u2019s men once drunkenly said that he became a mercenary because his wife had sold her hair for money. He had chosen this tough job because of his self loathing\u2013he hated himself for being so incompetent, causing his wife to sell her hair. Carlton didn\u2019t understand at that time; it was just hair. It\u2019ll grow again with time\u2013how insignificant.Luisen wasn\u2019t Carlton\u2019s wife, but now the mercenary understood his men\u2019s feelings.He\u2019d never felt so powerless and incompetent before. Carlton was someone who took pride in his capabilities\u2013it defined his identity.\u201c\u2026Just this time. This won\u2019t happen again. Whatever may happen, I\u2019ll make sure we\u2019re not short of money,\u201d Carlton vowed. Whether through hunting or manual labor, this would never happen again.\u201cWell\u2026do as you please?\u201d Luisen said.\u2018Does Sir Carlton really hate being in my debt?\u2019 Contemplating on Carlton\u2019s strange obsessions, Luisen drew the hood over his head once again.***The two re-entered the castle. As a city often frequented by a lot of tourists, Confosse\u2019s back alleys were also quite bustling. It was a perfect place for fencing and laundering items secretly.\u00a01It wasn\u2019t that hard to sell hair. Although hair was often sold at a bargain, Luisen\u2019s hair was long and well-maintained\u2013smooth, taut, and authentically blonde. That particular hair color was quite rare, so it made the strands more valuable than market price. On top of that, Carlton won a few more coins through some haggling and intimidation.Looking at that, Luisen\u2019s insides boiled. \u2018Wow, when I first sold my hair, I got less than half this price.\u2019However skilled Carlton may have been at bargaining, the price difference was just too much! He must have given away his hair back then for way too cheap. At the time, Luisen knew wigs were made of human hair, but he had no concept of money or how much his hair was worth. Back then, he had just been happy that he could get money at all for something like that.Carlton didn\u2019t know how much hair was usually sold for either. Instead, Carlton knew how to bargain by observing his customer\u2019s reaction.\u2018I should have done that. What a shame\u2026\u2019 Luisen thought.It was all in the past, but Luisen still felt wasteful. When he recalled how he had happily agreed after being offered a small amount of money, Luisen felt an urge to punch the air. Instead, the young lord clenched his fists.Carlton noticed Luisen\u2019s body language\u2013the mercenary imagined that, no matter how at ease the noble seemed as he offered to sell his hair, no noble would be happy with resorting to an impoverished wife\u2019s tactics. Though the other may have pretended this was a trivial matter, he was sure to feel slightly hurt.Carlton felt sorry for Luisen, patted him on the shoulder, and offered him words of comfort. \u201cSince we have money now, let\u2019s eat a long-awaited decent meal for dinner.\u201dAt Carlton\u2019s consoling, Luisen smiled and nodded. One of Luisen\u2019s strengths was his ability to move on without much regret. The two continued on, ignorant of the minor misunderstanding that passed between them.Holding their money, Luisen and Carlton searched for a blacksmith. Located in the same alley, there was an old blacksmith that mainly handled stolen goods; he was a perfect candidate for keeping secrets because the man was illiterate and mute. The blacksmith worked robotically on the pilgrim\u2019s pass without questioning them.When the bronze attached to the surface was peeled off, the pilgrim\u2019s pass\u2019s original appearance was revealed. The silver plaque was engraved with the Church\u2019s symbol\u2013the sign for \u2018light.\u2019 The brilliant and chilling hue spread out in all directions in the form of rays. Even those that were ignorant of the symbol\u2019s true meaning would recognize that this was not an ordinary object from its sophistication.After exiting the alley, Luisen threaded a leather string through the pass and hung it around his neck.Now that Luisen\u2019s fake identity had been secured, it was Carlton\u2019s turn next. They continued down the same road and entered the mercenary\u2019s guild, and there they requested a mercenary plaque issued in the name of someone from Carlton\u2019s company. The mercenary said that he had lost his plaque when he had encountered a robber on his way here.At first, the guild staff looked at Carlton and Luisen with open suspicion and refused to issue the plaque. Honestly, how could they have entered the heavily fortified castle gate without proper identification or a mercenary\u2019s plaque? In addition, Carlton looked far more like a bandit than a mercenary. It was reasonable for the staff to believe that Carlton may be the robber and not the robbed.However, when Luisen stealthily showed the staff his pilgrim\u2019s pass, all doubt was cleared. The employee gladly made a new plaque. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say you were hired to escort an honored pilgrim earlier?\u201dThese passes were issued and managed by the Church; it was a guarantee of one\u2019s status and devotion. Therefore, those with pilgrim\u2019s passes were protected and formally recognized by the Church. No other proof of identity was needed. Under that logic, a mercenary hired by such a pilgrim was also indirectly under the protection and employ of the Church, so no further proof was needed for them either.\u201cThis really works!\u201d Luisen was surprised. He had learned that the pilgrim\u2019s pass was quite useful as he\u2019d followed around the one-armed saint, but he didn\u2019t know the extent of its influence.\u201cThat is what I\u2019ve said. With that, no matter what you look like, you can avoid inspections wherever you go.\u201d\u201cStill, I thought they\u2019d ask where we came from and what we intend to do here.\u201d\u201cMost common folk are afraid to have their faith called into question. They may make the Church unhappy by uselessly interrogating pilgrims about this and that.\u201dLuisen nodded. That was true. This kingdom believed in one god, and the Church\u2019s opinion was reflected in all of the kingdom\u2019s greatest events. The clergy was never missing from official ceremonies, and these matters often followed religious procedures detailed by the Church. As a result, the Church\u2019s influence was quite strong in the people\u2019s daily lives. Priests often were local leaders in rural villages, where the Lord\u2019s governmental influence was weak.Luisen had previously lived a decadent life as a recognized noble trash\u2013all his friends were the same. They had never been very religiously conscious. In his mind, he imagined the Church as a place where kind priests gave out food as charity.In any case, after recognizing the power of the pilgrim\u2019s pass, Luisen looked at Carlton with new eyes. \u201cWith something like this as a hidden ace, you could have travelled the world with no fear! Everyone would have believed you.\u201d\u201cI must seem like a very temperamental man, but I\u2019m not thoughtless,\u201d Carlton spoke arrogantly.Luisen was dumbfounded. \u2018If you\u2019re aware of your own temper, then shouldn\u2019t you try to reign that in\u2026?\u2019 As he thought that, Luisen fiddled with his pass. Did Carlton really use this in the previous timeline? Now, though, there was no way to know for sure.***Going forward, the pilgrim\u2019s pass proved very useful. The two left the shady alley and walked confidently on bright, sunlit streets. Because they had been wandering the mountains, they looked dirty and shabby; the two were unrivalled in ruggedness in Confosse\u2019s streets.The combination of Carlton\u2019s unapproachable atmosphere and Luisen\u2019s tightly covered body should have been quite suspicious. And yet, no one doubted them.\"\"When the two went shopping, the merchants were reluctant to sell at first but changed their behavior once they saw the pilgrim\u2019s pass. Some weren\u2019t completely friendly, but by and large the merchants treated the two well rather than ignoring them or chasing them away. Even the vigilant guards, who were questioning the passersby, smiled at the pass and walked by.Thanks to that, Luisen and Carlton were able to safely buy what they needed and obtain a room in a clean and decent inn.FootnotesFencing = selling stolen items. Laundering = turning dirty money into legal money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe room they had gotten at the inn was small but neat: two beds alongside a bathtub. They had said they wanted to bathe immediately, so the employees brought bathwater right away. Luisen, realizing how dirty he was as he walked around the streets of Confosse and compared himself to others, took off his clothes and went inside the bathroom to clean.He meticulously washed away the accumulated sweat and dirt. When he thoroughly soaked himself inside the bathtub, a sigh automatically released from his throat. It finally felt like he was able to rest properly. In the mountains, sleep felt more like falling unconscious rather than resting for the night. Immersing himself until the water was up to the tip of his nose, Luisen blankly reminisced on all that had happened.He had been attacked by monsters; Ruger was revealed as a spy. He had walked here, nonstop, with Carlton, and now he was posing as a pilgrim.He was struck by how many things had happened\u2013from the duchy to Confosse. It was an incredibly difficult and hectic journey.\u2018I\u2019d have had more trouble without Carlton.\u2019Since before regression, he had memories of wandering around the kingdom, he probably would have somehow wandered until he reached the capital. However, he was sure to have taken more time and encountered more difficulties. Even now, he would still probably be wandering around in the mountains. The feeling of being lost when he had woken from the cave was still fresh in the young lord\u2019s mind.Carlton was incredibly competent. As he watched the man from the side, Luisen realized how the man had overcome the limitations of his status, quickly emerged as the powerful right arm of the prince, and gained fame throughout the kingdom. Carlton was someone who, if he was dropped stark naked in enemy territory, could return in great success, draped in silk.\u2018If I follow Carlton well, at least I won\u2019t starve to death.\u2019The memory of Carlton bargaining during the day, cutting merchants\u2019 prices in half and even obtaining a peach as a bonus for their purchase, made Luisen\u2019s heart flutter. \u2018Food automatically appears before talented people!\u2019He had thought the mercenary would be smart and strong, but who would have expected such worldly survival knowledge? What did Carlton even lack? An even temper?\u2018To be fair, his temper is a problem. That temper even ruined his livelihood\u2026.\u2019As expected\u2013there was no perfect person in this world, Luisen realized. Life had an element of fairness.After thinking of this and that, Luisen finally left the bathtub because his body had gotten too warm. He wiped his body with a washcloth, but he had neglected to bring a change of clothes into the bathroom.\u2018I don\u2019t really wanna wear my used clothes\u2026\u2019Though his old clothes were crafted by artisans using expensive cloth, they had already been transformed into rags. They smelled, and Luisen\u2019s skin itched just from looking at them. It felt uncomfortable to wear these dirty things after finally managing to take a bath.Luisen sneakily inched open the bathroom door and looked into the room. The new clothes, alongside other items they bought, laid on the table.\u2018Did Carlton go somewhere?\u2019The mercenary wasn\u2019t in the room.\u2018How fortuitous.\u2019Luisen rushed into the room and grabbed his new clothes\u2013baggy pants and a flowy, one-size-fits-all tunic.They were sewn from coarse cloth, cheap and incomparable to Luisen\u2019s original clothes. However, the new clothes were far hardier. Furthermore, the young lord could also be more active since the clothes didn\u2019t wrap tightly around his body.Just as Luisen wore his new underwear and was tucking his legs into the pants, the door opened, and Carlton entered. Luisen had thought a stranger had appeared and moved to hide but was relieved when he saw the mercenary. \u201cDid you also wash up? We should have washed together.\u201d\u201c\u2026The room next door was empty, so I used the bathroom there.\u201d Carlton responded half a beat late, but Luisen didn\u2019t notice any of that. The young lord\u2019s attention was on the mercenary\u2019s hair\u2013Carlton\u2019s hair color had changed to a rich, dark brown. Though the hair color had only changed slightly, the mercenary seemed to give off a softer impression.\u201cHow did you do that to your hair?\u201d the young lord asked.\u201c\u2026I soaked it in beer.\u201d\u201cWell done. The slight change of color makes you look like a completely different person.\u201dCarlton and Luisen\u2019s descriptions were written on the wanted poster. Changing hair color would put them out of the direct line of suspicion-what a good idea.Luisen also thought of dyeing his hair, but his face was more conspicuous than anything else. No matter what hair color he chose, his features looked incredibly aristocratic. It would be better to cover his face with a hood.With a nod, Luisen finished putting on his pants. The mercenary stood there, motionless, still gazing at the young lord. No matter how dense Luisen was, the young lord couldn\u2019t help but notice the persistent gaze.Luisen rolled his eyes awkwardly. Because of his looks and status, he was admired by both men and women. In his experience, those who looked at him with ardent desire were hiding a black heart within that passionate gaze.\u2018No way! Him? For someone like me\u2026? There\u2019s no chance\u2026\u2019Luisen hesitated before mustering up his courage to ask, \u201cWhy\u2026are you looking at me like that\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026I chose your clothes by roughly estimating your size with my eyes, but they fit well. I was worried they\u2019d be too large.\u201d\u201cAh! Of course. The clothes.\u201dThat was that. His companion wasn\u2019t an ordinary person\u2013he was Carlton. Not long ago, he had been beset by the man\u2019s aggression and war tactics. \u2018I\u2019ve never heard of Carlton being interested in another man.\u2019 Luisen quickly threw away his momentary suspicion.\u2018How could a man like Carlton be interested in someone like me, just because I had cleaned up and recovered my looks? I was overconfident.\u2019 Feeling embarrassed, Luisen quickly donned his tunic. How could he have had such an insane misunderstanding about such a decent person?The young lord suddenly noticed Carlton was holding something. \u201cWhat is in your hand?\u201d\u201c\u2026Scissors. I borrowed them from the innkeeper. I thought it would be good to trim your hair.\u201dThat didn\u2019t matter too much since Luisen was going to cover himself with the hood. However, Luisen felt like he needed to accept the mercenary\u2019s sincerity\u2013after all, the man already had the scissors in hand. He nodded. He pulled the table\u2019s chair closer and sat down.Carlton stood behind Luisen. Preparations for the trim\u2013wrapping cloth around Luisen\u2019s neck and taking the scissors out of its sheath\u2013followed. Night had fallen, so they lit a candle. Because of the dim light, Carlton stepped closer to the young lord.\u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and cut it.\u201d Carlton swept back Luisen\u2019s hair with his large hands and began to cut\u2013bit by bit\u2013from the bottom. It was quite repetitive, grabbing a section of the hair and snipping. Carlton was so focused, silently touching the young lord\u2019s hair.Since others have always cut his hair, Luisen was used to this sort of situation. He felt nervous for some reason, though. Was it because of Carlton? Was it because Carlton was standing behind him with scissors?It was a bit hard to pinpoint where Carlton\u2019s hands were touching. The hand holding his hair was light and unnecessarily stroked at his golden strands. Everytime Carlton did so, the young lord\u2019s scalp tickled; Luisen could help but wriggle his hands and feet.Luisen\u2019s gaze wandered here and there before finally looking at the window. Carlton, as seen through the reflection in the glass, directed his serious, grave expression to the young lord.Luisen\u2019s ears flushed red. Carlton, in one fell swoop, brushed Luisen\u2019s side hairs. As the mercenary did so, his fingertips idolently brushed past Luisen\u2019s earlobe.\u201cNngh!\u201d Startled, the young lord looked behind him. He met Carlton\u2019s indifferent gaze. It didn\u2019t seem like Carlton was acting in his own self-interest\u2013perhaps he had been too sensitive, yet again. Luisen smiled awkwardly and turned around. Once more, Carlton resumed his strokes.\u2018He should just roughly cut the hair. Nobody is going see me anyway\u2026\u2019Luisen felt that it was weird to use so much effort for something trivial.He still vividly remembered the time he had crawled between Carlton\u2019s legs. The tingling atmosphere that made the young lord\u2019s hair stand on end; the mercenary\u2019s hot gaze looking down at him. Those memories made it harder for the young lord to sit still. Luisen swallowed dry saliva and moistened his lips with his tongue.He tried to look blank and thoughtless in his efforts to not seem weird.Snip Snip.The sounds of scissors cutting filled the room. In between each snip, Luisen could hear Carlton\u2019s breaths. Outside the window, people laughed and chattered, but none of that entered Luisen\u2019s ears.The rest of the world sounded so distant\u2013like echoes from a different realm. In this room, the sounds of the mercenary\u2013the mercenary\u2019s breaths and the sounds of scissors\u2014was everything.\u2018Let\u2019s not misunderstand anything. This is Carlton. Carlton.\u2019Luisen wished he could be broad-minded and confident, but once he started to be conspicuous of the other\u2019s touch, his attention couldn\u2019t help but focus on these instances. Warmth spread from his ear, and now his face felt like it was burning up. Luisen kept his mouth shut from embarrassment and bashfulness.It was obvious to Carlton that the young lord\u2019s neck was becoming more and more tense and that his ears were turning red. Of course he noticed these changes\u2013the man had all his focus directed onto the young lord.Snip.As the long, protruding strands were cut, the back of Luisen\u2019s pale neck became visible. The white nape was pitifully thin and long. While the mercenary felt regretful at the site of the pronounced neck bone, the desire to place his mouth there also grew.Lowering his gaze down the lord\u2019s neck, Carlton could see delicate body lines exposed through the loose tunic. Luisen\u2019s naked body\u2013which he had seen earlier when he had come into the room\u2013came to mind.Luisen wasn\u2019t as muscular as Carlton. However, he still had the urge to lightly touch the pale skin that had reddened after the bath\u2013just like the desire to poke a ripe peach.He wanted to place his fingers in Luisen\u2019s soft hair and just run his hands through it. He wanted to tickle those blushing ears. For some reason, he wanted to see the young lord\u2019s waistline, covered by the loose tunic, one more time.\u2018\u2026Am I sexually frustrated?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018\u2026Am I sexually frustrated?\u2019He\u2019d never felt that way before.Carlton felt incredibly embarrassed. Up until now, the mercenary felt that he had been rather inattentive towards matters of sex. He felt that there were many other enjoyable activities; it was far more thrilling to be recognized and succeed in his career endeavors. For someone whose life was kindled by ambition day and night, all other things seemed too boring.The other mercenaries around him viewed him as somewhat strange, but Carlton felt that it was even stranger to roll around naked with an unfamiliar person. He was especially leery of hugging and falling asleep with a stranger without having a weapon nearby.Even during his teenage years\u2013a time in which many were consumed by lewd thoughts\u2013Carlton would travel here and there to various battlefields. The mercenary was still generally sour about such sexual deeds. But, why was he suddenly acting like an lustful boy who had just opened his eyes to the possibilities of sex\u2013especially since he\u2019d never had these thoughts before?Had he just been too comfortable? Was life too easy?His head felt complicated, but the texture of the hair slipping through his fingers was so soft. Short hair felt so different to the touch than long hair. All other thoughts disappeared, and Carlton focused on his fingertips.\u2018How can human hair be softer than fox fur?\u2019Carlton deliberately moved his hands slowly, pretending to grab at the hair and even stroking it. Whenever that happened, Luisen\u2019s neck flushed redder and redder.\u201c\u2026You can just be brief and haphazard.\u201d Unable to endure, Luisen spoke up. He conveyed his discomfort. Only then did Carlton realize how excessive he was being.He\u2026 must have really seemed weird. He quickly rolled his head and tried distract Luisen. \u201cI checked with the people below; apparently four of my men were caught at Confosse. They were immediately transported to the Duchy.\u201d\u201dWhat about the others? Your army?\u201d Luisen quickly focused on the topic and adopted a serious expression.\u201cI heard rumors that they went northward. No witnesses, though. Simply rumors,\u201d Carlton continued. He did not make up these details; he had heard them in passing from the innkeeper and meant to inform the young lord. However, he didn\u2019t intend to use this topic to spare himself from the discomfort. Carlton hastened his scissors.\u201cDid they say how the captured people were being treated?\u201d\u201cThey said the men looked alright when they were being carried away.\u201d\u201dWell, then it\u2019ll be fine. My estate doesn\u2019t condone torture\u2026 They\u2019ll be able to reunite with you safely. If they were to suffer an injury, I\u2019ll take care of their future.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine on their own. I didn\u2019t train my men to be so weak.\u201d Once Carlton resolved to finish, the haircut was completed in no time. \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201dCarlton took away the cloth around Luisen\u2019s neck and tussled the lord\u2019s hair. Luisen turned around, fidgeting with his nape and feeling awkward. Though Carlton had seen others cut human hair, it was his first time trying his hand at it; he wasn\u2019t particularly good. Nevertheless, short hair suited Luisen.Now that his hair was shorter, his narrow jawline was refreshingly revealed\u2013it gave the young lord a cheerful and sophisticated aura. His delicate features stood out even more. On the other hand, the roundness of his head made him look quite cute as well.Carlton thought back when Luisen had long hair that the lord looked best with that hairstyle. However, short hair looked good on him as well. \u2018His face is so beautiful\u2013no matter what he does, he\u2019s beautiful.\u2019Carlton was mesmerized by the lord\u2019s beauty. At that moment, he wanted to cup Luisen\u2019s cheeks with both hands. He almost committed a crime, gazing into the young lord\u2019s eyes and emboldened by this strange atmosphere\u2013he would have moved to touch him if Luisen hadn\u2019t spoken up in a faintly high-pitched voice.\u201cWhere\u2019d you place the map? I\u2019d like to check our upcoming path.\u201dThanks to Luisen\u2019s timely question, Carlton managed to regain his sanity. This wasn\u2019t the time for such things. \u201cOver there.\u201d Carlton casually turned around to find the map. When he unfurled the map on the table, the strange atmosphere settled back into something more realistic.Luisen breathed a sigh of relief. The atmosphere was incredibly fluttery and hard to manage. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\u201cHere.\u201d Carlton pointed to a spot on the map. Confosse was to the east of the duchy, in the adjoining territory. The Anies Dukedom was located in the center of the southern region. Thus, it took them quite a while to escape the south; it would be a longer journey to the capital from Confosse. After a long time of walking down roads, crossing rivers, and passing through a few cities, they would reach the capital.\u201cWe\u2019ve only come this far? I thought we walked quite far.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because we went around the mountain to avoid the main footpath.\u201d Cartlon drew a gentle curve with his fingertips. He began at the site of Ruger\u2019s attack and sloped into the mountainside, all the way to Confosse. Their path wasn\u2019t even detailed on the map.\u201cWe still have a long way ahead of us.\u201d Luisen sighed deeply.\u201cIt took longer because we were in the mountains, but we\u2019ll be travelling along proper roads now. We\u2019ll follow the main road north,\u201d Cartlon explained as he pointed at the map. As Carlton said, following the main path would lead them to a river that separated the eastern and southern regions of the kingdom. \u201cHere, at a city called Mittil, I think it\u2019d be best to a boat from the dock. If we travel by boat along the river, we can go even further.\u201d\u201cThat is the fastest route. I\u2019ve been to Mittil before.\u201d Luisen was also familiar with this city. Mittil was the most prosperous city with the most marine traffic along the river\u2013after all, the shortest path to the capital was to cross the river at Mittil. Both the aristocracy and wealthy used Mittil\u2019s marina\u2013its splendour couldn\u2019t even be compared to the likes of Confosse.\u201c\u2026But, isn\u2019t there a church in Mittil?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cThere is one. As far as I know, it\u2019s quite a large church with several priests.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll probably think we\u2019re strange if, as a pilgrim, I don\u2019t stop by the church.\u201d\u201cYes. So, even if we take a more roundabout path, we could use a dock that\u2019s out of the town\u2019s boundaries\u2026 I believe it\u2019d be better than to mingle with many people.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d\u201cDepending on how natural my duke can act, we can adapt our path forward to suit our needs.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Luisen had travelled with a pilgrim for a year. Moreover, after passing as a noble despite his lack of wits and a sensible mind, he was at least confident in his ability to pretend and act. \u201cHow long will it take to get to Mittil from here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll take around four to five days.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s along the main pedestrian footpath?\u201d\u201cWe only have one donkey after all. If we come across a merchant following a similar route, we might be able to rent a space in their carriage.\u201d\u201cWhat about a public carriage?\u201dFor well-traveled roads, public carriages often operated in certain sections. As long as they could pay, anyone could hitch a ride.\u201cI had heard that there was originally a carriage from Confosse to the postal village, but it\u2019s not open now.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cRecently, public security has been unstable, and monsters have become more active. Apparently, that\u2019s resulted in quite a few traffic jams. According to rumors, several villages have become isolated.\u201d\u201cIs this the consequences of the civil war? The country has become much more disorganized as we\u2019ve travelled north.\u201d\u201cIf only it was just that\u2026\u201dAs the southern military forces were occupied with other matters, there was some neglect in hunting monsters. It would be natural for monsters to increase in population and expand their range of activity. However, now that the two knew about Ruger\u2019s involvement with the monsters and the recent attacks on the villages, all of this was cause for worry.Carlton pointed out the way forward. If they went upriver from Mittil, they\u2019d arrive in the middle of the kingdom. From there, they\u2019d head east, stopping briefly just before entering the capital to observe the current situation and to judge that it was safe to enter to capital. It was probably the easiest and safest route they had.\u201cIf we had a horse\u2026\u201d Carton thought of his beloved horse regretfully.\u201cI\u2019m sure your horse is doing well because it\u2019s so smart. It must have descended the mountain and found some farmhouse.\u201d\u201cThat would be nice\u2026\u201d Carlton\u2019s face was filled with worry.Luisen, who knew that Carlton had a special bond with his horse without needing to hear more, tried to console him. \u201cLater, I\u2019ll send out some men to try and find your horse.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying that.\u201d Carlton shook off his gloom and returned to the map. \u201cOnce we cross the river, we\u2019ll reach the kingdom\u2019s middle region. The civil war was fought the most intensely in this area\u2026 We\u2019ll need to be prepared.\u201d\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Luisen knew well how the country fell into bedlam after the civil war.Carlton looked doubtful at the young lord\u2019s knowing attitude. \u201c\u2026Are you sure you\u2019ll be fine?\u201d\u201cOf course. I can withstand anything.\u201d Luisen was confident. A bed and a roof were luxuries; he had spent more than one or two days sleeping on the streets. The young lord could almost guarantee he was more experienced in being homeless than the mercenary.Luisen observed the map again. Along the path there were many places that lingered as bad memories in Luisen\u2019s head. Painful and distressing memories were attached to many places scattered all over the kingdom. However, he wasn\u2019t afraid.He wasn\u2019t alone anymore\u2013he had Carlton. Thanks to the mercenary, he\u2019d been fine so far; he had a vaguely reassuraing expectation that the benefits from this alliance would continue far into the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sun had just begun its dim rise; both lord and mercenary prepared to leave, half-awake.Luisen wore a robe over the clothes he had worn yesterday. The robe had full cover\u2013it was as if sleeves were attached to a giant sack with a hole for the head. The young lord drew the robe\u2019s hood over his head and wore another hood he had taken from the village for good measure. The hood\u2019s hem came down to his nose and completely covered the young lord\u2019s features. After tying the baggy midsection with a thick rope\u2013rather than a belt\u2013Luisen\u2019s physical stature was disguised.If he could shrug his shoulders and hunch his back, Luisen would be able to disguise even his height; he could seem like a completely different person. Next, the young lord attached a wooden cross, his holy relic, to the rope. From a surface glance, he undeniably looked like a pilgrim.Carlton and Luisen followed the road straight and headed towards the far gate. Even at dawn, the streets of Confosse were crowded with departing people. Since those gathered were used to traveling long distances, the crowd was even more lively and noisy than in the daytime.At first, Luisen was nervous. However, it seemed like no passersby were concerned with them, so his heart quickly relaxed. There were even people who greeted Luisen with clasped hands when they saw the pilgrim\u2019s pass hanging around his neck. Each time, Luisen politely and demurely bowed his head, copying the one-armed pilgrim.\u2018I wonder if I resemble the saint a little?\u2019 Luisen was excited to think that he may look similar to the man he admired. Joy automatically rose within him as he tried to remember the one-armed saint and copy his walking style. When he tried to reproduce that unsteady gait with his stiff body, his joints creaked like pieces of wood. It was strange\u2013he looked like a startled cat.Carlton, who couldn\u2019t endure that sight anymore, patted Luisen on the back. \u201cPlease walk properly.\u201d\u201c\u2026I wanted to walk like a pilgrim.\u201d\u201cYou look constipated.\u201d\u201cConstipated\u2026?\u201dIt seemed that he couldn\u2019t emulate the saint\u2019s coolness. Luisen released the tension from his body and returned to his usual light steps.Despite his criticism, Carlton wasn\u2019t worried about Luisen\u2019s ability to pose as a pilgrim. After all, pilgrims came from a variety of backgrounds, so Luisen\u2019s carefree attitude\u2013as if he were a bird swishing its tail feathers as he walked\u2013wasn\u2019t out of place.\u201cIt\u2019s alright to be a little aristocratic in your body language. Instead, please watch what you say. There are no pilgrims that speak condescendingly.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHave you ever used honorifics before?\u201dOf course. Many times. The first thing Luisen did to survive as a nomad was to break his conversational habits. \u201cI have more experience than Sir Mercenary expects. Please, don\u2019t worry. Rather, you should be careful in how you address me.\u201dLuisen spoke gently and formally; Carlton was satisfied\u2013it wasn\u2019t easy to give off an air of modest courtesy. \u201cThough it\u2019s good to call me Sir Mercenary, you may also address me as \u2018Carl,\u2019 my new identity. I shall call you Revered Pilgrim from now on.\u201d\u00a01\u201cYes, be my guest.\u201dThe two passed through the gate as they easily conversed. Because Carlton\u2019s men were captured in Confosse, those who left the castle were examined as thoroughly as those entering. The two had little baggage; they passed easily with the help of the pilgrim\u2019s pass.After leaving the gate, the two headed near the secret entrance to see if the donkey they had left there was still around. However, unexpectedly, there were people there\u2013two men clad in ordinary tunics\u2013relatively young security guards. The men were waging tug-of-war over a black horse.The men were jointly pulling at the horse\u2019s reins, but the horse would not budge. Instead, when the horse stepped back, the two men were dragged along.Carlton and Luisen stopped without getting any closer.\u201cThey look like security guards right? What are they doing here? And my donkey is over there!\u201d Luisen wanted to just turn around, but right behind the black horse was Luisen\u2019s donkey. The doneky, paying no heed to the bedlam happening before it, munched on grass. What a carefree fellow.\u201cWhat should we do about it?\u201d Luisen turned towards the mercenary.Carlton, though, was staring at the black horse and not the donkey. \u201cZephys\u2026\u201dZephys? That was a familiar name.Luisen immediately remembered that Carlton\u2019s beloved horse was named Zephys. \u201cYour horse? That black horse is yours?\u201dCarlton nodded. Startled, Luisen looked back at the black horse. On closer inspection, its fur looked rough and thin, but its head-to-tail black luster and handsome face seemed familiar. Its body was balanced well; its legs were taut and long. It was a rare, excellent military horse with muscles to match. After close observation, it looked exactly like Carlton\u2019s horse. \u201cWhy is your horse here, though? We parted ways in the mountains. Couldn\u2019t it be a similar-looking horse?\u201dLuisen asked just to cover his bases, but the black horse\u2019s reaction was answer enough. Zephys noticed its master\u2019s voice with its keen senses and turned to look at them.Whinny!In an instant, Zephys bit the guard\u2019s arm and pushed him away with its body. After knocking over the two adult men, it ran to Carlton.Neigh, neiiighhh.Zephys\u2019 eyes were moist as it rubbed its face into the mercenary\u2019s shoulders and licked the mercenary\u2019s face. It was the first time Luisen had ever seen a horse cry so sorrowfully. Carlton stroked the fur on Zephys\u2019 head; his expression looked simultaneously regretful and welcoming. The young lord was moved by that ardent reunion.But this was no time to relax and be sentimental. The two men that had been holding Zephys\u2019 reins approached with spears pointed.\u201cYou there! Who are you people?\u201d the guards loudly shouted.How could they threaten people out of the blue? Luisen was incredibly bewildered. Why are they acting like that? Carlton stepped in front of the young lord and placed his hand on his sword\u2019s hilt.\u201cWe\u2019re part of Confosse\u2019s security forces. This man over here is the Guard Captain. Don\u2019t even think of rebelling and surrender!\u201dAs Luisen had expected, both men were guards. However, it was a little surprising to hear that the guard captain would be in plain clothes. If he\u2019s a guard captain, he\u2019d be decently high-ranking. Why would he be in this location? Clad in peasant clothing?\u201cGive up your weapons and surrender now!\u201d\u201cFor what reason are you threatening us with weapons?\u201d Luisen asked. However, the guards did not answer and, instead, placed their spears closer to the young lord and mercenary. The guard captain continued to observe and stood by.Luisen\u2019s heart pounded. The young lord tried to calm down and held up his pilgrim\u2019s pass. \u201cI\u2019m a wanderer following the will of God.\u201dIn the light of the rising sun, the bright silver of the pass scattered the rays of light. The captain and the guard were surprised and lowered their spears. \u201cAh\u2026 So you\u2019re a revered pilgrim.\u201d\u201cThen, that person is\u2026\u201d\u201cThis man is a mercenary I hired as an escort,\u201d Luisen answered.\u201cIs this how Confosse treats pilgrims? Do you all have grudges against the Church?\u201d Carlton didn\u2019t miss the time to interject and threaten with the Church\u2019s name.As he said that, the startled guards began to desperately explain, \u201cWe have not forsaken the Church! Absolutely not! We did not intend to behave this way. It\u2019s just that\u2026this horse\u2019s owner was a criminal\u2026\u201d\u201cA criminal?\u201d\u201cThis horse belongs to the men led by the bastard that kidnapped the Duke of Anies.\u201dSo, Carlton\u2019s men must have brought Zephys here! Finally, the question regarding Zephys\u2019 presence was answered. It was fortunate that it joined and followed Carlton\u2019s men.After the horse had separated from Carlton, Luisen was worried that it would run into the direwolves or be left stranded in the mountains, struggling and wandering around. What a relief.If all went according to plan, Luisen and Carlton would have been able to reunite with both Zephys and Carlton\u2019s men as they continued their journey. However, since the mercenary was blamed for kidnapping Luisen, Carlton\u2019s men had been captured and taken away.Usually, the criminals\u2019 personal belongings were disposed according to the will of the guards who caught them; therefore, Zephys was in the guard\u2019s possession.\u201cYou seemed familiar with the criminal\u2019s horse, so\u2026 We had no choice but to approach with weapons because we thought you were working with the kidnappers. Please understand us, revered pilgrim.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026that mercenary. Are you certain you know who he is? I\u2019m not doubting you, revered pilgrim, but Carlton and his men are mercenaries as well. By any chance\u2026\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not! This horse was actually happy to see me!\u201d Luisen quickly tugged at Zephys\u2019 reins. One didn\u2019t need to shout that Carlton was Zephys\u2019 owner; the horse\u2019s friendliness was suspicious enough\u2013the young lord wouldn\u2019t have his companion taken away to be locked with his men.The guards were reasonable to doubt them\u2013after all, they were speaking the truth\u2013so Luisen desperately crafted some excuses. \u201cI raised this horse in the monastary ever since it was a foal. I took care of it. That\u2019s why it recognized me and rushed towards me. It came to me, not him. Me\u2013the pilgrim.\u201dAs soon as Luisen spouted his lies, Carlton stepped away from Zephys and pretended to be nonchalant. Zephys didn\u2019t particularly understand the full situation, but it was a clever horse. It read its owner\u2019s expression and calmly nuzzled Luisen.\u201cI see. I understand your circumstances, but that\u2019s a criminal\u2019s horse. It\u2019s under security jurisdiction now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d When Luisen hesitated, Carlton caught the young lord\u2019s arm.\u2018Why of all people\u2026guards\u2026\u2019It would have been far easier if a merchant or another mercenary had Zephys. The opponents currently before them could not be swayed through intimidation or force. If they touched the guards, the owner of Confosse\u2013and, beyond that, the lord of this territory\u2013would not stand still.\u201cSend it back,\u201d Carlton whispered. Luisen was forced to release the reins.FootnotesLet\u2019s talk names and identities. First things first, Carl, while shorthand for Carlton, is also a homonym for 'sword.\u201d Nice word play~ Second, \uc21c\ub840\uc790\ub2d8 is \uc21c\ub840\uc790 (pilgrim) + \ub2d8 (a suffix to show respect.

Come quickly!\u201dZephys did not budge one inch no matter how hard they pulled. The men seemed incredibly impatient; in between their struggles, they observed Luisen and Carlton out of the corners of their eyes. It seemed like they wanted to leave this place as soon as possible\u2013like they had some ulterior motives.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you moving!?\u201d One guard poked the horse in the buttocks with the point of his spear.Neigh\u2013Zephys cried. It had no choice but to falter one step forward.Zephys was incredibly clever; it didn\u2019t cling to Carlton for help. Perhaps it realized that would only bring the mercenary trouble. It only looked at the mercenary pitifully with its round, black eyes. That sight was more effective at tugging at the heart strings.\u2018Damn it. Fuck.\u2019 Carlton kept cursing inwardly.For the mercenary, Zephys was a special horse. He had taken care of Zephys ever since it was a frail, sick colt; their bond was extraordinarily firm. The horse was a true companion that came along with him when he ran away from home.Even though Zephys was his horse\u2013even though it was being dragged along by the guards\u2013he could do nothing. In his heart, he wanted to steal Zephys and ride him far far away. However, Carlton was accompanying someone else.Carlton had promised to take Luisen to the capital safely. Therefore, though he was frustrated enough to vomit blood, he had to endure. Right now, he could only clench his innocent fists.While Carlton dithered, Luisen rushed out. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d At Luisen\u2019s shout, the guards turned around.\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d Carlton asked.\u2018I don\u2019t know either!\u2019 Though the young lord managed to halt the situation for now, Luisen didn\u2019t have a brilliant idea. Still, he hated to send Zephys away like this. If they parted now, there was no guarantee they\u2019d meet up again!Luisen wracked his brain for dear life. \u2018Dear Saint, please share your wisdom with me.\u2019 They say that if one prays hard, things will work out. A lightning strike of an idea struck Luisen just then. \u201cWhy are you hurrying?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSir Guard Captain. What were you planning to do while sneaking off with a criminal\u2019s horse?\u201dThe guards became furious at Luisen\u2019s statement. \u201cWhat do you mean sneak away? Captain can dispose of a criminal\u2019s belongings as he pleases\u2013that\u2019s not sneaking away.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so strange about this business. Why would someone of the captain\u2019s status leave his post at the gates and crawl through this secret passage to handle a criminal\u2019s horse? If you rode that horse proudly through the gate, no one would say anything to the contrary.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d the guard captain mumbled. At that reaction, Luisen realized he\u2019d hit the nail on the head. These men were scurrying about and plotting in secret before being caught red-handed by Luisen and Carlton.\u201cThat\u2019s guard business. It has nothing to do with Revered Pilgrim,\u201d the guard captain calmly retorted, as if to prove that nothing unsavory was happening. However, nothing escaped Carlton\u2019s keen senses.\u201cThat person is incredibly anxious. He\u2019s in a hurry; in a way, it seems like he\u2019s pierced with fear,\u201d the mercenary whispered so that only Luisen\u2019s ears could hear.Even so, the young lord wasn\u2019t certain he could retake Zephys with this line of interrogation. However, through persuasion or intimidation, he should pull at everything that could be pulled.\u00a01\u00a0Luisen questioned them a little harder, \u201cThe Lord in charge of this region must be incredibly concerned since Carlton\u2019s men were captured in Confosse; does the Lord know of your \u2018business?'\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to insinuate?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d just like to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\u201cWhat will you do with that information?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cWhy would the Revered Pilgrim do that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because, as you said, I\u2019m a pilgrim. I shine light in dark and shadowy places where our God in heaven can\u2019t peer into nor drive away. This is the very reason why we wander the world, spreading his glory and mercy.\u201d Luisen recalled the one-armed pilgrim as he carefully uttered every word.Next to him, Carlton was incredibly surprised. The young lord seemed like a true pilgrim. His speech patterns and expressions, his tone and missionary sense as well, all worked together to create the sense that the young lord was absorbed in religious piety. However, his demeanor wasn\u2019t burdensome at all; it felt like Luisen would accept anything he was told and would show mercy. The guard and captain lowered their vigilance.\u201cI don\u2019t know the full details. I can only guess that if the captain of the guard, someone always praised for his good character, does something in secret\u2026he must have desperate and justified motives.\u201d Actually, it didn\u2019t matter what kind of person the captain was, nor the status of his reputation. Luisen had no idea what the guard captain was like. However, he saw how the one-armed pilgrim opened stubborn mouths through moderate praises and gentle uplifting\u2013saying \u2018you\u2019re not usually this type of person.\u2019\u201cIf we hadn\u2019t met, I\u2019d be ignorant of your situation; now that we\u2019ve come across one another, couldn\u2019t this meeting be arranged by His Holiness? Maybe I or the Church could be of help. Did something happen?\u201d Luisen continued in a subdued tone. Referring to God worked wonderfully for those in predicaments. Luisen\u2019s exploitation tactics struck true; the captain\u2019s heart was shaken.Even without those words, the guard captain seemed so anguished and frustrated\u2013like he desperately wanted to confess everything in his heart to someone. Then, when Luisen hit the nail on the head, the captain thought it would be better to explain his situation rather than to plead with the young lord to pretend ignorance. \u201cThe truth is\u2026 As the revered pilgrim says, I\u2019ve exited the castle secretly. I truly don\u2019t intend to do anything malicious. It\u2019s just\u2026 I wanted to go to my hometown.\u201d\u201cYour hometown? At this time?\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t be ideal for Confosse to have its captain of the guard missing during its current crisis. Since the kidnapper\u2019s troop was caught within Confosse, they were confined to the castle grounds. The castle\u2019s security was as strict as it had ever been.\u201cAbout a month ago, my wife went back to my hometown to give birth\u2013we\u2019re from the same town, you know. But, no matter how long I\u2019ve waited, I haven\u2019t heard any news from my wife!\u201dHis wife, who had promised to send word once she made it to her destination, did not contact him. At the same time, the kingdom had already experienced civil war, a duke had been kidnapped, and so on. There had been rumors of unprecedented monster attacks as well. The Guard Captain was so worried that he sent several people to check on the situation. However, none of the people he sent had returned; he was left in the dark. \u201cI\u2019ve been so fretful; I just could sit around. Just when I thought I had no path forward\u2026that horse caught my eye. With that kind of warhorse, I could go there and return within a day.\u201dSince it was a criminal\u2019s horse, no one would care if it disappeared for a moment. Moreover, Zephys was a strong and agile horse, so the captain thought he\u2019d be able to travel to his hometown faster. He had his men secretly bring him the horse, and he sneaked out of the castle through that secret hole.\u201cCouldn\u2019t you ask a favor from the mercenary guild?\u201d\u201cWhen they\u2019re being inundated with so many commissions, why would anyone take my request when it rewards no money nor glory to further their career? There\u2019s nothing I could do. Imagine how frustrated I was for me to have come out on my own.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cMy lord will punish me greatly if he finds that I\u2019ve abandoned my post. Nor will I be able to go to my hometown. Please, have mercy on my family and me and pretend you never saw anything, revered pilgrim,\u201d the guard captain appealed sincerely.Luisen and Carlton exchanged brief glances.This was it. If they did well, they may be able to obtain Zephys.Luisen hid his excitement and patted the captain on the shoulder. \u201cYou must have suffered. How could I tell on you when you\u2019re in this situation?\u201d\u201cHowever, Guard Captain. Isn\u2019t your plan too sloppy? No matter how fast you are, who wouldn\u2019t notice when you\u2019re away for an entire day.\u201d While Luisen comforted the man, Carlton was critical. The captain of the guards went from heaven to hell in one short moment.\u201cMmm\u2026. He does have a point. I understand your situation, but this was an incredibly reckless plan.\u201d Luisen pretended to agonize over the matter for a few seconds before continuing, acting as if he had just thought of a good idea. \u201cWell then, what about this? Sir Guard Captain should hurry back to his post\u2013didn\u2019t you say you\u2019ll be severely punished if you got caught sneaking away? Instead, I shall visit your hometown.\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d\u201cYes. Why don\u2019t I go and make sure your wife is safe and deliver any messages you may want to send?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly trouble you like this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m a wanderer, and the guard captain must maintain his position like a rock. It was heaven\u2019s will that we\u2019d meet like this. Be at ease and leave it to me.\u201d\u201cRevered Pilgrim\u2026If you could do that, I\u2019d be so\u2026\u201dIn the middle of this emotional conversation, the quick-witted Carlton intervened and halted the heartfelt emotions. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to go, revered pilgrim. That\u2019s outside our contract; I won\u2019t work more than I\u2019m paid. If you go, you\u2019ll go alone.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026Then I\u2019ll make it through the forest paths alone, somehow.\u201d Luisen pretended to be at a loss. Although the hood covered his expression, he conveyed that feeling of embarrassment with his whole body. The guard captain also became nervous because the matter which had been solved smoothly suddenly ran into difficulties.\u2018No way, you\u2019re not going to stop helping because that mercenary can\u2019t follow you, right?\u2019 The guard captain stared insistently at Luisen.The young lord looked alternatingly between Carlton and the captain, giving plenty of pause and lingering gazes. Then, when it seemed like the captain would stop breathing from anxiety, Luisen spoke in a moderate tone, \u201c\u2026He\u2019s not wrong. Mercenaries follow money\u2026 I could not force him to do work. However, I\u2019m not in a situation where I can spare much gold\u2026\u201d Luisen looked meaningfully at Carlton while slurring the latter sentences.\u201cForget money, give me that horse. I\u2019ve been wanting one like that for a while.\u201d Carlton pointed at Zephys.FootnotesThe original is more like \u201cbite at everything that could be stretched out.\u201d I localized it a littlePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026\u201d The captain hesitated.\u201cThe mercenary escorting me is an incredibly capable man; he\u2019ll be able to solve any roadblocks caused by monsters. And, if something truly happened to the village, it\u2019ll be best for someone like me, a pilgrim, to go and recruit help.\u201dThe guard\u2019s face brightened when Luisen hinted that he could seek help from the Church. Of course, the young lord had no intention of doing anything so bold and dangerous as that.\u201cThere\u2019s really nothing more I could ask for\u2026\u201d Since it was the captain\u2019s discretion as to what should be done with a criminal\u2019s possession, there was nothing wrong if he sold or gave the horse away. However, Zephys was an outstanding horse; it would fetch a lot of money\u2013that he\u2019d regretfully lose out on\u2013with mercenaries or merchants.However, even if the man disposed of the horse and placed a request at the mercenary\u2019s guild, there was no guarantee that they had someone free to take the request. Furthermore, it seemed more reliable to rely on this seemingly good-natured pilgrim instead of a violent and unfaithful mercenary. Besides, the mercenary at the pilgrim\u2019s side looked very strong as well. As the pilgrim said, he could borrow the Church\u2019s power if enough justification was provided.After weighing his choices, the guard captain finally made his decision. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll hand you this horse. In return, I\u2019ll place my business in your hands.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t worry.\u201d Luisen took the reins from the captain.Carlton leaned over to whisper in Luisen\u2019s ear while the captain rushed to write a letter to his family. \u201cIs this really okay? We\u2019re in such a hurry that a day would be hard to spare\u2026 Are we able to go off and run someone else\u2019s errand\u2026?\u201dThough the mercenary had played along with Luisen\u2019s performance, he was worried. They had a long way to go and were incredibly busy; could they really afford distractions like this? He was greedy for Zephys, but now he felt belatedly guilty that they would be waylaid by unnecessary matters.\u201cAt least we now have a horse. Won\u2019t we be able to reach the capital faster with this guy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, even if we waste a day, we shall end up at the capital sooner. It\u2019ll be fine. Besides\u2026 isn\u2019t this horse special to you?\u201d Luisen wanted to repay Carlton\u2019s sacrifice by getting Zephys back. Didn\u2019t they lose Zephys in the first place because of the young lord?\u201cReally\u2026Thank you so much.\u201d\u2018So, Carlton knows how to say thank you normally.\u2019 Startled, Luisen stared at Carlton. The mercenary\u2019s eyes were as sweet as young spring fields. When they had first met, the man\u2019s eyes were filled with contempt and disgust, but now the young lord couldn\u2019t find any signs of those emotions in his pupils. Instead, he found affection and gratitude aplenty, outright and unhidden.\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re thankful\u2026\u201d Luisen said. \u201cYou\u2019ve done so much for me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve stepped forward on my behalf. No one has ever cared for me that way before.\u201dCarlton\u2019s words tickled Luisen\u2019s heart. The young lord shrugged, at a loss for words.Carlton was already moved; when Luisen acted so cute, it tugged at his heart. He had the urge to grab the young lord\u2019s shoulders\u2013to grab that embarrassed, swaying golden head\u2013and drag him into the mercenary\u2019s embrace. For some reason, Carlton felt unfounded confidence that the young lord wouldn\u2019t reject him now..However, the delicate vibe that surrounded Luisen and Carlton vanished due to the guard captain\u2019s intervening words. \u201cHere\u2019s my letter. Please deliver this well and return to me with news of the situation. I\u2019ll entrust this to you, Revered Pilgrim. Now that you\u2019ve listened to my troubles\u2026I really have no one else to rely on.\u201dIn other words, he\u2019s beseeching them to keep their words and not abandon him after winning their quarry. Luisen smiled benevolently, as if he was ignorant to the underlying implications. \u201cOf course. As a follower of God\u2019s path, how could I abandon someone in trouble?\u201dThough his expression was hidden by the hood, Luisen\u2019s words alone seemed trustworthy.After stowing the captain\u2019s letter safely away, Luisen left the donkey in the captain\u2019s care.Honestly, Luisen wanted to take it along since he had gotten attached to it during their time together, but he was forced to leave it in Confosse. The donkey would probably be unable to keep up with Zephys\u2019 speed\u2013and they had not yet decided whether or not they\u2019d return to Confosse at all. Since they had decided to put off that decision until they\u2019d gauged the situation in the guard\u2019s hometown, this may be the last time the young lord would see the donkey.Luisen looked at the donkey with eyes full of regret. Perhaps the young lord\u2019s feelings weren\u2019t properly conveyed, for the donkey had its usual easy-going expression.\u201cPlease take good care of my donkey.\u201d\u201cYes! Of course.\u201dLuisen approached Zephys. He was able to solo-ride the donkey due to Carlton\u2019s special training, but it would be a new experience to ride something so big like Zephys. Unlike the small and easy-going donkey, Zephys\u2019 nose was incredibly high up\u2013like its owner. Back when he had the chance to tag along on Zephys\u2019 back, a while back, it was clear the horse hated ferrying the young lord.\u201cPlease just don\u2019t fling me off. If you drop me, the guard captain will be suspicious of us,\u201d Luisen whispered into Zephys\u2019 ear. Simultaneously, he tensed his body, ready to avoid the horse\u2019s kick.However, it was different this time. Zephys looked at the young lord and kneeled before him. It did its hardest to allow the young lord to climb onto its back easily. As Luisen sat in the saddle, the horse stood up.From this high up, even Carlton looked small.\u2018My word. It felt like just yesterday when I was carried like a pack on Zephys\u2019 back.\u2019 Luisen was deeply touched as he recalled the first time he rode on Zephys. His face had smashed into the horse\u2019s buttocks and was beaten by its tail. Now, he couldn\u2019t believe that he was proudly riding on its back!Zephys was an incredibly clever horse. Carlton, as he clambered up, pretended to look inexperienced and hummed in discomfort. At a surface glance, Zephys seemed to follow Luisen\u2019s orders and not Carlton\u2019s\u2013especially since the captain and the guard were unaware of the full situation.\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you!\u201d the captain repeated as he saw the two off.***The Guard Captain\u2019s hometown was located deep within the forest. The way there didn\u2019t overlap at all with Luisen and Carlton\u2019s original path. Therefore, visiting this village was a complete waste of a day.They really didn\u2019t have the time to help others. Honestly, the guard captain didn\u2019t know Luisen and Carlton\u2019s real identities, so there would be little trouble if they had just left. The mercenary had slyly floated that option; Luisen, though, refused because he was determined to not do anything that he couldn\u2019t be proud of when he met the saint again.No matter how urgent their matter was, it would be heartless and cowardly to take advantage of another\u2019s desperation. Instead, he urged Carlton to go as fast as they could, without breaks. Though Carlton was feeling impatient, he did not insist on leaving since he had a conscience.Understanding its owner\u2019s impatient mood, Zephys galloped tirelessly. Even though it was carrying two adult men, it moved lively, as if the two weren\u2019t heavy at all. As Zephys began to run in earnest, Luisen choked back some regretful tears. \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said we should hurry. This is just too fast.\u2019The landscaped passed quickly before the young lord\u2019s wide-open eyes; the blurry sight made him dizzy. The sound of rushing wind filled his ears. When Zephys\u2019 taut legs struck the ground, Luisen\u2019s body slightly floated upwards before falling back down on the saddle; tingles ran up his tailbone.There ws no handle on Zephys\u2019 saddle, so he could only reliably hold onto Carlton. He tightly grasped onto Carlton\u2019s arms\u2013at least he had these, what a relief. The young lord had never ridden so fast in his life.He clung the length of his torso against the mercenary\u2019s body and leaned his head against the mercenary\u2019s bust. That wasn\u2019t enough\u2013the young lord also tightly shut his eyes. As he leaned into Carlton\u2019s embrace, he could hear a pounding heartbeat from somewhere. \u2018Wow\u2013his heartbeat\u2019s racing. He\u2019s scared to death, too.\u2019How could the sound of his heart pounding be heard so clearly in his ear? It was that loud. Luisen shrank into himself even more; therefore, he couldn\u2019t see Carlton urging Zephys with an uncharacteristically awkward expression.They passed the hills and entered the woods. Their view was drastically diminished due to the shade of the foliage. Even on this narrow and rough road, untravelled by most, Zephys galloped fearlessly. Carlton remembered the guard captain\u2019s directions and went exactly in that direction. Then, at some point, Zephys began to gradually slow down.Then, Zephys suddenly stopped. Wondering if they were taking a break, Luisen finally opened his eyes. \u201cAre we resting before setting off again?\u201d\u201cPlease stay still and don\u2019t dismount.\u201d Carlton descended from the saddle and unsheathed his sword. With a rigid expression, he used his sharp intuition to look around. Zephys also paced back and forth a few steps as well. Both horse and master warily looked in the same direction.\u2018What is it?\u2019 the young lord thought.Ever since the sound of thudding hooves had stopped, silence flowed through the forest. The young lord could sense nothing\u2013it was so quiet in the forest that it seemed like Carlton, Luisen, and the horse were the only living things there.\u2018What\u2019s this? Is something there? Am I the only one who has no idea?\u2019 Luisen looked around blankly.However, at that moment, something that seemed like a black blade came flying at the young lord. Before Luisen could even realize the danger, Zephys nimbly stepped to the side and avoided it. At the same time, Carlton intervened and brandished his sword.Clank\u2013!The sound of iron meeting iron rang out. Whatever it was, it slithered away after failing in its attack. Only then did Luisen see what had attacked him.A huge centipede.TL: Noooo The donkey T_T I\u2019m so sad that they had to leave it behind.I imagine that Zephys is a draft horse. Medieval warhorses (or Destriers) aren\u2019t actually that tall, apparently. This is a draft horse:That\u2019s gigantic!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was no ordinary centipede. For starters, it was gigantic. Its body was as long and thick as the tree trunks by its side. Its firm, segmented body slickly shone like well-heated iron.\u00a01\u00a0The dozens of legs attached to its body were red and sharp, like blades.Luisen had, in the past, wandered around the kingdom and seen many things he hadn\u2019t before as noble trash, but this was the first time he\u2019d seen such a large centipede. It would hurt when one got bitten by an ordinary centipede, but, the moment this centipede were to bite you, it would most likely cleave your body in two. That thought was so terrifying and gruesome, the young lord couldn\u2019t help but shiver.\u2018Is that a bug? Or a monster?\u2019Unlike its smaller counterpart, the opponent before them had dozens of bead-like eyes on its face; it moved around here and there as it examined Carlton and Luisen. The young lord had never heard of a centipede with dozens of eyes. \u2018As expected, it\u2019s a monster, right?\u2019The centipede made scratching noises as it crawled up a tree. Its long body curled around the trunk; its numerous legs clacked as it moved up the bark. Contrary to what its size may suggest, it was incredibly fast. In a blink of an eye, the centipede made its way up to the canopy and flew through the air towards Luisen.\u201cAaaaagh!\u201d Luisen screamed. The thing must have been after the young lord after all! Perhaps it was aiming at the weakest individual in the group first. If Luisen was alone, he probably would have been caught in that attack. However, he currently had Zephys\u2013once again, the horse swiftly dodged the centipede\u2019s attack.Crash\u2013!The centipede couldn\u2019t direct the force of its flight and soon crashed to the ground. A normal animal would have suffered a broken skull, but\u2026\u2018U-Urgh\u2026 Gross\u2026 I\u2019m scared\u2026 It\u2019s so disgusting\u2026\u2019\u2026The centipede was quick to climb\u2013scraping against bark once more\u2013up the tree again. However, this time Carlton was faster. He jumped at the bug and swung his sword. In an instant, its two front legs were chopped off.Kyaaaaaaak\u2013!The centipede screeched. Dozens of its legs spread out in unison; it began twisting its torso strangely. Some thick bodily fluid began dripping from the severed locations.The centipede began wildly whipping its tail about in agony and felled the surrounding trees. Carlton shielded Luisen while waiting for a gap in its random attacks. In the meantime, Zephys carried the young lord to a safe distance so that he wouldn\u2019t be caught up in the fight.Now a few legs short, the centipede changed its target to Carlton.The mercenary and the insect exchanged a few blows. The bug moved its dozens of legs precisely and rapidly, swinging its front feet and tail almost instinctively. On top of that, it tried to reach out its head and plunge from a high height to pierce through the mercenary with its pincers.Attacks\u2013strong, powerful attacks\u2013flew at each other from all sides. With each miss, the ground was hollowed, and trees were smashed. When the centipede\u2019s front legs hit Carlton\u2019s sword, the sound of metal hitting metal rang out. A slight brush of the blade, like that, couldn\u2019t make a dent in the bug\u2019s carapace.Luisen watched over Carlton nervously. He knew his companion was strong, but the opponent was a hitherto unseen monster.But Carlton was even more of a monster. He effortlessly hit back his opponent\u2019s attacks. No matter how fast the centipede moved\u2013no matter how many attacks it shot from various angles\u2013Carlton did not allow himself to get hit by a single attack. He wasn\u2019t pushed back at all.The mercenary wasn\u2019t flustered by the centipede\u2019s hard carapace. He observed his opponent calmly and slowly cut off each of its legs. Each time its legs were severed, the centipede writhed and revealed its white belly.\u2018W-Whoa. He\u2019s not losing at all.\u2019Because the ever-loyal Zephys wasn\u2019t moving from its distant position, Luisen was able to relax and watch over the fight.The centipede changed its strategy as the situation became increasingly unfavorable. It hissed, turned around, and tried to dig into the ground to escape. However, Carlton had no intention of letting it leave now; he pierced his blade through its tail.Kyaaagh\u2013!The centipede\u2019s cry reverberated through the air, ripping through the sky. Even from far away, it sounded so terrible; Luisen was momentarily frightened. The monster\u2019s long body wildly wriggled up and down, thudding thunderously onto the ground.Disregarding all its thrashing, Carlton kicked the monster and pressed down on its head. Then, without hesitating, he thrust his sword between its eyes.Crack\u2013!It sounded like the monster\u2019s head was crushed. The remaining\u2013still plentiful\u2013legs trembled and twitched. Soon after, the centipede stopped wriggling, and its antennae drooped onto the ground.\u201cIs it finished?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cWait a moment.\u201d Carlton didn\u2019t forget to confirm that he had fully killed his opponent. He didn\u2019t allow Luisen to return until he had fully cleaved the centipede\u2019s head in half and kicked both parts away.\u201cNgh\u2026 It\u2019s even more gruesome up close. Why is such a thing here? Is this centipede a monster?\u201d\u201cIt definitely can\u2019t be some common centipede. Not with this size and strength.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Luisen looked at its torso. The centipede\u2019s body, which had flipped over to reveal its white belly, was a different type of disgusting than when it had moved around so vigorously. The sight of dozens of its limp legs made his skin itch. \u2018Ugh,\u2019 Luisen groaned. \u2018Up close, it\u2019s even more revolting.\u2019Carlton patted Luisen\u2019s shoulder.Luisen and Carlton decided to take a break while they disposed of the centipede\u2019s body.While Carlton started the fire, Luisen sat haphazardly nearby. \u201cHow far have we travelled?\u201d the young lord asked as he ripped off pieces of the bread he had brought from Confosse.Carlton looked up at the sky\u2013the sun was high in the sky. \u201cSince it\u2019s been about half a day, we should be nearly there. If it weren\u2019t for the centipede, we may have already reached the village.\u201dAs he drank water from a bucket, Luisen thought out loud, \u201cIs it because of that centipede? For contact from the guard captain\u2019s village being cut, I mean.\u201dThe guard captain had sent word several times, but nothing had returned.\u201cThey would have travelled the same path we did, so the messengers would have been similarly attacked by the centipede. If they were lucky, they may have been able to escape, I suppose,\u201d Carlton said.The centipede was a formidable opponent, even for the mercenary. An ordinary person wouldn\u2019t be able to put up a proper fight and would simply become its prey. The messengers were probably eaten.\u201cWho knows. It\u2019s quite far from town, but\u2026\u201d Carlton trailed off. The situation wasn\u2019t very positive.\u201cWhere could this centipede have come from?\u201d\u201cHm? Wasn\u2019t it born here?\u201d\u201cIt must have migrated from somewhere. The south doesn\u2019t originally have such gigantic monsters like this one.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dMercenaries were often called in to fight monsters. Carlton was no stranger to monsters; the kingdom\u2019s southern region had little mercenary activity. Compared to other regions, fights erupted less because the lands here were richer and had more administrative oversight. Crucially, though, there were no gigantic monsters that couldn\u2019t be solved through individual power.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a centipede before, but I\u2019ve seen ants and spiders of that size. Their habitat is usually to the northwest of here,\u201d the mercenary said.\u201cThen did they come down from there? However, there\u2019s a river in the way\u2013can monsters cross those?\u201d\u201cIf a monster of this size were to cross the river, it would have stood out.\u201d\u201cWho knows. It\u2019s a chaotic world lately.\u201dNo matter where one went, the war has been a huge problem. Armies moving up, refugees fleeing south\u2013the population moved chaotically. Among all that, there were a few people trying to cause fusses. The normal system had collapsed and strange things had gone wild within those cracks.Luisen finished eating his bread. Carlton was about to set the centipede\u2019s body ablaze, but then suddenly a few middle-aged men appeared from within the forest.Unlike with the centipede, Carlton and Zephys looked at them calmly. They were dressed in ordinary peasant clothes; furthermore, they looked like frightened, cornered rats. Even to the young lord, they didn\u2019t seem like people he needed to be vigilant against.They soon noticed the centipede and became exceedingly startled. \u201cAargh! Monster! It\u2019s a monster!\u201d\u201cSave us!\u201dFrightened, they attempted to run away before they realized that the centipede was still, turned over onto its back. They held hands and observed the centipede incredibly cautiously. \u201cW-What? You killed it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s dead? The monster?\u201dCarlton stepped forward. The three men finally noticed the mercenary and backpedalled, frightened once more. \u201cWhose family do you belong to?\u201d\u00a02\u00a0Carlton said.\u201cW-Who are you guys?\u201d\u201cI asked first,\u201d Carlton gave them a prickly reply.The people alternated their gazes between the centipede and the mercenary before responding, \u201cWhat\u2026happened to that monster?\u201d\u201cI killed it. So, what family do you belong to?\u201d Carlton was annoyed.Though the sight of an annoyed mercenary was incredibly frightening, perhaps these people had lost their minds from fear. They cheered from afar, \u201cHe said he killed it! That person killed it!\u201d\u201cAigoo!\u00a03\u00a0He killed it? Really, thank you\u2013Thank you so much!\u201d They bowed and shook Carlton\u2019s hand. Luisen couldn\u2019t tell if they were in shock from fear or not. Carlton was dumbfounded.The young lord stepped forward, holding back laughter at Carlton\u2019s dazed expression. \u201cWhat is the matter? Who are you people?\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s calm question, someone from the group finally returned to his senses. \u201cWe\u2019re people from the village\u2013right next to that huge boulder out front. We heard the centipede\u2019s screeches, so we came here to see what had happened\u2026We didn\u2019t expect to find that it had been killed!\u201dThe people lived in the guard captain\u2019s hometown\u2013Luisen and Carlton\u2019s destination. \u201cThe village next to the big boulder? We\u2019re on our way there as well. We\u2019ve come on errand for Confosse\u2019s guard captain,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cOh! The guard captain? He\u2019s from our village\u2013you\u2019ve come to the right place.\u201d The villagers were eager to guide Luisen and Carlton to their home. The village was quite a ways away; on the way, Luisen was able to hear further details about their situation.TL: It\u2019ll be explained later, but you may be confused as to why Luisen is asking if a gigantic tree-high centipede is a bug or a monster. In this world, monster is a special class of being\u2013rather than a noun, it\u2019s more like an adjective, an it\u2019s hard to know just how many monsters or monster species exist.Footnotes\ubc18\uc9c0\ub974\ub974\ud55c is like the shininess that might come from coating something with oil or another similar substance.

    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe village they called \u2018the place next to the large boulder\u2019 was located deep within the forest. The people there made a living by collecting the forest resources and exporting to cities like Confosse.The forests here were dense and inhabited by various wild animals and contained a variety of natural resources. Of course, there were monsters, but they usually stayed at a distance. The two groups lived in uneasy harmony by avoiding each other\u2019s territories. Though the village wasn\u2019t spectacular, it was quiet and peaceful\u2013at least there wasn\u2019t anything particularly wrong with the place.However, about a month ago, the village\u2019s peace was broken. One day, a giant centipede burrowed here and began to live in the forest. No one knew where it came from or why it settled here. Suddenly\u2013like a bolt from the blue\u2013without anyone\u2019s notice, it began living in this forest. They said that it began to devour living organisms with its vigorous appetite\u2013people, animals, and other monsters.\u201cThat thing was truly a monster. No blades worked on it at all. And it was so tremendously big\u2026\u201d The villagers lost their motivation due to the giant centipede\u2019s power and its terrible, unsightly appearance. They couldn\u2019t even dream of eradicating it. Even with all their gathered strength, fences, and advantageous terrain, they were only able to prevent it from entering the village. The village people hid in their homes, pierced by fear. They couldn\u2019t dare confront the centipede.\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ask Confosse or the ruling Lord for help?\u201d\u201cEven if we wanted to do that, we\u2019d need to be able to leave the village. That thing was so perceptive\u2026\u201dNo matter how cautiously they moved, the giant centipede extraordinarily noticed them and moved to attack them. It was as if the centipede had eyes everywhere in the forest. At first, they had sent several people to ask for help, but all the messengers were eaten by the centipede.\u201cTherefore, no one wants to step foot outside the village boundaries anymore. We\u2019re simply eating what we stored for winter\u2026 Actually, we were incredibly worried as to whether or not we could withstand the coming cold season,\u201d one man said.\u201cOn my way here, my mind was plagued by many thoughts. What if that monster was still alive? What if an even more frightening monster had appeared?\u201d another continued.The giant centipede\u2019s screeches were too terrible. The sound seemed to rip through and scratch at their ear canals. As they approached, they thought they would die today. But, when they finally came upon the scene, they had discovered the monster\u2019s corpse and a human standing above it.In fact, if Carlton stood there alone, they would have turned their backs and ran away immediately. How could they deal with a man who could confront the giant centipede alone and come out of the battle without a single scratch? That person couldn\u2019t be ordinary. However, since a pilgrim was with him, they had judged that the two weren\u2019t dangerous and mustered up their courage to start a conversation.While listening to the villagers\u2019 explanation, Luisen asked something he had been curious about. \u201cConfosse\u2019s guard captain said he had sent several messengers. Have you seen any of them?\u201d\u201c\u2026No outsiders have come by our villager in the past month.\u201dJust as the centipede attacked Luisen and Carlton, the monster would have probably attacked those messengers. In that case, it would have been difficult for those people to escape with their lives.\u201c\u2026That\u2019s why all lines of communication have been completely cut.\u201d Hearing their circumstances, it was easy to understand their predicament. The giant centipede who killed indiscriminately was at fault.It wasn\u2019t even their intent, but it seems that Luisen and Carlton had unexpectedly solved their problems.After roughly hearing the whole story, Luisen scooched over and plastered himself against the mercenary\u2019s side. When the two of them made it obvious that they had things to discuss, the villagers quietly took the hint, walked up front, and widened their lead. Luisen pulled at the mercenary\u2019s arm; the mercenary bent his waist in order to listen. Careful to lower his voice and keep quiet from those ahead, the young lord whispered, \u201cIt seems\u2026we sorted everything out?\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to, but it ended well,\u201d Carlton whispered back quietly. \u201cOur business has become simple. Let\u2019s just go to the village, deliver the letter to the captain\u2019s wife, and return.\u201d\u201cI suppose we should,\u201d Luisen answered listlessly.Carlton perceived the change in mood and continued, \u201cWe should have a quick meal before we leave.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019d be great.\u201d The young lord nodded his head up and down to convey his anticipation. He was looking forward to eating the rest of the bread he had brought from Confosse.As they conversed, the village soon appeared before them. A huge boulder stood high towards the back; a brick fence surrounded the village. Something felt strange\u2013the fence was far too sloppy and short to block the centipede from crossing over.As they neared, there were countless people gathered at the entrance. It seemed that every able-bodied villager had come out.\u201cWhat happened? Who are these people?\u201d The villagers\u2019 faces were wary. In a situation where they were already frightened by the giant monster, a stranger\u2019s appearance made them uneasy and fussy.\u201cThis revered pilgrim here has come to help our village on behalf of Confosse\u2019s guard captain.\u201dLuisen blatantly showcased the pilgrim\u2019s pass. Because the silver in the pass sparkled brilliantly and refracted light, those in the back could see the characteristic shine. Some of the religious folk bowed with their hands clasped together. Luisen received their greetings modestly without seeming submissive or reluctant.\u201cWhat about the centipede? What happened to it?\u201d they asked.\u201cThis person, the private mercenary that\u2019s guarding the pilgrim, killed the monster!\u201d The man\u2019s words caused a great stir amongst the masses.\u201cTruly?! That thing is dead?\u201d\u201cThat person alone? That makes no sense!\u201d\u201cHowever, I saw it with my own eyes. It laid there dead, belly-up. They even set fire to its corpse.\u201d\u201cReally? That man killed it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true. Why would I lie?\u201d The men who guided Luisen and Carlton to the villaged began to explain what they saw. The villagers rid themselves of suspicion and celebrated the death of the giant centipede. Some shouted; some wept, crying that they were saved. Some people rushed to tell this news to their families back home.In this happy pandemonium, the young lord and mercenary quickly became saviors of the town; gratitude poured forth from all quarters. Luisen gave all credit to his companion\u2013he said that Carlton noticed the centipede\u2019s approach and had even saved his life. The \u2018pilgrim\u2019s\u2019 humble attitude further encouraged the villagers\u2019 joy.A child rushed forth and handed Carlton a present. It was only a few small acorns, but their heart was in that gesture. Carlton stared blankly at the child\u2019s outstretched hand.\u2018Acorns? What do they want me to do with this?\u2019Luisen, who couldn\u2019t endure that sight anymore, stabbed Carlton in the ribs with his arm. Startled, Carlton picked them up. The child bowed deeply with gratitude, almost bending in half, and then ran to their mother.Looking at Carlton\u2019s furrowed brows, the young lord asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you upset that you received mere acorns?\u201d\u201cDo you really think I would\u2019ve expected to get a gold bar in a place like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026Then, why is your expression like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Just because\u2026\u201d Contrary to his outward expression, Carlton felt incredibly awkward.Humans were scared of unfamiliar things. They were even more reluctant to approach unfamiliar beings if they\u2019re far stronger than they are. Therefore, the more Carlton showcased his strength and danced with his blade, the more people feared him. If Carlton were a knight or perhaps some aristocrat\u2019s slave, they might not be so reluctant to approach, but his status as a mercenary made others even more uncomfortable.Of course, the mercenary was used to such treatment; besides, he intentionally acted crueller in order to garner more hostility and stoke anger. He shouldn\u2019t be upset with that. It was better to cause fear than to be considered a pushover.However, it felt strange to hear such gratitude and to receive small gifts. He had never felt so awkward and embarrassed. Carlton stuffed the acorns into his pocket with a sullen expression.\u201cWith how you took care to store those acorns, it doesn\u2019t seem like you hate it\u2013relax your face. That child\u2019s getting scared.\u201d Luisen giggled beside him. His companion got acorns as a gift from a child! \u2018It\u2019s so funny, I might laugh to death. Carlton\u2019s men need to see this!\u2019For a long while, the villagers\u2019 enthusiasm didn\u2019t cool off. After a while, waiting for the buzzing energy to subside, the village chief ran barefoot over to the two after hearing the news. \u201cThank you so much for saving our village. You two are our saviors.\u201dAfter spouting out a deluge of thanks, he calmly invited Luisen and Carlton into his house. The man presented himself with mature dignity\u2013though he may not have been wearing shoes. Luisen glanced at the chief\u2019s bare feet from time to time as they walked alongside the older man.\u201cBy the way, Mark\u2026 No, the guard captain, requested you to come here?\u201d\u201cHe said he had grown up in this village.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s the most successful person from our town.\u00a01\u00a0Anna is also from our village\u2013oh, Anna is the name of Mark\u2019s wife. He must have sent someone because he lost all contact with our village. He\u2019s a very attentive man.\u201d The chief seemed very proud that his small village produced someone that went on to become a guard captain.\u201cThere\u2019s that\u2013but we were also incredibly worried about his wife. Come to think of it, where is she? I\u2019d like to give her her husband\u2019s greetings and hand her his letter.\u201d Luisen looked around at the villagers. He couldn\u2019t see a pregnant woman or a swollen stomach anywhere. Was she not well enough to walk around outside? The young lord began to worry whether or not the village was able to endure the troubles the giant centipede had inflicted.But the chief suddenly stopped and urgently asked, \u201cAnna? He said that Anna was currently in our village? Didn\u2019t Anna return to Confosse?\u201dWhat was he saying?Luisen and Carlton also stopped. The chief\u2019s face turned starkly pale. How ominous.FootnotesThe text uses the word \uce5c\uad6c, which means friend. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the old man considers our guard captain a friend. The word could mean someone you\u2019re friendly with, someone who\u2019s the same age as you, or someone that you\u2019re aligned with. In this case, I bet the captain is saying that the guard captain is someone they are well acquainted with and is therefore using the word \u201cfriend\u201d because they are from the same village. This could be both affectionate, familial, and distant at the same time. Either way, it\u2019s hard to put all that nuance into text, so I localized it with a bit more impersonal \u2018person.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62This wasn\u2019t some matter that could be talked about on the open streets, so the three hurried into the chief\u2019s house. As soon as they sat down at the table, Luisen asked, \u201cWhat are you saying? The captain\u2019s wife went back to Confosse?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just as I said. Anna returned to Confosse about a month ago.\u201dThe chief talked more about Anna, the wife. Luisen and Carlton already knew she had returned to her hometown to give birth. However, as soon as she arrived home and unpacked, she had a gigantic fight with her family; she packed up her luggage and said she\u2019d go back. \u201cShe and her family originally didn\u2019t have the best relationship. I asked them then, their daughter had finally returned to give birth\u2013is it worth this fight? But, they told me it was family business\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, she\u2019s pregnant\u2026 They let her go off alone?\u201d\u201cAnna left with an entourage that came with her\u2013an old woman and a servant. They were a small group, but they had a carriage as well. That\u2019s enough. They made the safe journey here, after all.\u201d\u201cBack then, was the centipede absent from the forest?\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s question, the chief looked hopeless, \u201cPerhaps.\u201d\u201cPerhaps?\u201d\u201cNow that I think about it\u2026 It might have already infested the woods by then\u2026 But, at that time, we had no idea such a monster would live there.\u201dThe villagers only noticed the giant centipede\u2019s existence when it attacked their home\u2013that\u2019s when it showed its face for the first time. Until that moment, they had felt the forest was different from usual, but they had never expected for a giant centipede monster to appear. The forest had been their safe haven for a long while; they had vaguely thought they\u2019d be sheltered.\u201cThey arrived safely, so I thought they\u2019d be fine going back as well. Furthermore, I couldn\u2019t afford to spend more attention on Anna\u2019s matters.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt was that night\u2013the centipede attacked the village.\u201dThe night Anna had left, the monster attacked. Many people died fighting back against the centpiede. People were terrified; their livelihoods were paused, and they were isolated within the village. They held out, afraid that the centipede may invade again; they survived by wasting the food they had stored for winter. He couldn\u2019t afford to worry about someone who had left when their lives were in immediate danger.\u201cTo be honest\u2026I had completely forgotten about Anna until this Revered Pilgrim inquired about her. Then\u2026 you\u2019re saying Anna isn\u2019t at Confosse? She didn\u2019t return at all?\u201d\u201cYes. At least, according to the guard captain\u2026\u201d\u201cOh god, how could this happen?\u201d The chief wiped his face with trembling hands. He quickly escaped to the kitchen, saying that he\u2019d bring tea. The two could hear the chief crying from the kitchen\u2013it seemed like he knew Anna well. This news must have come as a huge shock.Disturbed, Luisen turned towards the mercenary. \u201cThe guard captain said his wife had gone home, and the chief said that the wife had returned to Confosse shortly afterwards. However, the wife is nowhere to be found. What in the world is going on?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to complicate matters. The captain\u2019s wife disappears; and no one knew of that fact because of the monstrous centipede.\u201d\u201c\u2026When you put it like that, it sounds simple.\u201d Luisen grabbed his head. The guard captain had asked him to uncover the village\u2019s situation, but that was incidental and secondary to the safety of his wife. However, now she\u2019s gone missing! In the forest where the giant centipede roamed! No matter how optimistic the young lord tried to be, it all seemed futile.\u201c\u2026Do you think she\u2019s still alive?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely.\u201d Carlton\u2019s words were cruel but accurate. If the captain\u2019s wife were still alive, she would have appeared somewhere\u2013wherever that would be. Under these circumstances, it was very likely that she had been attacked by that monster.\u201c\u2026What should we even say to the captain\u2026\u201d Luisen murmured.How could he tell a man, eagerly waiting for his future child, that his wife died a month ago? The mere thought made him dizzy. Carlton patted the young lord on the back.After weeping for a long while, the village chief returned to the table. He asked Luisen and Carlton to excuse him, left the house, and began to gather the villagers, informing them that Anna had disappeared. Then, along with the rest of the residents, the elder decided to look for the captain\u2019s wife.No one expected her to be alive, but many volunteered their services. The village, which had been excited enough to have a feast, was now grieving. A gloomy atmosphere befitting a funeral enveloped them all.***Leaving the village behind, Luisen and Carlton set out again. They couldn\u2019t help the villagers, and they had to return to Confosse to give the captain the news.They walked side by side along the forest road without riding on Zephys\u2013the horse followed docilely behind. Luisen fiddled with the captain\u2019s letter, which he carefully stored in his pocket. How could a floppy sheet of paper be so heavy? The thought of returning this letter, unable to be delivered, back to the original sender was the worst.From behind them, they could hear noises from the hurried search party rummaging through the forest.Then, Carlton suddenly put something at Luisen\u2019s mouth. The young lord instinctively took a bite. \u201cWhat is this? Mm? Jerky?\u201dAs he mumbled, the salty taste bloomed on his tongue and a savory taste seeped out. It wasn\u2019t as good as the ones made in the castle in his duchy, but the smoky scent and meat texture uplifted his mood. \u201cWhen did you buy this?\u201d\u201cI bought some\u2013they were made at the inn. My duke keeps groping at his chest pocket\u2013it looked empty.\u201d\u201dAh. I did?\u201d Luisen\u2019s face heated up. He was talking about the piece of beef jerky he always carried near his heart, right? Was it that obvious? It wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but it was an embarrassing habit.\u201cI was going to use it if my duke wasn\u2019t going to listen to my words, but I used it now.\u201d Carlton handed the leftover pieces in his pocket to the young lord.\u2018His tone sounds teasing, but he must have been paying attention to me.\u2019 Luisen put the meat in his pocket after handing the mercenary a piece as well.As they shared the beef jerky, it sounded like a pandemonium had broken out behind them. \u2018What is it this time?\u2019 Startled, Luisen turned around; simultaneously, they could hear a villager shouting.\u201cA carriage! Anna\u2019s carriage!\u201d\u201cWe found the carriage! And\u2026people\u2026.their corpses\u2026.Agh!\u201dLuisen turned to look at Carlton. \u2018Let\u2019s go\u2013it could be the guard captain\u2019s wife,\u2019 his eyes conveyed. Carlton nodded\u2013he understood the young lord\u2019s silent signals.They had found the carriage in an open space, a little off the road between Confosse and the village. It wasn\u2019t so far from where the young lord and Carlton were. When the two arrived, several villagers had already gathered to observe the scene.A small carriage, fit for two, had been broken and scattered across the vacant space. Blood had been splattered about\u2013a disastrous sight.\u201cIt seems the carriage went off road and drove wildly in that direction. They must have been attacked before trying to escape their pursuer,\u201d Carlton, looking around the lot, said.\u201cWas that pursuer the giant centipede?\u201d\u201cMost likely.\u201dAs the young lord observed the area with his companion, a villager approached him.\u201cRevered Pilgrim. Over there\u2026\u201d The villager pointed to the side. Two corpses were laid neatly, side by side. Since they had been abandoned in the forest for a month, the bodies were in a pretty horrid condition. Luisen, though, was indifferent because he had seen too many horrible deaths. Seeing his attitude, the villagers thought that the pilgrim was a truly impressive being.\u201cHave you confirmed their identities?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cThey don\u2019t seem like residents of our village\u2013they\u2019re probably the servant and the old woman that were part of Anna\u2019s entourage.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only two there?\u201d\u201cYes. For now. We\u2019re searching the surroundings at the moment\u2026 We\u2019re planning to move them into the village right now, would you please pray for them before that?\u201d the villagers cautiously asked. The people of this land were superstitious about moving those that had been recently deceased under unfortunate, unfair circumstances. They believed that if a priest prayed to soothe those regretful souls, it would all be fine.A pilgrim was quite different from a priest, but, in the eyes of those ignorant of religious hierarchy, the two seemed similar. \u2018I\u2019m not even a pilgrim, really, but this is what the living requested.\u2019\u201cI can pray for them, but it\u2019s best to cremate the bodies. I\u2019m a pilgrim, not a priest,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cThank you so much, Revered Pilgrim.\u201dLuisen approached the corpses and recited a short prayer. He copied the one-armed saint, who still remained vivdly in his memory\u2013co-opting speech patterns, gestures, and the way he maintained eye contact with his audience. The performance was incredibly believable; even the vaguely or noncommittally faithful put their hands together and imitated prayer.Carlton looked around the area while the young lord prayed. At the end of the prayer, the villagers moved to transport the bodies, and the mercenary approached Luisen. \u201cThey were attacked by the centipede.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Carlton brought Luisen around the carriage. When he brushed away the long grass with his foot, the young lord could see dotted tracks on the ground.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably centipede tracks.\u201d\u201cHow can you know?\u201d\u201cThat monster doesn\u2019t drag its body around; it travels by poking its legs, on either side, into the ground.\u201dLuisen recalled how, earlier, the centipede moved and tamped down on a wave of nausea, however futile his efforts may be. \u2018Ngh! So gross!\u2019\u201cAnd, if you look this way, there\u2019s bloodstains alongside the tracks. It goes over there,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cThen, the captain\u2019s wife is\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom the lack of body and the bloodstains, she must have been taken by the centipede. With that said, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s still alive.\u201d\u201dMmm\u2026\u201dIt was somehow discomforting. Why would it leave the other two behind and just take the captain\u2019s wife? If it wanted food, the servant would serve as a better meal.Luisen stared motionlessly in the direction the footsteps led. Even though it was bright daylight and the sun was shining, the distant forest looked gloomy. The centipede was dead. They had burned it, destroying its corpse. Nevertheless, he had an ominous hunch that this whole business had not finished yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cLet\u2019s follow the tracks,\u201d Luisen suggested. It was one thing if they had passed by without discovering this; now that the two believed the blood that painted these footprints belonged to the captain\u2019s wife, the young lord needed to personally confirm whether or not she was alive. How else could he face the guard captain later on?\u201cI believe it\u2019d be best to return to Confosse. We\u2019ve already done enough to fulfill his request.\u201d Carlton considered it a waste of time to stay here. The search could be conducted by the villagers. The outcome was unlikely to change even if they joined forces.\u201cDon\u2019t you find it strange that only the captain\u2019s wife was taken away?\u201d\u201cWe have no way of knowing the centipede\u2019s intentions. Besides, we also have no way of knowing if we\u2019ll find the captain\u2019s wife if we were to follow these tracks.\u201d\u201c\u2026Still, what if she\u2019s alive? We should save her as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cThen the villagers and the guard captain will take care of it. We have no time to meddle in another\u2019s affairs.\u201dAs Carlton said, they couldn\u2019t afford to meddle. However, Luisen couldn\u2019t feign ignorance now. The guard captain who worried about his wife and was waiting for the birth of his child; the chief who had cried alone in the kitchen at the news of Anna\u2019s disappearance. The villagers who were overjoyed at the centipde\u2019s death. Luisen had gotten to know them now.Now that he\u2019d gotten to know them, he couldn\u2019t easily leave, carefree and unfeeling. Even if he were to leave this place and travel far away, his anxieties would hang to the tips of his hair, serving as a worrying reminder of the village\u2019s plightTime. If time was an issue, was there no other way to resolve this?Luisen wracked his brains and thought of a good idea. \u201cLet\u2019s ask the chief to deliver the news to the guard captain. That way, we won\u2019t have to return to Confosse and we\u2019ll have more ease in our timeline. Hm?\u201d\u201cWhy would you go this far?\u201d\u201cSomething feels dangerous. I don\u2019t think we should just abandon these villagers\u2013these people don\u2019t have the strength to protect themselves.\u201dCarlton fell into contemplation. No matter what the young lord said, he still thought this matter was pointless. \u2018If I said no, right now, he\u2019d listen to me, but\u2026 He\u2019d be disappointed with me.\u2019He\u2019d be the cold-hearted beast that turned a blind eye to those in need and only cared about his business. Though it was true that Carlton was that type of person, he didn\u2019t want to appear that way to Luisen.Furthermore, Luisen\u2019s argument held some weight. As he said, if they sent someone else to Confosse, they\u2019d have half a day to spare. Then, it wouldn\u2019t be too much of a waste of time to join in the search. Even if they couldn\u2019t go and convey the news to the guard captain directly, they\u2019d save face by searching for his wife.\u201c\u2026Alright. However, we can only spare half a day. If that time goes by and nothing appears, we must leave.\u201d\u201cOf course! I won\u2019t be stubborn at that point!\u201d With Carlton\u2019s permission, Luisen told the villagers that they\u2019d decided to follow the centipede\u2019s footprints. Several strong-looking village youths volunteered to follow the young lord.***Even though a long time had passed, the centipede\u2019s footprints remained intact. It was fortunate that the sky hadn\u2019t rained and the weather remained dry all the while. As they walked along the tracks, the two reached a big rock\u2013the very same rock that could be seen from the village.A large open space surrounded the large rock; the tracks were cut off due to the thick piles of fallen leaves.\u201cSo it must have come over here\u2026\u201d Luisen crossed his arms over his chest and looked around. There was a rock over there and open space here. Just where would the centipede have gone? Unable to work it out, he looked towards Carlton.\u201cIf a centipede\u2019s den were to be here, it would be over there.\u201d Carlton pointed at the large rock.\u201cOver there?\u201d\u201cCentipedes like to be under rocks\u2013dark and narrow.\u201d\u201cHave you ever seen monsters that look like centipedes before?\u201d\u201cNo. However, monsters follow the creatures they resemble. Spider-type monsters spin webs; ant-type monsters cluster around and swarm others.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026\u201d Luisen really had no desire to know that. A spider or an ant the size of a child? Ugh. Just imagining them was gruesome and hair-raising. Luisen scratched at his arms automatically.Carlton approached the giant rock. When he removed the fallen leaves piled up around it, a narrow gap between the rock and the ground appeared. At a surface glance, it looked like the gap was formed naturally.\u201cThis must be the entrance to the centipede\u2019s burrow.\u201d\u201cThis? Isn\u2019t this just some gap in the ground? Isn\u2019t it too small for something of the centipede\u2019s size?\u201d\u201cIt may look like that from here, but it\u2019s probably quite spacious below. The ground underneath is soft soil, and it would be quite easy for that monster to dig and build its home.\u201d With that said, Carlton threw a small stone into the gap. The echoes from the stone rolling around lasted a long time. He was correct\u2013contrary to its outward appearance, the burrow must have been deep and wide inside.Luisen nodded. Carlton\u2019s logic had never been wrong. The young lord thought it best to listen to smart people.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go in.\u201d Carlton hesitated\u2013he wondered whether he could take the young lord inside something like a centipede burrow. For now, though, the centipede was dead; the young lord wouldn\u2019t be in much danger. And, he was worried that something may happen to the young lord if he left Luisen on the surface. So, Carlton had Luisen follow him by holding onto his cape.Carlton entered the cave first, followed by Luisen, and finally the youths from the village. As the mercenary said, after passing the narrow entrance, the inside was wide enough to stand and walk comfortably. However, the way forward was so dark it was hard to tell how deep the burrow was.The group cautiously advanced while carrying a small torch. Like that, they walked for a long while. The path slightly careened downwards, so it felt like they were walking into a dark pit. The more they descended, the more the burrow smelled unpleasantly fishy. It must have been the combination of blood and rotting grass alongside the centipede\u2019s natural scent. Furthermore, the walls were marked everywhere with the centipede\u2019s footprints.\u2018It\u2019s definitely a centipede\u2019s burrow, but\u2026\u2019No matter how far they went, nothing appeared. As the long passage continued endlessly, Luisen\u2019s initial tension had disappeared; now the young lord was struck by weary boredom. Suddenly, the surroundings changed: the ceiling had risen up and the sides opened wide. They had exited a hallway into a room. They had finally reached the end of the burrow. As he passed through the threshold, Carlton paused.Luisen had been following absentmindedly and hit his forehead against the mercenary\u2019s back. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something in front of us.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s in front of us?\u201d Even though Luisen eagerly looked ahead, his eyes weren\u2019t used to the darkness and couldn\u2019t see very well.\u201cIt\u2019s on the floor.\u201dAt Carlton\u2019s words, a village youth stepped forward and shone a light around. \u2018It\u2019 appeared in that light.A foot. A human foot.Women. Three women were laying side by side on the floor. All of them were late-stage pregnant women and looked similar in physique and age. It looked as if the monster had purposely collected these pregnant women and displayed them side by side. They were stupefied by the unexpected discovery.Did the centipede do this?\u201cWho\u2019s the guard captain\u2019s wife?\u201d Carlton broke the silence.One villager, who returned to his senses at the mercenary\u2019s question, observed the women. \u201cHere! This person is Anna.\u201dOne of the three women was the captain\u2019s missing wife. According to one of the village youths, the rest were also women from nearby villages along the forest borders. On the surface, the women looked perfectly fine. They must have been held underground for a long while, but they didn\u2019t look thin or weak.As a result, the village youth took courage and inspected them in closer detail. \u201cThey\u2019re breathing! Their hearts are beating too\u2026I think they\u2019re alright.\u201dAt first glance, the women appeared to be locked in deep sleep. \u2018Whew.\u2019 Luisen was incredibly relieved. \u2018It was good to follow the centipede\u2019s footsteps. If we hadn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t have found this burrow or saved these women.\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s hurry and take them outside. Let\u2019s each take one person into our arms to move them,\u201d the young lord said.Underground, they had nothing to simulate a stretcher; it would take time to go out and bring one below. The best idea would be to carry the women in their arms. There were three women and three people that followed them from the village, so the numbers matched perfectly.While the villagers took care of the women, Luisen and Carlton looked around the room to see if anything else was there.The young lord, while fumbling around in the dark, inadvertently brought the torch to the wall. \u201cNngh.\u201dHe had thought the walls were quite uneven\u2013it turned out to be a huge bust.The bust looked quite strange. It had the shape of a goat with four horns and three eyes. The torso protruded upwards and looked down, as if it were watching over the three women.Below the bust, there was a stone platform. It wasn\u2019t large, but soft cloth covered it; there were golden candlesticks on both sides with an incense burner in the center.\u201cIs this an altar?\u201dThe shape and arrangement looked quite similar to altars seen inside churches. The only differences were in the decorating elements: gold candlesticks instead of silver; animal bones instead of flowers.There was a gold plate placed atop the center of the altar. When one thought back to a church\u2019s altar, that place was reserved for special holy relics. However, when Luisen lifted the object atop the plate for close inspection, it was a pocket knife the size of a finger. Though the darkness made it hard for the young lord to see, the knife was blunt and its engravings and decorations looked cheap.\"\"Once again, Luisen glanced at the altar and the bust. \u201cThis is\u2026 too\u2026strange.\u201dEverything in view was just too unnatural and illogical. Why was there an altar in a centipede\u2019s den? What could that bust mean?The giant centipede had only chosen pregnant women and kept them alive in its burrow. Sometimes, monsters were known to store their food fresh, but these women did not look as if they were set aside to serve as food stocks. They had been laid so neatly\u2013as if they were displayed in front of that bust.What kind of monster would do that? They eat, destroy, and breed. Those were a monster\u2019s instincts; they were called monsters because they were slaves to those instincts.The young lord was certain that a human\u2019s hand must have meddled with this centipede\u2019s burrow. Golden candlesticks, altars\u2013those were things that only a human could retrieve.\u2018So then, someone commanded the centipedes to retrieve these women?\u2019A human who played with monsters as if they were instrumentsLuisen knew someone like that very well.TL: What is this, resident evil? D: I\u2019m not sure I want to find out what that altar was for.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Ruger\u2026\u2019Ruger ran around with a group of people that had the power to command monsters. A month ago, Ruger would have been in the duchy; so, the person involved couldn\u2019t have been Ruger. Luisen supposed this must\u2019ve been the group\u2019s doing.They seemed to be scheming something with the bizarre power. Luisen had no idea who they were. With such strange happenings cropping up everywhere, rumors were bound to spread around.\u2018Just what are they up to? What could they want? What benefit could come from their actions? What\u2019s their connection with Ruger? Was their goal to kidnap me related to all this? Was it like this in the previous timeline? What\u2019s going on?\u2019Luisen felt momentarily dizzy. It felt like he was staring down the dark abyss of a deep hole.Carlton quietly approached and grabbed the young lord\u2019s shaky shoulders. \u201cTry not to think about anything else right now. First, we should take the women out of this place. We won\u2019t be too late if we choose to think once we\u2019ve reached a safe location.\u201dTaking heart from Carlton\u2019s resolute tone, Luisen soon returned to his senses. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. First, we\u2019ll leave\u2026 we can think later.\u201dThe young village men were already carrying the women, one by one. The young lord tried to follow them quickly, but a gentle wind brushed past his cheek.\u2018Hm? Wind?\u2019Carlton dragged the young lord into his embrace by his shoulders. Right before Luisen\u2019s eyes, a black liquid sharply flew by. It barely brushed against the hem of his robes, and the cloth melted. \u2018Argh! What is that?!\u2019Sh\u2013Sh\u2013Shhh~An eerie sound echoed overhead. Luisen looked up quickly; there, a huge centipede clung to the ceiling, glaring at them. Its dozens of red eyes rolled around. Black drool dripped from between its sawlike teeth; when the liquid touched the ground, the soil corroded with a violent noise.\u201cEveryone, run!\u201d\u201cArghh!\u201d The village youths discovered the centipede and ran away with the women in their arms. Luisen and Carlton, who brought up the rear, were in the most danger. Without thinking twice, Carlton carried Luisen in his arms and started running as well.Bang!The centipede crashed and stuck its head into the floor. Carlton dodged by a hair\u2019s breadth and slipped into the hallway. The passage was narrow, long, and uphill. Since before them were the youths carrying the women, Carlton found it difficult to speed up.The centipede bustled and clacked its dozens of legs and chased them while crawling along the walls.Thud, Crash, Thud\u2013!Every time the centipede poked the wall with its leg, an earth-shattering vibration spread out.\u201cArgh! Didn\u2019t that thing die? We burned its corpse just in case!\u201d Luisen shouted.\u201c\u2026.It\u2019s not the same monster.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cCentipedes travel in pairs, male and female. Damn\u2013I just remembered. That\u2019s a female centipede.\u201dIt was bigger and longer than the monster that Carlton killed. So, you\u2019re saying those things travel in pairs? There\u2019s no doubt about it\u2013this world had gone insane!The young lord saw the centipede open its big mouth as if it were about to swallow him.\u2018Arghhh!\u2019 The young lord wrapped his arms around Carlton\u2019s neck and legs around the mercenary\u2019s waist. Forget about shame or propriety\u2013none of that mattered if he died. With that determination in mind, he clung resolutely to his companion.The centipede bared its teeth\u2013pincers?\u2014from time to time as it relentlessly chased them. Poisonous saliva trickled down through the gaps in its mouth. Luisen couldn\u2019t help but to inwardly pray to god.\u2018God. Why would you bring such a creature into this world?\u2019 The holy diety was silent as always, but at least Luisen had Carlton.Carlton tactfully defended by kicking at the centipede\u2019s head or teeth. He bought time by smashing its head into the wall in between his defense. Thanks to that, the village youths and Luisen were able to crawl out of the den safely.The villagers, who came after hearing the news, were gathered around the rock.\u201cWhat are you doing? Run away!\u201d Luisen shouted, but the villagers, caught unaware, moved slowly. Calrton immediately placed the young lord on Zephys, drew his sword, and prepared for battle.The ground rumbled throughout this short, uneasy silence.At that moment, the centipede popped out from below the boulder as if it were flying into the sky. Dust and dirt rose like a cloud as soon as it appeared. Underneath the bright sunlight, the monster showed off its majestic form. Its long, wriggling body seemed like it was made of steel; the long, spindly legs were bent at precise right angles and moved freely. Every time it clacked its legs in the air, a sharp noise rang out.Keeeeeeeeeee\u2013!The centipede screeched. The villagers panicked, and the empty meadow soon turned into a\u00a0 pandemonium.\u201cI-It\u2019s a centipede!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alive! Arghhh!\u201d\u201dSave us!\u201dScared, the villagers fled in all directions. However, the centipede stood straight and stayed still. It didn\u2019t go after the running people and simply hissed and tried to intimidate Carlton.\u201cWhy does it seem like, in my eyes at least, it\u2019s focusing only on you?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cIt knows I\u2019m the one who killed her husband.\u201d Carlton snorted.\u2018Could he really laugh at a time like this? My legs are shaking right now.\u2019 The young lord couldn\u2019t decide whether or not to admire Carlton\u2019s guts or to cry. Actually, no, he just wanted to cry.\u2018If I knew that we\u2019d encounter a monster like that, I\u2019d have never taken this request! We were originally going to just meet the captain\u2019s wife, deliver a letter, and obtain a reply. Simple, safe, and heartwarming!\u2019There was no use regretting things now. The female centipede ran towards the mercenary at a high speed. In the blink of an eye, it came directly in front of Luisen and Carlton. Lifting its upper torso, it swung forward and thrust its pincers. The mercenary parried its pincers with his sword and, this time, swung his blade at one of the legs.Clank\u2013!Alongside the sound of metal clashing against metal, his blade bounced off the leg. Carlton intended to cut off the legs gradually, like he did with the male centipede, but failed. It seemed as if the female\u2019s body was harder and tougher.As soon as it weathered that first attack, it stuck its body into the ground and swung around. The legs moved in perfect synchronization as its torso wriggled about. In an instant, the centipede circled around Luisen and Carlton to their rear and attacked simultaneously with its tail and head. The attack wasn\u2019t aimed solely at the mercenary; it would also involve the young lord in its path.\u201cAghh!\u201d Luisen hugged Zephys\u2019 neck. The horse deftly dodged by jumping over the centipede\u2019s tail.Carlton, anticipating the head\u2019s attack, easily dodged and posed to scratch the eyes sideways in a counterattack. However, the centipede was frighteningly fast. The numerous joints on its huge body allowed it to speedily change directions with little force needed. It dodged by plunging its head to the ground, and Carlton\u2019s sword only gazed past its black antennae.Kyaak\u2013! Kyaaagh\u2013!The centipede screeched as it burrowed into the soil.Rumble\u2013The ground shook as if an earthquake was happening; a thick cloud of dust rose into the air. As soon as Carlton attempted to grab its tail, it spat out some saliva from that end\u2013the very same acidic saliva that had melted cloth. The mercenary could not approach, and the monster soon vanished underground.\u201c?\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201d Carlton flung his body sideways as he swore. Simultaneously, accompanied by a hair-raising roar, the centipede popped out with an open maw\u2013exactly where the mercenary had been standing just seconds before. It was too close for comfort.\u2018This won\u2019t work. We\u2019ll need to both run away.\u2019 Luisen tried to pull on Zephys\u2019 reins to direct the horse towards its owner. \u201cNo! Go back! Your master might die like this!\u201dZephys brushed off the young lord\u2019s shouts and moved away from the battle scene. The young lord dismounted, somehow, but there was nothing more he could do. He knew that running to the mercenary would just make him into a bigger burden; Luisen was forced to watch his companion struggle.The female centipede then launched various attacks. It seemed like it was taking everything for the mercenary to even block the attacks. Even if he somehow placed his blades against the centipede\u2019s joints, the monster soon fled underground and jumped out of some unexpected vantage point to continue the onslaught of attacks. Each time that happened, the mercenary had to move in an ungainly way and fling himself out of the line of danger. He didn\u2019t have to move a single step while fighting the male centipede, but now it looked difficult to stand on his two feet.Luisen felt like something acrid was burning in his mouth.However, Carlton was smiling.\u2018Where did that come from?\u2019 The female centipede was an incomparably tricky opponent compared to her counterpart. Not only was it strong, fast, and gigantic\u2026but the difference it its weight distribution made it hard for the mercenary to aim for its eyes. The hard outer skin protected everywhere else. It was clever enough to know that Carlton was aiming for its eyes, so it didn\u2019t attack with its mandibles again.Its appearance, ferocity, and strength\u2013furthermore what it had done to this forest. All that was enough to crown this centipede as a \u2018named monster.\u2019 It would go down in history.\u2018If one kills a thing like that, they\u2019ll become super famous.\u2019Along with the news of the emergence of a new monster, stories of the person who slayed it would spread as well. Even if one killed dozens of monsters like Orcs, they wouldn\u2019t be able to attain that sort of reputation. Fame was like gold for mercenaries like Carlton\u2013the more the better. So, naturally, Carlton couldn\u2019t help but smile.Carlton\u2019s sword split through one of the joints on the centipede\u2019s countless black legs. His blow struck true, but the centipede hid in the ground again; the mercenary couldn\u2019t continue his offense.Carlton was searching for an opportunity. The more he took damage, the sharper his gaze became. He tapped the ground with his feet. As soon as the centpiede burrowed into the ground and popped out once more, Carlton plunged his sword down with all his might.Kyaaaaaaaaaargh\u2013!The centipede\u2019s wail rang out. The attack was half successful. Originally, the mercenary aimed for the eyes but missed by a narrow margin and caught the edge of the socket. Though Carlton was hit by the centipede\u2019s head, he landed stably on the ground.\u2018I wish I could have poked through the eye in one shot, but\u2026\u2019 He didn\u2019t think he would be able to defeat the monster in one blow anyway. It had too extraordinary of a reflex. That was alright, though. Carlton wasn\u2019t aiming for a single blow.The centipede stood upright. It slammed into the ground and wriggled around.Kyaaaaaagh\u2013!It was the first time the monster had ever felt that kind of pain. It was born strong and had never been hurt before. In addition, anger and fear compounded in its monstrous body from the fact that the same human that had killed its husband was pushing it to this extent. Its monstrous instinct, which had laid dormant from complacency, had revived.\u2018I have to live. I have to escape!\u2019 it thought.However, things didn\u2019t work out according to the centipede\u2019s wishes.Rummmmbleee\u2013!A grumble echoed deep from underground; the soil caved in right underneath its feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe ground collapsed right below the centipede\u2019s feet. When the centipede burrowed through the ground with its gargantuan body, it caused a disturbance in the stability of the soil, and the ground was weakened. It could not withstand the weight of the monster anymore. To make matters worse, the large nearby boulder fell over onto the centipede\u2019s body.Kyaaaaaagh\u2013!Carlton leisurely stepped outside the hazardous zone. The ground\u2019s collapse was one of his goals.The centipede dug into the ground and hid whenever it found itself at a disadvantage. Naturally, the monster left behind a long tunnel whenever it did so. Of course, the ground beneath his feet shook. Without fail, those passages would collapse. At that moment, the huge boulder caught the mercenary\u2019s eyes. Carlton deliberately led the centipede to hide underground and sought to counterattack it near the large boulder. Just as he expected, the centipede faltered in confusion in the collapsing soil and was squashed by the boulder.When the tremors subsided, Carlton approached the centipede. The centipede struggled until the end\u2013when it saw the mercenary approached, it clacked its mandibles at him. However, that was all it could do. The monster\u2019s body was a wreck\u2013it couldn\u2019t push the boulder away. It couldn\u2019t even escape into the ground.Carlton casually stepped on the centipede\u2019s head and inserted his sword into the monster\u2019s bright red eyes. Several times. The monster screeched and hit its tail onto the ground, flopping about in its dying throes. Eventually, it wearied, and the centipede\u2019s body went limp.This was Carlton\u2019s victory.\u201cW-Wow\u2026\u201d Luisen mouth gaped wide open. That was a more dramatic reversal than any theatric play. Just when it had seemed like the mercenary was pushed back by the centipede, he had killed the monster in an instant. At first, the young lord wondered if Carlton had gotten lucky, but the young lord soon changed his mind when he saw the mercenary avoiding the danger zones. It was clear that he had defeated the centipede through precise calculations.He took advantage of the centipede\u2019s own strengths\u2013its ability to hide underground\u2013against the monster. What a clever, quick-witted ploy. Amazing. So cool. How could he act so boldly when his life was at stake? Even though he was a mere observer, Luisen felt like his heart would burst.\u201cWow, that person killed the centipede all by himself!\u201d The villagers, who could not escape far away, gathered around the young lord to watch Carlton\u2019s fight. Everyone was mesmerized by the dramatic turnabout victory. They had yet to be struck by the reality that the centipede was now only a cooling corpse.Carlton beheaded the monster. Then, as if he were kicking a ball, he launched the Centipede\u2019s head away.\u201cW-Wow\u2026 Waaaahhhh!!!!\u201d The villagers went wild\u2013a wave of excitement swept through them. It finally sunk in\u2013the monster was dead. That mercenary had killed two monsters and saved the town again!Paying no heed to who should approach the man first, the people rushed at Carlton. The villagers scrambled around to praise him. Luisen had also joined the crowd and approached his companion.Carlton smiled cheekily\u2013despicably confident\u2013when he saw the young lord. When Luisen saw that smile, his breath was suddenly caught in his throat. Though the mercenary remained victorious, if the heavens willed it and turned their favor away, Carlton could have been caught in the ground\u2019s collapse and defeated by the centipede\u2019s blind struggle.\u2018Why are you laughing like that when things could have been disastrous? You make your audience\u2019s heart burn with worry.\u2019\u201cYou\u2026You madman.\u201d\u201cWas it so bad that, instead of a compliment, you must curse at me?\u201d Carlton protested.Luisen tried to speak further but soon surrendered himself to a surge of emotion. He strode up to the man and hugged the mercenary tightly.Carlton opened his eyes wide with shock; his pupils rapidly shook side to side. \u201c\u2026Revered pilgrim?\u201dHis dumbfounded expression did not suit his veteran mercenary identity. Paying no heed, Luisen hugged Carlton even tighter and whispered in to his ears, \u201cYou did well\u2013very impressive. You\u2019re truly the best.\u201dCarlton had been through many battles, but compliments\u2013not ones fueled through fear or jealousy, true praise\u2013were unfamiliar to him. It tickled the mercenary, but he didn\u2019t hate it. Rather, it felt like his heart was swelling.Carltons hands hesitated for a moment before returning Luisen\u2019s embrace. At that sight, the villagers, drunk on triumph, went wild. They hugged each other and comforted each other for their struggles.The heated atmospehre did not subside for a while; soon the others, who heard the centipede\u2019s screeches, joined the masses. In the midst of that atmosphere, Luisen and Carlton held each other for quite a long while.\"\"***By the time the centipede was killed, the sun had already set. Luisen and Carlton stayed overnight in the village. Though the village felt that even a grand feast wasn\u2019t sufficient for their valiant heores, the night passed quietly\u2013after all, the aftershocks of the ground collapsing had reached the village outskirts, breaking things here and there. They simply couldn\u2019t afford it.The next day: Unexpected people arrived at the village at dawn: the guard captain at Confosse and one of the ruling Lord\u2019s knights. After being contacted by the village chief, the guard captain had raced here with a few others; the knight had recieved a call, around two months ago, that there were suspicious folks wandering about the forest. Though the knight was hesitant of the veracity of such rumors, he had appeared as well.They were startled at the state of the village and nearly fainted at the sight of the centipede\u2019s corpse. After receiving updates from the villagers, the guard captain and knight wanted to see Luisen and Carlton\u2013each for their own reasons. However, the two had already left the village at dawn.The two thought their presence would be too burdensome for the impoverished village; there was no need to stay any longer when they have done all they needed to do. So, they left the room and left behind a single note explaining their thought process\u2026Honestly, they had escaped at down because they didn\u2019t want to draw more attention, but they couldn\u2019t add that detail into the note. The villagers were deeply moved at the thought that their heores were so considerate of their difficult situation.Among the grateful, the captain\u2019s heart was especially affected. Luisen and Carlton had ventured into a cetipede den to find his missing wife. They could have just returned to him and informed him of his wife\u2019s disappearance; the fact that they had taken such a risk to keep their promise to him and return Anna to safety moved him to tears.Thanks to that, his wife had safely woken from her stasis. Though she didn\u2019t remember anything that had happened after being captured by the centipede, she remembered a person\u2013the revered pilgrim perhaps?\u2013caressing her forehead. The guard captain reflected on the holy doctrine as he recalled the pilgrim that had protected his family\u2013a light that shine mercifully upon those in the dark. Were they sent by God to shine light upon their world? The married couple gave thanks for their safety and prayed for a safe pilgrimage for Luisen and Carlton.A few weeks later, the captain\u2019s wife gave birth: a healthy daughter. The couple named their child with a religiously symbolic name, one that meant \u2018God\u2019s blessing,\u2019 to honor their savior.***The Anies duchy was grieving, drowning in sorrow.Not long ago, they had lost contact with the entourage that left for the capitol; only Ruger had returned to the duchy. Injured and exhausted, Ruger said that the group was suddenly attacked by some monsters; in the midst of that chaos, Carlton had abducted Luisen. At first, they couldn\u2019t believe Ruger\u2019s words, but, as all others had died, they had no choice but to believe in him.The Anies duchy went out all in their efforts to find Luisen but found nothing. As time passed and anxiety increased, they could only languish in their helplessness.Ruger, who had manufactured this whole situation, also wasn\u2019t in a good shape. \u2018Damn it. Where the hell is he?\u2019He had no idea where Carlton and Luisen were either.After Carlton jumped into the waterful, Ruger scoured the surrounding area. Contrary to his expectations that he\u2019d find them soon, Luisen could not be found anywhere. \u2018I thought he\u2019d return to the dukedom, but..\u2019Luisen was like a snail\u2013he tended to hide away in his home at the hint of danger. That person thought that the duchy and capital were all that mattered due to his limited wordly knowledge.\u2018Then, he should have returned to the duchy.\u2019Ruger had his helper explore the surroundings with the direwolves and returned to the dukedom alone. Then, he lied to everyone, stating that Carlton had kidnapped Luisen. Someone needed to be the scapegoat and the mercenary was a notoriously good fit for the job.\u2018Without that bastard, the plan would have been perfect.\u2019Whether by scaring Luisen into running away under the cover of darkness or to succeed in his kidnap attempt\u2026if it hadn\u2019t been for Carlton, Luisen would be in his grasp by now.\u2018I didn\u2019t like him from the first time we met. He has no idea what he\u2019s spouting. Does he think that, because he can run all over the place, he\u2019s all that? Nothing changes the vulgarity of his lowborn status.\u2019Ruger loathed Carlton\u2013he was frustrated that Luisen and the mercenary were left alone together.However, Luisen did not appear no matter how long he waited. His master, who placed him as a secret agent and ordered the kidnapping, had grilled him for more information; his subordinates had no idea where they should go. While suffering from a head-rending head-ache, he had learned that Carlton\u2019s men had been captured.Ruger rushed to go meet the mercenary\u2019s men\u2013it was exceedingly difficult to do so. The general had prevented anyone from seeing them. Ruger had gone to the general to try and discuss this matter, but the man had kicked Ruger out saying, \u201cJust focus on your own recovery.\u201dRuger snorted as he closed the door to the general\u2019s office. \u2018What? He wants me to focus on my own health and nothing else? How dare this old man play tricks with me.\u2019It was obvious that the man had just given him a generic excuse. Even though Ruger had a bandage wrapped around his head, the general had not once asked how he was feeling.\u2018He must be blocking me from meeting with Carlton\u2019s men. He\u2019s suspicious of me.\u2019The general did not believe that Carlton had kidnapped Luisen. Rather, he doubted Ruger. Because he suspected that there were hidden factors in this case, he had to do something to uncover some information.The old vassal who had led the duchy for so long was disgustingly clever. It was fascinating how a man like that could raise a fool like Luisen.\u2018Does he really think that I won\u2019t be able to uncover information without his permission?\u2019 Ruger paced in front of the general\u2019s office like an obsessed man before heading for a deserted hallway. Soon, a maid came out of an office and, after confirming no others were nearby, went after Ruger.\u201cDear, are you alright?\u201d The maid asked Ruger in a pitying tone as she caressed his face.She was a low-level maid in charge of various chores in the general\u2019s office and someone Ruger had put a great deal of effort into. She believed that she and Ruger were intimate lovers, but, to Ruger, she was a useful source of information. That\u2019s why he approached her in the first place. This time as well he was sure he\u2019ll be able to find more information through her.\u201cI guess the general doesn\u2019t trust me because I\u2019m an outsider,\u201d Ruger bowed his head as if he were lost in emotion.The maid\u2019s heart was shaken by Luisen\u2019s distressed performance. \u2018It wasn\u2019t like he wanted to do anything bad; he wanted to do all he could as a sick person.\u2019 This time, she felt like the General went overboard. \u201cI heard a few things\u2026\u201dA lover\u2019s weak visage was enough to stimulate her sympathy. \u2018Why is it so hard to say only a few words to cheer up a loved one?\u2019***\u2018Confosse. Confosse, huh.\u2019 Ruger reflected on what he had heard from the maid. The general must have been very careful\u2013much of her information wasn\u2019t very useful\u2013but it was still interesting to hear that Carlton\u2019s subordinates were caught near Confosse.\u2018Those guys were waiting for Carlton at Confosse. The duke must be with the mercenary, I suppose.\u2019It was easy to figure out that Luisen and Carlton were not returning to the duchy and were, instead, heading straight to the capital.\u2018That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t find them no matter how hard I searched. They\u2019re acting opposite to my expectations\u2013I\u2019m sure this is Carlton\u2019s idea. The duke isn\u2019t so bold.\u2019Luger clenched his fist as he imagined Carlton threatening his duke and forcing him to the capital. Anger bubbled up from within him.\u2018I\u2019ll need to personally go to Confosse. I\u2019ll retake the Duke with my own hands.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter if Luisen had already gone past Confosse. The direwolves had an amazing sense of smell\u2013he was confident that the monsters would be able to chase quickly as long as they started there.\u2018I guess I must catch Luisen myself. Since I cared for and betrayed my owner, I must finish this well.\u2019 Ruger\u2019s thoughts were somewhat contradictory, but those thoughts came so naturally to the man that he didn\u2019t notice the contradiction at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Part 7: I feel as if someone is watching me in the darkThe night they defeated the centipede: Luisen and Carlton sat in the dark room, seated across each other, and discussed the day\u2019s events.Considering the circumstances, they were convinced that the giant centipede that had kidnapped the women was acting on someone\u2019s orders\u2013someone who had the power to control monsters. From that fact alone, it was clear that this mystery person was in cohorts with Ruger. He and his gang\u2019s final goal wasn\u2019t Luisen\u2019s abduction\u2013they had other plans and Luisen\u2019s abduction was simply one of them.They had too little information; their tactics were so unprecedented so they had few guesses as to their identity or motives.The only certainty was that the group must be conducting evil somewhere else as well\u2013a huge conspiracy scheming underneath the eyes of those that believed peace had arrived after the chaos of the civil war.\u2018In anycase, we must leave here quickly.\u2019Since Carlton\u2019s men were captured in Confosse and taken to the duchy, Ruger must have a great interest in Confosse. If they linger, they may be caught by the combined forces of his colleague, who controlled the centipede, and Ruger.Due to those thoughts, they escaped the village before sunrise. They were ignorant to the fact that they had left such a lasting impression on the villagers and the guard captain.The sudden separation created room for lingering regrets; the people did not forget this benevolence for a long time and spread tales of the pious pilgrim and his mercenary, who were clearly sent by God. Both Luisen and Carlton did not expect that.Since then, the two moved constantly. It was an easy journey in many ways thanks to the supplies they bought at Confosse and Zephys. In the distance, they started to see the vague outlines of the city.The port city: Mittil.\"\"In this kingdom, a large river, originating from the western mountains, divides the country\u2019s land mass. One had to cross this river to go from the South to the other parts of the kingdom, and port cities, large and small, developed along the river basin.Mittil was the most prosperous port city among them. It had the adantage of being an easy access point to move eastward through the river.Luisen was also familiar with this city because, in the past, Luisen had crossed through this area on his way to the capital. As an aristocrat, he enjoyed all sorts of luxuries in this port; however, the city left the strongest impression after the young lord made his moonlit escape in the previous timeline.As he ran away in the night from the duchy and blindly went northwards, Luisen came to Mittil in order to cross the river. There were no gate inspections, so he could easily enter the city. The problem, though, was the ship. At that time, he had not known that one had to buy a ticket to board a boat, so he was caught and immediately kicked out of the boat.\u2018Now that I am reminded of that, I\u2019m embarrassed.\u2019 Luisen\u2019s face heated up at that old memory and he fanned his hands wildly.\u201cAre you tired? The sunlight is a bit strong.\u201d Carlton raised his hands over the young lord\u2019s head and blocked the sun rays. The resulting shadow was big perhaps because of the mercenary\u2019s large hands.Anyway, that\u2019s when someone approached that foolish past-Luisen. The man said he\u2019d buy the ship ticket for him, so the young lord handed him the money. That man took the money and bounced; Luisen was swindled. At the time, he felt the world was so unfair, but that anecdote showed exactly how naive the young lord was back then.\u2018Still, I had good luck.\u2019While he was crying on the side of the road in frustration, a merchant caravan approached him and asked about his situation. The merchant felt sorry for the swindled Luisen and bought a ticket for him. The ticket\u2019s seat was for a third-class commoner\u2019s ship, but at least the young lord was able to cross the river.On second thought, there were so many good people in this world. Like the saint and those back in the duchy.\u2018Are the people back at the castle in the duchy doing well\u2026?\u2019Luisen looked back. There was no way he could see the castle, but for some reason his heart strings were still tugged. These days he\u2019s been worried about the people back home. Ruger might be tormenting the denizens of his duchy with his evil power.\u2018I\u2019ll quickly go to the capital and reveal the truth.\u2019He\u2019ll save his people from Ruger\u2019s grasp. After gaining a solid foothold in the capital, he\u2019ll return safely to his castle and serve as a proper lord. He just hoped that the people in the duke\u2019s castle will hold firm until then. Luisen steeled his heart.***Luisen and Carlton were able to enter Mittil with heads high because thanks to the Pilgrim\u2019s pass and Carlton\u2019s mercenary tag.As they were posing as people on a pilgrimage, the two went to the church and prayed for the sake of formality and quickly escaped without encountering the priest. Then, they headed to the mercenary\u2019s guild. There were always mercenaries in Mittil\u2019s guild that were seeking safe and well-paying commissions.When Luisen entered the mercenary guild, all the mercenaries\u2019 eyes were on the young lord. Though he was covered head to toe with clothes, the way he opened the door was so aristocratic. The pilgrim\u2019s pass at his waist shone brilliantly.\u2018He\u2019s a pilgrim from a noble family, huh? Then, is he going to request an escort?\u2019\u2018There\u2019s nothing easier than escorting a pilgrim. I should obtain his commission.\u2019The mercenaries all stood up to talk to the young lord. At that moment Carlton followed Luisen inside. He naturally placed his hand on the young lord\u2019s soldiers and glared at all the focused gazes in the room. \u2018What are you guys looking at?\u2019 the mercenary\u2019s eyes seemed to say.Although the folk in the room were tough and rugged mercenaries that have been through many hardships, Carlton\u2019s sturdy physique and vicious eyes discouraged them.\u2018Man, that guy\u2019s already spoken for,\u2019 The mercenaries calmly lowered their eyes and sat their butts back down in their seats\u2013there was no point in continuing to stand. Carlton grinned contemptuously at their reactions.Meanwhile, Luisen headed for the guild\u2019s reception window. \u201cI heard in Yeokcham village that we\u2019d receive money if we defeat monsters? Is that true?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. That\u2019s correct.\u201dThe indifferent employee at the terminal responded, \u201cYou\u2019ve brought evidence, right? If you don\u2019t have proof that you\u2019ve defeated the monster, we can\u2019t pay. Give me your proof.\u201d\u201cHere? There\u2019s just\u2026a lot of it.\u201dThere were many mercenaries who insisted that they had defeated dozens of monsters without any evidence. Perhaps the clerk assumed that\u2019s what they\u2019re like. The employee held out a small basket impetuously. While Luisen was hesitant and in a bind, the staff impatiently tapped his basket.Carlton\u2019s temper flared when the clerk acted arrogantly towards his client. \u201cIf he wants it so much, we\u2019ll have to give it to him, yes?\u201dCarlton spilled the contents of the bag he was carrying.Roll\u2013 Crash\u2013 Plop\u2013By-products, such as the monster\u2019s horn, eyes, and noses, poured out and piled high like a mountain on the till. A monster\u2019s unique stench and rotten blood scent spread throughout the building. The employee looked on with their mouth wide open. \u201cT-This\u2026 All\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease count the bills. There\u2019s more.\u201d\u201cT-There\u2019s more?!\u201dLeaving the bewildered guild staff behind, Carlton brought two more sacks. Even the observing mercenaries stared with their mouths gaping. \u2018That\u2019s overboard, honestly.\u2019When Carlton found out that money would be given for defeated monsters, he hunted them like a madman. If one didn\u2019t know the mercenary\u2019s motive, he would have looked like a psychopath obsessed with blood. Actually, the man still looked like that despite Luisen\u2019s knowledge about this situation. Later on, the young lord even felt sorry for those monsters.However, Carlton simply stated, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d From his point of view, monsters were just walking coins. Carlton couldn\u2019t just pass by coins that were dropped onto the ground, after all. Of course, if he were alone, the mercenary wouldn\u2019t have gone that far; however, Carlton had Luisen with him. If he could catch one more monster, he could buy Luisen another piece of jerky. Instead of hard, dark bread, he could feed the young lord soft, white bread. Of course he had to defeat more.The monetary settlement process took a long time; Carlton could line his pockets as he wished.Luisen grumbled as he left the mercenary\u2019s guild. \u201cIt\u2019s too much\u2026\u201d\u201cWe must earn money while we can. I promised that I\u2019d make sure you won\u2019t lack.\u201d\u2018I can\u2019t believe he still cared about what happened Confosse. Was his pride really that affected by how we had to sell my hair?\u2019 Luisen inwardly clicked his tongue. Of course, Carlton wasn\u2019t thinking that, but Luisen wouldn\u2019t know that.\u201cLet\u2019s go buy something.\u201d Carlton pulled Luisen closer by the shoulder. The young lord followed along. Since there were so many people around, Carlton walked around naturally with his arms around the lord\u2019s shoulders. Luisen, who had become accustomed to the mercenary\u2019s embrace while on horseback, didn\u2019t mind and felt comfortable.Carlton spent the money excitedly. New clothes, new shoes, even underwear and socks\u2013luxuries they couldn\u2019t afford for a while. Luisen understood that they had buy necessities, but the mercenary was going overboard and was trying to buy things that weren\u2019t necessary for this trip.\u201cHow about that?\u201d Carlton said.\u201c\u2026Where would I use a hat fitted with a peacock feather?\u201d\u201cWhat about this?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do we have need of silk shirts now?\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s snap, Carlton turned around regretfully. He thought both the peacock hat and the silk shirt would suit the young lord well. Luisen felt like death while being dragged around. If this were a food stall, that would be a different matter, but Luisen wasn\u2019t as materialistic as he was a glutton. \u201cWhat are you trying to buy? I don\u2019t need anything more, so let\u2019s buy your supplies. No\u2013let\u2019s not add to our baggage and go eat some food.\u201dAt the young lord\u2019s grumbles, Carlton bought some candy and handed it over. Candy was pretty expensive for a treat\u2013Luisen didn\u2019t refuse because he was greedy for the sweet, but he also had concerns. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we save some money?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We can always earn more. I can do that much\u2013you saw, right?\u201d Carlton put on airs.\u2018It must be nice to be\u00a0*so*\u00a0talented,\u2019 Luisen shook his head. \u2018The more I see him, there\u2019s an element of childishness to that man.\u2019The young lord mumbled around the candy in his mouth. Suddenly, he remembered a question he had for a long time, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u2018How old is he to still have these sort of temper tantrums?\u2019Carlton pretended not to hear. However, the young lord did not miss how the mercenary\u2019s grin turned rigid. \u2018See that? Why is he ignoring me?\u2019\u201cI\u2019ve never heard how old you are. Zephys is now 7 years old? You took him and ran away, correct? Uh\u2026 Then\u2026\u201d Luisen counted by folding fingers. \u201c\u2026You\u2019re an adult, right? You\u2019re not still a minor, right?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m an adult! Do I look like I could still be a child?\u201d\u201cWell, with that face, body, and temperament\u2026 It\u2019d be concerning if you weren\u2019t at least 20.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019m the same as my duke.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be! If he ran away from home at 15, he should be 22 years old now?! Huh? You\u2026 Are you perhaps younger than me\u2026?\u201d Luisen shouted. \u2018Am I older? Is that true?\u2019Carlton slipped away, pretending to look at the stalls on the other side of the street.\u2018Huh? What\u2019s with that reaction?!\u2019Luisen tugged at Carlton\u2019s arm and urged him for an answer. Though the mercenary kept trying to avert his gaze, Luisen\u2019s blue eyes were too sparkly and beautiful to ignore. Still, he didn\u2019t really want to talk about his age, so he tried a different tactic. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly when I was born, so I don\u2019t know my proper age as well.\u201d\u201cDoes that even make sense?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told you how aloof my family is.\u201dLuisen narrowed his eyes. For some reason, he strongly felt that the other was simply giving him excuses to avoid answering the question. However, if that tragic story was true, it\u2019d be tactless to ask further.The young lord couldn\u2019t believe his companion had countered his slight teasing with a sorrowful familial woe. What a quick-witted man. Luisen raised both hands in a surrendering gesture, \u201cFine. I won\u2019t ask you any further. You really don\u2019t want to talk about it, do you?\u201d\u201cNo harm done now that you understand. By the way\u2026\u201d Carlton, chuckling, whispered into Luisen\u2019s ear, \u201cI believe we\u2019re being followed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67\u2018We\u2019re being trailed? He\u2019s joking, right?\u2019When Luisen looked doubtful, Carlton slightly shook his head.\u2018We\u2019re seriously being followed?\u2019Just as the young lord was about to look back, Carlton\u2019s hand blocked him. \u201cLook forward, and please follow behind me naturally.\u201dCarlton picked up something random from the stall, paid for it, and moved on naturally. Luisen walked in tandem with the mercenary\u2019s footsteps, but his body felt like it was carved from wood. At least his clothing was relatively baggy, otherwise his awkwardness would have been noticed.Carlton, unable to stand the stiltedness, placed his arms around Luisen\u2019s shoulder. Honestly, the young lord felt more comfortable like this.The mercenary glanced sneakily behind him. He purposefully sped up and slowed down at random intervals, trying to catch his opponent off guard. The trailing man looked somewhat awkward as he floundered about\u2013he didn\u2019t appear to be a professional tracker.\u2018He\u2019s nothing special.\u2019 Carlton sped up around the corner. He pushed Luisen against the hard stone bricks and plastered his body against the wall as well. Then, he stuck out a leg and tripped the man who rushed after them hurriedly. Simultaneously, he grabbed the man\u2019s arm, bent it behind the back, and pressed his knees against the man\u2019s waist.\u201cAck!\u201dIn one stroke, the mercenary overpowered the man following them. The man struggled, but Carlton didn\u2019t budge one inch and, instead, pinned him down with more strength.\u201cW-Why are you doing this?\u201d\u201cWhy? That\u2019s what I should say. Why are you following us?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean f-following?! Ack! First, let go of my arm\u2026\u201d The man denied as he jumped up and down. Carlton hit the man on the head, warning him not to make a fuss.Luisen looked closer at his pained expression. \u2018Huh\u2026 That person\u2026?\u2019\u2018That man\u2019s face looked somehow familiar. Just where have I seen him before?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t hard to recall\u2013Luisen quickly recognized him with a moment\u2019s contemplation.This man, moved by the young lord\u2019s tragic, fraud-victim story, was the one who had bought his crying self a ticket in the previous timeline. He was someone who made a long-lasting impression since he was the first person to offer any sort of goodwill after the young lord had been shunned and despised after his fall from grace. Luisen could mentally overlap that man\u2019s face and on top of this one\u2013he was sure this was the same person.\u2018I believe, back then, that person said he was a merchant?\u2019In anycase, though it was the first time Luisen met this man in this timeline, it was a relief to see the face of a good man. The young lord was sure there must be some sort of misunderstanding.\u201cWait a minute. Let\u2019s hear him out.\u201dThe young lord stopped his companion. Though the mercenary kept his guard up, he let the man go.The man scrambled to his feet, certain he mustn\u2019t lose this opportunity to explain himself. \u201cI\u2019m Morrison, affiliated with the Nakatan merchant caravan. I wasn\u2019t trying to follow you, I just had something to tell you.\u201d\u201cThen, you should have said so in the first place. Why trail along silently?\u201d Carlton pressured him.Merchant Morrison flushed with embarrassment. \u201cYou two were having such a good time, it felt a bit\u2026weird to squeeze in\u2026\u201d\u201cA good time?\u201d\u201cThe atmosphere made it hard for me to talk. You guys were hugging and walking\u2013it was obviously a date\u2026 Ack!\u201dCarlton, flustered, poked the merchant with his knee.\u2018Atmosphere? A good time? I\u2019ve been suffering while being dragged around by Carlton\u2013in what way did that look like a good time? How on earth did he come to that misunderstanding? He\u2019s a good man, but he has no sense.\u2019 Luisen was dumbfounded, but he still wanted to listen to his explanation. \u201cWhat did you want to say to us?\u201d\u201cI saw you two at the mercenary guild earlier. It seems like you\u2019ve hunted a great deal of monsters\u2013I\u2019m sure you\u2019re experts at that. I wanted to commission you to escort our caravan.\u201d Morrison, as the leader of his caravan, had come down South after hearing rumors of a war brewing in the area. However, just as he was about to leave without anything to show for his journey, the mercenary he had found in Mittil collapsed from enteritis.They had to terminate the contract and procure new mercenaries. At that moment, he saw the two at the mercenary\u2019s guild; he wanted to commission them for escort service.Everyone wants to hire a talented hand. Clients often searched for reliable mercenaries independently from the guild-system.\u201cI\u2019d like to ask for an escort to take us, by ship, to the nearest city from this dock. They say there are monsters in the area.\u201d Morrison offered to provide everything necessary, including maintenance allowances, shipping fees, and boarding.\u201cWhen would you be leaving?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little abrupt. I\u2019m planning to leave tonight.\u201d\u201cAh, you\u2019re in a hurry.\u201dIf they\u2019re leaving tonight, then they would have to pack up immediately. However, the pay seemed so low compared to the urgency of the situation. A skilled mercenary wouldn\u2019t stand up for this sort of light payment\u2013only some middle-aged, washed-up sword might be moved. Morrison wouldn\u2019t want to hire someone subpar either, so he must have followed the two after they had left the mercenary\u2019s guild. Someone that\u2019s escorting a pilgrim must have some credibility and wouldn\u2019t be a random, rough-shod hired hand.It was understandable, then, for him to follow Carlton and Luisen.Luisen and Carlton exchanged glances.\u2018What do you think?\u2019\u2018If you\u2019re sure he\u2019s a merchant, then I believe it\u2019ll be fine. You can check his cover with the mercenary\u2019s guild.\u2019It was true Morrison\u2019s request was very tempting; the two could board a boat tonight. As soon as the two left the guild, they went to the port to inquire about a ship before coming to the shopping district. The ship departing tonight had been sold out, and the next available ship would depart two days later. There was a decrease in maritime operations in the aftermath of the war.They had looked into another ferry leaving tomorrow morning, but it wasn\u2019t the best option as that one was often preferred by the aristocracy. They were debating leaving Mittil and heading for another port city or perhaps secretly boarding one of the boats leaving tonight.\u2018This is a necessary commission.\u2019They\u2019d be able to earn money while progressing on the route they needed. Since Luisen had received help from this person before and the commission was very valuable, he wanted to view this meeting as fortuitious happenstance. If they uncover something suspicious, they can simply just turn down the request.\u201cWe\u2019ll check in with the mercenary\u2019s guild and contact you,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cYes, of course. But please give me your answer quickly. We\u2019re in a hurry\u2026\u201d Morrison disappeared quickly after finishing his business, saying he had a lot of work to do. There was no time to apologize to the man for misunderstanding him and nearly knocking him to the ground. Luisen thought the merchant was probably an eloquent conversationalist but was intimidated by his companion.It seems they still had business with the mercenary\u2019s guild.\u201cI\u2019ve said I tend to go a bit overboard, right?\u201d Carlton looked away, like a dog that knew he had done something wrong.***After checking in with the mercenary\u2019s guild, they confirmed that Morrison\u2019s affiliation and circumstances were as the man stated. Luisen had no idea in the previous timeline, but it seemed like the man belonged to a famous caravan. The guild also stated that the client was reliable and trustworthy.The pair informed Morrison, through the guild, that they would accept his commission. Then, they went to an inn they had scoped out in advance, washed up, and rested for. abrief moment. Since Carlton had already bought what they needed\u2013quite excitedly at that\u2013they didn\u2019t need to prepare any further. They had no difficulty getting ready to board the ship.The sun had slowly begun to decline. Before boarding the boat, Luisen and Carlton went to a well-known restaurant for dinner. After all, it was clear what kind of provisions would be available on the boat. The young lord aspired to eat plenty of decent food until then.As soon as the mercenary sat down in his seat, he said scarily, \u201cBring enough food to cram the table full.\u201dIt was a spacious table for four. Did he want to fill this entire thing up? For a moment, Luisen saw a halo behind Carlton\u2019s head. \u2018What does it matter if he\u2019s a freak obsessed with blood?\u2019 he thought, \u2018When he can make enough money to buy delicious food.\u2019As Luisen gazed upon the mercenary with adoration, Carlton puffed out his chest. \u201cLook. Wasn\u2019t it worth over-hunting all those monsters?\u201d\u201cYeah, of course. You\u2019re right.\u201d Luisen nodded and gave the mercenary a thumbs up. Carlton responded with a satisfied smile.Soon, the food came out and filled the large, four-person table. As a viral restaurant, each dish was gratifying and delicious. The bread was soft and moist; the roasted pork backbone was crispy and savory. The steak was seared crispy\u2013as if the outside were burnt\u2013but it was delcious as well. Luisen ate the scrumptious food\u2013the likes of wish he hadn\u2019t seen for a while\u2013and cleared the dishes.\u2018How long has it been since I tasted something this delicious? Until we arrived at Mittil, I ate food that we\u2019ve bought in advance at Confosse. It was better than raw Buried Old Hags, but the preserved food wasn\u2019t tasty either. We stopped by the inn there and ate stew, but the food there was like pig slop.\u2019Holding one end of the pork backbone in his hand, Luisen neatly bit off a strip of flesh with one bite and drank beer afterwards. The young lord\u2019s face was full of smiles, and his shoulders were shaking from joy.Carlton sipped at his beer and gave a content smile. Though the young lord was still neat, he ate passionately enough to show his sincere pleasure. That sight was so cute and fascinating; the young lord was a joy to watch.Faced with such pleasure, of course he couldn\u2019t hold back on buying things for the young lord. Carlton felt a different sense of pride than when he had bought supplies or clothes to wear for himself. He finally understood why his colleagues worked so hard to support their wives and children.\u201cYou\u2019ve got something there.\u201d Carlton took a napkin and gently wiped some sauce off of Luisen\u2019s cheeks. It was only then the young lord, who had been distracted by the food, noticed his comapnion. The mercenary sat there, smiling, with his eyes clothed; it was like he was looking at something he found adorable.\u2018Huh?\u2019 Luisen blinked, backbone still in his hand.\u201cKeep on eating. If it\u2019s lacking, do you want me to order some more?\u201d\u201cN-No\u2026\u201d\u2018What\u2019s this? Why is he looking at me like that?\u2019However, Luisen didn\u2019t think for too long. Now that he had returned to reality after being possessed by the desire for food, he could hear conversation next to him. The people sitting next to them were discussing something very interesting.\u201cThey say a\u00a0wizard\u00a0has appeared.\u201dA\u00a0wizard.In order to find the one-armed pilgrim\u2013without a name or a background\u2013Luisen had been searching for a\u00a0mage/wizard.\u00a0However, they weren\u2019t easy to find because they often didn\u2019t obey the laws of the world. And, they\u2019re saying one has appeared now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 68Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cYou know Lake Cabanil, right? There\u2019s a wizard out there that supposedly makes people\u2019s wishes come true.\u201d\u2018Ah, so they\u2019re saying the wizard isn\u2019t here?\u2019 Luisen was a little disappointed, but he kept the location, Lake Cabanil, in mind.Wizards were those who sought truth\u2013 enlightenment\u2013and utilized mysterious powers. They often did not follow logical rules of reality and were generally secluded from the public. Even Luisen, a great lord, had to endure a significant amount of bleeding from his wallets to find one.Though this information may be false, it would be best to remember it for later.Clank\u2013!Carlton slammed down his beer mug roughly. Luisen looked forward in surprise, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Carlton answered brusquely and gulped down his drink.\u2018Wasn\u2019t he happy until just a little while ago?\u2019 Luisen couldn\u2019t figure out why his companion was so upset. \u201cYou\u2019re alright?\u201dCarlton nodded sullenly.\u2018Well, then, if he says he\u2019s fine.\u2019 Luisen was somewhat bothered by the sudden shift in Carlton\u2019s attitude but felt that it would be strange to interrogate the mercenary further. So, the young lord moved onto another topic. \u201cDo you know where Lake Cabanil is?\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s in the center of the kingdom. It\u2019s west of the capital.\u201d\u201cWest\u2026 Then, will it overlap with our route?\u201d\u201cWho knows?\u201d Carlton replied in an unexpectedly half-hearted tone.This time, Luisen felt concerned. \u201cAre we not certain about our path forward?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll change depending on the situation. The area north of the river cannot even be compared with the South; it\u2019s not peaceful there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Really?\u201dCarlton\u2019s reasoning was sensible. The difficulty of the path ahead didn\u2019t seem to be the reason for the insincerity of his answer, though. However, Luisen was slow to pinpoint his companion\u2019s subtle feelings. \u201cI wish I could travel near Cabanil lake, even if we were to only pass by its surroundings.\u201dIf he was able to determine the authenticity of the information on the\u00a0wizard, then it would be easier to send people to summon them.Luisen didn\u2019t intend on chasing after the wizard instead of going to the capital. Though finding the one-armed pilgrim was an important goal, the priority would be to remove the sword of Damascus pointing at his neck. Even he had enough intelligence to prioritize what was truly important.\u201cHave you ever met a wizard?\u201d The young lord asked.Carlton looked at the young lord with raised, dark eyebrows and asked something unrelated to the question. \u201cAre you interested in the\u00a0wizard\u00a0because of the one-armed pilgrim?\u201d\u201cOf course. Why else would I need to find a wizard?\u201dIf the young lord had known his benefactor\u2019s name or face, he would have been able to find him through a duke\u2019s resources. Luisen\u2019s mood sank slightly\u2013he knew nothing about the one-armed pilgrim. \u201cI was too occupied with telling him about my backstory, so I didn\u2019t ask for his. I should have paid more attention to him,\u201d Luisen lamented.Carlton\u2019s intense eyes boiled as he watched his companion. \u2018So what if he\u2019s a pilgrim\u2013what\u2019s so good about him?\u2019He was in a very good mood up until a little while ago. When he wiped the sauce off of Luisen\u2019s cheek, the young lord was completely immersed with the mercenary. The noises from the background and the smell of food had disappeared\u2013the two exchanged deep glances as if they were the only two people left in this world.But as soon as the word \u2018wizard\u2019 had appeared, that bubble shattered. Luisen\u2019s attention was drawn to the one-armed pilgrim before Carlton could do anything. The young lord felt regret for the pilgrim, and the food no longer pleased him as much. Luisen\u2019s desire to see the pilgrim was so strong that easily won over his appetite.Knowing how obsessed the young lord was with food, Carlton\u2019s stomach churned even more. He caught monsters like crazy and visited famous restaurants all for Luisen, after all.\u2018But, you\u2019ll think of another man in front of me?\u2019 His heart ached; he wanted to beat up the pilgrim, perhaps, and remove his existence from Luisen\u2019s mind forever. \u2018Why was a guy like that the young lord\u2019s childhood hero? I would have been nicer to you if we met back then\u2013although, at that age, I wouldn\u2019t have dared to raise my head in front of the young lord\u2026\u2019The more Carlton thought, the angrier he became. \u201cDo you like that pilgrim so much?\u201d The mercenary\u2019s tone was laced with sarcasm\u2013the words came directly from his twisting insides.\u201cOf course I like him! He\u2019s my savior. I couldn\u2019t respect him enough.\u201d The sarcasm didn\u2019t work on Luisen. Rather, it confirmed the young lord\u2019s trusting and affectionate stance on the man. Carlton felt like someone had lifted him up and thrown him onto the ground. He couldn\u2019t quite understand why he felt this way, but the hurt within his heart made him say words he normally wouldn\u2019t voice. \u201cThat person, is he a real pilgrim? I think he\u2019s a fraud.\u201d\u201cWhat?! No. He had a pilgrim\u2019s pass, and\u2026\u2019\u201cHe could have picked it up somewhere, like I did. He could have stolen it as well. I\u2019m only saying this because the Duke only seems to see the good in people. The pilgrim\u2019s personality or what he\u2019s talked about\u2013you can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s a faithful believer just from that.\u201d This wasn\u2019t something Carlton had made up just because of his dirty mood. This was, in fact, something that he had been suspecting every time Luisen recited a touching anecdote about the one-armed pilgrim. Though bitterness seeped into his tone, Carlton couldn\u2019t help but think that the man\u2019s thought processes were similar to his own. Would someone like him be a true pilgrim? There\u2019s no chance.\u201cHe was a true saint,\u201d Luisen replied through clenched teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense. You weren\u2019t privy to his mercy and generous mission. Of course, his words and actions may be strange for someone that attends church, but his soul was nobler than anyone else\u2019s.\u201dAs soon as Carlton tried to stop him, Luisen interrupted Carlton, waving his fingertips in the air gently. That sight was so aristocratic\u2013the gesture had an unusual power to it.\u201cAny criticisms towards him should be targeted at me. I am who I am through his teachings. I won\u2019t stand anyone slandering him.\u201d Luisend clenched both fists and exhaled deeply and roughly. He was more furious than when he had learned about Ruger\u2019s betrayal.\u201cAre you mad at me because of that person?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cHa!\u201d\u2018You\u2019re getting mad at me when you weren\u2019t even this furious at that traitor Ruger? Is that pilgrim so precious to you?\u2019 Carlton felt wronged and frustrated. The mercenary felt more upset than when he\u2019d been falsely accused.The two, both offended, glared at each other across the table. After this deadlock confrontation continued for a while, an employee asked if it would be okay for them to clean the table. The two rose from their seats, wordlessly.***Luisen and Carlton arrived at the dock with Zephys. While boarding his luggage, Morrison rushed over to greet him.\u201cThank you so much for accepting my commission. If it weren\u2019t for you two, we wouldn\u2019t have had an escort\u2026\u201d Morrison\u2019s words were slurred. It seems like the cold atmosphere between the young lord and his mercenary had almost shut the merchant\u2019s mouth. \u201cMm, well, if you two are pretending to be on bad terms because of what I had said earlier, please don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s necessary. I\u2019m not so narrow-minded of a person to think that pilgrims shouldn\u2019t date or anything. After all, pilgrims are pilgrims and not priests.\u201d\u2018Just what kind of misunderstanding does this person have? I was already so uncomfortable from fighting with Carlton.\u2019 Luisen sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that at all.\u201d\u201cAhaha. Then, let\u2019s just go with that. Well then, please come aboard the ship.\u201d Morrison paid no attention to Luisen\u2019s denial.It was too tiring to clear the merchant\u2019s misunderstanding. The young lord was exhausted as he tried to board the ship while side-eyeing Carlton amidst their cold war.Morrison took the two men and guided them to their room. \u201cThere\u2019s only one room. This was originally intended to house mercenaries, so there are two beds. I ask for your kind understanding.\u201d\u2018Honestly, what\u2019s wrong with this person? We sleep on separate beds normally anyway.\u2019 Luisen glanced at Carlton. The mercenary was expressionless; the young lord\u2019s head was throbbing from the whiplash of constantly looking around.\u201cThe full-fledged escort will be joining us after we get off the ship. There shouldn\u2019t be anything too dangerous on board, but\u2026 Please just stay near us and check on our luggage every once in a while.\u201d Morrison told them where his own room was located and left to finish onboarding his belongings.\u2018Fine, it\u2019s probably best if you leave.\u2019 Luisen all too willingly sent Morrison away. But, he soon regretted that choice afterwards.The young Lord and Carlton\u2019s room was small enough that two beds filled the area. The young lord tried to stick his head against the wall to avoid looking at the mercenary.A stifling silence settled in the room. The two took turns giving each other sidelong glances. They never made eye contact, but it made them self-conscious to know that the other was looking at them.Of course, it would be best to speak up first. If he expressed some regret for their agitated conflict, then Carlton wouldn\u2019t be upset either. However, he didn\u2019t want to speak first. What did he do wrong? Carlton shouldn\u2019t have insulted the saint.\u2018How dare he call the saint a con-man, a fraud. He knows how much I admire that man.\u2019 Carlton was the only person Luisen had told about the one-armed pilgrim. The young lord couldn\u2019t reveal all the details, but he had said a lot. That\u2019s why he felt even more upset.Luisen wanted the mercenary to apologize first, but, by the looks of it, that wasn\u2019t going to happen. Carlton was expressionless\u2013Luisen had no idea what he was thinking.\u2018I can\u2019t do this.\u2019 Luisen jumped to his feet. \u2018I need to go out and get some fresh air. If I stay here, I\u2019ll explode.\u2019 With that thought, he exited the room.Carlton loyally followed after him. Luisen whirled around and glared at the mercenary. \u2018Why\u2019s he following me? I left because I didn\u2019t want to be around him.\u2019The young lord wanted to tell him not to follow him, but he felt like he\u2019d lose at that moment. So, he just turned around and headed for the deck. Whether or not the mercenary knew about the young lord\u2019s feelings, he continued to follow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The evening sun had almost finished its descent, and the skies and rivers were dyed red. The large river flowed calmly and silently. He watched the ship cut through the water as it progressed. He suddenly turned around \u2013 Mittil\u2019s port was growing distant at a steady pace. It was only then the fact that he was leaving the South had fully set in.The two had escaped those chasing them and managed to safely board the ship. After crossing the river, they would probably be a bit freer from the threat of pursuit. However, the young lord\u2019s heart felt complicated\u2013after all, he had finally returned to the comforts of his hometown after dying.\u2018It\u2019s not like I\u2019ll be gone forever, though, right? My situation is different from back then.\u2019Luisen took a sidelong glance at Carlton. The mercenary stood at an ambiguous distance; the two were neither standing together nor separately. This non-committal distance was filled with awkwardness.Carlton was looking far beyond the horizon on the river; his rigid gaze looked quite serious. Was it because the red glow of the sunset was beginning to subside? Luisen felt his chest squeeze tight. Occasionally, Carlton\u2019s distinctive sharp atmosphere made the young lord\u2019s heart flutter.If someone were to ask Luisen if he was still scared of his companion, the answer would be an easy no. Though the young lord had long suffered delusions of a black knight\u2013an illusory Carlton\u2013coming to kill him, the man had saved his life many times and watched over him. This feeling felt more like dizzying tension rather than fear. Even though he knew the mercenary wouldn\u2019t do anything to him, he still felt like he shouldn\u2019t let down his guard.Carlton turned and stared at the young lord; as soon as their eyes met, his brows furrowed.\u2018Ah, I\u2019ve been staring for two long\u2019 Luisen, embarrassed, quickly turned his head away. \u2018Carlton still seems very angry. What should I do if this continues?\u2019There\u2019s still a long way to go, and he wanted to get along with Carlton in the capital.\u2018Look\u2026 We\u2019ll have to reconcile this someway, somehow\u2026 how do I\u2026 begin reconciliation?\u2019 For the shallow relationships Luisen managed to procure in the previous timeline, one side or the other usually knelt down whenever there was a problem. Before his unfortunate midnight escape, others knelt down to the young lord; after the escape, Luisen had been the one to kneel.\"\"\u2018I can\u2019t imagine Carlton kneeling before me\u2026\u2019It was the mercenary who insulted the one-armed pilgrim first, so he probably wouldn\u2019t kneel first.\u2018What to do\u2026\u2019 While contemplating, Luisen heard a welcome voice.\u201cSo, this is where you are!\u201d Morrison approached them. \u201cIf you have nothing to do, please come with me. I\u2019d like to introduce you to my family.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Luisen didn\u2019t even ask for the mercenary\u2019s opinion and accepted the invite. Carlton frowned, but the young lord turned a blind eye.He felt suffocated being alone with the mercenary, and he wanted to talk with Morrison, a former benefactor. As Luisen followed the merchant, Carlton followed as well. \u2018So, you\u2019re still going to follow me, huh?\u2019 Luisen released a deep sigh. \u201cWhat is the name of the caravan that Mr Morrison\u2019s works under\u2026?\u201d\u201cNakatan caravan. You probably don\u2019t know about it\u2013we generally focus on the upper region. We\u2019ve never had a need to come down South. At least, until now.\u201d\u201cWhat is your main merchandise?\u201d\u201cFabrics.\u201dLuisen asked Morrison various things about his caravan. He wanted to know more in order to repay the merchant for the help he had received, once the young lord was able to restore his former status. Neither the caravan nor his merchandise was particularly grande nor unique.\u2018It\u2019s a little too iffy to connect business dealings with the city at the duchy castle itself\u2026It\u2019d be best to connect him with a village within the duchy instead.\u2019While conversing, they soon arrived at Morrison\u2019s room. The man\u2019s room was equipped with a small table; another room was attached to the initial one. The rest of the merchants\u2019 colleagues were already gathered there\u2013one woman and three men. Although they were at various stages in life, they all had the same atmosphere. As merchants that needed to travel around, they seemed quite strong and fit.\u201cThese people are the ones I talked about earlier.\u201d Morrison introduced his colleagues to the young lord and his companion. Luisen greeted them as befitting a pilgrim, and Carlton nodded curtly.\u201cI\u2019m glad you two could come. You can\u2019t believe how flustered I was when the previous mercenaries said they couldn\u2019t come\u2026 Ah, would you like a drink? Please sit down.\u201dThe merchant\u2019s colleagues readily welcomed the two. They handed over chairs and filled empty glasses with wine. The mercenary refused and stood against the wall. Once again, Luisen stole a glance at the mercenary. Luisen felt a bit guilty and dispirited\u2013the other was in a bad mood and he still dragged the mercenary here.\u201cThere\u2019s not much going on in the South or on this boat, but it\u2019ll be different when we land on shore. Not only are there monsters, but bandits never left as well.\u201d\u201cIs the security up North so sad?\u201d\u201cYes, there are many places where the ruling lord had either died or a moron had been left in charge. Monsters are definitely a headache, yes, but free-lance mercenaries have turned into bandits and begun to rob travelers\u2019 pockets.\u201dIt was common for mercenaries who were unable to obtain money legally to turn to thievery. The mercenaries\u2019 guild had been formed to try and stopgap the situation, but they couldn\u2019t control all the outlaws. Luisen opened his ears wide, listening to the merchants reminisce upon their travels.\u201cThere\u2019s no place in this world where you can leisurely travel without fear. I had heard that things were better down South, but\u2026 Supposedly, the Duke of Anies, one of the Great Lords, was kidnapped. According to one of the rumors.\u201dLuisen was appalled at Morrison\u2019s words. Why this again? Though the young lord felt embarrassed, he was curious about what other rumors were flying around. \u201cRumors?\u201d\u201cYes, well. Some purport that it wasn\u2019t a kidnapping, and that they eloped for love.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d It was so absurd that Luisen\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but gape wide open. It was fortunate that his expression wasn\u2019t revealed due to the hood. If not, the others may have become suspicious of his over-the-top surprise.\u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of nonsense like that. Carlton\u2019s nickname is the aristocrat butcher; he wouldn\u2019t have run away with a noble man. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s more likely that\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Luisen strongly denied. Carlton glared at the young lord. The mercenary\u2019s anger was so piercing the back of the young lord\u2019s head felt hot. Morrison had unknowingly dealt a blow to both Luisen and Carlton.\u201cIn anycase, we\u2019ve been harassed\u2013at checkpoints\u2013so much because of that rumor. In a way, I envy you, revered Pilgrim. With that pass, who would dare stop you?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, could I take a look at your pilgrim pass?\u201d\u201cYes, well. If it\u2019s only looking\u2026 Please return it to me though.\u201d Luisen was fine with showing off the pass\u2013he was just so glad that the topic had changed. Morrison used candlelight to view the pass.Morrison gawked at the brilliant silver. \u201cThis is genuine. Where did you get this?\u201d\u201cAt the church, of course.\u201d\u201cAh yes. It is a pilgrim\u2019s pass after all. I was wondering where you started your pilgrimage.\u201d\u201cAh, is that what you meant? I started in the northwest region.\u201d Luisen kept his words vague; it wasn\u2019t unusual for pilgrims to hide their origins.\u201cThe northwest. When did you come down south? If you\u2019re ignorant of the situation back home, then you must have been in the South for a long while. Did you two meet here? Or were you together from the beginning of your journey?\u201d Though he felt like the merchant was interrogating him, Luisen answered sincerely.\u201cI escaped South as a refugee, so I have been down here for a long while. We met at Confosse.\u201d\u201cConfosse, huh? It\u2019s not too far from here, but you became intimate quite quickly.\u201d\"\"\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you travel. When you rely on each other, your affection naturally grows,\u201d Carlton stated.Morrison alternated looking between Luisen and Carlton. Somehow the gaze was so enthusiastic\u2026 it gave the young lord goosebumps. \u201cWe\u2019re not like that.\u201d\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d\u2018Honestly, this guy doesn\u2019t listen well. Does he just like romance stories?\u2019 Luisen\u2019s impression of the man changed from a good person to a strange and delusional person.\u2018Rather than helping with his business, do I need to introduce him to a lover\u2026?\u2019Thankfully, though, that topic ended there. Luisen had a long talk with Morrison and his colleagues. If it weren\u2019t for the merchant\u2019s ridiculous delusion, Morrison was a pleasant and loquacious conversationalist.Carlton continued to lean against the wall and watch the scene quietly. \u2018\u2026Damn it.\u2019Though the mercenary\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, his insides were roiling. Luisen smiled throughout the conversation, but, whenever their eyes met, his face would become rigid. The young lord tried to avoid eye contact as well and wouldn\u2019t talk to Carlton.Though Carlton had been horrible to Luisen when they first met, the young lord had never ignored him this much.The mercenary realized he really made a mistake. \u2018Ha, fuck. Why did I say that?\u2019Frankly, he understood that he acted childishly. Who would like it when another called a person they respected a fraud? He knew that it wasn\u2019t something he should have said in that situation, but he was blind back then. \u2018And why\u2019s that guy being so clingy?\u2019Morrison slowly narrowed the distance between him and the young lord as they clinked their glasses together. For some reason, Luisen liked Morrison, so the young lord was taking that as mere friendly behavior. \u2018If someone approached me when I\u2019m already on my last nerves, anxious about followers? I wouldn\u2019t let my guard down for one minute.\u2019Carlton grit his teeth. \u2018He doesn\u2019t want to make eye contact with me but is perfectly willing to laugh along with that guy.\u2019At that moment, Carlton locked gazes with Morrison. The merchant stared blatantly at the mercenary before turning back to Luisen. For some reason, that trivial action caught at the mercenary\u2019s senses. At a surface glance, there was nothing suspicious about this man\u2013he was a friendly, affable merchant.\u2018I don\u2019t like that punk.\u2019 Carlton narrowed his eyes and fiddled with the handle of his sword. He couldn\u2019t tell whether the man simply annoyed him or if the mercenary was annoyed because the man was pretending to be friendly with the young lord. Carlton couldn\u2019t read his heart at all. However, he was certain that he had to do something about the current situation.Luisen was incredibly angry at him; meanwhile, a dubious man might take a seat next to the young lord. And\u00a0*that*\u00a0didn\u2019t sit right with the mercenary. Who knows where the one-armed pilgrim may be, but, right now, Morrison was in his sights.***TL: I wonder if Carlton realizes his own jealousy\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as they returned to the room, Carlton said, a bit intimidatingly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dLuisen blinked, bewildered. \u2018He wasn\u2019t mad?\u2019 Luisen wondered. \u201cWhy the sudden apology?\u201d\u201cMy duke, you were angry I called your benefactor a fraud.\u201d\u201cSure, at first, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou ignored me.\u201d\u201cI did?\u201d\u201cOn the deck.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you were angry first, wasn\u2019t it? If you weren\u2019t mad, why did you glare at me like that in Morrison\u2019s room? You even ignored the chair I placed for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Isn\u2019t that guy, Morrison, a bit strange?\u201d Carlton couldn\u2019t say that he was jealous, so instead, he turned the conversation around. Besides, his words weren\u2019t without merit. That man was weird in many ways.Luisen agreed, nodding, \u201cA little.\u201dApart from being grateful to Morrison, the young lord realized the merchant was a bit strange. \u2018So, Carlton\u2019s upset because Morrison kept on misunderstanding our relationship!\u2019 He convinced himself. \u2018Of course my companion would hate that. I was quite popular in the old days though, so this does give me a bitter taste in my mouth.\u2019\u201cIn any case, I apologize. My words were too harsh. Of course you\u2019d get angry if I insulted someone you admire.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m sorry I yelled at you in the restaurant. Actually, I was only angry at that moment; none of my anger lingered.\u201dIn fact, Luisen was more melancholic than angry when the mercenary called the one-armed pilgrim a fraud. He was being childish\u2013he desperately wanted the other to also respect the person he admired.\u201cLet\u2019s make peace?\u201d Luisen reached out this hand. \u2018Is this the right way to do it?\u2019Carlton grabbed the young lord\u2019s hand without hesitation. Copying something he\u2019d seen somewhere, Luisen embraced him and patted him on the back.\u2018Alright. That was an excellent reconciliation. I guess issues can be solved without one person kneeling to another, huh?\u2019 Luisen felt incredibly proud from learning something new. \u201cCome to think of it, you do have reasons to be suspicious. I also had some doubts when I saw you had a pilgrim\u2019s pass as well. I wonder if he really was a pilgrim.\u201dCarlton couldn\u2019t have been the only one in the world who happened upon a pilgrim\u2019s pass illegitimately. The pre-regression timeline\u2019s kingdom was in a chaotic situation; it would have been easier to pretend to be a pilgrim during that time.Because doubts had alrighty taken seed in the young lord\u2019s mind, the mercenary\u2019s words had a greater effect. Luisen said, \u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not he\u2019s a true pilgrim. Whether or not he\u2019s a conman.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s a fraud?\u201d Carlton was taken aback.\u201cHe saved me from death and opened my eyes to the larger world through his teachings. The fact that he is my benefactor and savior doesn\u2019t change.\u201dWords can be crafted at any time. However, it\u2019s hard to keep up consistent behavior.\u201cHe had obtained medicine for me even on stormy days. In the winter, he yielded the area in front of the fireplace for me. He always gave me half of his food whenever we had scrounged up something to eat. I\u2019ll believe in his actions. That being the case, he\u2019s someone I like, so please don\u2019t insult him in front of me. Understand?\u201dWhoever the one-armed pilgrim was, he was eternally Luisen\u2019s saint. Regardless of anyone\u2019s opinion. \u201cOnce again, he\u2019s someone I like, so no more insults!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s sleep now. I\u2019m tired.\u201d Luisen slipped out of his clothes and dove into bed.Carlton stood, dumbfounded, for a while. Who does the young lord like? He felt a chill in his chest, as if the cold river breeze had enveloped him. They had apologized to each other and made up. Still, he felt a strong, lingering sense of defeat.***The night passed, and the morning light arrived. Luisen woke, a little late, and rubbed at his eyes. At first, he rushed to start moving before realizing he could stretch out and be languid on his bed. It was great to be on the move without having to walk.Luisen rolled his body up in the blankets before his eyes found Carlton. He was sitting at the edge of the bed, with a complicated, contemplative expression on his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you? Did you sleep at all?\u201d the young lord asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Carlton replied absentmindedly.The ship traveled peacefully. They ate in the on-board restaurant, looked around the cargo, took a walk on the deck, and spent time playing card games with Morrison.All the people on board were merchants like Morrison and their employed mercenaries. Luisen took his absentminded companion to the eatery and ate\u2013as expected, the food was pretty tasteless.After eating, they strolled around and, falling into a routine, went to the cargo hold to see if Morrison\u2019s luggage was intact. This time around, the merchant and his crew also joined in on their day and boisterously played card games nearby.Though the young lord thought that the boat ride would be boring, the ship ride was actually rather pleasant. Because the passengers were mostly professionals, no one was particularly self-indulgent or rowdy. Most of them quietly spent time within their own groups.The time flowed by at a leisurely pace. Luisen loved this relaxed mood.As they were in the middle of a river, the fear that someone would pop out and stab or bite him from the back had vanished. They\u2019ll float peacefully for three days. He was anticipating that.However, those anticipations were dashed far too soon.It was time for dinner, and the passengers flocked to the on-board restaurant. Luisen commented to his companions that it was a shame the meals on board were disappointing and how regretful his meal at the famous restaurant in Mittil was cut short.At that moment, someone stumbled into the restaurant. His slow and unsteady steps\u2013like a person suffering from muscle pain\u2013attracted everyone\u2019s attention; the entryway was entirely blocked.\u201cHey you! Hurry up and move!\u201d A mercenary, who was waiting to enter the restaurant, got annoyed and slapped the man on the back. He had hit the man very lightly, but the man fell forward with a thud. \u201cW-What?!\u201dThe fallen man did not rise again. Bewildered, the mercenary looked at the man and shouted, \u201cThis man is dead!\u201d\u201dWhat? What are you saying?\u201d The people in the restaurant exploded with interest. A group of fellow mercenaries approached. At first, everyone had thought that the shouting man was spouting nonsense; however, the fallen man stood up again. This time, though, his neck had been turned completely around. Only then could the people present clearly see what it was.It was a corpse.A corpse was moving.\u201cArgh! Aaaaaaackkk!\u201d The muscular\u2013almost mountain-sized\u2013mercenaries screamed as if they were going to faint. In the blink of an eye, Carlton jumped across the table, wrapped his arm around Luisen\u2019s shoulder, and unsheathed his sword. The restaurant became a pandemonium.\u201cGroooannn\u201d\u00a0 The moving corpse was incredibly slow. It simply ambled about; it didn\u2019t really try to threaten those present. Soon afterwards, the mercenaries, returning to their senses, ushered the corpse into a far corner.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cHuh? This person\u2013isn\u2019t this person from the Allos Caravan?\u201d Someone had recognized the corpse.Simultaneously, Luisen finally noticed the moving corpse. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a Ghoul?\u201d\u201cA Ghoul? Like the ones from stories?\u201dSupposedly these were caused by souls that have suffered after the original person died an unjust death\u2013the body starts to move as if it were alive. That existence was called a Ghoul. Since the body was once a living being, public opinion was divided on whether or not a Ghoul should be considered a monster. People were also divided on the origin of these beings\u2013spontaneous generation? Natural occurrence? Evolution? Curse? Epidemic? Even in the future, nothing had been confirmed.Luisen was of the opinion that it was a curse or an epidemic rather than supporting the theory of natural occurrence or the after-effects of a wronged soul. If all people who were wronged became ghouls, shouldn\u2019t everyone at the duchy become a ghoul and chase after the young lord?In any case, Ghouls weren\u2019t threatening monsters. It was gruesome to see corpses amble about, but these things were too slow and weak to attack properly.\u201cIsn\u2019t there a lot of those up North? Specifically in the Northern Regions?\u201d In the previous timeline, while living as a nomad, Luisen had encountered many Ghouls. It wasn\u2019t common, but the monsters weren\u2019t unusual either.\u201cWhat are you talking about? If those things were common, it wouldn\u2019t be the nobles who\u2019d run the kingdom. It\u2019d be the Priests.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dCarlton was shocked at Luisen\u2019s tranquil nonchalance. \u2018Was this person always this bold?\u2019 While the two talked, the mercenaries succeeded in tying up the Ghoul\u2019s hands and feet. Perfectly timed, someone from the Allos caravan rushed in. \u201cT-This\u2026 How did this\u2026\u201d\u201cHey you! What the hell happened?!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the leader of your caravan? Come out and explain yourselves!\u201dThe surrounding people began to rebuke the man; in response, the man hesitated for a moment before closing his eyes and explaining all that had happened.The ghoul here was a servant from the Allos Caravan that had died early this morning. Last night, after the ship sailed, the man had collapsed from a high fever. At the time, the members of the caravan were suffering from the enteritis pandemic that plagued Mittil. However, contrary to their expectations, it wasn\u2019t enteritis, and the man\u2019s condition continued to deteriorate until he finally died at dawn.\u201cHonestly, if that were the case, then we should have turned the boat around! Why did you hide it?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 We\u2019d suffer a huge loss if the boat turned around\u2026\u201dIf the boat returned back to port because of the Allos caravan, the caravan would have to take responsibility for all the merchants and mercenaries on board. They had already lost a lot of money in the venture in the South\u2013they had hushed up the situation because they were reluctant to lose more.\u201cWhere\u2019s your leader? We\u2019re already in the middle of a crisis\u2013what is he doing?\u201d\u201cOur boss is also down with a high fever.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAll the people from our caravan have collapsed.\u201d\u201cWait a minute. So, it\u2019s an infectious disease?\u201dAn infectious disease.At that one word, everyone fled from the man from the Allos caravan and the Ghoul. In an instant, the restaurant was filled with an air of anxiety and fear.The people on the boat all shared the same destiny before they landed at their destination. Everyone ate the same food, drank the same water, and shared same space. That meant that, in this situation, no one here could escape the spread of the disease.News of the epidemic spread quickly. They were in the middle of the large river, so people couldn\u2019t get off the boat. The pleasant and comfortable ship\u2013the floating bedroom that gently cut through the river currents\u2013quickly became a moving prison.TL: Just do it Carlton, admit your jealousy~ I wanna see how Luisen reacts!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ghouls were quite unpleasant, but they weren\u2019t a major threat in and of themselves. Rather, it was more alarming to hear that the other members of the Allos Caravan, who had stayed with the dead man, also showed the same symptoms.\u201cIt\u2019s an infectious disease! An epidemic!\u201d The people ran out of the restaurant. They fell into panic and acted as if they would kill the ghoul and the other members of the caravan.Luisen and Carlton also slipped away from the restaurant\u2013 they wanted to avoid being swept away by the panicking mob. After all, infectious diseases were like invisible envoys; they had no choice but to be even more scared. Who knows when the sickle of death would cut down someone\u2019s life. Those that believed the epidemic was a curse tried to cling to Luisen, who dressed as a pilgrim. If Carlton hadn\u2019t blocked them with his body and moved quickly, Luisen would be ensnared within their grasp.Carlton pushed Luisen into his room and locked the door. Moving corpses, infectious diseases, people rushing to the young lord to request a prayer\u2026 it was all too overwhelming.He was certain that the young lord would have been alarmed as well. Carlton turned to the young lord to try and appease him, but Luisen had taken the initiative to take off his robe. Contrary to his expectations, the young lord was tranquil and calm; he wasn\u2019t frightened at all.\u201cYou should also quickly disrobe,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201dThough we didn\u2019t come into contact with him, we still saw the ghoul and the person from the Allos caravan. It\u2019d be safer to change out of your outerwear,\u201d Luisen stated with conviction. Although the mercenary didn\u2019t understand the relationship between an infectious disease and his coat, he still did as he was told and placed his coat in a bag.Next, Luisen poured out water and washed his hands. \u201cYou should wash your hands as well.\u201dCarlton haphazardly washed his hands. Luisen looked so calm it was strange.\u201cDon\u2019t do it like that \u2013 do it properly.\u201d The young lord held the mercenary\u2019s hand and rubbed it to create soap bubbles before rubbing insistently. Luisen\u2019s soft palms embraced and rubbed at Carlton\u2019s hands. From the man\u2019s palm, hardened with calluses, to the tender flesh in between the fingers, Luisen rubbed his companion\u2019s hands thoroughly.Carlton unconsciously blushed at the sliding sensation. At the sight of Luisen\u2019s white, long fingers entangled in his rough ones, he suddenly felt dizzy for no reason. However, the young lord was careful\u2013like someone washing their dog\u2019s paws; he had no ulterior motives. The mercenary coughed, embarrassed, \u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\u201cThis is what you\u2019re supposed to do. It\u2019s a precaution.\u201dThat\u2019s what everyone did in the future. Luisen wiped Carlton\u2019s hands with a clean cloth and discarded the water.\u201cYou\u2019re very calm. I thought you\u2019d be more surprised,\u201d the mercenary said.Luisen shrugged. Whenever the kingdom underwent a crisis, horrible things were sure to follow. Before his regression, a large variety of diseases became very prevalent throughout the land. Moreover, a great number of those diseases were highly contagious. Except for the South, he had wandered throughout the kingdom and heard many rumors and information about the diseases. And, thanks to following the one-armed pilgrim, the young lord had gathered a lexicon of knowledge about this matter.The various things he had experienced during his nomadic life had allowed the young lord to maintain his calm. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about this plague. I\u2019ve never caught such a disease.\u201dLuisen wasn\u2019t afraid of infectious diseases. His long wandering and hunger had weakened his stamina and ruined his body; he had obsessively worried about contagions, but he was still somehow fine.He had even passed through an infectious village; he had even ridden the same carriage with a contagious person. However, he had never been infected. He couldn\u2019t tell if it was because his body was particularly good or because he had been blessed by a high-ranking member of the church as soon as he was born. The young lord was certain, though, that his body was more robust than it looked. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never had to worry about getting sick either. I\u2019ve never been sick in my entire life.\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s a relief.\u201dLuisen had heard rumors, in the past, that Carlton had fallen to an infectious disease\u2026or that he had run away from the plague in fear. Although he really couldn\u2019t confirm the veracity of his companion\u2019s statement, it was fortunate that they wouldn\u2019t need to huddle inside the room, trembling with fear. \u201cMore than that, I\u2019m worried about the ship. What do you think will happen? Will the boat still continue on its path? Do you think it\u2019ll turn around and go back to Mittil?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to the captain, but\u2026 We\u2019re probably not returning to Mittil. I believe matters become complicated when things like profits are involved.\u201dBesides, it would be best for them to proceed\u2013the two didn\u2019t want to return anyway.\u201cI believe we\u2019ll arrive at our destination as scheduled. Since the price of our tickets was\u00a0 cheap, the captain will try to reduce damage to his profit margin as much as possible.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the issue, though. The ship may not be able to dock at the port.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Luisen\u2019s eyes opened wide. He hadn\u2019t even thought of that possibility.\u201cThe infectious disease could spread, after all. Our destination city can refuse entry. In the worst scenario, the ship may not be able to dock anywhere and will be forced to wander down the river.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not good!\u201d The worst scenario for Luisen and Carlton would be being stranded over water. With Ruger chasing from behind, a long road ahead, and the king possibly dying at any minute, it would be disastrous to have their feet tied while aboard ship!\u00a0 \u201cThen, what should we do? We can\u2019t waste time.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll either take a smaller boat and escape or pray that the disease isn\u2019t contagious.\u201d\u201cAhh\u2026\u201d Luisen hung his head. Why, of all boats, did this have to happen here?\u201cIf this disease originated on Mittil, this would be a problem for other ships as well. Perhaps the other ships that depart after this one would not be able to set sail at all.\u201d Carlton consoled the young lord, but the soothing words didn\u2019t reach his heart.Luisen sat, arms crossed, and began to wander back through his memories. \u2018What kind of diseases were prevalent this year\u2026?\u2019A few candidates for the outbreak came to mind, but he wasn\u2019t sure if they matched the disease plaguing the Allos caravan. After all, he had never seen the diseased up close. The young lord was too busy with his own matters to even see the ghouls properly. \u201cWhether it is ghouls or the sick, I believe I\u2019ll be able to judge what happened if I were to observe them\u2026 It\u2019s possible that I may know the cure.\u201d\"\"\u201cMy Duke?\u201dLuisen nodded and steeled his resolve. \u201cLet\u2019s return to the restaurant. The man from the caravan and the ghoul should still be there. We should hear more from them and see if we can meet the rest of the members. What do you say? If you\u2019re uncomfortable, I\u2019ll meet them alone.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going back there?\u201d Carlton contemplated knocking the young lord out and escaping the ship with him. No matter how healthy he may be, the mercenary was reluctant to let him meet a corpse and the sick during a possible epidemic. However, Luisen was ready to do this all alone.\u2018Just what is he thinking\u2026?\u2019Though Luisen\u2019s head may be pretty and round, the mercenary had zero idea what was going on inside; the mercenary\u2019s own head was throbbing. Generally, the young lord was docile, but sometimes he was determined to do something crazy.Considering Luisen\u2019s dismal academic records, it was obvious that he would be ignorant in specialized fields such as medicine. However, the young lord seemed confident, and the mercenary was well aware that the young lord had surprising insights at times. Luisen always had a reason when he was stubborn and often produced positive results.\u2018It looks like he has faith in himself\u2026 And I can deal with any conflicts with people should they arise\u2026Besides, it\u2019s not like he\u2019ll listen if I tell him not to go\u2026\u2019Ignorant of all of the scary happenstances, Luisen made it a habit to do all sorts of strange things. This was a man who would secretly do whatever he wanted unless his hands and feet were tied and body imprisoned. In this perilous world, wasn\u2019t he the only one that could take care of Luisen? After much consideration, Carlton made his decision.\u201cWhere in the world would I go without my Duke?\u201d Carlton said bluntly.Luisen, used to the mercenary\u2019s prickly way of speaking, just laughed. The mercenary i\u2019s all bark and no bite.The two returned to the restaurant. This time, they covered their noses and mouths with cloth and wore gloves. The mercenary had no idea how any of these methods could help, but he just followed the young lord\u2019s orders.***As expected, because most of the onboard residents ran away from this area, the restaurant was empty. Instead of a crowd, there stood a ghoul, the man from the Allos caravan, and an unexpected person\u2013Morrison.Morrison, like the young lord and his companion, covered his nose and mouth with cloth; with gloves on, he used a long rod to push the ghoul into a corner. The man from the Allos caravan wept as he observed this scene.\u201cMr. Morrison?\u201d\u201cYou two. Didn\u2019t you two return to your room? Did something happen?\u201d\u00a0 Morrison reacted rather sharply. It seemed like the man was especially sensitive due to the unexpected crisis. He was like a fox wary of his surroundings.\u201cYes, well, there was something I wanted to check so I\u2019ve returned. What about you?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cWhile passing by, this person looked like he was troubled. Even if he may be a ghoul now, we can\u2019t ignore that he was a human before. I\u2019ve come here to help him.\u201d\u2018This was definitely Morrison-like. I\u2019m only calm because I know the future; Morrison is ignorant and yet has come forward to help.\u2019 Luisen\u2019s heart felt tugged as he reminisced on the merchant\u2019s warmth in the previous timeline as he handed the young lord a boat ticket.\u2018Though that man may entertain all sorts of strange misunderstandings and delusions\u2013he\u2019s a kind and gentle person, through and through.\u2019\u201cWe\u2019ll help as well,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cAh, I\u2019d appreciate that. I thought about pushing the ghoul into an empty, unused storage room.\u201d\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just hit it in the neck?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cWell, he could get up after a while and start to move again\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019d be best to cremate it, but it\u2019s best not to light a fire on a boat. Though the ghoul may not necessarily be dangerous, it is unsightly and presents hygiene issues\u2026 It\u2019s best to lock him up somewhere. It doesn\u2019t have the intelligence to open the door.\u201d Luisen nodded, admiring Morrison\u2019s wealth of knowledge.Carlton, however, felt differently. \u201cYou must know a lot about ghouls\u2013they aren\u2019t common though. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever seen such a thing.\u201d\u201cThose who are in the know, know. Reverend Pilgrim also seems to know a lot about these beings\u2013he must know a lot of things.\u201d Morrison responded with an affable smile Carlton felt that Morrison\u2019s words had an edge to them somehow. What an unsettling man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72\u2018I\u2019d like to dig a little more out of him, but\u2026\u2019But\u2026Carlton\u2019s companion liked Morrison\u2013even now, the young lord was smiling as if he had been praised. So, Carlton decided to give up for now.\u201cCan you say a prayer before we lock him up, Revered Pilgrim?\u201d Morrison requested Luisen.\u201cOf course. Though, since I\u2019m not a priest, it won\u2019t have much of an effect\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. You\u2019re not a priest. However, what matters is the thought.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t too difficult to pray, so Luisen stepped forward. Morrison held the ghoul at bay with a stick; Carlton stood by the young lord\u2019s side, ready to protect the young lord by clearing away threats at any time.Luisen looked at the ghoul properly for the first time in his life. Its darkened complexion, drained of flowing blood, and its bulging rotten-fish-like eyes really pinpointed clearly the fact that it was a corpse and not a living being. Despite the fact that the lord had seen many dead bodies before, it still wasn\u2019t a pleasant sight. However, something caught his eye.There was a rash behind its ears and the area in which the jaw and neck connected. Strangely, though, the rash wasn\u2019t the standard red color but a yellowish green.\u2018Green?\u2019Had something been smudged onto the corpse? Luisen took out a handkerchief and rubbed at its skin.\u2018Ah, it\u2019s not coming off.\u2019\"\"\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Carlton, startled by Luisen\u2019s eccentric behavior, grabbed the young lord\u2019s wrist and pulled him away. He took the handkerchief from the young lord\u2019s hand and flung it far away\u2013like it was a bundle of germs. Luisen exclaimed at the sudden movement.Even the members of the Allos caravan and Morrison were viewing the young lord strangely.\u201cIt looked like something was on its skin\u2026\u201d Luisen said futilely.The mercenary cautiously looked underneath the ghoul\u2019s chin, where Luisen had been rubbing. \u201cThere are some discolored spots underneath its chin. Was that always there?\u201d\u201cNo, he never had something like a mole before\u2026 Ah, you\u2019re right! There\u2019s a green spot there\u2026 Is that something weird?\u201d asked the man from the Allos caravan, a bit dumbly.\u201cIn the first place, a person\u2019s blood is red, so most spots are red, dark red, or brown. Never green. After all, People aren\u2019t plants or trees. Were there spots like this on the other people?\u201d Carlton replied with a sneer.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cYou really have no idea? Does that make sense? This thing is green, not red\u2013how could you not notice it? Are you perhaps hiding things deliberately? Should I go ask this question to others?\u201dAt Carlton\u2019s intimidating aura, the man from the Allos caravan whimpered. \u201cOur party collapsed all at once; do you think I\u2019d have time to observe anything? There\u2019s even a moving corpse! And, if a dead body were to move\u2026wouldn\u2019t it be understandable that the skin might be bruised blue or green?\u201d\u00a01\u201cSo you say.\u201d Carlton said casually, as if he couldn\u2019t understand why the other was angry.\u00a0\u201cAre you asking me?\u201d Carlton asked, shrugging at the Allos merchant\u2019s protests.On the other hand, the man looked at the mercenary with a dumbfounded expression. Luisen fell into deep thought, undisturbed by the fuss happening around him. He was used to this sort of behavior from Carlton.\u2018A green spot\u2026green\u2026 It\u2019s unnatural\u2026\u2019 Something was on the tip of his tongue, but no matter how the young lord rifled through his memories, no answer appeared. Luisen wracked through his head for dear life. \u2018I feel like if I just look at it a bit more, something will come to mind.\u2019\"\"However, the ghoul\u2019s body had already begun to decompose. The skin peeking through the clothes had already begun to turn black; looking at something like that would be meaningless. He steeled his resolve; he would have to meet the members of the caravan that were showing similar symptoms to the dead man.Morrison looked at the still and rigid young lord and asked, \u201cDo you have any theories about this disease?\u201d\u201cAh, no,\u201d Luisen said evasively. The issue was just too critical for him to voice his half-formed, unclear hypotheses. Luisen cleared his throat, \u201cAhem. Let\u2019s pray for the dead.\u201dLuisen cleared his mind and gathered his hands together. Everyone put their hands together to pray except for Carlton, who was pressing down on the ghoul with a stick to keep it immobile.The sounds of people trying to escape and the low tone of prayers echoed throughout the empty restaurant. Luisen\u2019s voice was calm and enunciated clearly, soothing his audience\u2019s minds. The man from the Allos caravan echoed the prayer earnestly. He knew that pilgrims had no power\u2013they were different from priests\u2013but they prayed that a miracle would happen and that the dead would be able to rest in peace.There was no miracle after the prayer. The ghoul wouldn\u2019t understand the prayer made specifically for it; it simply wandered around while flinging its arms. The man from the caravan sobbed at that sight.Carlton was the one who directed the ghoul into the storeroom. He simply corrected its directionless wanderings with a stick, so it went into the room on its own. It was exactly as Luisen had explained\u2013despite its horrible appearance, the ghoul was weak. For some reason, this experience reminded the mercenary of the time he pushed a colt into a stable.Meanwhile, Luisen stood by the person from the caravan and soothed him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be alright,\u201d he said.After much reassurance, the man finally regained composure, \u201cThank you so much. Really\u2013thank you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so sorry this has happened to you. Everyone here has joined forces to pray to the Lord Almighty for peace for that man\u2019s soul. Now, God shall take care of it.\u201d\u201cNgh, Hngh, Yes. I suppose so. I hope so\u2026\u201d Overwhelmed by emotion, the man from the Allos caravan clamped his mouth shut.Luisen, cautiously so that the others wouldn\u2019t hear the awkwardness he felt, asked, \u201cI heard that the other members of the caravan have collapsed. Is that true?\u201d\u201cT-That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWe need to gain an understanding of the situation in order to act accordingly. I\u2019m not trying to pin blame on you.\u201d\u201c\u2026What\u2019s the point of poking around now? That\u2019s right\u2013everyone has collapsed except for me\u2026 This is probably an epidemic.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026I-I really have no idea what to do\u2026!\u201d The guilt made the man stay up all night; right now, confessions poured out as if he had rushed to the church first thing in the morning.He introduced himself as Cullen. Cullen was originally hired as a servant for the caravan; actually, he was a handyman who cleaned up after the members. He had no authority and no say in their peddling. However, everyone else had collapsed, and he was the only one left.Taking care of the sick, handling the ghoul, and hiding the disease\u2026During his struggles, the ghoul escaped, and the truth behind this supposed infectious disease had spread in a catastrophic way.\u201cNow, I really have no idea what I should do. Our caravan members are going to die, and I\u2019m going to die as well!\u201d Cullen was absolutely terrified. No matter how much he thought about it, there seemed to be no way forward except to die of the plague or throw himself into the river before he was beaten to death by an angry crowd.\u201cFor now, please calm yourself. Take a deep breath\u2026That\u2019s good. It\u2019ll be alright. You, Mr. Cullen, are not alone. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d Luisen said.Cullen\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cR-Really?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re on the same boat. And I\u2019ve chosen to wander the world, following God\u2019s teachings, never to turn a blind eye to those in need.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026..!\u201dThe red glow of the sunset shone through the window down onto Luisen\u2019s head. It looked like a halo. The first glance of Luisen\u2019s mouth, which was revealed through the bottom of the hood, looked so beautiful while smiling\u2013like a painting of mercy.\u201cR-Revered Pilgrim\u2026\u201d Cullen was speechless from gratitude. Instead, he expressed his feelings by clasping Luisen\u2019s two hands.\u201cIsn\u2019t he being too clingy?\u201d Carlton glared at Cullen. He struggled to resist the urge to separate the handyman from the young lord. Luisen seemed to have something he wanted to uncover from the man, so Carlton didn\u2019t want to interrupt; however, he was dissatisfied with how close the man was to his young lord.\u2018How can he seduce a person with his face all covered? It\u2019s a good thing we covered the Duke\u2019s face\u2013100 times out of 100, I\u2019d do it again. Otherwise, he may start a religion based on his looks here and there,\u2019 the mercenary thought.Regardless of Carlton\u2019s roiling thoughts, a holy and peaceful vibe settled in the restaurant. Morrison silently watched the two, as if he were deeply impressed. The sunset continued on its path, and the red light now stretched to include Morrison as well.***Cullen led Luisen, Carlton, and Morrison to the room that his caravan resided in. He stood next to Luisen, telling the young lord this and that unprompted. Now that he met someone who said they\u2019d help in his time of need, the man opened up completely. \u201cI joined the caravan a bit late and didn\u2019t get along with the others. Actually, I felt out of place. They always left me to mind the cargo while they ate and drank among themselves\u2026\u201dSo, Cullen lamented, that may be the reason that he\u2019s the only healthy person in his group. \u201cI\u2019m relieved because of you, Revered Pilgrim. If you hadn\u2019t offered help at the restaurant, I would be unable to do anything on my own.\u201dLuisen appreciated the thanks, but\u2026 The young lord looked back awkwardly. \u201cMr. Morrison was the first to come forward though\u2026\u201dLuisen had left the restaurant and returned later. Shouldn\u2019t Morrison, who came to the restaurant before him, be the one to receive all of these praises?\"\"However, Cullen looked a little sour. \u201cAh, yes. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m also grateful to Mr. Morrison.\u201d He bowed awkwardly to the merchant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73Cullen bowed awkwardly towards Morrison. The man was being courteous yet distant; his actions towards the man were completely different from his manner with Luisen. There was something strange with that, but perhaps Morrison had history with the leader of the Allos caravan.However, Carlton wasn\u2019t as generous as Luisen. \u2018What was Morrison doing before we arrived on the scene?\u2019Just what did Morrison do to make Cullen believe that Luisen, a person who came belatedly to the scene, was more of a savior? Was Cullen\u2019s attitude just a consequence of Morrison and the Allos caravan owner\u2019s relationship? In Carlton\u2019s point of view, Morrison didn\u2019t seem to be close with the Allos caravan\u2019s owner. During their stay on the boat, the merchant never visited the other caravan. Of course, on the Allos caravan\u2019s side, they were debilitated by illness, but\u2026It was Morrison himself who cut off the mercenary\u2019s wandering suspicions. With an affable expression, the merchant tried to tap Carlton\u2019s arm; the mercenary swiftly avoided his touch with a straight expression. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cYou were staring so blatantly at me. Do I have something on my face?\u201d\u201cNo. I was wondering if there was any need for you to follow us. At the very least, you\u2019re the leader of your caravan, so you must have many other things you need to attend to. Shouldn\u2019t you search for your caravan members and confirm their safety?\u201d\u201cAll of my colleagues can take care of themselves, so it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m also worried about the people in the Allos caravan. It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know each other.\u201d\u201cStill, aren\u2019t you scared? They say it\u2019s an infectious disease.\u201d\u201cThe people come first.\u201dLuisen, who was walking ahead, turned back at Morrison\u2019s straightforward answer and expressed his admiration. \u201cMr. Morrison is a very good man.\u201dThe merchant smiled warmly, revealing a mild-mannered aura. This smile could be painted and held up as a textbook example of someone who leaves a good impression, but Carlton\u2019s mind twisted like a wrongfully gnarled and dried tree.***The people in the Allos caravan were all gathered in the room belonging to the owner of the caravan. Cullen said he had moved them all to one room in order to nurse them efficiently. Because of that, there were people lying on the floor and on the sofas.All of them had unhealthily dark complexions and were unable to control their bodies. The person that looked to be in the best condition swore at Cullen, asking him why he had only returned now. Even so, his words were nearly incomprehensible.Cullen smiled even though he was cursed at. \u2018Why is he smiling?\u2019 When Luisen looked at the man strangely, Cullen rushed to explain, \u201cAh, everyone\u2019s still alive! They even have the energy to curse at me. I was worried that someone would die while I had left them\u2013I was so nervous\u2026\u201dWhile patting the man\u2019s sobbing back, Luisen observed the people from the Allos caravan again. \u201cMay I take a look around?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Of course.\u201dLuisen scrutinized the person nearest to him until he reached the owner, the person farthest from the entrance. Everyone had high fevers and was delirious.Luisen looked carefully at the napes of their necks. Just like the ghoul, there were green rashes that ranged from the back of their necks to their chins\u2013right where the shadow of a beard would form. It was plausible that one would be ignorant of the rash\u2019s existence.\u201cWas there anything unusual before they collapsed?\u201d\u201cMm, they said they felt unwell before they boarded the boat, but they\u2019re such heavy drinkers. I thought they were sick from that. Ah, but they mentioned that their legs wouldn\u2019t move before collapsing. It was only then that I noticed something was wrong and approached them; their bodies felt like burning spheres.\u201dThe young lord paused at Cullen\u2019s words. Leg paralysis?Luisen used his fingertips to press firmly into the caravan owner\u2019s leg. It shouldn\u2019t hurt because the young lord wore gloves, but there was still little to no response to the stimulus. It was obvious that his legs were paralyzed or numbed.The young lord took off the owner\u2019s shoes and socks. He ignored the rank smell and observed the man\u2019s ankle; he saw a dark green, triangular spot there. At first glance, it looked like a tattoo, but when the young lord took off his gloves and gently touched it, he realized it was a blood clot rather than a mole. He also checked the others\u2019 ankles and found similar marks.Green rashes, leg paralysis, and triangular spots.\u2018Ah, as I thought.\u2019Luisen had seen something similar in the past. This disease wasn\u2019t one that could be passed from person to person.\u2018No, this isn\u2019t even a disease in the first place. This is poison.\u2019A few months after he met the one-armed pilgrim, his life\u2019s savior, the pilgrim began to open his heart to the young lord because of Luisen\u2019s devotion.While traveling through the kingdom\u2019s midwest region, the two had visited a monastery. Originally, these spaces would be full of simple yet reverent, sacred scents, so the groans and odor of the sick stood out. An epidemic had broken out in a nearby estate; the place expelled their sick, and the monastery had taken them in.The monks had accepted them with the resolve to die with the sick; however, none of the monks became ill. Rather, the infectious disease spread more in the estate that they were kicked out of. The monks had found this phenomenon strange and sought help from the one-armed pilgrim who had coincidentally taken temporary refuge there.While on his way to the estate from the monastery, the pilgrim had found the green, bite-shaped spots\u2013clues that others had overlooked; with that discovery, he was able to identify the true cause of the disease.There was a snake-like monster with a square, angular head and a comparatively slender body. It wasn\u2019t even as big as an adult man\u2019s forearm; however, the eyes were maliciously red, so they could immediately recognize it as a monster. That monster was secretive and clever, however, so it wasn\u2019t particularly conspicuous.The monster had a peculiar, awl-like upper tooth and two lower teeth, and it bit any passing creature. The three spots left in a triangular formation on the Allos caravan member\u2019s ankles were definitely from that monster. Venom flowed in its fangs, and the symptoms only appeared in earnest half a day to a day after being bitten.The bitten people went on with their lives, ignorant of the fact that they had been poisoned until they suddenly collapsed with paralyzed legs.\"\"When fully manifested, the symptoms of the monster\u2019s venom were easily confused with those of an epidemic, especially because the monster often stayed in one region, biting plenty of victims in the same area.The one-armed pilgrim used his body as bait to lure the monster and killed it near a well at the estate\u2019s manor. After that, the number of the sick did not increase any further. In addition, the one-armed pilgrim and Luisen collected the monster\u2019s venom and brought it back to the monastery for antidote creation; the two then spread word of the monster\u2019s existence far and wide. When the misunderstanding behind the disease\u2019s origin was corrected, many deaths were avoided.That was when Luisen became certain. The one-armed pilgrim was definitely God\u2019s agent sent from the heavens to save the world from misery. He was the one who would drive away darkness and establish justice and righteousness in the world.Although the young lord couldn\u2019t see that goal realized, it was an unforgettable honor to participate in just a moment of the saint\u2019s heroic life. Because of that experience, even when Luisen had regressed to the past, didn\u2019t he continue to benefit greatly? \u2018Dear Pilgrim, I owe you another favor.\u2019Luisen indulged in his habit of expressing gratitude to the one-armed pilgrim. Even though they were apart, the young lord\u2019s respect for him grew daily.\u201cHave you discovered something?\u201d Cullen asked hopefully. Luisen put aside his passionate feelings for a moment and returned back to reality. Cullen, Morrison, and even the patients, who lacked the strength to even lift a finger, paid curious attention to the young lord.\u201cYes, this is\u2026\u201d Luisen was about to answer them, but the ship\u2019s horn trumpeted. That signal commanded the scattered sailors to gather.At the same time, the ship suddenly slowed down; the hull shook violently. Carlton held onto the young lord\u2019s shaky body. Everyone could feel that the ship had stopped. When the shaking subsided, everyone ran out\u2013with no care as to who they passed\u2013into the hallway. Something had definitely gone wrong.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?! Why have we stopped all of a sudden?!\u201d\u201cWhat is the captain doing?!\u201dPeople lodged complaints from all corners; the ship soon became quite noisy. Soon, the sailors wandered around saying that they were confirming something on the ship, assuring the passengers that nothing critical had happened. However, no one really believed those reassurances, and the real reason why the ship had stopped was quickly revealed.A few people saw some oarsmen being carried away on a stretcher. After asking around, it was revealed that those people had collapsed with similar symptoms to the caravan folk. As a result, the other oarsmen were in a state of total confusion, and the ship had stopped in its tracks.\u201cSo, the infectious disease must have spread there!\u201d Cullen screamed; his expression belied his fear of dying.The angry crowd insisted that those in the Allos caravan should be thrown off the boat. Although many were still scared to go near their room because they were afraid of the disease, it was only a matter of time before their anger overcame their fear. That process would only happen quicker while the ship is at rest.Rumors spread faster on the wings of anxiety. Like the dusky sky, getting a little darker with every passing minute, the situation on the boat was deteriorating rapidly.Carlton decided that it was too dangerous to stay in the Allos caravan\u2019s room, so he quickly took the young lord back to their room. Morrison also rushed out of the area, saying he would try to meet with the captain. Only Cullen remained with the patients.Back in his room, Luisen sighed and perched on the edge of the bed. He was completely overwhelmed from the emergency situation.Carlton wondered, \u201cAre you not going to wash your hands?\u201d\u201cAhh, no need. This isn\u2019t a disease.\u201d Luisen explained to the mercenary what he had uncovered. Carlton looked a little disappointed, but he didn\u2019t doubt the young lord\u2019s words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cMonster venom\u2026I didn\u2019t even think about that possibility. What did the members of the Allos caravan do to be bitten by such a monster?\u201d Carlton said.Luisen nodded and agreed with his companion\u2019s speculations. That monster was found, at least two years later, in the Midwest region of the kingdom. It was surprising to encounter something like this in the South. \u201cMore than that, the oarsman have fallen ill with similar symptoms.\u201dIf only the members of the caravan had collapsed, then it wasn\u2019t such a big deal. One could presume that those people were bitten before they boarded the ship. However, the oarsmen were different. They would have stayed aboard the ship while it was docked in Mittil. That meant that the monster was also on this ship.\u201cThere\u2019s a monster on the ship, huh.\u201d Carlton grimaced severely. Won\u2019t that mean that the number of affected people will increase? As more fall, the ship will become more of a pandemonium. \u201cThat\u2019s why you answered Morrison\u2019s question so vaguely?\u201dBefore they returned to the room, Morrison had asked the young lord if he had found anything. Luisen simply glossed over his response. Carlton had thought Luisen\u2019s attitude was a bit strange, but unexpectedly the reason had come out before he needed to probe.\u201cYeah. I thought it\u2019d be better if people didn\u2019t know about this.\u201d\u201cYou did well. In this sort of situation, the people probably won\u2019t believe you. Since there are a lot of merchants on this ship, money is involved. They\u2019ll probably need a scapegoat\u2013they may even blame us wrongfully.\u201d The best scenario would be to be outed as a liar. The two may be falsely accused of spreading this poison and pinpointing the blame on a nonexistent monster.\u201cIt\u2019d be best to let others know after capturing the monster. Though, we\u2019ll have to find the monster alone.\u201d\u201cIf a lot of people find out and create a fuss, the monster may go into hiding instead. It\u2019d be best to let the two of us handle this.\u201d Carlton was confident; because of that, the young lord also felt reassured.\u201cStill, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s not an infectious disease. Once the monster is caught, this commotion will calm down,\u201d The mercenary stated.\u201cIf you catch the monster, an antidote can be created. If the sick can just hold out until then, they can be cured.\u201dThough Luisen couldn\u2019t say much about the monster, he told Cullen how to take care of the caravan\u2019s collapsed members. With fever reducers and commonly used antidotes, the death toll wouldn\u2019t increase too quickly. Though, if they didn\u2019t catch the monster, all of them would die anyway.\u2018I wonder if it\u2019s fortunate or unfortunate that the monster is aboard the ship.\u2019Anyway, it was clear that the two had to catch it.Of course, this was easier said than done. The ship was large, and Luisen and Carlton would have to wander around searching for a snake the size of their forearm. Moreover, the sick didn\u2019t have much time left; this venture required making the correct decisions and much focus.Fortunately, Luisen\u2019s experience with the one-armed pilgrim and knowledge of the research data, published later on, remained in his head. The one-armed pilgrim had done much work on this matter, so stories of the snake permeated his pilgrim\u2019s tales.\u201cThat thing doesn\u2019t eat people. It just bites them. It\u2019s bothered by people walking around what it believes to be its territory.\u201d Luisen said.\u201cWhat a monster-like motive.\u201d\u201cIt must have bitten the oarsmen now\u2013it must think the ship is his territory. The oarsmen row in a compartment under the deck; the snake must be around there.\u201dRight now, the oarsmen had collapsed first\u2013not the passengers on the deck or in the cabins. There was a high possibility the snake resided where the oarsmen were located.\u201cSnakes love places like that, so it makes sense,\u201d Carlton responded.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dNormally, passengers could not enter the rowing compartment. However, now that the ship had stopped and all the oarsmen returned to their staff quarters, it wasn\u2019t difficult to sneak in.\u201cThe place will be completely empty, so, if we go and rummage around, the angered snake will definitely pop out.\u201d Carlton nodded.Using one\u2019s own body as bait\u2013that wasn\u2019t so different from the way the one-armed pilgrim caught the monster. Though that seemed simple, not anyone could do it. The snake\u2019s venom was deadly, and it was quick and nimble as it hid in the shadows of its territory. You had to aim for the moment the snake opened its mouth wide to bite your ankle; the attacker needed not only strength to not miss that moment but also the boldness to pull the plan off.\u201cI can do that much. After all, someone with only one arm pulled it off,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s dangerous so please think about it carefully. Though the saint lacked one arm, he was many times stronger than others.\u201d\u201cDo I seem weaker than that person?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really have the perception to gauge something like that\u2026\u201d Luisen wouldn\u2019t know; it was hard to tell who was inferior or superior between the two. He just knew that both Carlton and the one-armed pilgrim were amazing.\u201cI\u2019ll defeat the monster in a blink of an eye. Then, my duke, you\u2019ll have to admit that I\u2019m better.\u201d It seemed like the mercenary\u2019s pride was injured. How cute\u2013such pride made the mercenary look younger. \u201cWhat is it? Why are you laughing?\u201d he asked.It wasn\u2019t until the young lord heard Carlton\u2019s words that Luisen realized he was laughing. \u2018Good Lord, the day has come where I find Carlton cute. Am I insane?\u2019\u201cAre you treating me like a child?\u201d Carlton was incredibly perceptive.Luisen belatedly made excuses for himself, but nothing was effective. In the end, only praises for Carlton\u2019s strength could assuage the man\u2019s mood.***It was near midnight. The frenzied crowd grew exhausted from their panic and slept. When sounds of breathing grew louder than conversation\u2013and the sounds of pacing footsteps disappeared\u2013Carlton and Luisen decided it was time to start hunting a snake.The two stealthily exited their room. They found their way downstairs without much difficulty. Carlton\u2019s ability to memorize the ship\u2019s structure made their pathfinding quite easy.Sailors who should have been patrolling the hallway could not be found, and that absence made the situation more disturbing. It meant that this situation was so urgent that the staff had abandoned their posts. The night on this peaceful river was silent as death; the moonlight sparkled and scattered on the surface of the water.The two reached the below-the-deck door without encountering anyone. The door was locked and needed a key, but Carlton managed to break it open by roughly shoving in an iron skewer into the keyhole a couple of times.The mercenary took the lead, and the young lord followed him down the stairs. It seemed like there was nothing but a void of darkness at the bottom. Since the oarsmen had left the place, it seemed like all the lights had been extinguished as well. The lower they went, the more nervous the young lord felt.The sway in the basement was incomparable to that in the deck and the cabins. Whenever he touched the wall, he could feel the vibrations of the current hitting the ship\u2019s hull. The young lord was hit by the realization that, without this thin wall, the large body of water would simply swallow him up. Splish\u2013 Splash\u2013 the sound of water permeated into the room.\u2018It\u2019s too dark here.\u2019No matter how much better his life became, Luisen still hated dark places. When trapped without light, he remembered the long, painful days before the one-armed pilgrim had saved him. He could separate reality from those unpleasant memories now, but he could still vividly feel the fear. Moreover, the pressure exerted by the enclosed space was significant; he felt like his chest was tightening, unable to breathe properly.Luisen inadvertently grabbed the hem of Carlton\u2019s clothes in front of him. The mercenary turned around.\u2018Ah, I don\u2019t want to show him such a pathetic appearance,\u2019 Luisen thought.He tried hard all this while to hide the fact that he had a phobia of the dark. He thought the other would find him annoying and bothersome.\u201cSlowly\u2026Let\u2019s go down slowly.\u201d The young lord released the mercenary\u2019s hem and pretended to be fine. He had learned to bluff like this after wandering alone for a long while.Carlton looked at the young lord silently for a while before pulling on the man\u2019s arm. \u201cStand in front of me.\u201d\u201cWh-What?\u201d Luisen let himself be dragged to the mercenary\u2019s front. Beyond the narrow staircase lay a great darkness. The sound of water splashing filled his ears. \u201cS-Sir Carlton. W-Wait.\u201dUgh, it felt like something was there: a ghost, a black blade flying towards his head. Luisen tried to turn his head around, but the mercenary didn\u2019t allow him. Carlton hugged the young lord\u2019s back from behind and grasped the young lord\u2019s chin with his hand. Luisen clamped his eyes shut.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. I\u2019ve been wondering about this for a long while\u2026are you afraid of the dark?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\u201cTry to keep your eyes open. If you keep looking, your eyes will adjust.\u201d\u201cBut\u2013\u201c\u201cYou should at least try.\u201d Carlton was determined.Complaints like, \u2018Are you really doing this now?\u2019 and \u2018Are you my father\u2019 climbed up the young lord\u2019s throat.Still, the body temperature transferring from Carlton\u2019s firm, supportive body to his back gave the young lord a strange sense of stability. He could hear the sound of the mercenary\u2019s heart. The deafening sound of the flowing river was drowned out by those steady heart beats, giving him a little courage.\u2018Should I open my eyes? Just a little?\u2019 Luisen narrowly opened his eyes. \u2018Ugh, It really feels like something\u2019s there.\u2019It felt like there was a person standing in the dark.\u201cIs that\u2013Is that a person?\u201d the young lord asked.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing there. If there were people, I would have noticed.\u201d\u201cMust be great to be you!\u201d Luisen\u2019s temper flared; he cried out. His voice cracked at the end of his sentence.Carlton found it funny, \u201cNow, watch your step.\u201dThe mercenary led the young lord down the stairs. On the last few steps, Luisen\u2019s eyes began to get used to the dark. Finally, he could see what he had mistakenly believed to be a person.The basement level was just dirty; chairs, oars, wooden boxes\u2026it was all just rolling around in this space. A slight scent of sweat\u2013and something musty\u2013permeated the area. They could see where the oarsmen haphazardly threw away their oars as they ran away; the place looked lived in.\u201cIt\u2019s not much, huh,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cSee? It\u2019s not so scary once your eyes adjust. The more you try not to look around, the scarier it\u2019ll be. However, well, you don\u2019t have to push yourself. You can turn on a light.\u201d With that said, Carlton lit the torch.Luisen felt choked up yet again, \u201cHonestly! You should have run down and turned on the light from the start!\u201d\u201cThink of it as an experience\u2013a learning experience.\u201d\u201cWow. Really. Wow.\u201d Luisen was struck speechless by disbelief. The mercenary laughed as he saw how offended his companion was. Before long, Luisen began walking casually around the area, even though the few lit torches did not properly drive away all the darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cSo, what\u2019s your strategy now?\u201d Carlton asked.Luisen responded, \u201cIs there a strategy? Just walk around until it appears; if we don\u2019t think it\u2019s here, we\u2019ll go somewhere\u2026else\u2026Ngh.\u201dThe young lord bumped his knee against a wooden box. His eyes had now adjusted to the dark, but his physical acumen was still the same. Luisen tried to balance himself after striking the box, but he stumbled again after stepping on an oar that had fallen to the ground.\u201c*Sigh.* Here, grab onto this.\u201d Carlton held out his hand. The young lord grabbed it without any hesitation.The two continued to walk around the lower hull like that. Carlton held the young lord steady whenever he faltered. Because he could only hear the splashing of water, the young lord tried to sharpen his senses in order to hear the snake\u2019s slithers; the more he did so, however, the more vividly he felt the other\u2019s body temperature and the texture of his hand.Their earlier conversation had unsettled his heart, making Luisen pay more attention to the mercenary.They had reached the \u2018basement,\u2019; their first impressions of this place were largely similar to the other areas in the hull. It reeked of sweat and the fishy scent of seawater. The sound of water deafened all other noise in this area; the lack of light created a gloomy atmosphere. Because he walked hand in hand with Carlton, though, something felt special about this situation. This is something he hadn\u2019t felt while walking underneath the moonlight with a beautiful lover while listening to the dulcet tones of a live performance. He couldn\u2019t believe that a basement\u2013housing a monster that may pop out at any moment\u2013could feel so romantic.\u2018This is not the time to be like this.\u2019It wasn\u2019t the first time he had walked hand in hand with Carlton.\u2018Well, wasn\u2019t that situation kinda romantic\u2013\u2026Actually, not really. Besides, now is not the time to think about these things.\u2019Luisen criticized himself, but the excitement in his heart did not easily subside. He took a sneaky glance at the merecenary\u2019s face. The man\u2019s high, straight nose bridge shone in the dim light of the torch; his brows and forehead were prominent. Piercing eyes were shadowed by fierce-looking eyebrows.Seeing his companion wary of his surroundings, Luisen was able to calm himself. The young lord\u2019s cheeks blushed inadvertently; it was fortunate that his surroundings were dark. Otherwise, anyone would be able to see his red face.\u201cThe snake isn\u2019t appearing.\u201d Luisen said something in order to hide his heart palpitations. They had walked for a long while, but there were no signs of the snake monster.\u201cYes\u2013Should we cause some more fuss?\u201d\u201cHm. I suppose we should.\u201d\u201cWould you like to run around for a bit while holding my hand?\u201d Carlton stood in front and held out his palm. Maybe it was because of the strange atmosphere that had settled between them during this walk, it was difficult for the young lord to make eye contact with the mercenary and face him. He felt like a weirdo for being overly self-conscious. Luisen grabbed his hand, trying to remain calm. Then, he began to make large stomps.Th-Thud! Thud! Stomp!He wasn\u2019t as loud as he imagined. This didn\u2019t seem to be enough, so Luisen began to leap around.Thud. Thud. Thud.To reiterate, Luisen was horribly uncoordinated and ungainly; he was someone who chose to hide that fact rather than practice and exercise to overcome that clumsiness. He felt awkward while moving his body because it had been a long time since he had exercised. After jumping up and down the galley, he was left off-balance and shaky.\u201cAh, Nngh!\u201d Carlton pulled the young lord towards him and caught Luisen\u2019s tottering body. Simultaneously, the two\u2019s legs entangled, and their bodies came into close contact. Luisen\u2019s hood fell off, and his hair was revealed. As soon as the young lord returned to his senses, Carlton\u2019s chest was the first thing he saw. The sound of heartbeats\u2013whether his or the mercenary\u2019s\u2013echoed loudly in his ears.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d The mercenary asked.\u201cUh\u2026Uh\u2026\u201dIt seemed like Carlton\u2019s voice sounded deeper than usual. Luisen felt shivers run down his spine by that rumbling voice. When the young lord looked up, the mercenary\u2019s face was right in front of his. They were close enough for the tips of their noses to touch.\u201cYour hood came off.\u201d Carlton said, but he only brushed his hand through Luisen\u2019s disheveled hair and abandoned the hood. The mercenary gazed at the young lord\u2019s face as if he had been possessed. The young lord could see his dazed reflection in the mercenary\u2019s pupils.The mercenary\u2019s sharpness had melted down, and in its absence, there was something almost indescribable\u2013passion? Luisen\u2019s cheeks flushed at the affectionate yet heated gaze. The young lord recalled that his companion shot him a similar gaze at the restaurant in Mittil. This look felt comparable to that time. He had forgotten about that incident, because of their fight, but even then he had been momentarily shocked.\u2018Does he like me?\u2019It was a gaze that induced delusional thoughts. Luisen felt trapped within that gaze; he couldn\u2019t move as long as those eyes were focused on him.When Luisen neither avoided nor frowned his eyes, Carlton wrapped his arm tighter around the young lord\u2019s waist. His big palm rested on the small of the young lord\u2019s back, as if the hand would stroke further downwards. His eyes stared into Luisen\u2019s pupils before looking at Luisen\u2019s lips. A moment of hesitation\u2013in his absentmindedness, the mercenary\u2019s breath was stolen away. Without thinking, he lowered his eyes and tilted his head to the side.The mood of the situation made it so it wouldn\u2019t be strange if those two kissed.If it weren\u2019t for the snake monster.They suddenly heard a hiss and felt a gust of wind brush shudderingly by their ears.Both of them looked down at their feet; right there was the snake with its angular head and slender body\u2013the very snake they had been searching for the entire time. It posed with its mouth wide open, like it was about to bite Luisen.\u201cArgh!\u201d Luisen jumped onto Carlton while exclaiming; he clung to the mercenary like a cicada would cling to an old, wizened tree. While holding the young lord, Carlton threw his dagger at the snake. Considering the situation, it was a surprisingly quick response.However, it wasn\u2019t a normal snake\u2013it definitely showed it was a monster. It tilted its body mysteriously and disappeared in a blink of an eye to escape the flying dagger.They missed the monster. Luisen\u2019s face became flushed; only then did he realize he was hugging his companion with all his might. The young lord noticed that he was clinging.Honestly, there was no need to jump into the other\u2019s arms, startled. Snake monsters usually bit at people\u2019s ankles because their heads were heavier than their serpentine bodies. To counteract that, the young lord wore ankle-high boots made of tough leather; he had even taken care to cover the leather with wooden boards and cloth, just to be safe. It may even have been better to let the snake bite; if its teeth snagged into the wood and got stuck, the snake would have no choice but to slow down.This turn of events wasn\u2019t romantic at all. It was detestable enough that the mysterious atmosphere hovering around them had disappeared. Embarrassed, Luisen bowed his head, \u201cUm\u2026You can let me down\u2026\u201dCarlton placed the young lord on the ground. Luisen quickly moved away from the mercenary.\u201cAh\u2026Sorry. I was just too surprised.\u201d The young lord muttered.\u201cNo, not at all. I was distracted as well\u2026\u201d The mercenary also avoided eye contact, \u201cBut, now we\u2019ve confirmed that it\u2019s on this floor and that our provocation will work. It\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then, should we go around again? I think jumping\u2026is a little difficult.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stamp my feet this time.\u201d\u201cAlright\u2026\u201d Luisen nodded.The two wandered around the basement-like hull again, focusing on their surroundings. As heated as the atmosphere was earlier, an even chillier awkwardness settled between them.\u2018It would have been less awkward if we kissed.\u2019No\u2013Actually, that isn\u2019t true. \u2018I should have just fallen over like a normal person. What was I thinking?\u2019It felt like he had been bewitched\u2013was he bewitched by Carlton? \u2018Me? The Duke of Anies, someone who had touched all the flowers in the capital? By a mercenary who was called a butcher? No. That can\u2019t be possible.\u2019 Luisen shook his head.Smack\u2013His knee hit some of the clutter\u2013he had no idea what it was\u2013lying about.\u201cNgh.\u201d\u201cNghh.\u201dIt seemed like, this time, he had run into a wooden water barrel. Why were there so many things here? Getting frustrated, Luisen tried to push through, but something crossed his mind.\u2018Right now\u2026Didn\u2019t I hear two moans?\u2019As soon as the question bubbled up in his mind, Luisen kicked at the water container. Carlton kicked whoever snuck out from behind that barrel; simultaneously, the mercenary stepped in front of the young lord and protected him. This was all so sudden; Luisen couldn\u2019t figure out what he should do.\u201cArgh!\u201d It was a man who hid behind the wooden pail; after being beaten by the mercenary, he was flung far away where he dry heaved and tried not to vomit.At first, Luisen couldn\u2019t recognize the person\u2019s identity because of the darkness, but, on a closer look, he managed to recognize the man\u2019s face. \u201cCullen?\u201dHeaving, Cullen flinched as soon as he heard his name. \u201cI\u2019m not Cullen.\u201dThe man had forcibly lowered his tone, but no one believed him. Cullen must have also thought this was a quite lame pretense; he turned his head away slightly. When his eyes met the young lord\u2019s briefly, he shivered and avoided the young lord\u2019s gaze.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Luisen interrogated.\u201cI was just\u2026.just feeling claustrophobic. So, I went out.\u201d Cullen mumbled in response.If he was feeling stifled and frustrated, then he should have walked around the deck; why would he come down to the basement where the oarsmen are? Why was he hiding from Luisen and Carlton? From head to toe, this man was suspicious.\u201cCullen. Why are you here? What about your caravan members?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease say something.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Cullen\u2019s mouth was clamped tightly shut. Then, he suddenly jumped to his feet and tried to escape. Screaming and scrambling, the man\u2019s momentum was effective, but Carlton simply tripped him over. The mercenary then pressed on Cullen\u2019s back with his foot.\u201cL-Let me go! Let me go, I said!\u201d Cullen struggled with his entire body. However, he couldn\u2019t make the mercenary\u2019s foot budge one inch.Relaxed, the mercenary looked over at the young lord. \u201cThis punk won\u2019t respond to kind words. Don\u2019t worry though. With just one touch from me, I\u2019ll make him reveal how much underwear his grandfather owns.\u201d\u201cMm\u2026Well\u2026 Don\u2019t be too harsh.\u201d Luisen knew that a physical interrogation was inevitable, especially if Cullen wouldn\u2019t answer their initial, gentle questions. If he hadn\u2019t tried to escape, the young lord would not force him to deal with Carlton.Carlton whipped Cullen around, like a rag doll, and pushed him into a square hole meant for the oar. Luisen turned around, covered his ears, and sang something random. Meanwhile, Cullen\u2019s screams echoed through the hull.After a while, Carlton tapped the young lord on the shoulder. Luisen turned around to see an absolutely delighted mercenary and a drenched Cullen. The poor handyman sat on his knees, looking as if his soul had escaped his body.\u201cThis punk is more wicked than he seems.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dCarlton said something truly surprising.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cAbout that snake. He\u2019s the one who brought it onto the boat.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Luisen was startled. Cullen was the culprit behind this catastrophe? Wasn\u2019t he a poor, young man struggling to take care of his fallen caravan members and running himself ragged to catch the runaway ghoul?\u201cTell me exactly what you told him,\u201d Luisen asked Cullen. It seems that, now that Cullen\u2019s reason and shame had returned to his body, he didn\u2019t particularly want to expand on this topic, but Carlton tapped the man on his back. Immediately, Cullen opened his mouth; apparently, whatever Carlton did was effective.Cullen had no intent to lie and frankly said, \u201cThat snake. Actually, it\u2019s a snake I raised.\u201dWhen Cullen said something absolutely insane with a clear and steady expression, the young lord began to doubt his ears. \u201cYou raised it? Like a pet?\u201dCullen nodded.Luisen knew of several nobles who made a hobby out of raising vipers. They claimed that the serpent\u2019s sparkling eyes were cute. Of course, they also felt a thrill from the threat of being bitten. However, this was different\u2013this thing was definitely a monster.Even though this snake was more petite, the evil vibe it exuded and its aggression towards humans were at a level that no ordinary person could handle. A sane person would feel instinctively repulsed by the monster and would either run away or kill it. The unexpected answer made Luisen loathe to interrogate this man further; rather, he wanted to distance himself from him. \u201cYou had no idea it was a monster, right?\u201d\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t! If I knew, how could I raise it? But, is it truly a monster? Perhaps you\u2019re mistaken? That child is really gentle and beautiful\u2026 If you look carefully, its eyes sparkle\u2026\u201d Cullen bragged like a true pet owner. \u2018Our child is so pretty. So kind and nice,\u2019 he cooed indulgently.\u00a01\u00a0However, that beautiful and kind pet snake was a monster that bit and killed people.\u2018Crazy. He\u2019s absolutely insane.\u2019Luisen couldn\u2019t believe that in all the years of his life, he would come across someone that found a monster to be cute and lovable. Did they really need to continue to talk with this guy? Cullen showed no signs of stopping his boasting about his pet monster.\u2018Why should I listen any further to this story?\u2019 When Luisen turned to the mercenary, Carlton struck Cullen once more.Cullen finally returned to his senses and went back to the original topic. \u201cAh. So, I met my baby when\u2026\u201dThe Allos caravan had gathered in Dubless County. At that time they had arrived in the South early to seek opportunities, for they had expected the South to be embroiled in a war\u2013especially the Anies Duchy. Cullen had been ostracized by the members of the caravan and felt quite lonely; just then, he became acquainted with a man.Cullen had remembered that the man was easygoing and quite kind, even though he seemed a little strange. That man was the one who gifted Cullen the snake.Luisen was dumbfounded, \u201cWho gives someone a monster? Honestly, even if you didn\u2019t know it was a monster, didn\u2019t you feel uncomfortable when you received it? You just took it?\u201d\u201c\u2026At first, I was a little put off by its serpentine appearance, so I refused. But, the person said that, if I had a snake, the others wouldn\u2019t harass me and would help me out. Then, he forced me to hold it.\u201d Cullen agreed and said that he felt too uncomfortable with the snake at first. However, he was being bullied by his colleagues in a distant land; plus, he couldn\u2019t refuse since the man had handed the snake over as a parting gift.\u201cActually, I was originally going to release it in a forest or someplace like that. I felt a bit repulsed. However, as I continued to raise it, I grew attached. I was caught in a very difficult spot.\u201d\u00a0 Cullen was definitely stuck in a bad situation. The Allos caravan had traveled to the south with all intentions of walking on a golden road, but the situation in the South had exceeded all of their expectations.All because of the Duke of Anies.The Duke of Anies had coaxed Carlton into preventing collateral damage with his wise and humble attitude; he had even prevented problems that would have risen with the locust swarms through his surprising foresight. The Southern lords had also surrendered to Carlton, like dominoes falling one after another, because of the swarm; the southern crisis had ended without a single battle.Luisen coughed and rubbed at his nose. \u2018I did pretty well, huh?\u2019Carlton looked at the young lord with admiration in his eyes.Cullen looked as if he couldn\u2019t understand why the people in front of him were acting like this. \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so happy, but\u2026 Anyway our caravan decided to pack up, cut our losses, and return.\u201dThe Allos caravan had been preparing weapons as their main cache for an outbreak of war. However, as there was no battle, they couldn\u2019t dispose of all the stock they had brought and were forced to return. This trip had cost the Allos caravan dearly. Not only the owner, but the other caravan members became anxious and tense. In turn, they directed all that stress at Cullen. It was fortunate that only words flew at the handyman\u2013usually, a few clubs and fists flew at him as well.Other than the extra violence that resulted from the caravan\u2019s setbacks; its members had appeased the boredom of their long journey by mocking and insulting Cullen. It was easy to imagine how worse the return journey would be. Cullen was sure he\u2019d be beaten to death on this trip.In that mess, this baby snake was the one to comfort him. The baby snake didn\u2019t bully Cullen and listened to Cullen\u2019s stories silently. In this lonely and distressing situation, the baby snake was Cullen\u2019s only friend.Curiously, if he carried the snake in his embrace, the caravan members wouldn\u2019t harass him. Whenever they raised their hands to hit Cullen, the members were suddenly pierced with fear and avoided him. Did the man speak true? Was the snake truly helping Cullen? It was hard to believe that a small snake would have so much power, but Cullen became more and more fond of the snake.\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a monster. Most people would avoid a monster\u2019s presence.\u201d\u201cHe said that I\u2019m different from ordinary people\u2013he said that I have talent.\u201d\u201cThe man who gave you the snake told you that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThat man was incredibly suspicious. Luisen looked at Carlton. Without the need to voice anything out loud, Carlton was able to answer the young lord\u2019s unasked question. \u201cConsidering his body language, it doesn\u2019t sound like a lie.\u201d\u201cSo you say. But, didn\u2019t he cry for us to help him, panicking and saying that we\u2019re all going to die from an infectious disease?\u201d\u201cNo, no. I really thought it was an infectious disease!\u201d Cullen was terrified to have another \u2018sincere conversation\u2019 with Carlton in the river. He waved his hands in aggressive denial.\u201cI didn\u2019t even know my baby was venomous until a little while ago.\u201d\u201cHow did you not know that?\u201d\u201cIt has never bitten anyone until now; although, sometimes it goes off to hunt on its own\u2026 But all snakes are like that, right?\u201d Until earlier, Cullen truly believed that an epidemic was about to break out. But, when Luisen observed the Allos caravan members, Cullen also saw the triangular bite mark. It was too particular and unique to deny. That mark matched the tooth of the snake he had been raising.Only then did Cullen realize that the members had been bitten by his snake and that the symptoms weren\u2019t caused by a disease.\u201cIf you realized that, why didn\u2019t you tell us immediately? Why didn\u2019t you speak?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026You\u2019re not going to leave my baby alone once you find out, right\u2026?\u201d Cullen wanted to save his snake. That\u2019s why he secretly snuck down to the basement to find it. He believed that if he took it and hid it well, making it unable to bite others again, the rumors of an infectious disease would disappear and the situation would calm down.\u2018Of course, with no more bite victims, the suspicions of a possible infectious disease would disappear\u2026but is that even possible?\u2019A monster was a monster, not an animal. A human could not control a monster as they pleased.\u2018No\u2013there are some people that have the ability to control monsters.\u2019 A throbbing headache was growing in the young lord\u2019s brain. \u201cWere you going to let all these people die in order to save your snake?\u201d\u201c\u2026For the caravan members\u2026That\u2019s not enough to repay the hurt they\u2019ve given me.\u201d Cullen clenched his trembling fists. The resentment within him surfaced; his eyes looked distant yet delighted\u2013as if he was imagining something pleasant.\u2018\u2026Let\u2019s stop talking further on this topic.\u2019The young lord wasn\u2019t sure if Cullen was originally a normal person that turned insane from the constant bullying or if he was originally such a psycho, but the reality, currently, was that he was struggling to save a monster. It wouldn\u2019t be fruitful to debate a crazy person. Even a normal person would become unstable from being around someone like him. \u201cYou said you came down to capture the snake, correct? So you must know the method to lure him out?\u201d\u201c\u2026I know how, but\u2026 But\u2026I can\u2019t say. You\u2019ll kill it if you catch it\u2026 NghH!\u201d\"\"Slap\u2013Carlton hit Cullen in the back of the head. Cullen\u2019s neck bent forward as if it had broken.\u201cDo you think we\u2019re nicely recommending you to do this? Summon the snake.\u201d Carlton tyrannized the handyman.Cullen shook his head, shivering, \u201cI\u2026I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cThen do you want to die?\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cOr, should I make you suffer more than death?\u201d Carlton smiled and pointed toward the river.Cullen, filled with despair, quivered as he begged Luisen. \u201cRevered Pilgrim, merciful pilgrim. Please don\u2019t let that vicious bastard harass me.\u201dWas he really trying to garner sympathy in his position? Luisen was dumbfounded. Carlton dragged Cullen by his nape; Cullen cried and struggled. He struggled for a long time considering the mercenary was his opponent.His affection for the snake was that sincere\u2013a friendship between an alienated person and a snake. It was a heartbreaking story, but Luisen felt uncomfortable that a monster with a deadly poison was considered a pet.\u201cI\u2019ll speak! The box! There\u2019s a box! No matter how far it goes, it\u2019ll always come back to the box when the sun comes up!\u201d\u201cWhere is that box?\u201d\u201cO-Over there\u2026\u201d Cullen sobbed as he pointed to someplace on the ground. The box was rolling around on the floor, disturbed by Cullen\u2019s stumbling after\u00a0 Carlton hit him. While Carlton shook the handyman to try and force more potential information from Cullen, Luisen went to pick up the box directly.The wooden box was painted black; its texture and solidity were so luxurious that even Luisen admired the crate. It wasn\u2019t something that a junior caravan member would carry. Luisen opened the box and was struck with terror.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cWhat is this!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Carlton came running, dragging Cullen behind him. Luisen, stunned, showed the mercenary the insides of the box. Carlton was shocked as well.Inside the box\u2013under the lid\u2013an image of a mountain goat with three eyes was engraved into the wood. Although the design was simplified, the rendering looked exactly the same as the strange bust that Luisen and Carlton saw inside the centipede cave.\u201cWhy is this\u2026here?\u201d Carlton asked. Luisen couldn\u2019t figure out the answer either. The two naturally turned to look at Cullen.\u201cW-What?\u201d He exclaimed.\u201cTell me everything about the person who gave this to you.\u201d\u201cWhat? Him? I don\u2019t really know much about him either\u2026\u201d Cullen began to ramble as he immediately blurted out whatever came to mind. The person was a young man, but wore good clothes. A confident, relaxed aura surrounded him; he had a high enough status to be treated well within the castle they were staying at.\u201cStrange\u2013did you find anything suspicious about him?\u201d\u201cYes, well\u2026 At first, I thought he was a con artist. When we first met, he claimed he was a wizard? So, I asked him to show me some magic; he bragged that, if he were to show off, everyone here would die.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cWhen I told him not to brag, he said he was different from ordinary wizards. Someone great had opened his eyes to magic; therefore, he claimed he would only use his powers for that person. Does that make sense? In any case, he was a good person. He would listen to me mope and curse the world while I drank.\u201d\u201cDo you know his name, age, residence\u2026anything like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026He was called Lencul, apparently, and I don\u2019t know his age. He looked young, but he also looked older at times as well. We met in Dubless county, but I don\u2019t think he lives there. He said he\u2019d come there to meet his brothers.\u201d\u201cLencul? That\u2019s just the syllables in your name arranged backwards. He gave you a totally false name\u2013he had no intent of even hiding that. You don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s truly a wizard. In the end, you don\u2019t know anything, do you?\u201d\u201cI already said I don\u2019t know much\u2026\u201d Cullen protested timidly, wary of the mercenary.\u201cThen, do you know anything about this engraving? Did he say anything about it?\u201d Luisen showed Cullen the design in the box.Cullen nodded. \u201cYes, yes. He explained a bit about it\u2013he said it\u2019s the symbol of the person he serves. The horns represent authority and dignity, and the mountain goat represents\u2026 What did he say? Hmmm. Ah, and the extra eye symbolizes that he\u2019s opened his eyes to the truth. Doesn\u2019t this sound like a wizard? Wizards often talk about the truth of the world. I\u2019ve answered your question well this time, haven\u2019t I?\u201d\u2018What is with this guy? That wasn\u2019t anything particularly difficult to say?\u2019Luisen had a headache. \u201cIn any case\u2026So\u2026 He\u2019s part of Ruger\u2019s gang, right?\u201d\u201cIt seems that way.\u201d Carlton said.\u201cDamn it! That\u2019s right. There can\u2019t possibly be that many insane men out there giving monsters as gifts.\u201d Anger burst forth from the young lord. \u2018Before I regressed, did the \u2018plague\u2019 start with Cullen as it did in this timeline?\u2019In the previous timeline, the snake monster had spread out and turned the Midwest region of the kingdom into a field of dust. If the one-armed pilgrim had not identified the monster, the population of snake monsters would have spread throughout the kingdom, unopposed. Even as they died, the people thought they were suffering from an infectious disease.Committing all sorts of evil deeds around the land\u2026Who on earth were Ruger and his gang? And how does Luisen fit into their plans? Was he being targeted?\u2018Ruger, what in the world are you thinking? What is my role in your schemes?\u2019Luisen bit his lips as he recalled Ruger. The servant, whom he thought he knew well, was becoming more and more unfamiliar as time went by. \u201cI don\u2019t know what those people want. I have no clue.\u201dExterminating the villagers of a remote mountain settlement, kidnapping pregnant women, the shady altar, and releasing monsters with strange venom upon the populace\u2026It wasn\u2019t like they were trying to conquer territories; they weren\u2019t even trying to amass a fortune. It didn\u2019t even seem like they were seeking power. The group appeared to move stealthily and quietly for some larger goal, but he couldn\u2019t even imagine the rough outline of their motives.\u2018And the wizard? Was the ability to control monsters related to magic? Then, who is the person leading the group?\u2019As the information he had increased, it felt like Ruger and his gang\u2019s identity were even more mysterious.\u201cJudging from their actions, they look like villains trying to throw the world into chaos. Well, something like that. As if they want to doom everyone.\u201dCarlton\u2019s theory was just so plausible; a giggle bubbled out of the young lord\u2019s mouth.After all, the previous timeline\u2019s world was a total mess. As the old saying goes, when a country collapses, bad luck will follow. Natural disasters, wars, famines, plagues\u2013everything had happened. If one were to voice a particularly heretical opinion, one could say that everything was an ominous portent for ruin, for an apocalypse.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s a heretical cult. Back during my time, the church wasn\u2019t particularly enthusiastic about gnashing its teeth and punishing others, but\u2026\u2019The church believed in a one true god, a god that symbolizes light. All other faiths were painted as heretical and punished severely. The inquisitor who rooted out these cults was famous for being incredibly vicious.That person was apparently so pious and single-minded; once they grabbed hold of you, they\u2019d crush all the bones in your body until they received a confession. Such a bloody rumor. Since Luisen had lived life in the lap of debauchery, the nosy people that regarded him as an eyesore often threatened that the inquisitor would visit him. However, the young lord had never met them in person.\u2018What happened to that world after I died\u2026?\u2019Luisen tried to imagine it but soon stopped. He was saddened by the thought of the one-armed pilgrim dying alone.The young lord and the mercenary talked further, but they couldn\u2019t make any conclusions yet. They still had too little information.Meanwhile, the time had passed, and the sun rose. Since it was time for the snake to return to the box, Luisen and Carlton had agreed to put off their conversation and catch the snake first.It wasn\u2019t hard to catch the monster. As soon as they stopped Cullen from interfering and set the box far away, the snake slowly crawled out. The snake had its guard down; Carlton very simply cleaved the snake\u2019s head in half.The monster died before it could fully realize its impending death. Compared to the fear it wrought upon the boat, its death was anticlimactic.***As soon as Luisen and Carlton dragged Cullen out of the hull, their world flooded with blue light. It was early, but the two headed straight for the captain\u2019s room. It was time to reveal the whole story and request help.The captain greeted the two with a haggard expression. It would be catastrophic for him to pretend ignorance of the existence of a localized epidemic on the ship and dock in the port; however, if he left the ship in quarantine, he felt like he would be beaten by the passengers. He stayed up all night wracking his brain, but no miracle solution manifested.He couldn\u2019t do this or that; whatever he chose, the captain would have to bear the brunt of the consequences. Honestly, he\u2019d rather jump into the cold river than to deal with this. \u2018Yes, let\u2019s just jump!\u2019 Just as he thought that, Luisen appeared.That man not only solved the problem but also taught him how to make the antidote. To the captain, Luisen looked like an angel sent from heaven.\u201cHow did you know that the cause was a monster? Not an infectious disease? I\u2019ve heard that pilgrims and roaming priests often help those in trouble with their great insight\u2013I guess it\u2019s true. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u201d The captain bowed his head, deep enough to reach his knees, as he thanked the young lord for his hard work. Then, he summoned the sailors and asked them to see if there was a pharmacist or an apothecary among the passengers.Deciding to leave this matter to the captain, Luisen and Carlton were eager to return to their rooms. Cullen had also been entrusted to the captain; although he was ignorant to his pet\u2019s true nature as a monster, it would be difficult for the poor handyman to avoid punishment. He would be fortunate to not be beaten to death by the other passengers who may root out the detailed nature of this situation.The incident had ended, but they didn\u2019t feel all that refreshed.As soon as he returned to the room, Luisen threw off his robe and sat on the edge of the bed, taking a small pouch out of his luggage. It contained the knife made of bone he had retrieved from the centipede\u2019s cave. While running away from the monster, he accidentally brought the knife with him; Luisen felt too uncomfortable to throw it away in a random place, so he carried it around on the off chance it may prove to be some sort of clue.He placed that next to the wooden box that had contained the snake; he looked between the two alternatingly. At first glance, they looked plain, unlike objects that were mired in ominous events and suspicious cabals.Everywhere they went, they noticed Ruger\u2019s gang doing strange things, but they had yet to encounter them. They always became entangled with the gang\u2019s matters while passing through. There was a giant knot of frustration within the young lord\u2019s brain. Carlton looked anxiously at the young lord.Luisen said, \u201cI\u2019d rather coolly bump into these people. Then, at least, we can ask what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\u201cBut these are people that are trying to kidnap my Duke? If they see you, they\u2019ll try to capture you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m even more tempted, because of that! I have no idea what they\u2019re thinking! What are they trying to accomplish by kidnapping me?\u201d\u201cThe South will go crazy if that were to happen.\u201d At some point, Carlton had taken a bottle out of the cupboard and was shaking it.\u2018When did he take that out?\u2019Luisen felt desperate for a drink. He felt like he was going to faint, so exhausted and weary from walking around all night, but he couldn\u2019t rest because his brain was crammed full of theories. After regressing, Luisen tried not to drink alcohol if he could help it, but perhaps today it would be okay to sip a little. The young lord received the bottle, sipped a few sips, and returned it to the mercenary.\u201cWell. I supposed there would be pandemonium.\u201d It would be okay for \u2018Luisen\u2019 to disappear. However, if the \u2018Duke of Anies\u2019 disappeared, the duchy would collapse. He wouldn\u2019t be a noble, one of the Great lords and the strongest aristocrat in the South, without the support of the plentiful golden fields.\u201cThe new king\u2019s position will also be unstable.\u201d Carlton fed the young lord some candy and sat opposite the young lord. The mercenary tilted the bottle towards his own mouth. The beds were close enough that their knees bumped against each other; although this was a common occurrence, the young lord\u2019s legs tensed up for some reason.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And from then on, the relationship between Luisen and Carlton would have changed. This was the first time they had been left alone in a room since that incident. No one was looking for them, and the door was locked; they were perfectly alone.Luisen nibbled and sucked on his candy. He was weary and tired, but he strangely trembled with excitement.\u00a0 All this while, they had held hands, bumped bodies while riding horseback, embraced each other while wandering throughout the mountain\u2026he had even woken up in Carlton\u2019s arms. The young lord couldn\u2019t believe he was bothered by a brush of the knee now.Ahem. Luisen coughed for no reason. Perhaps the mercenary thought the young lord was thirsty, Carlton handed over the bottle again. Come to think of it, wasn\u2019t sharing a single bottle of alcohol a little\u2026*too much*?Since when had he felt so flustered by his relationship with Carlton? Although the young lord was overwhelmed, the general had done him a great service to teach him how to keep a poker face. That skill was highly useful at this moment. Luisen gulped down the drink and said casually, \u201cIf the new king only receives the acknowledgment of three great lords, he\u2019ll sit upon an imperfect throne forever.\u201dLuisen took a sneaky glance at the mercenary; Carlton didn\u2019t seem as conscious of the situation as he was.\u2018What is this? Am I the only one that\u2019s stressing over this?\u2019It would have been awkward if his companion was just as self-conscious as he was, but Luisen\u2019s pride was hurt when the other looked completely fine. Sure, the king is a popular man right now, but even the young lord had a colorful past in which many people offered bribes to his servants in order to be alone with him.\u201cI suppose the first prince\u2019s, your master and king\u2019s, position has always been a bit insecure,\u201d Luisen said with a touch of grumpiness in his voice.\u201cThat\u2019s true. If the royal authority is shaken, the nobles in the land will fight; everything, from top to bottom, will be a mess. It\u2019ll be difficult for the state to function properly, and the kingdom will be helpless to address any small crises.\u201dFaced with Carlton\u2019s analysis, Luisen forgot his earlier complaints and made an audible gasp. The future he experienced really went that way. As soon as his duchy collapsed, the South fought fiercely; they were briefly united against the common enemy of the locusts and, later, everyone else. Betrayal and slander became rampant in their peaceful land, which once held abundant fields of grain and ripe orchards with fruit. Everything became a mess.If one considered how dire the situation was in the relatively relaxed and leisurely Southern Region, the other areas touched by territorial conflicts and catastrophes were like scorched earth\u2013the people\u2019s lives were simply devastated. In particular, the denizens of the Northern Region ran away from their residences, abandoning countless cities; in their place, monsters came down from the mountain to occupy the resulting emptiness. What a headache.\"\"In such a situation, no one emerged as a dominant power; the political game never turned in favor of any one group either. No one benefitted from the misfortune that hit their kingdom. Quality of life quickly declined; the people were impoverished. Everyone became poor and sick. Luisen had a short life, but, in that small time, he had observed everyone else\u2019s hellish lives. Unless a hero stepped up, the future would probably grow worse.\u201cConsidering all of that, do you think their dream is to truly destroy the world?\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s serious question, Carlton erupted into laughter, \u201cThey\u2019re not some third-rate theater villain. What kind of clich\u00e9 like that would exist in today\u2019s world?\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Luisen adopted an awkward expression. As he knew the future, it was hard to let this theory pass as some joke.\u201cIf you\u2019re truly targeted by a villain whose dream is to destroy the world, then it\u2019s a huge deal. Because of my duke, I too am targeted by this third-rate villain\u2026 I should receive a good reward from you. I\u2019m an expensive mercenary, you know?\u201d Carlton laughed.Luisen burst into laughter at his companion\u2019s lighthearted joke. \u201cNo, no. Even if it weren\u2019t for me, you\u2019d be targeted by them as well. Aren\u2019t you the first prince\u2019s sword? No matter what, someday you would have been in their sights as well. Rather, you should thank me for giving you extra information as we travel. Your eyes have been opened, and you won\u2019t be caught with your pants down between your legs. I should be the one that\u2019s rewarded!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s with that logic?\u201dThe two bantered playfully. Meanwhile, uncomfortable feelings and worries disappeared; a pleasant alcohol buzz washed over them.Luisen leaned back on his arm, smiling, \u201cYou\u2019re drunk, right?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Carlton smirked, taking the bottle from Luisen\u2019s hand before hand-feeding the young lord another piece of candy.\u2018Am I a child?\u2019 the young lord thought. Still, as he rolled the candy around in his mouth, the young lord could feel the mercenary\u2019s worries for him, conveyed through the medium of sweetness. He was sure his companion continued to make silly jokes to alleviate his anxiety.Still leaning back on his arm, Luisen slid his eyes up the mercenary. \u2018Is this man really the \u2018butcher\u2019 I was so afraid of?\u2019That question often entered his mind while traveling. Was this really the man who brutally killed his retainers, slaughtered innocent people, and burned down his golden fields?In Luisen\u2019s watchful eyes, Carlton was hot-tempered, easily lost his cool, and was an objectively \u2018bad\u2019 person\u2026but he wasn\u2019t evil. Although he dealt with his opponents a little harshly, this man knew how to sympathize with and comfort him. This man was clever and a visionary.No matter how mentally-driven and hot-tempered Carlton may be, would he really carry out a slaughter that would ultimately stain his reputation and become a blot on his life? It was clear that he had committed a massacre in the previous timeline, but he was beginning to doubt that it was solely the mercenary\u2019s fault.Now that he regressed, there were unimaginable plots everywhere in the past; schemes that had been inadvertently ignored. Hadn\u2019t Ruger concealed some ulterior motive in the midnight escape plan, although the young lord previously thought the choice to run away had originally been his own idea.Luisen had no clue, but many people must have lost their lives in similar conspiracies. Most of them probably didn\u2019t even know they were caught up in a scheme\u2013like the people of the Allos caravan who died from a snake monster\u2019s venom, even though they were ignorant to the fact that they had been bitten.What if there was a conspiracy against Carlton as well?A conspiracy may have bitten Carlton\u2019s ankle as well; the mercenary would have been just as ignorant as the others.\u2018What a shame.\u2019That, however, was the problem of the past. No one but Luisen remembered; there was no way to find out if the mercenary was innocent. If the crime had been committed because the mercenary was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The young lord had been given the opportunity to return to the past and to atone, but Carlton had not.The mercenary\u2013the one that would remain in Luisen\u2019s memories forever\u2013would stay a sinner.Thinking about this possibility, Luisene felt so sorry that he inadvertently reached out; Carlton\u2019s rough hair slipped through the young lord\u2019s soft fingers. For a moment, the mercenary\u2019s pupils trembled.\u201cAh, sorry.\u201d Luisen realized what he had done and rushed to try and withdraw his hand. How rude of him to stroke a grown man\u2019s head so suddenly. However, Carlton immediately grabbed his wrist; his expression looked subdued, but there was a boiling warmth in his eyes.The mercenary asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you avoid me?\u201dThere was no need to explain the mercenary\u2019s words. As soon as Carlton spoke, both Luisen and Carlton recalled their moment in the hull. A fast heartbeat\u2013unable to determine whose since they were in such close contact. Their breath intermingled and strangely tickled each other\u2019s cheeks. The young lord\u2019s fall was a mistake, but the narrowing distance\u2013almost too close\u2013wasn\u2019t a mistake.Since Carlton looked so indifferent, Luisen was quite flustered by the question. \u2018What\u2019s this? Is his poker face better than mine?\u2019Well, come to think of it, it wasn\u2019t so unexpected that the young lord didn\u2019t notice the other\u2019s feelings due to his own denseness. \u201cJust because.\u201d\u201cJust because?\u201d Carlton sounded like he was suppressing his anger.Luisen hurriedly added, \u201cI didn\u2019t dislike it. At that moment, I thought I would be alright with being swept along in the atmosphere.\u201dHonestly, there were not many thoughts inside his head. He\u2019d previously done more than kissing while going along with the flow.Luisen\u2019s impassive answer set Carlton\u2019s heart ablaze. The mercenary was well aware that Luisen was known as a famous playboy in the capital, but experiencing it in person was different.\u201cSo. Just because. Because you didn\u2019t particularly hate it. You were swept along by the atmosphere\u2026\u201d Carlton said to himself, calmly. Goosebumps ran down both Luisen\u2019s arms.\u201cThen, when faced with that sort of atmosphere, you\u2019ll simply \u2018not avoid\u2019 your partner?\u201d\u201c\u2026No, I don\u2019t do that with just anyone.\u201d Luisen shook his head desperately. \u2018Ah, I think I said something wrong, but how do I fix this?\u2019However, Carlton didn\u2019t give him space to relax and craft an answer. He pulled at the young lord\u2019s wrist and kissed Luisen\u2019s palm.\u201cC-Carlton?\u201d Startled, Luisen tried to retrieve his hand, but the hand remained still. Carlton looked the young lord straight in the eye and kissed him again\u2013the wrist this time. He pressed down with soft lips before licking the young lord\u2019s delicate skin with the burning tip of his tongue. Afterwards, the mercenary released the young lord.He didn\u2019t stop there; Carlton kissed down the young lord\u2019s forearm and then his shoulders. It felt like the rush of alcohol heat surged in the young lord\u2019s body; his view suddenly spun. Luisen gave a small gasp\u2013an exclamation. Carlton gently placed his teeth against the young lord\u2019s wriggling, trembling neck; Luisen\u2019s body shook.In the blink of an eye, the mercenary had wrapped his hand around the back of the young lord\u2019s neck. His dark eyes seemed to question Luisen, \u2018What will you do now?\u2019\u2018What does he mean by that?\u2019 Luisen thought. The allure that the mercenary exuded felt so chillingly exhilarating. This was beyond simply \u2018not hating\u2019 him; Luisen wanted him.\u201cYou\u2019re so\u00a0awful.\u201d Luisen placed his arms around the mercenary\u2019s neck. There was no space to get closer; Carlton\u2019s lips overlapped Luisen\u2019s. The young lord could feel the vibrations of the mercenary\u2019s laughter through their lips.\u2018Does he like this that much?\u2019Luisen bit Carlton\u2019s lower lip gently because he was slightly grumpy. Even that stimulated the mercenary; the kiss was deepened, more and more. Their lips touched, fell away, then touched again\u2026and again\u2026.and again. For quite some time, only the moist sounds of kissing could be heard in the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs soon as Luisen breathed out, Carlton banged his lips to the young lord\u2019s again. Carlton\u2019s kisses were hasty and intense\u2013quite befitting his character. Perhaps due to his lack of oxygen, Luisen\u2019s mind went blank from dizziness. The Lust and excitement filled in the vacancy where his rationality had been.\u201cHaah,\u201d Luisen smiled and dragged the mercenary down to the bed with him. Carlton followed and, almost unexpectedly, climbed atop Luisen\u2019s body. Luisen\u2019s hair became disheveled, spread on the white sheets;\u00a0 Carlton automatically ran his fingers between the golden strands. \u201cEver since I cut your hair, I\u2019ve always wanted to touch it like this.\u201d\u201cMmhmm, So you say.\u201d\u2018He\u2019s saying he\u2019s been conscious of me since then? So early in our journey?\u2019 the young lord thought.Only now did he understand the strange tension he had felt this far. Carlton\u2019s seemingly overprotective behavior flashed through mind; Luisen burst into laughter. This tickled his heart.He\u2019d been seduced by countless love confessions, but he had never felt this way. Now that he knew the other liked him, he saw things in a different light\u2013moments that he had simply dismissed without further thought turned into exciting memories.\u2018I mean, it\u2019s Carlton. Not anyone else. *The* Carlton.\u2019The past, when he trembled in fear when faced with the mercenary, felt so far away. Back then, he had been too frightened to speak to the man, but now he was doing something more. Even kissing the mercenary felt so much better than his imagined fantasies.Luisen and Carlton kissed each other deeply again. This time, Luisen also roughly grabbed Carlton\u2019s hair. The mercenary\u2019s hair was so stiff it soon became a crow\u2019s nest. Amused by that sight, the young lord laughed once more.One kiss\u2013one light tease. That alone made him feel as good as tumbling in the sheets with another. It was the first time that he finally understood the clich\u00e9, \u2018A blessing in disguise.\u2019\u00a01\u2018Ah, alright. What\u2019s the point of thinking about it any further? How should I know what Ruger and his gang are doing?\u2019\"\"A lot had changed from the previous timeline. The Duke of Anies was alive and well; his vast wealth still remained. He\u2019s doing well as a duke. Above all, he had by his side an ascendant status symbol (a rising star), the strongest man in the kingdom who had won his position as the prince\u2019s confidant by force.\u2018It\u2019ll all work out somehow.\u2019Thanks to the steadfast companion by his side, Luisen\u2019s uniquely optimistic nature had been slightly revived.Luisen yawned, body stretched out languidly, and blinked. As his anxiety disappeared, the heightened tension in his body began to subside. Drowsiness washed over him.\u201cAre you sleepy now?\u201d Carlton\u2019s hand went inside of Luisen\u2019s clothes and fiddled with the young lord\u2019s waist. However, it was difficult to rouse the young lord with that touch. He had been through so much all night\u2013Luisen\u2019s physical stamina was now at its limit.Luisen pulled at the mercenary\u2019s arm and laid it beside him. \u201cLet\u2019s sleep. Let\u2019s sleep deeply and then eat.\u201d He patted the mercenary on the back.\u201cHah, tsk.\u201d Carlton felt dumbfounded, but, instead of standing up, he turned to face the young lord. Luisen soon fell asleep. The patting soon stopped, but Carlton\u2019s heart still felt soothed and comfortable.One night\u2019s lack of sleep wasn\u2019t enough to tire Carlton, but his eyelids became heavier gradually as he smelled Luisen\u2019s scent and listened to the young lord\u2019s slow breathing and rhythmic heartbeats.In the distance, he could hear the sound of a horn, and the boat began to move again. The ship\u2019s renewed movement was the biggest factor in his surging sleepiness; the two fell asleep, ignorant to the world.***As Luisen expected, the captain worked hard to do what was entrusted to him. He locked Cullen up and sent a carrier pigeon towards the port city to explain the situation within the ship. The crew then gathered to explain the truth of the epidemic to the onboard guests before starting travel once more. He hadn\u2019t forgotten to rustle up an apothecary to make the antidote either.Due to those efforts, the ship began to cut through the river again, moving forward vigorously. Because the resolution of the epidemic was such a sensitive matter, the crew\u2019s explanation spread quickly through the passenger rumor mill.At first, the people didn\u2019t believe it. They had met many people and wandered around many places, but they had never heard of such a monster.While he was at it, the captain unveiled the snake\u2019s corpse to the passengers. Everyone who saw its body shuddered. The mere sight of the snake gave them goosebumps; they felt an instinctive disgust and repulsion. There was no way something so dreadful could be an ordinary snake. Everyone became convinced when they saw the body, so they obediently believed the captain\u2019s explanation.And soon, the pharmacist/apothecary completed the antidote. That person followed the formula provided by Luisen; the medicine was fed to the Allos caravan members and the oarsmen without delay.\u00a0 The effects quickly emerged\u2013the patients\u2019 fevers subsided and their rough breathing calmed down. Soon, those folks returned to consciousness as well.Their recovery reassured everyone on board; they could finally believe all parts of the story. By the time Luisen and Carlton left the room, there was no one on board who didn\u2019t know the two.Luisen and Carlton walked around while staying about a half-step further apart than usual. They were too conscious of each other; a warm but awkward aura surrounded the two.People shouted as soon as the two stepped inside the restaurant.\u201cThere they are!\u201d\u201cI heard you guys were the ones to catch the monster and told us how to make the antidote?\u201dLuisen and Carlton, who had just woken up and came here for a bite to eat, were greatly flustered by the unexpected welcome. The mercenary quickly stepped forward and hid the young lord behind him.\u201cExcuse me, could you tell us more about the snake monster? Is it a new type? Where do they originally live? How did you identify it?\u201d\u201cYour instructions for manufacturing the antidote were very unique. Did you learn herbology from the monks?\u201d\u201cCome! Sit here! Tell us what happened yesterday in more detail!\u201dThere were people who asked various questions with an almost scary focus.\u201cThank you! Thank you so much!\u00a0 Because of you, the ship is moving again! We can arrive at the port in time! If I don\u2019t arrive by the appointed date I will have to pay a huge penalty!\u201d\u201cHow did you know the cause was a monster? You folks are incredible!\u201dThere were also people that suddenly gave them thanks and praises. The people cheered loudly enough to make their ears numb. Every single person looked a little haggard\u2013unable to sleep due to their accumulated worries\u2013but sincere joy lit up their faces.This burdensome interest was counterproductive to hiding the two\u2019s identities. How should they escape this situation? Morrison approached just as they had that thought; he had his usual grin on his face, although he seemed relatively aloof compared to the excited crowd.\u201cYou two! Let\u2019s talk for a brief second. Everyone, I have something to talk about with my party members, so I\u2019ll take them with me!\u201d Morrison sped out of the restaurant, dragging Luisen and Carlton behind him. Luisen felt a little nervous\u2013the man\u2019s expression looked slightly chilly.\u201cYou have something to say to us?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an excuse, of course. If you had been caught there, they would have had a hold of you lot for the entire day. You\u2019ve worked hard all night, so you should get some rest. It\u2019d be best to eat elsewhere.\u201d Morrison handed Luisen a basket full of bread before re-entering the restaurant, saying that he wanted to appease the crowd.\u2018As expected, he\u2019s a good person.\u2019 Luisen hugged the bread basket as he looked at the merchant\u2019s back.\u201cI suppose that person isn\u2019t going to ask us anything?\u201d Carlton complained.\u201cHe\u2019s being considerate of us. What a thoughtful and kind person.\u201d Luisen automatically praised Morrison; looking to the side, he found that Calrton looked displeased. \u201cDo you dislike Morrison?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of like or dislike; he\u2019s simply a stranger. It\u2019s my duke that\u2019s the one that likes him too much.\u201d\u201cMm, is that so?\u201d Luisen teased. \u2018Look at him. Considering recent events, is that jealousy?\u2019 A subtle smile bloomed on Luisen\u2019s lips.\u201cWhy are you smiling like that?\u201d\u201cNo reason.\u201d Luisen stepped on his tiptoes and kissed his companion. After a short peck, he whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s go find a deserted place.\u201dThe irritation that filled Carlton\u2019s expression turned limp before crumbling away. The mercenary allowed himself to be docilely led away by the young lord\u2019s hand.Unfortunately, it was incredibly hard to find a quiet place to eat. Luisen was quite noticeable as the only pilgrim on board; there were people everywhere on this ship. Even if they barely managed to find a vacant spot, people would often recognize him and approach. Once caught, it was obvious that a crowd would soon flock, so they avoided then avoided people some more\u2026but the two ended up staying in their room.Time passed like that; in the blink of an eye, the ship settled into the harbor. Though it had been stopped for one night, the ship hurried and was able to arrive on schedule.Luisen, along with Morrison, headed for the deck. Carlton stayed in the cargo compartment with the caravan people to help unload their luggage with his abundant strength.\u00a0 Luisen had decided to leave the boat first with Morrison since he could get hurt while wandering around. He didn\u2019t want to be separated from the mercenary, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. He wasn\u2019t a hired sword; he couldn\u2019t do anything like patrolling the cargo compartment.He felt somehow lonely now that they were apart after sticking by each other\u2019s side for so long. In Carlton\u2019s stead, Luisen stroked Zephys\u2019s hair. The haughty horse wagged its tail indifferently.\u201cRevered Pilgrim! Let\u2019s see each other again in the future. I\u2019ll buy you a drink!\u201d\u201cThank you so much for helping us out this time; if you ever need wool, please come to our caravan. We\u2019ll treat you well!\u201dWhile waiting to disembark, the people recognized the young lord and greeted him, one by one. Luisen kept pressing down on his hood, embarrassed. Fortunately, the stairs were soon lowered, and the people soon began to move; it seemed like their interest in him ended there.\u201cWe should also leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Luisen followed Morrison off the ship. The harbor, to speak of crowded places, was horribly packed. There were so many people that it was difficult to take a single step.As Luisen stumbled from being hit by passing shoulders, Morrison grabbed his arm. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\u201cIs it always this crowded here?\u201d Luisen didn\u2019t think it was the same way when he had passed through in the past. Although the port was active and full of travelers\u2013as any port should be\u2013this place didn\u2019t seem this congested.\u201cThey\u2019re all spectators.\u201d\u201cSpectators?\u201dMorrison pointed to something far in the distance. The young lord could see two knights in metal plate armor. They certainly stood out amongst the ordinary people milling about. The two were pushing along a wooden cage with Cullen inside. It seemed that the poor handyman was exhausted and had aged considerably these past few days.Since the captain had contacted the lord in advance, the lord had sent a few knights to capture Cullen. The spectators hurled abuse at the man; they even threw stones and rotten fish as well.Luisen watched the scene with complicated feelings. The man reaped what he sowed, but the young lord could sympathize with the loneliness that led him to rely on a snake monster.\u201cWhat will be his punishment?\u201d Luisen whispered to himself. He wasn\u2019t expecting an answer.However, Morrison replied. \u201cHe\u2019ll burn to death alive. There is no mercy to be shown at a sinner\u2019s demise.\u201dHis voice was cold and disdainful. As Luisen turned back, surprised, Morrison was staring at the young lord with a hitherto unseen expression. His face was emotionless\u2013like a stone statue\u2013but his eyes were piercingly intense. It felt as if the merchant could see through his head. There was a blue flame in his eyes in the shape of a cross.A cross-shaped flame!God was symbolized by light. Therefore, the church regarded fire as a blessing from God to men; priests could summon a small torchlight. The most pious and well-disciplined among them housed flames in their eyes.A long time ago, Luisen had seen a cross in the eyes of a high priest he had met during an event in the royal palace.\u2018Is he from the church?\u2019 An ominous feeling bolted through the young lord.\u201cNow, let\u2019s hear your story, Sir Fake-Pilgrim-with-a-Demon-Worshiping-Holy-Object. Who are you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u201dMorrison didn\u2019t give Luisen a chance to ask further questions. He pushed the young lord\u2019s chest lightly with his hand. The moment Luisen stumbled back, his mind was sucked into a dark void.Footnotes\uc778\uc0dd\uc740 \ud55c \uce58 \uc55e\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub974\ub294 is the original. Literally, it means \u201cYou don\u2019t know in life.\u201d Basically, this comes from an old folk tale where a man loses his horse only for it to come back with a mare. The man also breaks his leg, only to realize that he can now avoid being drafted into war. Basically, these bad happenings were blessings in disguise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Carlton spat out the blood that pooled in his mouth. Surrounding him were Morrison\u2019s men\u2013once a part of his party\u2013collapsed and prone.He felt somewhat uneasy ever since he had been asked by Morrison to help move the cargo. However, he was displeased by the revelation that his alone time with Luisen would soon come to an end; the mercenary ignored that feeling without further contemplation. He shouldn\u2019t have ignored it.At first, the cargo transportation process progressed normally. Gradually, the uneasy feeling built up within him. He felt anxious since the young lord wasn\u2019t in his view. Luisen was the type of person to trip while walking on a flat surface; honestly, Carlton should be by his side. Unable to endure this anxiety, he thought he should go off to find his companion when Morrison\u2019s men suddenly pulled out knives and ambushed him.Only then did he realize what had been tugging at his mind for the entire time: he was feeling the consequences of another\u2019s wariness and vigilance.Carlton took out his sword and responded in kind. Morrison\u2019s men had all been well trained; their individual swordsmanship skills were incredible, and they moved in sync, as if they had fought together more than once or twice. These were highly trained elite soldiers that one could take into any territory.However, unfortunately, their opponent was Carlton. The mercenary had strength beyond all logic and was particularly adept at dueling. He knocked down Morrison\u2019s men in an instant. He grabbed one fallen man by his hair, \u201cWho are you people? Who sent you?\u201dOf course, there was no answer; Carlton wasn\u2019t really expecting one either. He was simply nervous and needed to verbally release his agitation; the thought of Luisen and Morrison alone together made his heart feel like it would explode. The mercenary roughly tossed the man\u2019s head aside and ran up to the deck.The people, startled by the mercenary\u2019s terrifying bloodlust, parted naturally to create a path. Carlton searched for Luisen on the boat.\u2018Where is the Duke?\u2019Nothing. Luisen was nowhere to be seen.\u2018Where is he? Where did they go?\u2019\u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019d miss him; why can\u2019t I see him?\u2019Morrison couldn\u2019t be found either. He probably disappeared somewhere with the young lord.\u2018I let my guard down.\u2019He had considered Morrison suspicious for a while now; strangely, he even felt repulsed by and disliked the man. Carlton trusted his intuition. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t have let his guard down around that man. In a normal situation, he would have found out who that man was and stayed by Luisen\u2019s side.However, this time, he ignored his intuition and did not listen to the warnings that his instincts were blaring. He was being complacent\u2013completely unlike him.\u2018Why did I do that?\u2019It\u2019s just\u2026after a while, he had stopped observing his surroundings properly. His keenly sharpened senses dulled; his attention had been wholly focused on Luisen. There must have been more warning signs, but none of them entered his view. His eyes were too busy chasing the young lord\u2019s gaze.He had spent this entire time with Luisen\u2013laughing, kissing, sneaking out to the deck at night to kiss again. They weren\u2019t doing anything in particular, but the time passed by in an instant. They weren\u2019t bored at all. The mercenary floated like he was walking in the air; he was in ecstasy, like a child who had tasted the sweetness of candy for the first time in his life.And he was reaping the consequences now. It wasn\u2019t like he had been caught by a complicated scheme or some unfamiliar spell. He had lost Luisen in such an absurdly ridiculous and needless way. He felt a great deal of regret. His normally calm mind, which would be alert even in a life-threatening situation, felt hazy and vacant now. All he could think of was Luisen\u2019s parting wave, saying they\u2019d meet up later.Neiiighh\u2013!He heard a familiar horse whinny; Zephys had galloped up to its master.\u2018That\u2019s right. I still have you, Zephys.\u2019Carlton leapt onto the horse\u2019s back. Zephys had been with the young lord; it was a clever fellow, so it must remember where Morrison had taken Luisen.\u201cGiddy up!\u201d Carlton urged his steed roughly. He heard complaints from various corners, but the crowd\u2013the many people\u2013in this port didn\u2019t even enter his focused view.He needed to find Luisen as soon as possible. He had to return to the young lord\u2019s side.*******The first thing Luisen felt when he had come to his senses was the fact that the hood covering his face had disappeared. The cold air enveloped his entire body. He opened his eyes slightly, but the room was too dark for him to see anything.\u2018My clothes are all gone.\u2019Luisen also noticed that his arms and legs were tied to something resembling a chair.\u2018Where am I? How long have I been out?\u2019Suddenly, an ominous feeling gripped his body; Morrison\u2019s cold expression, which he had seen just before he fainted\u2013came to mind.\u201cIf you\u2019re finished trying to figure out your situation, you should hurry and fully open your eyes.\u201dThat was Morrison\u2019s voice.\u2018Oh my god. He was right in front of me.\u2019Luisen slowly opened his eyes, trying not to show any signs of his surprise. His long eyelashes rose in an elegant parabola, revealing clear blue eyes underneath; he stared straight at Morrison.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Luisen asked abruptly. When his status as a fake pilgrim was revealed, the young lord stopped using honorifics. Being polite wasn\u2019t originally part of his temperament, after all. \u201cHow did you know I was a fake pilgrim? Did you perhaps know from the very beginning?\u201dMorrison didn\u2019t respond. Luisen recognized that the silence was a positive sign.\u2018So, he knew I was a fake pilgrim from the beginning and thus sent us a commission?\u2019Luisen recalled that incident where they had mistaken Morrison as someone that was stalking them. Perhaps that wasn\u2019t a misunderstanding\u2013perhaps they were truly being followed. Claiming that Luisen and Carlton looked too lovey-dovey to interfere\u2026was that all an act to seem clumsy and incompetent?!Luisen clenched his teeth at Morrison\u2019s meticulousness. \u201cWhy did you follow us? Why did you keep us at your side, pretending to be our client?\u201d He asked.This time, Morrison replied, \u201cI saw you for the first time from Mittil\u2019s Church. There was a strong curse aura coming from you people.\u201dThe Church! It started from there?!\u201cI thought for a moment a demon-worshiper was approaching. But then, he happened to pose as a fake pilgrim using a dead pilgrim\u2019s pass. I was suspicious and suggested we travel together.\u201d\u201cCurse? Demon-worshiper? I don\u2019t know anything about that. It was wrong for me to pretend to be a pilgrim, but there was a good reason for that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been observing you all this while. And I\u2019ve come to a conclusion.\u201d Morrison ignored the young lord\u2019s words and continued, \u201cAs a heresy inquisitor ordained by the Church, I\u2019ll interrogate you on suspicion of being a heretic cultist.\u201d\u201cAre you really an inquisitor?\u201d Luisen was greatly surprised. Although he had heard many stories about these inquisitors, one way or another, throughout his life, this was the first time he had ever encountered one.The inquisitors were exactly as their name suggests: they were priests in charge of interrogating, identifying, and punishing heretics. Their identity and detailed accounts of their activities were treated as top-secret matters; even ordinary priests were ignorant of this information. However, their vicious and cruel attitude toward heretics was famous.Regardless of their opponents\u2019 high or low status, the inquisitors will catch them at all costs once they\u2019ve been pinpointed as a cultist. And, they were known to torture and torture some more until their captives have confessed. In their process, any lie or murder was tolerated. They only followed one principle.That is to say, they do anything at all costs to capture and kill their targets.And now Luisen was misunderstood as a heretic by such a person\u2013a worst-case scenario.\u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something\u2026\u201d Luisen tried to explain, but Morrison didn\u2019t even listen. Once again, a blue flame burned in Morrison\u2019s eyes. Almost simultaneously, the flames spread around the young lord and surrounded him. The room lit up from the flame\u2019s light.Luisen gasped; fear flared in his eyes. Bizarre torture tools\u2013things he\u2019d never seen or heard of before\u2013hung on the walls. It made him think of all sorts of terrible torture methods; the young lord flinched, unconsciously conveying his desire to escape.Thud\u2013The iron chair didn\u2019t budge one inch. Sweat dripped down like rain; his entire body trembled.\u2018Nngh\u2026\u2019Morrison stood straight and looked down at Luisen with an incomprehensible stare. The solemn atmosphere emanating from the inquisitor overwhelmed the young lord. The situation was grave enough for Luisen to feel hopeless; the blue flames flickered, as if to devour the young lord. Luisen felt miserable\u2013like he had become insignificant and small.\u201cI won\u2019t have to use those things if you just answer the questions I ask. Now, tell me the truth. This fire will prove the veracity of your words.\u201dLuisen felt like a dispirited dog with its tail lowered. \u201cI\u2026W-What\u2026 Am I supposed to say\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me what this is.\u201d Morrison pulled out a small pocket knife. Luisen had picked it up in the depths of the centipede cave\u2013a crude knife made from bone. Back then, Luisen had placed it in his robe\u2019s pouch\u2026when did he take that?Morrison continued, \u201cYou had this on you. It\u2019s a relic used by demon-worshipers.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relic? I can\u2019t believe such a toy-like-thing was a relic\u2026\u201d\u201cDespite how sloppy it looks\u2026You\u2019d be surprised to find out how many sacrificial bodies this knife has sliced through.\u201dSacrifice? Were the women captured in the centipede cave sacrifices? If so, then the altar was set up underground and the huge goat bust painted a convincing picture.\u201cWhere and how did you get this knife?\u201d Morrison asked.\u201cThat\u2026.There was a centipede cave in Confosse. I picked it up there.\u201d In order to prove his innocence, Luisen revealed everything he knew about the bizarre incident that had occured in the village near Confosse.\u201cAn altar, huh. It sounds like something those guys would do. Morrison brooded for a moment before asking another question. \u201cThen, the snake monster. How did you know that thing caused the chaos?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026!\u201d Luisen was about to answer immediately, but then hesitated for a moment. If he said he saw the answer in the future, would this person believe that? There was a famous story about a saint that made a wish to God and, as a result, returned to the past. If the young lord were to say that something that had happened to a saint had happened to him, he didn\u2019t think that an inquisitor\u2013a deeply religious man\u2013would believe him.\u2018If I tell him the truth, he might get even angrier, thinking that I\u2019m trying to deceive him\u2026What should I do?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His mind went blank.\u201cDid you know that those people were creating new monsters? How did you come by that information?\u201d Morrison asked, again.That snake monster was a new man-made creation? That was certainly surprising, but Luisen couldn\u2019t answer. Morrison walked to the wall after realizing that Luisen avoided answering.He picked out one of the most horrible and gruesome appearing torture instruments\u2013it was hard to fathom what it could be used for.Bang!He slammed it down in front of the young lord, as if to show off the tool. The young lord trembled.\u201cN-No\u2026 It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to say anything\u2026\u201dEven if he were to speak, he didn\u2019t think that the other would believe him. Ah, should he just reveal everything? When Luisen hesitated, Morrison stared at the young lord quietly; the inquisitor\u2019s gaze seemed to urge the young lord to give a speedy answer. That raised the young lord\u2019s anxiety. Struck with fear that Morrison would point the torture apparatus at him, the young lord\u2019s mouth would no longer open.After trembling like that for a while, one question came to mind.\u2018\u2026Why is he just sitting still and staring at me?\u2019Luisen recalled how Carlton had interrogated Cullen. The mercenary did not wait for an answer nor did he ask questions multiple times. When it became clear that Cullen was hiding something, the mercenary immediately dragged the handyman to the opening and dunked him into the river. The mercenary was sure his victim would open his mouth anyway, so Carlton didn\u2019t waste any time in trying to soothe and assuage the man.Come to think of it, when Luisen wandered around the land, those who had something to gain from the young lord started the conversation with their fists. Morrison, on the other hand, had cultivated a dreadful atmosphere, as if he were going to do something gruesome, but the inquisitor had yet to place a finger on Luisen.\u2018\u2026Now that I think about it, why is he just talking to me?\u2019Was it because Morrison is a priest? No\u2013that can\u2019t be it. Priests loathe and hate heretics and cultists. Priests on the extreme end of those beliefs would be selected as inquisitors. There was no way the man was showing mercy.\u2018Still, there\u2019s no way\u2026that he\u2019s being lenient because he knows me.\u2019Luisen couldn\u2019t fathom what was in Morrison\u2019s innermost thoughts. \u2018There\u2019s a limit to my brain!\u2019 He thought. The young lord remembered two of the best people he had known in his life\u2013the one-armed pilgrim and Calrton. What would those two have done?Luisen tried to use his imagination. In his head, the two men\u2019s imaginary voices shouted as one: \u2018That guy\u2019s not sure either, so he\u2019s just flapping his mouth!\u2019Yes! That\u2019s it!Luisen felt enlightened.If Morrison was convinced that Luisen was a demon worshiper, he would not have been waiting for Luisen to wake up and explain the young lord\u2019s side of the story. He would have started torturing the young lord\u2019s unconscious body, forcing him to come to his senses. The inquisitor would have shaken and overwhelmed Luisen\u2019s senses without giving the young lord time to figure out what was happening.Morrison waited until fear had stacked to an appropriate intensity in the young lord. He kindly informed the other that he was an Inquisitor and explained why he suspected Luisen. Similarly, Morrison\u2019s question seemed like a tactic to obtain more information rather than to accuse the young lord of heresy.Luisen\u2019s head was spinning around. As if he had become the one-armed pilgrim or Carlton, the young lord could clearly see the other\u2019s intent. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m a demon-worshiper, right?\u201dThe solemn atmosphere in the room was disrupted by that one question. Morrison, at the center of the chilling vibe, was expressionless as if he hadn\u2019t heard the young lord, but Luisen could intuit that the man was flustered.Now that the young lord thought this far, Luisen was no longer afraid of this situation or Morrison\u2019s gaze. Luisen stretched his shoulders and raised his head. The young lord was in his underwear, and his face was a mess. His body had been tied up, and his appearance was unpleasant; however, that one action was enough to reveal the arrogance that had been an integral part of the young lord\u2019s life.\u201cYou know that I\u2019m not a demon-worshiper, but you\u2019re trying to get information out of me; you\u2019re setting the tone of the situation. Correct?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, no? You\u2019re confirming that you don\u2019t believe me to be a heretic by answering my questions.\u201d Luisen didn\u2019t let up and pressed on, spurred by his momentum. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching me on the ship, right? No wonder\u2013I felt like someone was staring at me. How was it? I\u2019m not a cultist, right? But, you think I know something. However, because I hid my identity, you didn\u2019t think I\u2019d answer if you had asked directly. That\u2019s why you wanted to set this mood. Inquisitors\u2026I suppose it\u2019s true that they\u2019re quite cruel to heretics, but they can\u2019t touch non-heretics, correct?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer me?\u201d Luisen looked Morrison in the eye. The winner of the short staring contest was the young lord.Morrison sighed and raised his hand. His expression returned to something familiar\u2013the kind merchant Luisen was familiar with. \u201cAh, you\u2019re more perceptive than I thought.\u201dLuisen\u2019s tension quickly released.\u2018My prediction was correct! Thank you, Sir Carlton\u2026One-armed Pilgrim! I\u2019d like to dedicate this honor to both of you!\u201dEven though the young lord was speaking so vigorously, Luisen was actually trembling; he thought he would die from anxiety. The General\u2019s \u2018poker face in any situation\u2019 lessons were of great help.\u2018General, you must still be suffering because of me. I\u2019ll listen carefully to you when I return.\u2019 Luisen, recalling everyone\u2019s faces, thanked them from the bottom of his heart.\u201cSo, who are you?\u201d\u00a01\u00a0Morrison asked.Luisen flicked his fingers, quite impetuously and annoyingly, \u201cUndo these first.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201d Morrison untied Luisen\u2019s hands and feet.Honestly, the young lord wanted to rest now because he was exhausted, but it would be a waste of his reputation as\u00a0 \u2018trash.\u2019 Luisen stood up, straining his trembling legs. He slapped Morrison on the cheek without hesitation. With a loud clap, the inquisitor\u2019s face turned away. The strong hit made Luisen\u2019s wrist tingle.\u201cWould you please forgive me for my mistake with this?\u201d The inquisitor asked.\u201cForgive you? I\u2019m going to make a formal complaint to the church. How dare you make me suffer such an insult\u2013and you want to get away with this with a simple slap on the cheek? I\u2019m going to visit the archbishop and tell him everything that you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re someone that can meet with the archbishop? Seriously, who are you?\u201d\u201cLuisen Anies. I\u2019m the guardian of the gold fields and one of the Great Lords.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026!\u201d Morrison exclaimed. \u201cYou look better in person than in portraits.\u201d\u201cI hear that a lot,\u201d Luisen said apathetically before sitting back down in his chair. \u201cI was on my way to the capital at the behest of his majesty. To think that I\u2019d be kidnapped on my way to fulfill my sacred duty of defending the kingdom and its sovereignty. I guess the church must have many complaints about the royal family.\u201d\u201cN-No. It would be troublesome for you to interpret it that way. I\u2019m just faithful to my duty\u2013this has nothing to do with politics. Besides, you acted quite suspiciously, right?\u201d\u201cNo? Not at all. Why blame me for your loss of common sense.\u201dHonestly, Luisen thought that even he would have misunderstood, but Luisen backed off from that line of questioning. Shamelessness was a common virtue for the nobility.Morrison soon realized that he had fallen into an awkward situation. He falsely threatened an innocent man\u2013someone who was one of the top five political powerhouses in the country at that!Although inquisitors weren\u2019t swayed by secular values and only followed God\u2019s word, the church couldn\u2019t be maintained by building atop clouds and drinking only morning dew. If they wanted to build on the kingdom\u2019s land, they needed to live in harmony with the royalty. It was foolish to pretend to have any sort of political power. Especially now, when the current king\u2019s life was about to end and the Great Lords\u2019 power authority was increasing.\u201cWhat can I do for you to let this slight pass?\u201d Morrison stood in front of Luisen. Their positions harkened back to the beginning of this conversation, but their relationship had completely reversed. Luisen now had the upper hand.\u201cThe people who have the ability to control monsters. Tell me everything you know about them.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the demon worshippers, yes?\u201dSo, he\u2019s saying that Ruger and his gang are demon worshippers. They belong to a heretical religion so influential that an inquisitor was chasing them. Ruger and cultism\u2013what an unfitting combination.\u2018Well, It\u2019s not like I know much about Ruger,.\u2019 Luisen worriedly groaned.\u201cBy the way, if you\u2019re the duke. The mercenary you were with\u2026is he perhaps Carlton? The first Prince\u2019s hands and feet?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cOh, so the rumor that was circulating on the streets about you two escaping together out of love wasn\u2019t completely off course?\u201d\u201cCan you spout nonsense in this situation? Huh?\u201d Luisen glared coldly at Morrison.\u201cNo, I truly mean it\u2026 In anycase, I can\u2019t beat that man, so please save me.\u201dWhat is this nonsense he\u2019s spewing now? Luisen opened his mouth to ask further, but the ceiling collapsed. At the same time, a big sword plunged through from above. Morrison narrowly blocked the initial attack; when the blade chipped, the inquisitor had to roll backwards. A familiar backside blocked Luisen\u2019s view, as if he were protecting the young lord.\u201cCarlton!\u201d\u2018I knew you\u2019d come looking for me!\u2019 Luisen hugged Carlton\u2019s waist, overjoyed to see the mercenary.Carlton flinched and trembled. \u201cLet go. First, I\u2019m going to beat up that bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cMy duke, please save me!\u201d Morrison begged.\u201cAs expected, he knows who we are. We can\u2019t let him live\u2026\u201d\u201cI told him\u2013it\u2019s fine. Calm down. There\u2019s still a lot I need to ask him.\u201d Luisen hugged Carlton even harder. Carlton froze like a man that had been cursed. Carlton\u2019s face looked grim, as if he were eager to break the inquisitor in two.As he watched the young lord gently clinging to his defender, Morrison\u2019s tongue clicked. \u201cAnd you said I was speaking nonsense! Ah\u2013I get it. By the way, are my men still alive? I should pick them up first\u2026before their corpses are found. Please excuse me for a moment.\u201d Morrison ran outside without looking back.He gave long-winded excuses, but they were certainly quite useful in escaping Carlton\u2019s wrath.\u201cCan we let him go like that?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll return anyway. He must still have many questions for me.\u201d Luisen loosened his hold when he saw Morrison was far away. Carlton turned back. Only then did the mercenary notice that Luisen was wearing only underwear. The anger that had subsided just a moment ago erupted like a volcano.\u2018Morrison, I\u2019m going to catch and kill you.\u2019 Carlton vowed.TL: I just had the biggest grin on my face this entire chapter. +1 to Luisen for his adorably shameless act (?).FootnotesEven though the English won\u2019t let me show this nuance, Morrison has returned to his incredibly polite demeanor. He\u2019s calling Luisen \u2018Sir\u2019 etc.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCarlton was perceptive and thought quickly on his feet. After seeing that Luisen was only in his underwear and looking around the room, he guessed what had happened.The young lord would have sat in that iron chair with his hands and feet tied; Morrison would have threatened him with torture tools. That man had placed someone who was already afraid of the dark into a dark room and bared him naked like a sinner. What humiliation.Carlton couldn\u2019t forgive Morrison even more. The mercenary\u2019s eyes flashed with bloodthirst.When Luisen saw the mercenary looking around, he rushed to grab the mercenary\u2019s hands. The young lord\u2019s hands were so cold it broke Carlton\u2019s heart.\u2018How anxious he must have been,\u2019 the mercenary thought. \u2018Is he trying to hold onto my hand so he doesn\u2019t stumble?\u2019The young lord looked so pitiful. How terrified must he have been, all alone in this room, to still continue to shiver even now.His head, which had been focused on his anger, cooled down; Carlton placed down his sword. At this moment, reassuring Luisen took priority over Morrison. The mercenary took off his cape and wrapped it around Luisen\u2019s shoulder. The early winter air was too cold for a naked body to endure, and the young lord\u2019s skinny shoulders were shaking.\u201cAre you hurt anywhere? Did that bastard do anything to you?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cAh, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m all good. That jerk couldn\u2019t even touch me.\u201dCarlton scooped up Luisen, cocooned in the cloak, and carefully examined the young lord\u2019s body, trailing his eyes up and down. He was checking for any injuries that were caused by his late appearance. Luisen, though, was unaware of the mercenary\u2019s feelings and squirmed.Fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem like the young lord was injured; and Luisen\u2019s eyes were still lively. Carlton was worried that the young lord would be in a state of shock, but, rather, Luisen looked vigorous and excited.Only after confirming that Luisen was healthy in both mind and body was Carlton relieved. Almost stumbling, he dragged the young lord down into an embrace. He leaned his forehead against the young lord\u2019s shoulder and slowly breathed in and out.It felt like he was thrown off a cloud, crashing into various things, and was barely rescued just before hitting the ground. The entire time Carlton searched for the young lord, he was afraid.Even when he was young\u2013even when he ran away from home and first started working as a mercenary\u2013Carlton was smaller and weaker then but, still, he had never been frightened. That man was always confident; he didn\u2019t know the definition of fear. He didn\u2019t doubt his own ability and regarded the world as a stage meant to support his feet.\u00a01But, the entire time he searched for Luisen, Carlton was pierced with fear. A hitherto unfelt terror\u2013something he did not feel even when dozens of blades were pointed at him\u2013dominated his entire being. He was afraid that he would never find Luisen or that he\u2019d arrive late and find the young lord wounded.Carlton was overwhelmed by this feeling. He constantly doubted whether or not he could find the young lord in time or if he was heading the correct way. His mind was full of terrible imagined delusions, and his heart was full of despair.Luisen also cautiously hugged Carlton\u2019s shoulders. When the mercenary felt long, white arms hugging him, he finally felt that his charge was returned to him, safe.Carlton closed his eyes and felt the young lord\u2019s body heat. Every time he breathed in, he breathed in Luisen\u2019s scent, which he had not yet become accustomed to. These sensations all worked together to give the mercenary some peace of mind; the fear that had dominated him earlier quickly dissipated like summer rain showers.\u2018So weird.\u2019This lack of confidence was so unlike him. He felt like another person\u2013a stranger. At a loss, Carlton simply hugged Luisen even tighter.\u201cI\u2019m so, so relieved that you\u2019re safe.\u201d If something had happened to Luisen, Carlton wouldn\u2019t be able to forgive himself for the rest of his life. Briefly losing the man had made him realize\u2026what it meant for Luisen to not be by his side.Now that he could think rationally, Carlton realized that Morrison may not have intended to hurt Luisen in the first place. However, that didn\u2019t lighten the mercenary\u2019s heart. Morrison and his men were no match for him, even if they rushed at him all at once. They weren\u2019t caught in a meticulous scheme, nor were they overwhelmed by an immense, formidable force. He was simply caught off guard.Even if the young lord was disappointed in Carlton\u2019s lack of attention in this instance, there was nothing to be done. After all, Carlton also couldn\u2019t stand being so pathetic. However, he didn\u2019t want to see Luisen\u2019s disappointed expression, so the mercenary hugged him tighter. He could only bow his head as he nuzzled up to Luisen, someone much smaller and thinner than him. A low sigh, filled with shame, escaped him. \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019ll never leave you alone. Never.\u201dA sense of deep remorse could be felt within Carlton\u2019s suppressed voice. The man\u2019s uncharacteristically dispirited appearance inwardly baffled Luisen. What a sullen, melancholy voice. The young lord felt sorry for the usually confident man, but what could he say? The mercenary was berating himself over a supposed mistake. That\u2019s how much the mercenary worried and suffered for him.Luisen opened his mouth, thinking he should soothe the man, \u201cAt first I was a bit scared. So I answered the inquisitor\u2019s every question. In the midst of all that, I thought of you.\u201d\u201cYou thought of me?\u201d\u201cYes. Things like, \u2018What you would have done in my position?.'\u201d\u201c\u2026My methods would be difficult for my duke to emulate, though.\u201d Carlton would smash everything, pummel Morrison\u2019s head, and then escape.Luisen burst into laughter at Carlton\u2019s words, \u201cNo, not that. I meant your quick wit. You\u2019re the cleverest man I\u2019ve ever met, so I tried to see the situation from your perspective.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cThanks to that, I saw through Morrison\u2019s bluff. Your voice echoed in my head; I\u2019ve learned a lot from you during our time together.\u201d Of course, Luisen thought of the one-armed pilgrim as well, but he was mum on that subject since he thought Carlton would be jealous.\u201cYour words bore into my brain more than I thought. I was alone, but it didn\u2019t feel like I was alone.\u201d On second thought, the fact that the mercenary\u2019s voice could be heard inside his brain was so funny that Luisen chuckled.At some point during this conversation, Carlton raised his head and looked into the young lord\u2019s face. \u2018I helped you? You thought of me in that kind of situation?\u2019What an unexpected response. Carlton had never had anyone rely on him this much. The mercenary\u2019s heart was so touched. How could Luisen so easily turn Carlton\u2019s heart upside down? As the mercenary looked at Luisen smiling at ease, the mercenary felt emotional.Carlton kissed Luisen impulsively. How did this man always impress him in such unexpected ways? Luisen was always a surprising person, and that made him absolutely lovable.Luisen opened his eyes wide, blinked a few times, before sinking into other man\u2019s hold. The young lord\u2019s round eyes and long lashes made Carlton even more excited. As Carlton kissed deeper, Luisen furrowed his brows\u2013perhaps the mercenary was being too much. Still, the young lord\u2019s cheeks were flushed, flaming red.Carlton kept note of all those subtle changes\u2013each flush or flutter did not escape his observant eyes. There was nothing to him that didn\u2019t seem pretty. The young lord\u2019s hastily chopped blonde hair, his soft cheeks, his eyes that looked highly privileged\u2013as if they have never experienced hardships\u2013and yet also seemed deeply reflective\u2026 Everything.How strange. The mercenary didn\u2019t like the young lord\u2019s face at first. Everything about Luisen agitated Carlton\u2019s inferiority complex\u2026but now, the mercenary was pleased by the young lord\u2019s features.\u2018I like it. I like him.\u2019 Carlton thought, almost subconsciously. The more he thought about it, the more his heart felt overwhelmed. The more he deepened his kiss. The mercenary had an urge to delve further\u2013to consume the other\u2019s insides\u2013and to become one. Carlton\u2019s hands stroked up and down Luisen\u2019s body.\u201cW-Wait!\u201d embarrassed, Luisen pushed at Carlton\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when Morrison will return; it wouldn\u2019t be ideal to go any further than this.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care if a punk like that comes.\u201d Carlton was about to lean to the young lord\u2019s lips again, but Luisen desperately blocked him.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do this next to these torture devices.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Carlton withdrew, sadly.\u201cStill, it\u2019s cold, so don\u2019t go too far from me.\u201d Luisen slipped his arm into the crook of the mercenary\u2019s elbow.\u2018How cute,\u2019 Carlton thought. The young lord seemed embarrassed to cling to him even though he took the initiative; the young lord\u2019s eyes looked everywhere except at him. \u2018I like this as well.\u2019Like?\u2018Come to think of it, what did I just think a little while ago?\u2019 Carlton just realized. Since just a while ago, he\u2019s been constantly thinking how much he likes the young lord\u2013how much he utterly adores Luisen.Only then did he realize he was acting foolishly, quite unlike himself. The fact that he considered Luisen the single most important person in the world\u2013his hatred for the one-armed pilgrim or Morrison. His emotions vacillated between two extremes.That is to say\u2026he had fallen in love with Luisen. This was a first for the mercenary.He had always said that those that fall in love turn into idiots\u2026He supposed he was the idiot now!The sudden realization threw Carlton\u2019s mind into chaos.***Luisen and Carlton exited the torture chamber, which was located in a seemingly ordinary cabin. The cabin\u2019s ceiling looked dangerously on the verge of collapse. Waiting for the inquisitor to return, the two settled down on a fallen tree a short distance away.Luisen told Carlton what had happened with Morrison. Throughout his entire tirade, the mercenary stared at the young lord passionately.\u201cWhat is it? Are you curious about something?\u201d Luisen cut himself off and turned to his companion. Carlton avoided the young lord\u2019s prying eyes, as if the mercenary hadn\u2019t been staring in the first place.\u2018Why is he suddenly acting that way?\u2019 Luisen thought.It felt like the other had changed his behavior after their passionate kiss. The mercenary didn\u2019t even want to make eye contact with him. Despite that, the mercenary persistently followed him and clung to his side.Luisen tried seriously to consider what was wrong with Carlton\u2013trying to see from the mercenary\u2019s point of view. However, he couldn\u2019t quite gauge if this had all been pure coincidence or if the young lord was simply unversed in Carlton-ology.FootnotesOr, to be idiomatic, the world was his oyster!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Well, it\u2019s not the first time Carlton has acted strangely.\u2019 Luisen neatly gave up on contemplating the issue further and continued to talk about Morrison.\u201cYou said he was an inquisitor? They really exist?\u201d The mercenary asked.\u201c\u2026I was utterly surprised as well. I\u2019ve heard of them, but I never thought I\u2019d meet one in my lifetime\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors that they\u2019re complete lunatics\u2026\u201d Carlton had heard of these heretic-chasing inquisitors; they were legends. Once again, his heart sank. If, at least, a bandit were to kidnap the young lord, then Luisen would have money or status to leverage against them. In this situation, Luisen was as defenseless as an infant; neither money nor power would work on the church.\u201cI apologize\u2013if I had been more careful, this wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Carlton said.It wasn\u2019t just Carlton\u2019s fault. In fact, Luisen was well aware that he had behaved recklessly around Morrison, swayed by his previous good memories of the man.\u2018However, who could have imagined that the kind merchant who helped me was an inquisitor for heretics?\u2019Inquisitors weren\u2019t all that common. Luisen, while living as a noble in the kingdom\u2019s capital, met various priests, but inquisitors were beings that only lived in stories. Ordinary folk would not even know they existed.\u201cBesides, you\u2019re quite tired, right? No matter how keen you may be, it would be hard to uncover an inquisitor,\u201d Luisen said.In the first place, inquisitors wouldn\u2019t reveal themselves like this. They would go deep into the shadows to catch the heretics that often moved in secret\u2013in the background. Anyway, this organization had operated for hundreds of years, and its members studied how to disguise their identity and deceive others. There was nothing they could do. \u201cIn any case, this is a chance to know more about Ruger\u2019s gang. Let\u2019s shake Morrison for all his information.\u201d\u201cOf course, we should,\u201d Carlton replied, resolutely. Simultaneously, he did his best to not make eye contact with the young lord.Not realizing that Carlton would fall into chaos after being made aware of his sudden first love, Luisen was eager for this awkwardness to be resolved before Morrison\u2019s return. He just knew what sort of comments the inquisitor would make while observing their atmosphere.As they waited docilely, Morrison and his men came to the cabin. All of Morrison\u2019s men sported injuries, but none of them were life-threatening. Because finding Luisen was his top priority, it seemed as if the mercenary showed some mercy in his subjugation and consequential interrogation of the men.\u201cWhen all this is over, I believe we\u2019ll have to concentrate on resting and recovering for a while. You\u2019ve wounded us deeply.\u201d Morrison said, meaningfully.\u201cYou should be grateful to be alive,\u201d Carlton replied, without backing down\u2013he spoke bluntly as per usual.Luisen was relieved. He was worried that the mercenary would remain dazed and absentminded, but, when Morrison returned, the mercenary returned to his usual overwhelming, intimidating form, placing plenty of pressure on the inquisitor and his men.Sitting down, Luisen could now comfortably hear Morrison\u2019s explanation.***Morrison, The Inquisitor.That man was chasing the trail of a demon worshiper who was recently rising in influence.While the South was still wrapped up in a power struggle\u2013when the political atmosphere was still dubious, he came to the region disguised as a merchant. However, the more he chased, the more the trail became cold. Later, he was left confused as to where he should go.While contemplating his next move, he came to Mittil to obtain more information and to report to his superiors. That was when he found Luisen.A false pilgrim exuding an unclean aura.\u201cHow did you know I was a fake?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cEach pilgrim\u2019s pass has slightly different designs. All inquisitors have those memorized.\u201dLuisen examined the pass Morrison returned to him. \u2018Looking at his\u2026what is he\u2026supposed to memorize\u2026?\u2019\u2018I can\u2019t tell, even as I look at it. Truly, he is an elite priest in the church.\u2019 Luisen neatly gave up trying.\u201cI was going to arrest you on the spot, but I changed my mind and decided to observe instead. It seemed like you two were traveling with a purpose.\u201d Morrison wondered if the two were going to meet some colleagues or return to their base. He followed Luisen, judging that he could find out more information if he stayed by the young lord\u2019s side. As he observed them, he found out that Luisen and Carlton needed a fast boat; the inquisitor was able to use that desire to lure the two into his party.\u201cI was scrutinizing you carefully from the side, and, at that moment, the ghoul appeared. Those things don\u2019t occur after normal deaths. Black magic or curses\u2026those that die from those heretical powers become ghouls.\u201d\u00a0 It was only then that the inquisitor realized Cullen had been enticed by a demon worshiper. Because the relic Luisen held was drenched in an evil aura\u2013the evil power was so strong, the inquisitor noticed the relatively weak snake monster a step too late.Morrison looked hatefully at the demon worshiper\u2019s dagger In Luisen\u2019s point of view, the knife simply looked crude, but the young lord supposed the inquisitor saw the world with different eyes.However, Cullen was merely a small fry. If the handyman had more time, he may have become one of the demon worshipers; that had yet to happen, though. Rather than to alert Luisen of his identity as an inquisitor by trying to arrest Cullen, Morisson decided it would be better to feign ignorance and observe the young lord\u2019s actions.After that long night\u2013the night where the circumstances relating to the snake monster were revealed\u2013Morrison constantly observed the young lord and mercenary, who rarely came out of their room.\u201cY-You watched everything?\u201d Luisen asked, flustered.\u201cYes, everything.\u201d Morrison looked meaningfully at Luisen. His gaze seemed to say, \u2018Are you really going to say I\u2019m delusional about your relationship at this point? No, right?\u2019\u2018Honestly, just because we kissed we\u2019re not lovers\u2026nor are we in love\u2026\u2019 Luisen\u2019s face flushed from embarrassment. \u201cThis is an invasion of privacy, you know.\u201d\u201cIt was my job. My misunderstanding was completely cleared up. Rather than being demon worshipers, I found out you were hostile to them.\u201d\u201cThen, you kidnapped me to learn the information you lacked?\u201d\u201cI said I\u2019m sorry, didn\u2019t I? We were desperate as well. Those people are evil.\u201dLuisen fixed his posture and began to listen to Morrison in earnest.The inquisitor continued, \u201cDevil worshipers. Literally, that refers to people who worship demons\u2026the Devil. Alternatively, you could refer to them as Black Wizards.\u201dDevil or demon worshiping was a heretic religion with as much history as the current reigning church. The methods of worship varied slightly from time to time, but this faction seemed to use magic.They were people who had striven to find the meaning of truth in this world through magical research and, at some point, turned to demon worshiping. They believed that the Devil was a prophet who would destroy the false world and lead them to the truth. All of those followers followed the devil\u2026and they believed that they had gained special powers by worshiping the devil.\u201cFor example, controlling monsters or casting curses. We call that black magic.\u201d\u201cAnd, there isn\u2019t really a devil?\u201d\u201cHow could something like that exist in this world?\u201d Morrison snorted. His tone conveyed the convictions of a man who had deep faith in and was devoted to God. \u201cIn anycase, these demon worshippers use unusual magic. The problem, though, is their delusions: they believe that the more they please the Devil in hell, the more power they\u2019ll gain. That\u2019s why they\u2019re doing these sorts of crazy things\u2026to please the devil. They make altars and present all sorts of offerings.\u201dThe more terrible their schemes\u2013the more frightened and confused they made their audience\u2013the more effective their offerings would be. Or so they claimed.\u201cThe results of their misdoings are quite visible and conspicuous, so their religion has persisted quite tenaciously. Their modus operandi is quite gruesome and dark as well. They do all sorts of evil deeds resulting in enormous damage, but, since they\u2019re not interested in recruiting others to their cause, it\u2019s hard to catch onto their trail.\u201d\"\"After hearing Morrison\u2019s explanation, Luisen was lost in thought momentarily. \u201cSo\u2026 the reason these people are doing such strange deeds are\u2026 because they want to drop the world into chaos?\u201d\u2018Are you saying that such crazy, mentally deranged people that can usually only be seen in third-rate power fantasy novels actually exist in this world? In my timeline?\u2019 Luisen could hardly believe in their existence.The amusing banter he exchanged with Carlton was the truth! Dear lord, the world is doomed.Luisen looked at the mercenary, who was furrowing his brows. It seemed like his companion was feeling the same way.\u201cHonestly, but who in the world does that these days\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the kind of world we live in. The civil war made a mess, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cThis is a little hard to believe. I keep thinking that, even though you\u2019re the inquisitor, that you\u2019re joking with me.\u201d\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d joke about these heathens?\u201d Morrison\u2019s gravely serious face was a little frightening.Luisen stealthily made his way to Carlton\u2019s side. The mercenary took the young lord\u2019s hand and stepped forward, as if to hide the other behind him. Only then did Luisen\u2019s flinching heart calm down. Morrison threw them a meaningful smile, but the two could easily ignore that look.\u201cNow then, I think I\u2019d like to hear from the Duke.\u201d Morrison said.At those words, Luisen made eye contact with the mercenary. Carlton nodded slightly. At that signal, the young lord also began to talk about what he had been through.Starting with the attack, the village that had been wiped from existence by monsters, the altar underneath the giant centipede burrow, etc. The young lord spoke for a long while, but Morrison listened to the whole story carefully without ever losing concentration.\u201cHow did you\u2026 How could you get tangled up so often with that slippery group?\u201d Morrison exclaimed, startled. That man hadn\u2019t run into Ruger\u2019s gang even once, despite the fact that he had been chasing after them. He couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the heavens were playing a prank by tying Luisen and the demon worshiper\u2019s fates together.\u2018Before regression\u2026 ghouls appeared here and there\u2013everywhere.\u2019 Luisen had thought ghouls were simply popular in the northern regions, but they may, in fact, be a sign of the demon-worshiper\u2019s increased influence. Furthermore, the reason why no bodies were left in the makeshift bandit\u2019s village may be that those that were attacked by monsters all became ghouls. The corpses themselves may have walked away.The future was far bleaker than Luisen had realized. The young lord inadvertently thought back to the one-armed pilgrim. The pilgrim had solved many strange cases even after the snake monster incident. Did he know about the existence of the demon worshipers? Somehow, the young lord thought the other would have known.This conversation with Morrison was truly useful. It filled the gap between Luisen\u2019s memory and the inquisitor\u2019s information, making the young lord look back on future events that he had simply passed by in his ignorance.PR: Morrison is like that over-sharing aunt at a family gathering who wants to announce loudly that the teenager\u2019s new love interest, whom they\u2019ve brought to meet the family for the first time, is soooooo cute and they\u2019re such a cuuuuuteeee couple, and everyone wants to hide under the sofa from the awkwardness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018That was all their doing.\u2019No wonder everything went to hell so fast. Both he and the Kingdom.Before his regression, Luisen lived a miserable nomadic life, wandering around the kingdom. He had lost everything and simply lived life, unable to kill himself\u2026However, Luisen wasn\u2019t the only one. Tragedy had befallen everyone\u2013all were equal\u2013in the kingdom. Faith and trust, which were mainstays in civilized society, became a luxury; human dignity had fallen to the ground. People were sold for small sacks barely filled with flour.After watching that chaos firsthand, the young lord could never forgive them.Luisen clenched his fist inadvertently; even without that extra force, his pale hands became even whiter. Carlton forgot his own embarrassment and looked at the young lord, worried.\u201cWhat will you two do now? We\u2019re thinking about looking around the South one more time, looking for clues that we may have missed. If you\u2019d like, let\u2019s travel together. I\u2019ll escort you safely back to the duchy,\u201d Morrison said.\u201cNo. I\u2019ll travel to the royal palace as scheduled.\u201d\u201cThe journey will be tougher than it is now. That region has become dangerous in the aftermath of the civil war.\u201dLuisen, though, was resolute. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the royal palace and meet the prince. I\u2019ll regain my property and army and exercise my legitimate right as a lord.\u201dThat alone should solidify his position as one of the Great Lords and Duke. Luisen was keenly aware that his nobility and birth status was one of his greatest strengths.The demon worshippers; the people behind Ruger. They were obviously aiming for the young lord and were hoping for his downfall.\"\"That was why Luisen thought he should strive to consolidate his power even more. He still had no idea what their goals were, and how his downfall played into their motivations, but he was sure that his return to power was the most efficient way to interfere with their plans.\u201cIf you\u2019re so determined\u2026then alright. I\u2019ll follow the Duke as well,\u201d Morrison offered.\u201cYou will? Why?\u201d\u201cNothing is coincidence in this world. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happenstance that the Duke, while disguised as a pilgrim, keeps on getting involved with those men. If I follow the Duke, I\u2019m sure to face their main operative body.\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll continue to pose as a pilgrim, correct? I\u2019ll be of help in that regard.\u201dThat made sense. In addition to restoring his secret identity, Morrison could add more power to their party. Besides, the man could sense plots that they might have unknowingly dismissed.\u2018What should I do?\u2019 Luisen looked at Carlton. The mercenary glared, conveying his dire loathing, at the inquisitor.\u2018Is he against it?\u2019 the young lord thought.No matter how much help the inquisitor may be, the young lord didn\u2019t want to force the issue if Carlton was against it.As Luisen tried to refuse, Carlton spoke first. \u201cFine.\u201d\u201cHuh? You\u2019re not against it?\u201d asked Morrison.\u201cI don\u2019t like you,\u201d Carleton replied. \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want anyone else to squeeze in between me and the Duke either. However, if you\u2019re on the church\u2019s side, I\u2019ll be able to escort the Duke to the capital more safely.\u201dThat is to say, the mercenary wasn\u2019t going to be stubborn. In that one instance, Luisen could feel in the mercenary\u2019s words his exclusive desire for the young lord and a caring heart. The young lord flushed.Isn\u2019t it against the rules to advance on his heart so suddenly like that? Carlton shook Luisen\u2019s heart so mercilessly. The young lord had the urge to drag the mercenary into his arms and scold him for saying something so praise-worthy, but Morrison and his men would bear witness to that. So, the young lord had to endure. Suddenly, he wanted to refuse the inquisitor\u2019s request.Morrison was quick to notice those feelings. \u201cAhem. Then, I\u2019ll see my men off, take care of some business, and then I\u2019ll follow you. I have to contact the church; you two should go on ahead.\u201dThen, he quickly led his men away. Although it was a little embarrassing to see the inquisitor clear out so purposefully, Luisen was fine. He was originally quite thick-skinned anyway.He sighed heavily and leaned against Carlton. He thought the mercenary would avoid his touch since the other was acting weird until just recently. However, Carlton received his touch with his chest, cushioning the young lord.\u201cHa, my life has somehow become entangled with such crazy people.\u201d The young lord lamented.Carlton gently patted Luisen\u2019s hair to console him. Luisen lifted his head once his upset stomach was soothed in the mercenary\u2019s embrace. The other was looking back at him anxiously.\u201cAre you worried?\u201d Carlton asked.\u201cNo.\u201dApart from being furious at the demon worshippers, he wasn\u2019t too worried. Carlton would destroy even the devil if he were to ascend to this realm. The answer tumbled out of the young lord\u2019s mouth easily because he had unshakeable faith in the mercenary. \u201cIt would be more refreshing to know what they\u2019re doing. The unknown is scary, but, now that we have more knowledge, there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of, right?\u201dWhen Luisen referenced Carlton\u2019s previous words, the mercenary\u2019s eyes widened before curving into an eye smile. He laughed\u2013a delightful sound that suited his young age.Luisen\u2019s heart was excited. Soon enough, a low, pleased rumble resonated in the mercenary\u2019s chest\u2013a sound that seemed to echo throughout the woods. For some reason, Luisen felt inflamed; he became more and more conscious of the firm arms holding him.\u2018We\u2019re outside, but\u2026 We\u2019re in the forest. And there\u2019s no people around\u2026\u2019Indoors or outdoors, as he had already made a name for himself as trash in the capital anyway, Luisen gave into temptation and hugged at the mercenary\u2019s neck. \u201cNo, on second thought, I think I\u2019m very worried. I want someone to comfort me.\u201dCarlton smiled and bit the young lord\u2019s lip lightly. After the two smacked lips a few times, Luisen opened his mouth; the kiss deepened. Carlton came at Luisen as if to devour the young lord; the young lord\u2019s body was gradually pushed back until he hit a tree.There was a resulting thudding sound, but neither Luisen nor Carlton paid it any mind. All their attention was directed at each other. Luisen touched Carlton\u2019s back and taut arms to his heart\u2019s content. Carlton\u2019s hands moved without hesitation; the mercenary rushed to place his hands impatiently under the young lord\u2019s loose tunic. Luisen trembled slightly as the other\u2019s cold hands touched his sensitive sides.\u201cMmmnn.\u201dShallow breaths and quiet moans spread throughout the tranquil forest. As soon as the young lord thought it was a little embarrassing, he heard an unfamiliar sound mixed into the equation.Carlton reacted first. The mercenary turned his head and looked towards where he heard the sound. Beyond the forest, three or four wild boars with yellow eyes were staring at them. A group of gigantic, horned, bloodthirsty monsters.At least if those things were other people, the unexpected audience could feign ignorance and continue onwards. Unfortunately, it was futile to expect such consideration from monsters. The group was ready to bounce, growling and exhaling steam.\u201cWhy at a time like this\u2026?\u201d Carlton gritted his teeth. Luisen agreed with the sentiment a hundred times over. It really does seem like the monster population was on the rise; no matter how remote this cabin may be, a monster still appeared in an area inhabited by humans while also taking the security situation into account. But what could they do? The monsters had no intent of backing down.\u201cPlease stay back,\u201d The mercenary murmured.\u201c\u2026Alright.\u201d Luisen backed away.Carlton brandished his incredible strength and finished off the monsters in record time. However, the lifeless appearance of the monsters did not revive the cooled embers. The two had to leave quickly; the other monsters that smelled blood may come\u2026***That night: In the forest at the foot of a hill in the outskirts of Mittil.Three men in dark red robes gathered. Between them, a human sacrifice who had their hands and feet tied, was plopped onto the ground.The men chanted strange spells and sang out loud. This all sounded similar to holy worship in church, but, at the center of their worshiping, was a bust of a goat with four horns and three eyes.Ohhhhhhhh~Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh~A man raised his dagger high.Before the sacrifice could scream, his body was brutally massacred, chunks of flesh splaying out; hot steam wafted up into the cold night air.One of the men observing the ceremony slipped away. When he reached the river, he haphazardly threw off his dark-red robe. The moonlight landed softly on the dark-red armor hidden under his clothes. Red hair fluttered in the riverside wind.Ruger looked at the distant lights. Anxiety flooded him as he imagined how Luisen was on board of one of those boats that were moving east along the river.Ruger departed the duchy a few days ago, predicting that the young lord would come by Confosse. When he arrived at the city, rumors of a hero who had repelled the evil, giant centipede and rescued the abducted women were hot on the streets.A pilgrim that had covered his face but exuded an aristocratic aura; a ridiculously strong mercenary. When Ruger heard about that group, he couldn\u2019t help but think of Luisen and Carlton.But that couldn\u2019t be them.Ruger knew Luisen didn\u2019t have the talent to imitate a pilgrim. The young lord had not undergone the basic theology education that all aristocrats should have received; he didn\u2019t even remember simple prayers when he attended church every New Year.If he were to pose as a pilgrim, he\u2019d be asked to lead a prayer and, sometimes, would be asked theological questions. How could Luisen overcome all of that? Although the young lord had changed significantly in the recent year, it was impossible to gain such advanced knowledge in a short period of time. So, Ruger dismissed the possibility that Luisen had disguised himself as a pilgrim.However, he had just received information confirming that Luisen had gone past Confosse. While searching everywhere for the lord in the city, Ruger had found a man selling blonde hair. Though the young lord wasn\u2019t the only blonde in the world, Ruger had recognized it straight away.Ruger stroked the bundle of hair carefully, as if he were combing through the young lord\u2019s hair. It felt soft to the touch; Ruger was momentarily lost in thought.Luisen was someone that was born with an outstanding appearance\u2013the best in the world\u2013but the man was indifferent to his own appearance. Ruger was the one to coax the young lord into growing his hair when the young lord wanted to cut it all off. The young lord couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with long hair. Ruger had carefully brushed each golden strange, every day over the past few years; he couldn\u2019t possibly mistake the strands\u2019 origin.Ruger carefully placed the hair in a pouch and then, so as to not lose it, placed the pouch carefully in his embrace.He could find Luisen with this.TL: Not gonna lie, trying to figure out how to translate \u201critualistic moaning chant sounds\u201d was too difficult. \u201cOhhhhhhhh\u201d sounded so dumb\u2026but that\u2019s all I had ya\u2019ll\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Ruger found his closest companion; that man called himself the ninth worshiper.The ninth worshiper was in Mittil. When Ruger asked why the man, who was supposed to be stationed in a village near Confosse, went to the aforementioned city, the worshiper said that he was chasing a pilgrim who had ruined his carefully crafted ritual. Perhaps that pilgrim was the protagonist in the rumors that had Confosse in a huge stir. Feeling that the two were strangely intertwined, Ruger had traveled all the way to Mittil.The ninth admirer was just about to cross the river when Ruger arrived. He stated that the pilgrim he was chasing had escaped by boat just last night.Ruger coaxed that man and asked him to find Luisen using the hair that the attendant had gathered. He had even brought the sacrificial materials the man had demanded: a young, weak, and desperate living person.Though, by now, that person would have served his purpose and was no longer a living sacrifice.\u201cLeaving in the middle of a rite? How arrogant.\u201dThe ninth worshiper and the eleventh worshiper followed him. The eleventh worshiper was a man that ran with Direwolves and exterminated the village of refugees hiding in the forest. That man moved according to his devotional duties rather than being led by his own interests.Blood and dirt were splattered all over the two men\u2019s robes and bodies.\u00a0 What they had done was clear. Their faces were filled with joy, and their hands trembled with excitement.\u201cThe way you guys go about it is disgusting\u2013you should at least make it pleasant if you want others to watch,\u201d Ruger said sarcastically.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who brought the sacrifice and asked for our help. Why act all noble now? Did you, of all people, dream of becoming a knight?\u201dThe worshipers were sarcastic right back as if they had heard something incredibly ridiculous. Ruger\u2019s expression immediately distorted. It was true\u2013he had once aspired to become a knight. That dream was an indelible wound; the attendant would not suffer anyone poking that scar. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for my father, I wouldn\u2019t be rubbing shoulders with you people.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even have a father. Your mother didn\u2019t have a husband, after all. Or, was it something like this\u2013a virgin had a baby so she was pregnant with the devil\u2019s child? Then, I suppose we\u2019re the ones that have to take care of and rear you!\u201d The worshipers giggled at Ruger.Ruger clenched his fists. He would strangle them if he could, but that wasn\u2019t possible.After a good laugh, the two patted Ruger on the shoulder, \u201cWe\u2019re just joking. Of course we know who your father is. He\u2019s our only patron after all. That\u2019s why we\u2019re helping you.\u201d\u201cNow, I\u2019ll tell you where the duke is headed.\u201d The ninth worshiper\u2019s eyes turned red. The blood on his body quickly transformed into black smoke, climbed up his body, and wrapped around his arms. The wisps turned into a finger pointed towards the river before stretching away into the distance. \u201cSo he\u2019s on that river. It just so happens that he\u2019s on the same boat with the pilgrim that I\u2019ve been looking for.\u201dRuger recalled his map; Luisen\u2019s movements were quickly drawn with his mind\u2019s eye. \u2018I\u2019ll catch up with you in no time.\u2019Though the distance between them was wide, the attendant thought he could catch up quickly with the worshiper\u2019s power. \u2018No, rather, I\u2019ll go ahead a little.\u2019Carlton wasn\u2019t a pushover; he wasn\u2019t an easy target to pursue or to defeat. Rather, it would be better to set a trap in Luisen and Carlton\u2019s path, separate the two, then devour them both all at once. Taking advantage of a beneficial position and a surprise attack would allow the attendant to perfectly capture the young lord.\u201cLet\u2019s go together. I think the pilgrim I was searching for is in that direction as well. I must take revenge for the deaths of my carefully reared children,\u201d the ninth worshiper said.His children were the pair of giant centipedes that turned Confosse upside down. Actually, Ruger was the one who rescued the baby centipedes and gave them to him. At that time, those centipedes were definitely ordinary; the attendant couldn\u2019t figure out how the worshiper raised them into such huge monsters.Ruger was working with them, but he only really followed orders. He didn\u2019t really know everything about their cause and methods\u2026taming and creating monsters\u2026 all that. He only knew that they used strange powers.The night worshiper chanted a spell and out popped a monster he had prepared in advance. The monster\u2013a giant eel\u2013meandered through the water before coming back with a small boat in its mouth.\u2018Did he personally make this one too?\u2019 Ruger quietly observed the eel.\u201cShall I make you one too?\u201d the eleventh worshiper said. The worshippers giggled once more when the attendant ignored them. \u201cYou have a gift.\u201dRuger ignored those words and returned to the ritual site. Bloodstains remained intact on the ground, but the bones had somehow disappeared. He tamped down his disgust as he picked up the golden locks of Luisen\u2019s hair, which had been placed underneath the goat bust.Strands of hair drenched with the blood of an innocent victim.It had served its purpose, but the attendant didn\u2019t want to leave it like this. Ruger diligently wiped away the blood with a handkerchief.\u2018I took so much care to grow this out.\u2019Ruger remembered how, one morning, his ward rolled around hungover in his pajamas. He oiled the young lord\u2019s hair and brushed it carefully. Those were happier times.What would have happened if he weren\u2019t a spy? Perhaps he might still be touching Luisen\u2019s hair. At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t be forcing his young lord to cut his hair to sell it for travel expenses. Carlton, that bastard, was too incompetent.\u2018If it were me, I would never have let that happen.\u2019 He was confident he could protect Luisen\u2013keep the young lord safe\u2013better than anyone else. However, these were all futile fantasies. Ruger was a spy from the very beginning; his real master was someone else.It was only at the command of his real owner that he became Luisen\u2019s servant. Somehow, he had gotten attached, so the attendant often imagined what it would have been like to be the young duke\u2019s knight. But, in the end, it was all meaningless.No matter how his heart may be swayed towards Luisen, he had to obey his master\u2019s orders. Like a knight loyally serving his lord. Although he did not officially become certified as a knight, the knightly teachings and code were always within Ruger\u2019s mind.As he was commanded, he would take the Duke of Anies.He only followed Luisen based on his commands\u2013nothing more, nothing less.Despite repeating those vows, Ruger still cherished that blood-soaked hair contained in his pocket. Looking back, the attendant saw the two worshipers giggling back at him.***The Anies duchy at a similar time:Despite the lord\u2019s unprecedented disappearance, the people at the duchy weren\u2019t frustrated nor desperate. They had prepared for the winter in advance and had been working through the backlog of work to solidify the duchy.There was a shortage of manpower and capital, but no one complained. During the past month\u2019s crisis, Luisen held out for the duchy, so the denizens garnered strength as they recalled the young lord\u2019s strong visage.At the heart of this endeavor was the general. At times like this, he maintained his role as a steady anchor without wavering; he believed he could only help Luisen by returning the duchy to its former strength. However, today\u2019s news was a little too much for him.The general pressed hard at his two eyes. In his hand was a reply to a letter he sent to the king.A considerable number of personnel had been relocated from the duchy to support the second prince; those men were still unable to return after they had been taken prisoner. As a result, even though Luisen had disappeared, he couldn\u2019t properly arrange a search party. So, the duchy informed the king of Luisen\u2019s disappearance and requested for the return of some of those prisoners.He received a rejection. To summarize the king\u2019s response\u2013the letter was nearly two pages long\u2013returning the prisoners was impossible unless Luisen himself pledges and proves his loyalty to the king and requests their return. In other words, the king was dissuading the duchy from even searching for the young duke.\u2018How could this be?! Does his Highness mean to say that he cares not what happens to the Duke now\u2026?!\u2019Despite the fact that Luisen sided with the second prince, he was still one of the few Great Lords. If he wasn\u2019t planning on abandoning the South, the king couldn\u2019t treat Luisen like this. The general pressed down on his throbbing eyes when someone else came into his office. Judging by the rough and heavy footsteps, it must be one of Carlton\u2019s subordinates and not one of the duchy\u2019s vassals.Because the general didn\u2019t believe Ruger\u2019s words from the beginning, when he caught Carlton\u2019s men, he treated them politely and asked them for further details.After meeting the first prince\u2019s messenger, Carlton went ahead to pick up Luisen; the mercenary\u2019s men followed. They had informed him of the monster\u2019s attack, the ensuing fierce battle, and that they had found traces of someone trying to purposefully drag Luisen away.The general learned that Carlton was travelling with Luisen\u2013both people were safe and on the way to the capital. The men had even told him that Ruger had lied.As soon as the general heard everything, he released Carlton\u2019s men and tried to capture Ruger. Though they had failed to capture the attendant, the men remained in the duke\u2019s castle and lent the people their strength. Because Carlton was with Luisen, the duchy\u2019s retainers and the men were naturally in the same boat.The duchy even helped to bring together Carlton\u2019s scattered soldiers; the men were filling in for the duchy\u2019s scarcity. Now, there was nothing more pleasant than their visit.\u201cWe have news from the royal city.\u201dThe general\u2019s eyes opened wide at those words. The first thing that he did with the duchy\u2019s power was to contact an informant that Carlton had planted within the royal castle. It seems that their efforts produced results faster than expected.\u201cWhat did they say? What are the capital\u2019s noble\u2019s reactions to the Duke\u2019s disappearance?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing very good. Apparently, there\u2019s this rumor going around.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThat the Southern Great Lord will be replaced.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d the general roared. Honestly\u2013the Duke of Anies is still alive and well. What are these ridiculous rumors circulating in the capital? \u201cWhat about his Highness? Is he really letting such an insolent rumor stand?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s very rare for the King to hold back his thoughts. It seems the first prince is taking care of all the state affairs\u2026and is sitting on the sidelines on the matter of the rumor\u2026 But, it\u2019s clear that he thinks negatively of the Duke of Anies.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d The general stumbled to his knees. \u201cNo way\u2026 Had the first prince staged the kidnapping\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe so. He wouldn\u2019t have told our captain to escort the Duke if that were the case.\u201d Carlton\u2019s men actively denied that train of thought, but inwardly they were similarly anxious. Strange happenings were occurring. If the first prince was really behind Luisen\u2019s disappearance, what will happen to Carlton? And what about themselves?In trying to deny the first prince\u2019s involvement, they continued to comfort the general. \u201cAt the very least, the Duke should be safe. Our captain is with him. They\u2019ll make it to the capital safely.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right. Of course. The Duke is so ignorant of worldly matters; I\u2019m just glad Sir Carlton is with him.\u201dAt the very least, the young lord wouldn\u2019t be murdered by thieves or starve to death.The fact that the mercenary was with the young lord brought him relief. The general smiled bitterly as he recalled how he had tried his hardest to separate the two.That wasn\u2019t all. Carlton\u2019s men were of great help to the understaffed duchy. How ironic that the enemy that oppressed them\u2013that which they considered the most dangerous\u2013was now their most reliable ally.The general rubbed his face clean with his hands and steeled his heart. Though he ached as he thought of Luisen, his charge, suffering from far away\u2026but the general must get a hold of himself. Now, more than anytime else.\u2018I\u2019m not sure what the prince is thinking, but\u2026 I can\u2019t just wash my hands of this crisis and surrender. I must make provisions.\u2019If the first prince was truly behind this, then Luisen wouldn\u2019t be able to relax even after he entered the capital. Carlton wouldn\u2019t be of much help there either. But that didn\u2019t mean there was no solution. The general was worried but worked laboriously.There would be people who would protest if the prince tried to change the Southern Great Lord willfully. To be exact, the other three Great Lords. It was difficult to say that they had good relations with Luisen or the duchy in general, but they wouldn\u2019t want to lose their own authority if the prince set a precedent by transferring a Great Lord\u2019s power to another family. The enemy of an enemy is one\u2019s friend.The general hastily penned a letter to the other great lords. He deliberately provoked them by distorting the story\u2013that the royal family was violating their authority. The letters could be delivered quickly with the help of Carlton\u2019s men.After finishing his business, the general looked out the window at the blue sky. He remembered a young Luisen who had often caught colds in the chilly air. That same Luisen who he\u2019d embraced after he came tearfully up to the general with a runny nose would now have grown up to adventure all by himself under that same sky.The general prayed earnestly that this young man whom he had raised\u2013the young man who was now beginning to soar despite the hardships facing him\u2013would not be crushed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Part 8: The villains are always after us.The day after departing, Morrison chased Luisen and Carlton and forcibly joined their party.According to Morrison, the church will send another inquisitor to the South to launch a full-fledged investigation; as soon as they find any new information, they promised to send that information to Luisen through Morrison. He promised that the church would protect the young lord, as long as he continued to be targeted by the demon worshippers. That was good news for the young lord. To be frank, he felt somewhat depressed about his next moves after they entered the royal castle.The newly formed group, now accompanied by the inquisitor, headed for the capital. They passed the route most often used by those who crossed the river\u2013just as the young lord had done. That path was the shortest way to the capital.At first, Luisen was worried that his identity would be discovered, so they were originally going to make a huge detour through a deserted forest road. Instead of the relatively close east gate, he had thought about making a twisted path towards the south gate or even the far west gate. However, their plans changed as soon as Morrison joined their party. Now, they had learned of the enemy\u2019s identity and that the enemy would be following Luisen; those men knew that the young lord was heading towards the capital. A detour wouldn\u2019t help them avoid a confrontation.Like that, a few days passed. They moved during the day; during the night, they emulated the homeless by searching for a suitable place to sleep. At first, Luisen was worried that Morrison and Carlton couldn\u2019t escort him to the capital without fighting each other. He didn\u2019t know Morrison\u2019s real personality, and heretic inquisitors were known to be fanatics. The man was like a ticking time bomb.Fortunately, excluding the pagan infidels, Morrison was a kind and caring man toward others. He was a consistently kind person\u2013just like when Luisen first met him. So, the man didn\u2019t cause any trouble. When Carlton concluded that they\u2019d need Morrison\u2019s help, the mercenary was no longer cranky. The two did not become close, but they worked together without much difficulty.The three men guided their horses down the road.\u201cI thought I\u2019d be able to immediately catch sight of one of those men if I followed the Duke, but there\u2019s no hint of their presence,\u201d Morrison said, regretfully. He secretly expected\u2013anticipated\u2013a demon worshiper\u2019s appearance, but no one popped up.\u2018Honestly, does he think that those guys just pop up wherever I go?\u2019 Luisen thought about scolding Morrison, but the young lord kept his mouth shut in annoyance. He simply watched the scenery pass by silently, leaning into Carlton\u2019s arms; drowsiness soon fell over him. He was nervous about riding a horse, but, as he got used to it, he was exhausted from merely sitting still. So, he began to fall asleep.\u201cYou should just go to sleep.\u201d\u201cMhmm.\u201d There was nothing more dangerous than falling asleep on a horse, but\u2026 Carlton was there. Luisen couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of sleep and leaned his head onto the mercenary\u2019s shoulder.Carlton embraced Luisen tightly with his left arm so that the young lord would not shake around. In contrast to the chilly early winter air, the mercenary\u2019s body temperature was warm, and the young lord quickly fell asleep. The mercenary\u2019s subtle scent also comforted his mind.Carlton drove his horse more carefully, so that Luisen wouldn\u2019t wake up\u2013it was a pity that the young lord\u2019s sleeping face was hidden by the hood. Luisen\u2019s sleeping face always had a solemn yet elegant aura\u2013like a snowy winter\u2019s night. Very aesthetically pleasing.\u201cIt seems he must have been incredibly tired,\u201d Morrison said as he saw that the young lord was now asleep.\u201cIt\u2019s inevitable. After leaving the ship, we were homeless.\u201d Carlton felt sorry for Luisen. A man who should have never known hardship in his life was now falling asleep on a trotting horse, tired from wandering. Even though the young lord must have been exhausted, he didn\u2019t show any signs of complaining. The mercenary\u2019s heart felt simultaneously warm and stiff.\u2018He could stand to be a little bit more childish with me, at least.\u2019It was regretful, but Luisen\u2019s poise held out\u2013that\u2019s the man\u2019s charm, though. \u201cLet\u2019s find an inn and rest early tonight.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking. There was a small village marked on the map. Let\u2019s go there.\u201dWhen all that needed to be said was finished, silence fell between the two. Usually, the conversation was maintained through the young lord as a mediator. Without Luisen, there was nothing more to say between the two of them\u2013other than about the schedule and their future plans, that is.Carlton placed Morrison out of his mind and focused more on the young lord in his arms. The warm weight against his body; the pleasant scent that wafted off man\u2019s skin. The comforting feeling, body temperature, and his breaths. Every small thing was pleasing. It wasn\u2019t long ago that the noble would scurry away from him like a squirrel; now, when he thought about how the young lord trusted him to the point where Luisen was willing to be vulnerable while falling asleep\u2026 This felt so refreshingly unfamiliar yet joyful.As he luxuriated in his happiness, Carlton could feel a gaze from the side. Morrison was staring at him. Sometimes, the inquisitor looked at people without blinking, and Carlton found it a little creepy.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Carlton said pointedly.\u201cSir Carlton is quite pure despite his outward appearances.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo\u2013nothing. I hope that you\u2019ll stay so beautifully in love for a long, long while.\u201d\u2018Long, long while? Is he making fun of me?\u2019 Carlton\u2019s expression twisted with annoyance. However, there was a little noise out front. Carlton and Morrison placed their hands on their sword hilts, ready to fight at any time.A fairly wide stream flowed across the field; the current was strong and deep, so there was a bridge built to help travelers cross the stream. The bridge was sturdy and made out of stone, so even wagons could pass. There was a group of people\u2013they appeared to be travellers\u2013gathered near the foot of the bridge. Three men in plate armor sat in the way.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and find out.\u201dAs they approached closer, they could quickly see why the people had gathered.\u201cI am a knight who serves Viscount Boton. This bridge was built by the grace of the Viscount, so you cannot pass unless you pay the toll!\u201d The men standing on the bridge shouted.\u2018So, the knights that were absent when monsters popped out or robbers attacked were stationed here, huh?\u2019 Carlton snorted.\u201cHey what is this\u2026 Is that a highwayman?\u201d\u00a01\u00a0The uproar woke Luisen up; the young noble yawned, completely relaxed. Because they ran into bandits at least once a day on the way here, he was no longer surprised at their appearance.Public security north of the river was completely different from the South. Any form of stable security was completely destroyed during the main stage of the civil war. If one walks through the forest path, there will inevitably be monsters; if one walks on the road, highwaymen will appear. It was common for mercenaries to switch careers and become bandits after a war. Those who have lost their livelihoods often turned to thievery as well.Because of this, the road had been blocked by bandits or monsters more than once. The average traveler would often choose to turn back or was left helpless, but Luisen\u2019s party did not avoid them. Nor did they suffer defeat.A villain who dreams of the world\u2019s destruction is chasing from behind; they couldn\u2019t waste their time on some petty highwaymen. A blocked road can be opened through force. If a monster proved to be a roadblock, then the monster must die; if a robber blocks the road, then they can just kill the robber. Carlton and Morrison always jumped into the fray brilliantly.\u201cYou\u2019re just going to pass them, right? We don\u2019t really have any place to go back to.\u201d Luisen looked around; he could see no other bridges.\u201cOf course. What great timing\u2013I\u2019ve been feeling a bit annoyed.\u201d Carlton dismounted his horse and strode forth to the bridge, alone. Luisen got off the horse, thinking he\u2019d give his buttocks some rest while Carlton fought.Just at that moment, a nearby merchant urgently spoke, \u201cExcuse me. He\u2019s a part of your party right? Hurry and stop him! The men who took over the bridge are incredibly vicious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. They\u2019re only some robbers.\u201d\u201cNo! They\u2019re not ordinary robbers! If you confront them now, you\u2019ll needlessly court trouble later on. Besides, they won\u2019t let you pass peacefully even if you pay the toll!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t pass through even if you pay the toll?\u201d\u201cYes! As soon as you walk past them, they\u2019ll throw you into the stream and ask you to cross through them again. Then, at that point, they\u2019ll ask you to pay the toll again. They\u2019re so villainous, but\u2026 We can\u2019t do anything about those knights!\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why you all were hovering about this bridge.\u201d Luisen was convinced, yet he didn\u2019t feel too much tension. Then, something the merchant said attracted his interest, \u201cBut, are those people really knights? After all, just wearing plate armor doesn\u2019t make one a knight.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re truly knights. A man named Viscount Boton employs them.\u201d\u2018True knights\u2026huh.\u2019 Not everyone could become a knight. One had to come from a wealthy household, and they had to be highborn\u2013at least more than a mere commoner. As a child, they must be the squire of another knight, and they must go through a long training period.\u201cWhy are knights taking money from passersby?\u201d Luisen asked.It\u2019s a knight\u2019s job to defeat robbers but, instead, these knights are doing the robbing?\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you know that Viscount Boton abandoned his estate and ran away a few months ago? He was terrified, muttering about the \u2018aristocrat butcher\u2019 or something like that.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dSo there was another fool like him\u2013or at least like him before he had regressed.\u201cSince the lord ran away, leaving behind the denizens of his estate as a shield, the knights have abandoned all morality and declared they\u2019d find their own way,\u201d the merchant continued.Luisen felt complicated as he looked at the knights. So this was what happened when a lord abandoned their territory; long-established tradition and all systems collapsed. The sword meant to protect peasants were then directed at innocents. \u201cBy the way, you seem to know the situation well.\u201d\u201cOur feet have been tied here for three days now\u2026 Rather than just lounging about, I looked into background matters instead.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to search for another bridge or to turn around?\u201d\u201c\u2026There\u2019s no other bridge except for this one\u2026 They\u2019ve all been broken.\u201d\u201cI see. Then, I think you\u2019ll be able to cross today. Please wait a little longer.\u201d Luisen drank some water and took out a bag of peeled walnuts. He may as well eat while watching.\u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve said that those men are real knights! How could one mercenary deal with three knights?! They\u2019re not going to cut him some slack, so hurry up and stop him!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. That friend will take care of everything.\u201d\u201cGive me a walnut as well,\u201d Morrison said, stretching his hand out. Luisen gave Morrison some walnuts and, while he was at it, shared a few with the merchant as well.Footnotesa robber that mostly steals from travelers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A stranger like himself was so worried about the man, but those that are part of his\u00a0party\u00a0aren\u2019t stopping the man and are simply observing from the side while eating snacks?Luisen and Morrison affably shared the walnuts; at that moment, Carlton reached the knight. At a distance, one could see that Carlton was well-built, but the mercenary looked relatively weak compared to the knights in his light tunic and cape.\u201cHonestly, It\u2019s not the time to be so carefree and eat walnuts\u2013you need to stop\u2026Ah\u2026 Ah!\u00a0Hnngrk!\u201d The merchant stopped talking; his eyes opened wide as he stared over at Carlton.It was all over in an instant. Carlton literally toyed\u00a0around\u00a0with the knights. After dodging several attacks, Carlton hooked their legs, tugged at their arms, and simply plunged the knights into the stream. The three knights were defeated before they could even touch the mercenary.Carlton threw a confident smile at Luisen. As if he were bragging, \u2018Look at this\u2013this is how great I am.\u2019\u2018He acts cute like that from time to time. Is that perhaps the charm of a younger lover?\u2019 Luisen smiled and clapped softly, \u201cThen, I\u2019ll go ahead first.\u201dLuisen quickly mounted Zephys again. During their travels, he had gotten used to horseback riding, so he could ride solo and mount the horse without the Zephys extending assistance by bending its legs. Though that was a skill anyone who could ride horseback could do, Luisen was still proud.As Luisen approached, Carlton also climbed onto Zephys. The three men walked across the bridge leisurely. This all seemed too simple to the people that had helplessly gathered around the bridge, delayed for a few days. The people that watched their departing backs could only admire their absurd courageousness to plunge the knights headfirst\u00a0into the water.\u201cWho is that person? Is he a mercenary? There\u2019s no way a man so strong would be unknown.\u201dAmidst the whispers, one of the travelers shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s those people! The pilgrim who recently became famous and his party!\u201d\u201cAh! Ah! You\u2019re right!\u00a0That person\u2013just then\u2013was a pilgrim!\u201d\u201cI heard that, no matter how dangerous a situation may be, those people don\u2019t retreat and help others\u2026 So it was true.\u201dThough Luisen\u2019s party had no idea, they were already quite the celebrities. Anecdotes from Confosse\u2019s guard captain\u2026The story of the incident on the ship\u2026 Accounts\u00a0of their deeds\u00a0were already spreading quickly through word of mouth.As Luisen and his party moved on, they cleared away everything that stood in their way; naturally, they ended up\u00a0defeating\u00a0notorious monsters and highwaymen/bandits. The neglectful estate\u00a0stewards\u2013those vicious men\u2013all disappeared when Luisen and his party passed by. In addition, Luisen, who could not bear to see other\u2019s hunger as much as he hated his own hunger, informed the refugees he met along the way of various edible vegetables\u2013like the Buried Old Hag\u2013and herbs.This sort of behavior sparked rumors about Luisen and his party. The harder and more arduous life was, the more popular\u00a0stories about heroes\u00a0were. Luisen\u2019s fame spread throughout the kingdom, and no one imagined that the\u00a0protagonists\u00a0of these stories would actually be Carlton the noble butcher and the trashy duke; like that, Luisen\u2019s reputation became widespread throughout the nation.***Traveling diligently along the road, the group would soon reach their destination by evening, just as they had planned. \u2018We\u2019ll probably be able to sleep in warm bedrooms and dine in restaurants today!\u2019 Luisen, tired of being homeless, was full of expectations; however, when they arrived, the group was met with ruins.There was no one in the village; only traces of the previous pillaging remained here and there. It seemed the village was abandoned in the aftermath of the war. Because he saw many similar villages on the journey here, Luisen wasn\u2019t even surprised.The three people quickly gave up\u00a0on their original plans\u00a0and found a place they could stay for the night. There was still an inn with intact kitchen facilities; there were no bandits or monsters around. This place\u00a0suited their purposes\u00a0for at least one night.They made an acceptable dinner. Pushing together the wooden tables left on the inn\u2019s first-floor dining-hall, they created a bedroom and went to sleep early.Carlton lay perfectly still before sitting up. He had always been a light sleeper, but it was especially difficult to\u00a0attempt to sleep\u00a0today. This was all because of Morrison. Carlton glared at the\u00a0person in question; the man was sleeping so well\u2013enough to snore quite despicably.\u2018Should I just pummel him? But then, Luisen might wake.\u2019 Carlton sighed and stealthily slipped out. Perhaps some cold air would relieve his discomfort.The village was slowly deteriorating into an unsightly condition in its abandoned state. It felt as if someone would pop out from behind any corner. The chaotic landscape showcased the entropy fueled by time. In contrast, the winter\u2019s night-sky was clear and cold.\"\"\u2018Stay in love for a long time?\u2019Morrison may have meant to tease him with that statement, but the words he had heard earlier in the day strangely echoed around in his head.\u2018A long time?\u2019How long? And how so? Did he and the young lord really have anything was capable of lasting?Carlton furrowed his brows.Luisen and Carlton lived in very different worlds. Luisen was a Great Lord, the second prince\u2019s friend, and had a strong foothold in the South. On the other hand, Carlton was a commoner mercenary, the first prince\u2019s hands and feet, and was based north of the river. If it weren\u2019t for the special circumstances surrounding the civil war and the demonic worshippers, there was no reason for them to become close.Now, they relied on each other and traveled towards a common goal: the capital. But what would happen after they accomplished said goal?\u00a0Could their lives continue in the same vein?Carlton was skeptical. From his perspective, it was so\u00a0clear\u00a0that, after arriving at the capital, there was only separation in their future.Luisen would solve his problem with the first prince when he went to the capital; the prince was sure to\u00a0stop antagonizing\u00a0Luisen, as he was a Great Lord. So, the young noble would soon regain his past glory. In that scenario, Carlton didn\u2019t think Luisen would rely on him as much as the young lord does now. More established households\u2013more well-born and educated people\u2013would lay in wait for Luisen\u2019s outstretched hand.The mercenary\u00a0was so accustomed to being abandoned after being used, but his heart\u00a0ached.There would be a problem even if Luisen attempted to keep him by his side. Carlton was the first prince\u2019s hands and feet. His and his company\u2019s rise and fall were completely subject to the first prince\u2019s whims; in his position, Carlton needed to constantly prove his loyalty to the first prince.But, if he were to grow close to Luisen, the prince would begin to doubt Carlton. Even a seed of doubt could\u00a0be his undoing.When they arrived in the capital, he\u2019d have to be exceedingly careful of wandering eyes if he wanted to speak with Luisen.Even if all business ended well, it would be difficult to continue as they are. Luisen would return to his duchy, and he would either be sent to the battlefield or remain with the prince. When the bodies are separated by a great distance, the heart would\u00a0stray\u00a0as well. Naturally, there would be a day when this relationship becomes forgotten.Still, could he throw away everything and chase after Luisen?Carlton was ambitious. He wanted to reach\u00a0become more famous\u00a0than anyone else; he wanted to receive a proper last name and a noble peerage. He wanted to prove to the world that even someone like him, who as a child cleaned up horse poop, could make it. Fortunately,\u00a0the world\u2019s political state\u00a0and his abilities supported Carlton. This was his last chance to\u00a0break down\u00a0and\u00a0overcome\u00a0the rigid wall of birth-status.This was a dream he chased all this while as he risked his life. He had walked too long on this path for him to give it up for a love that had suddenly barrelled into him\u2013Carlton was far too pragmatic.The cold night breeze brushed across his cheeks. Listening to the sound of crickets complicated his mind. As he stood still, he sensed a presence creeping up behind him.Usually he would kill the owner of such footsteps, but he could immediately identify who made those clumsy sounds. The mercenary smiled inadvertently and turned around just in time to receive his assailant\u2019s outstretched arms.\u201cAh!\u201d Surprised, Luisen floundered before embracing the mercenary. Carlton smiled and hugged him back.\u201cWhat a pity. I was going to surprise you,\u201d the young lord said.\u201cYou weren\u2019t sleeping?\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d Luisen closed his mouth before sputtering out, \u201cI waited since I thought you\u2019d bring me out as well.\u201dThe two had slipped away every night, so the young lord thought it would happen again tonight as well. Luisen murmured, stewing in his embarrassment. The mercenary felt overwhelmed by emotions and embraced the young lord tightly. That wasn\u2019t enough for Carlton, so he pecked the other\u2019s cheek. Luisen didn\u2019t avoid Carlton even though the young lord feigned a groan.The playful kiss soon deepened.When they placed their foreheads together and exhaled, Luisen chuckled. The young lord\u2019s slender face shone softly in the moonlight. Carlton held Luisen\u2019s cheeks in both hands and stared down.The end was clearly in sight. However, he didn\u2019t think he could forget this face for the rest of his life, so his heart violently fluctuated between his options. One one hand, a rise in status, a chance to sate his ambition and recklessness. Could he be happy in life\u2013could his belly be sated\u2013with just this face?Carlton could see himself in Luisen\u2019s eyes; he saw a man with a dazed expression. He saw many people die after staking their everything from a momentary rush of emotion. He resolved not to be pathetic like them, but how funny\u2026he had the same expression as those people now.\u201cI\u2019m going crazy. What should I do?\u201d Carlton sighed before crumpling slightly on top of the young lord.At the sight of his drained and exhausted companion, Luisen hugged the mercenary\u2019s back and gently stroked from side to side without clearly understanding the other\u2019s internal struggles.It was then.An arrow flew at them from an unknown origin.swoosh\u2013!\u201c!\u201dCarlton held Luisen and turned around to avoid the attack\u2013an ambush!\u2018Bandits?\u2019 He thought.It was common for bandits to simply observe during the day and raid at night. But, things felt too ominous for it to be a simple bandit. Usually one would try to rid themselves of the strongest-looking person first, but the arrow\u2019s target was Luisen.Carlton looked around his surroundings with vicious eyes. Immediately, the reason behind his uneasy feelings was revealedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThree men walked out from the darkness, their armor clattering as they stepped forth\u2013the three knights that had blocked the bridge during the day.Who knows what had happened in the meantime\u2013their faces were discolored in a bluish tint and their eyeballs were rotten and white. A few goblins accompanied them; like this, they looked like knights accompanied by servants.\u201cAre those people dead?\u201d\u201cYes. I can\u2019t hear breathing sounds.\u201d\u201cHave they become ghouls?\u201dThe knights were alive when they crossed the bridge; Carlton didn\u2019t kill them and had only dumped them headfirst into the stream. However, why were their corpses appearing in front of them?Against the backdrop of the ruined village, the knights-turned-ghouls hobbled towards them. ghouls had low combat abilities; despite knowing that, they made such an eerie sight that the hairs on the back of Luisen\u2019s neck stood straight. Furthermore, their uncharacteristically disciplined walk\u2013their purposeful steps\u2013were quite ominous.Dark red smoke swirled around the ghouls; the smoke looked almost like strings attached to the corpses as they stretched out and over the stream. The strings ended at a standing man. When the group noticed his dark red robe, Luisen and Carlton simultaneously sensed that the man must be a demon worshiper.\u201cI am the ninth worshiper.\u201d The man raised a finger and pointed at Luisen. \u201cYou must be the pilgrim who destroyed the sacred altar.\u201dLuisen recalled the giant centipede and the altar hidden in its underground den. He supposed that man was its creator.\u201cTales of your name could be found wherever I went. Thanks to that, it was quite easy to follow you,\u201d the worshiper continued.\u201cComing to us in the middle of the night without making an appointment? You people really have no manners, do you?\u201d Carlton grunted.\u201cDo you make appointments in order to punish sinners?\u201d\u201cSinners?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve destroyed the sacred altar and completely ruined the memorial service I was preparing to please my god! He is angry, and you all will be cursed to death!\u201d The worshiper shouted before stretching out his hand. The knight-turned-ghoul rushed forth with a chilling roar. He swung the two-handed sword\u2013one that was clearly underused in the knight\u2019s lifetime\u2013quickly. As the blade split the air, a vibration was transmitted through the air onto the young lord\u2019s and mercenary\u2019s skin. What tremendous strength.Carlton dodged as he pushed Luisen behind him; the mercenary then blocked the attack of another ghoul knight, flowing with the movements of his sword. The attack was powerful enough to make his wrist throb.The three knights rushed at once, so Carlton was too busy preventing any attacks from hitting to even begin to counterattack. However, thanks to the fact that the corpses\u2019 manipulator wasn\u2019t a knight as well, the mercenary was able to withstand the attacks due to small loopholes and blind spots in their attacks.However, he was slowly becoming distanced from Luisen.\u2018Damn it. What is Morrison doing at a time like this?\u2019 Carlton thought.He had allowed the inquisitor to travel with them in order to make use of the inquisitor\u2019s strength at times like this; however, Carlton couldn\u2019t see even the tip of his nose at this moment. The inquisitor probably wouldn\u2019t be sleeping peacefully when heretics were making an uproar like this.Carlton rolled on the ground as he landed a strike on one knightClank\u2013!The attack was aimed properly at the waist, but an ordinary sword would fail to penetrate the hardness of plate armor. A living person would slow down from the pain of the impact, but ghouls do not feel pain. The ghoul knight simply stumbled momentarily.\"\"Then, the corpse continued its attack without allowing time for the mercenary to return to the young lord\u2019s side.The manipulated ghoul was an incredibly annoying opponent. It was fast and destructive; as it was a corpse, it couldn\u2019t be killed.\u2018In that case, it would be better to target the person controlling them.\u2019Carlton glanced at Luisen; Luisen had learned something from all of the times they had run into monsters and was making efforts to protect himself. The young lord looked wary of his surroundings and had acquired a pot lid and wooden club that had fallen to the floor from their hooks on the wall of the inn. Carlton saw a single goblin was approaching the lord.The mercenary quickly turned to Luisen; in exchange for his wandering attention, he received a fist in his abdomen. As Carlton stumbled with a groan, the worshiper giggled and laughed.***Meanwhile, Ruger approached the battle site. He discovered the ninth worshiper, the mercenary, and the pilgrim.Ruger sighed; a few hours ago, the ninth worshiper went off alone, saying he had to avenge his altar and the giant centipede. Due to the pilgrim\u2019s growing reputation, the man couldn\u2019t stand the thought of the pilgrim being right under their noses.That\u2019s what he said. They were already shorthanded on trying to catch Luisen and preparing to kill Carlton, but the other\u2019s eyes were already turned towards his own private revenge. Pathetic. It was just an altar. The devil they served probably didn\u2019t even exist anyway. And the man could just make another monster.However, Ruger had no idea what sort of accidents and blunders the man would make if he went all by himself. Because Ruger needed to clean up after any accidents\u2013because a lead for Luisen might appear\u2013he had no choice but to accept the setback in his plans and chase after the worshiper.\u2018Though, he\u2019ll probably be alright even if I didn\u2019t intervene.\u2019He couldn\u2019t see well due to the darkness, the sole mercenary seemed to have difficulty dealing with the three monsters by himself. Ruger found the pilgrim with his eyes; even though the face wasn\u2019t clearly visible, the pilgrim\u2019s pass sparkled brightly and could be easily found. The pilgrim was struggling against a lone goblin, so the pilgrim didn\u2019t notice Ruger\u2019s presence.\u2018I feel a bit uncomfortable about harming someone from the church, but\u2026\u2019If he killed the pilgrim here, the ninth worshiper was sure to cooperate with him without any further grumbling. Pity that this was all a consequence of the pilgrim\u2019s good deeds, but that sort of thing was inevitable after being entangled with these lunatics.Ruger drew his sword and approached the unsuspecting pilgrim; the pilgrim had just finished pushing a goblin away and was catching his breath. His back was clearly exposed\u2013with one stab, the attendant could kill the man before the other could notice his situation.This was a simple task. However, the closer Ruger got to the pilgrim, the stranger he felt. The man\u2019s back looked so familiar\u2026Luisen\u2019s image overlapped the man\u2019s.It was a back he had always stared at from his place, one step behind, every day for the past few years. Ruger\u2019s heart beat fast, \u201cMy duke?\u201dHis painstaking patience in hunting the Pilgrim faltered, and his awkward voice called out a familiar name. His heart was filled with emotions\u2013tension or anticipatory welcome? Ruger couldn\u2019t tell.Then, the pilgrim looked back, surprised. The short blond hair wavered with the movement, revealing Luisen\u2019s delicate face. For a moment, Luger gasped; this moment felt strange although the two had seen each other every day for years.That pilgrim who had a reputation for being so pious and merciful was\u2026Luisen? The young lord had the ability to even pose as a pilgrim?Even now, nothing made sense to Ruger, but, at the very least, Luisen was in front of him.His shock was mirrored in the young lord. Luisen had no idea that his erstwhile attendant would suddenly show up from behind him! Luisen instinctively raised the pot lid and wooden stick for defense. His actions were proper for someone that had just learned self-defense, but the young lord had overlooked the goblin\u2019s cleverness.The goblin, who had been pretending to be unconscious as if it had lost the battle, opened its mouth wide and reached for Luisen with its teeth. Dirty, jagged teeth tried to sink into the young lord\u2019s neck.Time\u2013and the lord\u2013seemed to flow slowly\u2013as if time had slowed down before Ruger\u2019s eyes. He was just too surprised, nor was there any time to think. The attendant\u2019s body moved first; Ruger threw his sword forward. The blade that was originally drawn to kill Luisen passed by the lord and lodged into the goblin\u2019s head.\u2018Huh? What?\u2019 Luisen realized belatedly that he was in danger and that Ruger had saved him. Then, anger rose to the top of his head. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dWhy save him after years of deceiving him, trying to kidnap him, and then showing up with monsters to kill him? The young lord had no idea what the man was up to and glared at Ruger.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeak properly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because\u2026 I was ordered to bring my Duke in alive.\u201dRuger\u2019s liege wanted Luisen alive, so he had to prevent the monsters from killing the young lord. No other reason. He was faithful to his master\u2019s orders\u2013Ruger tried to convince himself. \u201cIf you follow me, you won\u2019t get hurt. My duke.\u201d\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d believe that? I already know who you people are.\u201d\u201cThen, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThen, you must have realized that you\u2019d be in trouble if you solely trust a lowly mercenary like Carlton. These men are much eviler and stronger. Come with me. I\u2019m the only one who can protect you properly.\u201d\u2018This bastard\u2013does he even realize the nonsense he\u2019s spouting? How are you going to protect me if you\u2019re with those evil people?\u2019 Luisen was so dumbfounded he was rendered speechless. Every word that came out of Ruger\u2019s mouth made no sense; he didn\u2019t know where to start with his rebuttal.\u2018Was he always this insane?\u2019 While the young lord was bewildered, Ruger had raised his sword. \u2018Look at him\u2013my eyes are spinning. He\u2019s being contradictory again!\u2019As the panicked Luisen moved to dodge, he heard Carlton\u2019s voice, \u201cMy duke, come backwards!\u201dLuisen fell to the ground behind him thoughtlessly, doing as he was told. Then, Morrison popped out from behind one of the buildings\u2019 roofs.\u2018Morrison! I was wondering where you were!\u2019Morrison threw a knuckle-clad fist at the attendant; Ruger blocked that attack with his sword. The resulting collision sounded so intense that it hurt Luisen\u2019s ears.In the brief confrontation between Luisen and Ruger, many changes had taken place. Carlton used a torch to burn down all the ghoul-knights and escaped their siege.\u201cOh! Oh oh! Wait. Wait! Let\u2019s run away!\u201d The demon worshipper used the goblin that he had dragged here like a shield and, without even looking back, ran away. Ruger didn\u2019t seem to care about that, though. The attendant observed the situation with cold eyes, as if he hadn\u2019t expected his colleague to look after him.A low-level monster like a goblin was no match for Carlton, and this group had an unexpected supporter named Morrison. Soon, the reality that he wouldn\u2019t be able to take Luisen away as he desired solidified. The ninth worshiper fled, so there was no reason to be here any longer.\u201c\u2026Let\u2019s see each other again.\u201d Ruger pushed Morrison away and swung his sword to widen the distance between them. A dark red mist rose from under his feet.\u201cNngh,\u201d Morrison backed away in horror. This dark and evil energy was like poison to a priest like him. Taking advantage of the gap created, Ruger soon disappeared into the darkness as well.Croak\u2013The last goblin collapsed; only three people were left in this village. The night sky quickly calmed down as if nothing had happened, but the smell of monsters and the deep, metallic stench of blood still wafted in the air.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking the young lord all over, he carefully checked for any injuries. This wasn\u2019t an uncommon occurrence, so Luisen calmly raised his right hand. \u201cI\u2019ve just scraped my palm here, otherwise I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not injured.\u201dThe young lord had abrased his palm against the surface of the wooden stick while pushing the monster back. \u201cI\u2019ve only had to push back one goblin. You should worry more about yourself.\u201dHis companion had to deal with three knights who wielded their broadswords as if their blades were made out of paper. Luisen also looked over Carlton, and, to his surprise, the mercenary did not suffer a single bruise. At this point, couldn\u2019t he be called a monster?Just as the young lord thought that, Carlton looked fondly at the scratch on Luisen\u2019s palm. \u201cStill, you did well.\u201d\u201cHuh? What?\u201d\u201cYou defeated a goblin by yourself. Although, the end of all that hassle was a bit regretful. You did a good job of avoiding boxing yourself against the wall and calmly chose your weapon\u2013a long wooden stick.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a goblin\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen we first met, didn\u2019t you almost die by a Goblin\u2019s hand?\u201d\u201cAh, I suppose you are right.\u201dWhen he first met Carlton, Luisen completely panicked at the Goblin\u2019s appearance and nearly died. If one considers that event, responding calmly and winning a power struggle against a goblin was a huge achievement by Luisen\u2019s standards. If Ruger hadn\u2019t called out to him, he could have shut down the monster\u2019s breathing.\u2018Come to think of it, I, Luisen Anies, have matured a lot.\u2019 Luisen raised his palm to the mercenary while praising himself, \u201cI simply used what I learned from you, again.\u201d\"\"Carlton chuckled deeply before grabbing the hand, clasping the young lord\u2019s fingers firmly.\u201cI gave you my hand for a high five\u2013what\u2019s this sudden hand-holding?\u201d Luisen grumbled, but he didn\u2019t hate this sudden contact. As the two were about to fall into their own world, Luisen felt an insistent gaze. Looking to the side, he saw Morrison viewing them with a pleased expression.\u2018Why\u2026is he looking at us like that\u2026?\u2019\u201cYou two make such a good sight.\u201d Morrison sighed.\u201c\u2026Are you a pervert?\u201d Carlton shot back.\u201cWhat do you mean pervert? I just appreciate a good love story.\u201d\u201c\u2026You certainly look like you do.\u201dAnyway, with Morrison watching, the desire to do more disappeared. Luisen let go of the mercenary\u2019s hand with a sour expression, took out his handkerchief, and wiped off the goblin blood that splattered onto him.Carlton glared at Morrison, frustration evident in the lines of his face. \u201cWhat were you doing for you to be so late? I didn\u2019t think you could sleep through this pandemonium.\u201d\u201cOf course not! I was fighting my own battles.\u201d Morrison said, as if he were wronged. \u201cAfter you two left, I was lying down by myself. Suddenly, I felt very uncomfortable, so I thought I should look around.\u201dCarlton had exited first, and Luisen followed. It wasn\u2019t something special; the two enjoyed a secret nightly meeting almost every day. So, it was obvious what the inquisitor would witness if he were to follow him out the door. Instead, Morrison tactfully slipped out through a window on the back wall.\u201cWhat?! You knew?!\u201d Luisen\u2019s face flared red\u2013his secret meetings were uncovered!\u201cI was right there when you two moved out; of course I\u2019d know. I don\u2019t particularly mind, so please don\u2019t worry. Anyway, as I walked around, I happened upon a strange man.\u201dThe man had apparently stood next to a direwolf; he looked down at the village from atop the nearby hill, and the aura surrounding him felt ominous and mysterious. Morrison had a hunch that the man was a demon worshiper and approached in secret. The demon worshiper failed to respond properly to the sudden surprise attack.\u201cDirewolf? Is that the man who attacked the refugee village?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think he came there to fight\u2013it was almost like he was there to observe. There were only a couple of direwolves. I had almost captured him, but\u2026\u201d\u201cYou lost him?\u201d\u201cYes. I had to capture him alive in order to interrogate him. However, at that moment, that man ordered a direwolf to bite him and drag him away.\u201d Morrison clicked his tongue, as if he regretted not overpowering the man.Morrison\u2019s face, as he recalled his fight with the demon worshiper, reminded Luisen of that inhumane expression he saw at the docks. That must be Morrison\u2019s true self as a heretic inquisitor. Once again, the young lord thought it was truly fortunate that Morrison and his misunderstanding was quickly and easily resolved.\u201cThese direwolves are incredibly fast; I couldn\u2019t chase after them with just my two feet, so I came back to town to acquire a horse. However, there were demon worshippers here, too.\u201d There was another battle happening in the village. Morrison was elated to have another capture target, but he had to help the young lord first, as the young lord was already in conflict with Ruger. \u201cI am fortunate to have followed my Duke. I met two people\u2013people who I saw neither hide nor hair of earlier\u2013all at once! My sixth sense wasn\u2019t incorrect.\u201dMorrison seemed pleased to have encountered the worshippers, even though the villains had escaped. \u201cThose bastards\u2026 they\u2019ll probably attack the Duke again, yes? Next time, I won\u2019t clumsily target the ankle. I\u2019ll target the spine\u2026\u201d\u201cStop talking so viciously in front of my Duke.\u201d Carlton protested, covering Luisen\u2019s ears. Luisen nodded as well\u2013\u2018Don\u2019t say such cruel things so nonchalantly.\u2019Morrison shrugged his shoulders. \u201cBy the way, that man with the red hair\u2026he\u2019s Ruger, right?\u201d The inquisitor had only heard stories about the man; he had never seen the attendant in person.\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cWasn\u2019t that man a bit odd?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s completely odd.\u201d Luisen said, bluntly. \u201cHe kept saying such strange things. He\u2019s not usually one to speak such nonsense. He didn\u2019t even seem to know what he was spouting.\u201d\u201cStill, he saved my Duke from the goblins, didn\u2019t he?\u201dAt Morrison\u2019s words, both Carlton and Luisen\u2019s brows wrinkled simultaneously.Luisen spoke, \u201cSupposedly, he\u2019s been ordered to take me alive. That\u2019s what he said, at least. Why the sudden interest in Ruger?\u201d\u201cNothing. It\u2019s nothing, but I just have a strange feeling.\u201dThere seemed to be more to the topic, but Morrison wouldn\u2019t say. The three of them cleaned up their surroundings and prepared to leave the village. After all, other monsters or beasts may be lured here by the scent of blood, or Ruger and his gang may come back with reinforcements.The three recovered the remains of the barony\u2019s knights and took their identification cards. In place of a funeral, they simply cremated the corpses and prayed.***Without space for proper rest, the three people set off on the road again. The dark, almost-dawn sky was filled with twinkling stars, but all three were not in the mood to enjoy this beautiful scenery. They were busy discussing what to do in the future.Until now, they had felt no threat due to Luisen\u2019s disguise as a pilgrim, which kept the Duke of Anies\u2019s whereabouts unknown. However, now his location was discovered and his identity was revealed; those bastards would be like tigers, waiting with eyes wide for an opportunity to steal and kidnap the young lord away.\u00a01\u201cI thought we would encounter them at least once before entering the capital, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be like this.\u201d Luisen sighed deeply.\"\"He had thought they\u2019d meet Ruger just before passing through the capital city gate\u2013that the attendant would lie in wait there. They had planned how to respond to that situation. However, they didn\u2019t know the demon worshippers would come after the pilgrim while bearing a grudge. The group needed to revise their future plans since they were discovered earlier than expected.\u201cHowever, nothing can be helped, right now, right?\u201d That was Morrison\u2019s argument. This trick had already been tried once\u2013disguising yourself as another person would be uncovered quickly.\u00a0 Even if they quickened their pace, the human body would prove to be the rate-limiting factor. It would be dangerous to try and protect Luisen when they had no idea how many demon worshippers existed. Nor could they claim that Carlton was some unrelated mercenary. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to reveal your identity and move quickly?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bit\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t that make the situation more difficult?\u201d Luisen said. Currently, in the eastern part of this kingdom, even knights became robbers. The hyena-like rascals who would want to capture the Duke of Anies would rather slow down the group\u2019s steps, providing openings to Ruger\u2019s gangs.\u201cThen, why don\u2019t we find someone who can protect the Duke after he reveals his identity?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d\u201cThe Great Lord of the East. According to the information I received, the Eastern Great Lord should be leading his knights around this area.\u201d\u201cNngh\u2026 I don\u2019t particularly like that\u00a0lord\u2026\u201d\u00a02\u00a0Luisen\u2019s brows furrowed.The Eastern Great Lord, the Duke of Assylus, was in his sixties, old enough to be Luisen\u2019s grandfather. He was an authoritarian man who was well aware of his own privileges; a man that took pride in his birth status. The man was an inconvenience for Luisen because he had always nagged the young lord, who had lived like trash.Most of all, before regression, when the wandering Luisen had visited him, Luisen was kicked out without being able to meet the Duke of Assylus. The same was true of all the other nobles. Therefore, the young lord decided to head to the capital with only Carlton for help. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge about who the shadow beneficiary of the demon worshippers was added to his decision.\u201cIs the Eastern Great Lord trustworthy? What if he\u2019s behind the demon worshippers?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve met him before\u2013he\u2019s a very religious man who would have nothing to do with heresy.\u201d Since Morrison, an inquisitor, was the one to say that, the great lord\u2019s credibility was made even stronger.\u201cYou all won\u2019t be treated well by that old man,\u201d Luisen said.Especially Carlton.\u201cIt matters not how he treats us\u2013it\u2019ll be safer with his knights. Ruger and his demon worshippers can\u2019t easily confront us that way. However, the issue is that the Great Lord\u2019s exact location isn\u2019t clear.\u201d\u201cIt would be different if we were far away from them, but isn\u2019t it a relief that we\u2019re in the same area? I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have to stray too far from our original path. I can make efforts to quickly find a more detailed description of the man\u2019s location.\u201dMorrison and Carlton were both optimistic about this plan. \u2018Ugh,\u2019 Luisen groaned. Things were completely different from before the regression, so he supposed it would be fine to ask the Easter Great Lord for help. He\u2019s not a member of the demon worshipers, after all.However, his heart still pounded from the betrayal and contempt he received at that time. But, since Morrison and Carlton would be the ones to fight in any situation, Luisen needed to respect their opinions. \u201cAlright. Then, when we meet them on our way\u2026 I\u2019ll attempt to negotiate.\u201dThe young lord grudgingly gave his permission, and a new destination had been set.***Meanwhile, two escaped demon worshippers and Ruger reunited in a rocky cave a little ways away.Footnotes\ud638\uc2dc\ud0d0\ud0d0 is an acronym: definition \u2013 a tiger stares at its prey with its eyes wide open, quietly looking for an opportunity to steal someone else\u2019s property.

Ruger glanced at the eleventh worshiper leaning against the wall; the man didn\u2019t look to be in a good condition. His ankle was completely bent at a wrong angle, and he was sweating all over.\u2018It\u2019ll be a problem if our manpower is reduced more than this here.\u2019Ruger frowned; he coldly looked down at the ninth worshiper clinging to the eleventh as he fed the man painkillers. These two cut off other people\u2019s wrists and ankles, but they acted so disgustingly with each other.\u201cYou got hurt like a fool,\u201d Ruger scoffed.\u201cBite that bastard!\u201d The eleventh worshiper pointed at Ruger. The direwolf, next to the man, rushed at the attendant. It opened its big mouth and tried to bite Ruger\u2019s ankle, but the man frustratedly kicked at the direwolf\u2019s snout.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He shouted.\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere was another person in their party. He suddenly attacked and crushed my ankle with his knuckles.\u201d\u2018Ah\u2013that person.\u2019 Ruger recalled a strange man blocking his way to Luisen. The moment they faced each other was short, but the man\u2019s piercing gaze, which seemed to dig deep into his head, felt unpleasant. That person wasn\u2019t normal. \u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to take care of yourselves, didn\u2019t I? How could you blame me for your careless actions\u2013that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t even know that the Duke of Anies was posing as the pilgrim, did you? Even when I suspected him, weren\u2019t you so sure that the Duke wasn\u2019t capable?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I had known that the pilgrim was the Duke of Anies, I would have prepared more before attacking him. This guy pretends to know everything about the Duke, but it turns out he knows nothing!\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d Ruger growled deeply. Every one of the worshiper\u2019s words felt like it pierced his heart. Indeed\u2013Ruger was the most befuddled one here.Luisen was the pilgrim who was famous for solving many cases? Even though he saw that fact with his own eyes, Ruger found it hard to believe. It felt as if the world was making fun of him.He was the closest person to Luisen; he knew better\u2013more than anyone else\u2013about the young lord. He used to be able to clearly see into the Duke\u2019s head, as if he were looking at his own palm.Luisen never used to have the ability to pose as a pilgrim or anything like that; the man was passive, complacent, and indifferent to others. He was indifferent to others and used to being taken care of and doing as he was told. These character flaws were considered aristocratic, so he never found the need nor desire to fix that issue.\u2018He didn\u2019t seem like the Duke I know.\u2019Ruger was bewildered; at some point, Luisen\u2019s mind looked hazy. The attendant could no longer figure anything out. It felt as if Luisen had changed into a completely different person.\u2018What could cause that person to change? There was no impetus.\u2019When the news that the second prince had lost the civil war and died, when the Duke fled to his castle, Luisen was still Luisen. Ruger thought he\u2019d get drunk and escape from reality.\u2018\u2026Carlton. Is it because of that bastard?\u2019Come to think of it, the turning point for the Duke\u2019s strange behavior was certainly around the time Luisen surrendered to the mercenary. From that point on, the Duke began to hide things from Ruger.\u201cDamn!\u201dCarlton, again. Is it really him? It\u2019s always him: a lowly man who doesn\u2019t even know his station, sticking to Luisen as if he\u2019s a knight\u2026\u201cWhy are you so angry?\u201d The ninth worshiper was irritated.\u201cCarlton\u2026 The Duke keeps on deviating from my expectations because of him. I can\u2019t fulfill my orders. Wouldn\u2019t you all be angry if your plans go awry?\u201d Ruger had been a spy for these past few years; his final mission was to kidnap Luisen.If he simply finished this job properly, his father\u2013these worshiper\u2019s master\u2013had promised to reward him accordingly. Maybe he could become a knight, a dream that he had once given up. Perhaps he\u2019d be recognized as his father\u2019s son. As his father had no heir, that position was open for Ruger.It was Ruger\u2019s lifelong dream to shed the stigma of being an illegitimate child and to proclaim his name proudly. Ruger justified his anger, stating that of course he\u2019d be angry since things went wrong\u2013snatched from the jaws of victory. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to look for another chance. Next time, I will have the Duke in hand.\u201d\u201cMy brother\u2019s ankle must be treated first.\u00a01\u00a0We won\u2019t cooperate with you until then.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to back out now? The Duke is right in front of our nose.\u201d\u201cThe Duke of Anies is your father\u2019s and your target. This is not the worshipers\u2019 objective. There\u2019s no reason to cooperate with you at the expense of our brothers. Let the Duke be attacked by a goblin\u2013then, at least, it would be easier to drag him away.\u201d\u201cHe could die. I was ordered to bring him in alive.\u201dThe ninth worshiper thought for a moment, then, with a meaningful smile, said, \u201cWe could attach his lifeforce back again, though?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\"\"\u201cI thought you were going to protect the Duke.\u201d\u201cWhy would I?\u201d\u201cYou said it earlier? \u2018I\u2019m the only one who can protect you properly.'\u201d The ninth worshiper mimicked Ruger with an exaggerated tone. It was obvious that the man was trying to tease the attendant again.Ruger replied, irritated and unable to ignore the man, \u201cWould you follow someone who said, \u2018if you follow me, you will die?'\u201d\u201cThen, when you\u2019ve caught him, I can take a peek, right? I have always been curious about noble blood.\u201dFor a moment, Ruger glared at the ninth worshiper as if he were going to kill the man.\u201cAh, so vicious. Someone would think I\u2019m your enemy.\u201d The ninth worshiper chuckled. Ruger turned around, ignoring himHe recalled Luisen\u2019s face when the young lord looked back at his shout. At first, his heart palpitated at the welcome face, but then it sank at the sight of the young lord\u2019s hair.\u2018After being an attendant for so many years, I\u2019ve become immersed. That\u2019s why I\u2019m like this.\u2019Since he played a faithful attendant for so long, he may have become worried about the Duke\u2019s welfare almost inadvertently. However, that was only a moment\u2019s confusion\u2013he would faithfully follow his master\u2019s order.\u2018There\u2019s no other reason. There can\u2019t be another reason.\u2019 Ruger repeated to himself. The attendant bit his lips until it bled. Looking at his very unstable appearance, the demon worshipers exchanged mysterious glances amongst themselves.***By the time the morning sun rose, Luisen and his party arrived at a small abbey. Morrison entered the building with a monk, saying that they needed to have a private talk; Luisen and Carlton waited outside for the inquisitor to exit again. The monk was probably a special contact that Morrison needed to find out the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s location.Taking advantage of the lull, Carlton taught Luisen simple self-defense techniques.\u201cIn a situation like last night, what should you do if that Ruger bastard forcibly drags my Duke away?\u201d\u201cI should shake him off and run away\u2026\u201d\u201cRight? That guy will probably try to grab my Duke like this and drag you away.\u201d Carlton grabbed Luisen by the arm. Although Carlton controlled his strength to be quite moderate, Luisen could not shake off the mercenary\u2019s hand. Carlton did not budge at all.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think I could shake him off.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s a difference in muscle strength, it\u2019s better to use techniques. Press the insides of the elbow with your arm; push his philtrum in with your head.\u201d\u201cThe philtrum?\u201d\u201cThe nose or the chin is alright as well. They\u2019re all vital points.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cOther vital points include the pit of the stomach and between the legs, but\u2026 Ruger would be wearing armor, so it\u2019s best to aim for his face.\u201dLuisen nodded with a serious expression, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you a demonstration.\u201d Carlton made Luisen grab his arm. As the young lord clenched his grip with all his might, Carlton pressed the inside of Luisen\u2019s elbow with his hand. Since the elbow was a joint meant to fold, the arm folded easily, without much force needed. Consequently, the young lord\u2019s arm weakened. In that state, Carlton\u2019s head flew forward.\u201cNnngh,\u201d Luisen closed his eyes reflexively.However, it wasn\u2019t Carlton\u2019s head but his lips that touched the young lord\u2019s lips. Luisen\u2019s face heated up at the soft touch; he glared at Carlton with narrowed eyes, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do it, then do it properly.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there too many people around to do something like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Luisen glanced around. Strangely, the travelers who should be passing by were hanging around the monastery. It felt like they kept glancing over here.Carlton shook Luisen\u2019s collar gently, \u201cYou should focus on learning\u2013I\u2019m teaching you quite diligently, after all.\u201d\u201cHah. And who\u2019s the one excited about this?\u201dCarlton grinned, enjoying Luisen\u2019s ludicrous expression. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in the situation to be able to hit with your head, it\u2019s good to aim for the eyes. Poke the eyes while pushing the face away with your palm; spit and spray dirt; slam the other\u2019s head into something, etc.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all\u2026self defense?\u201d\u2018All this dog-fighting?\u2019 Luisen felt a bit sour.\u201cEven if I teach you proper techniques, you probably won\u2019t be able to copy them?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a simple matter to dodge someone slow like my Duke. However, if you can shake them up for even just one moment, it would mean the difference between life and death. And, now that you know all this, my Duke will be able to handle things in a calm manner.\u201dApart from these tactics, Carlton taught Luisen various dirty and cheap maneuvers to use in times of need. The mercenary also fulfilled his own self-interest by fondling the young lord\u2019s waist when claiming to show Luisen a demonstration. The mercenary\u2019s machinations were quite transparent, but Luisen pretended to be ignorant while secretly enjoying the attention.After a while, Morrison emerged from the abbey.FootnotesBrother, ofc, is said in a collegiate sense rather than a blood-sibling sense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Judging by the full head of hair, the man wasn\u2019t a monk; furthermore, he was quite dressed up. Luisen had no idea who he was, but the man seemed quite glad to see the young lord, \u201cEsteemed Pilgrim. It seems that we meet again so soon.\u201d\u201cAhaha. Yes. Of course. Who are you\u2026?\u201d Luisen smiled awkwardly and stared at the Inquisitor.Morrison explained, \u201cThis person was on the boat crossing Mittil just a little while ago. Apparently, he works as an errand boy at this monastery.\u201d\u201cI greeted you when you dismounted the ship, but you must have forgotten. I had implored you to visit our abbey, as I wanted to repay you.\u201dHonestly, Luisen didn\u2019t usually remember any of those well wishes, greetings, or other such formalities. At that time, more than one or two people had greeted him similarly; also, he was shocked by the events that happened that day\u2013Morrison had kidnapped him\u2013so, the young lord could hardly remember anyone\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2013I apologize. My memory is a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s alright. These things can happen. I heard you wanted an audience with Duke Assylus\u2013I believe I can help with that.\u201d He said that the Eastern Great Lord had recently commissioned a book from the monastery. This person happened to be the one chosen to deliver the book and was willing to take Luisen\u2019s party with him.Of course, the man wasn\u2019t of a status that could directly greet the Eastern Great Lord. However, the party could accompany him to the insides of the Great Lord\u2019s barracks, and, when he hands the book off to a servant, he could secretly mention Luisen.\u201cIf you do this for us, I would of course be extremely grateful, but I wonder if we\u2019re asking a difficult favor from you\u2026\u201dThe errand boy waved away Luisen\u2019s concern, \u201cI owe the esteemed pilgrim a great favor. Saying a few words cannot compare to the difficulties the pilgrim faces. And, since the Duke is deeply religious, he is already interested in the recently famous pilgrim.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to hear about the esteemed pilgrim\u2019s activities aboard the ship. Since it happened in the east. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll offer great compliments.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll leave this to you.\u201d Luisen decided to accept the man\u2019s offer\u2013there was no reason to refuse. Besides, Morrison\u2019s smile seemed to indicate that the messenger had no other options.\u2018I suppose being famous isn\u2019t always a bad thing.\u2019Even without Morrison\u2019s pressure, there would still be many people willing to help him. Though it may be overly prideful, Luisen was still proud to think that this was because of his accomplishments.***The Eastern Great Lord was staying in a tent on a plain about a half day\u2019s journey away from the abbey. His crew was moving toward the capital at an incredibly slow pace.When Luisen arrived at the plain, he saw dozens of large and small tents erected atop the flat plain. A wood fence was set up around the boundary, making the whole camp resemble a nomadic village. In the center, a red wave-patterned flag, which symbolized the Eastern Great Lord, fluttered in the air.Various other flags representing other aristocratic families were also erected around the central flag: it seemed that the Eastern Great Lord had attracted other forces, and they were all traveling together en masse.As the world remained chaotic, the aristocratic union in the east showcased their robustness and intent to highlight the authority of their Great Lord.There were a great many people outside the wooden fence\u2013these consisted of those who could not join the Easter Great Lord\u2019s party and were camped near the entrance to see a glimpse of the great noble\u2019s face. They begged the soldiers, bribed them\u2026 In any case, things were a mess.\u2018It must have been difficult to even make it this far.\u2019Once they learned the location of the Great Lord, Luisen thought it would somehow be possible to be granted a meeting. But now that he saw the situation with his own two eyes, the young lord thought he wouldn\u2019t be able to go near the entrance.Perhaps if he removed his hood and identified himself, Luisen would be able to pass easily. However, Luisen wanted to hide his identity as much as possible; he thought it would be best to reveal his identity when he met the Great Lord.Luisen\u2019s party easily passed through the wooden barrier thanks to their introduction as an errand-group. The audience\u2019s jealous eyes fell upon the young lord.The Great Lord\u2019s servant came out to greet the messenger. \u201cMy lord has been eagerly looking forward to this book.\u201d The servants wore gloves before examining the book, page by page. These books, which were hand-written and hand-drawn by the monks, were like works of art.The errand boy\u2013the messenger\u2013quietly brought up Luisen\u2019s party while staring into the servant\u2019s eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of their group from a rumor going around\u2013I suppose the Lord will be interested in this story. What fortune\u2013the banquet has just gotten boring, so I believe it\u2019ll be alright to introduce\u2026.\u201d At that moment, the servant glanced towards Luisen and nodded when he saw the young lord.The messenger quietly remarked that things had gone well before turning around; Luisen and his companions were guided to a splendid tent\u2013large and colorful due to its red embroidery.Another servant entered the tent and told them that he\u2019d ask for an audience for the pilgrim from the Eastern Great Lord. The servant who had accompanied Luisen\u2019s party had the pleasure of laying out basic etiquette to Luisen; the words went in one ear and out the next for the young lord.\u2018I won\u2019t be chased away this time, right?\u2019Things had changed since the regression. He knew that intimately, but a little anxiety was inevitable as the young lord recalled old memories.At that moment, Carlton sneakily took the young lord\u2019s hand. The mercenary\u2019s palms wrapped tightly around the back of the young lord\u2019s hand\u2013that alone reassured Luisen. \u2018That\u2019s right. If anything happens, Carlton will carry me and escape.\u2019The servant that just entered the tent called for Luisen, \u201cPlease enter.\u201d\u201cOnce we\u2019re inside, please leave things to me. Both of you, try to refrain from speaking as much as possible.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cHaah.\u201d Luisen took a deep breath and walked inside. The attending servant and Luisen took the lead followed by Carlton and Morrison.The banquet was in full swing inside the tent; a band played music, and the nobles chatted as they ate and drank. The attending servants were busy at work, and the knights stood upright and vigilant.This scene was similar to banquets in the duke\u2019s castle. However, Luisen was surprised by the sheer number of nobles. It seemed like all the lords of the eastern territories were gathered here. The nobles were so busy playing among themselves that they didn\u2019t even look towards Luisen\u2019s group.\u2018Wherever we went, we heard that the nobles had fled. I suppose this was where everyone gathered.\u2019As the situation was unstable, perhaps it was reasonable for the nobles to gather underneath the Great Lord\u2019s wing. The choice was made for survival, but their behavior seemed pathetic to the outside eye.Bandits and monsters ran rampant outside; day by day, people turned their backs on their hometowns, unable to survive. These so-called lords sat here, busy drinking and playing. In exchange for their comfortable drinks, their denizens may wander, never able to settle down.As he thought about that, Luisen became desperate to return to his throne.The young lord reached the end of the carpet and stood in front of the Eastern Great Lord. He, in turn, sat on a chair decorated with gems. Uncaring of Luisen\u2019s approach, he laughed and exchanged jokes with young maids. Deliberately not paying attention to Luisen was a small show of the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s authority.The Duke of Assylus, the Eastern Great Lord, looked the same as he did in Luisen\u2019s memory\u2013a face of a relaxed and kind old man, whose eyes shone as brightly as any other youth\u2019s. The man was a sophisticated politician; a man who held his powerful post for many years.\u2018A very consistent man.\u2019Because of that, the rest of Luisen\u2019s anxiety flew away. As he watched the Eastern Great Lord show off, the young lord\u2019s heart yearned to match the man\u2019s rhythm. Although he was seeking help, Luisen was similarly another Great Lord.He was Luisen Anies. If the ruler of the golden fields had to kneel, he should only kneel twice: once before God and once before the king.Come to think of it, he knelt several times in front of Carlton, but that was tied to the duchy\u2019s fate\u2026 so the young lord could let that go. In any case, it hurt his pride to be the first to bow down.Luisen stood at a distance and waited for the Eastern Great Lord to see him.\u201cHem. Hem Hem.\u201d The servant coughed in vain, trying to give him a hint. Nevertheless, Luisen acted as if he didn\u2019t understand. At that point, the servant lowered his voice and urged, \u201cLook here\u2013what are you doing, being so discourteous to the Lord!\u201dLuisen ignored the servant\u2019s shouts. He looked back, just to check; Morrison and Carlton sat with one knee on the floor with their heads bowed down.The sight of them being so polite was quite refreshing\u2013after all, whether their opponents were aristocrats or not, they were more likely to bash their opponents\u2019 heads in.\u201cHave you ever seen such a wicked man?! I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d greet our Lord with his back straightened!\u201d As the servant roared, the knights also approached angrily. At that time, the nobles also looked at Luisen, wondering what was going on. The masses stirred slightly when they saw Luisen standing far away.The Easter Great Lord also glanced at Luisen\u2019s party after being alerted by the disturbance. Just as Luisen thought he should slowly begin to speak, the other spoke first.\u201cWait.\u201dAt that word, all the servants and knights stopped in their tracks; the nobles all held their breath, watching for their duke\u2019s next movement. Since the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s authority was clearly established, the hierarchy was clearly delineated, even in such chaotic situations. The noisy barracks became quiet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEveryone thought the Eastern Great Lord would reprimand Luisen for his rudeness, but their expectations were subverted. The Great Lord asked Luisen with a slight smile on his face, \u201cWho may you be?\u201dLuisen furrowed his brows. His question belied the connotation that Luisen wasn\u2019t an ordinary pilgrim. The eyes of this old and experienced powerful man sparkled like new-born stars. The young lord was certain that the Eastern Great Lord had already noticed his identity\u2013it just felt that way.\u201cYou already know who I am, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u2018The pilgrim in the rumors already knows the Great Lord? Who in the world is he?\u2019 The nobles murmured amongst themselves as they tried to guess at Luisen\u2019s identity. Many names were thrown out, but the Duke of Anies was not one of them.At Luisen\u2019s answer, the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s smile deepened, \u201cStill, I should at least see your face.\u201dDid he mean for Luisen to reveal his identity in front of all these people? Rumors that Luisen, the Southern Great Lord, was here would spread instantly.He had suspicions about the Great Lord\u2019s implication-filled words, but, no matter how he wracked his brain, he couldn\u2019t figure out the man\u2019s ulterior motive. Luisen was forced to take off his hood.The noon sun rays, peering in through the tent window, landed upon Luisen\u2019s hair. His short, blonde hair glistened brilliantly, like a halo. His white face and delicate features\u2013his unhideable splendor\u2013were revealed.He did not need to state his name\u2013everyone here recognized Luisen Anies. Many nobles here remembered his face: exactly as if nobility had distilled itself into human form. Luisen\u2019s face and status were famous.\u201cMy word. That face! Isn\u2019t that the Duke Anies?\u201d\u201cHis aura has changed somewhat, but it\u2019s truly Duke Anies, alright.\u201d\"\"\u201cDidn\u2019t they say he was missing? He looks fine? Although, he\u2019s a bit of a mess\u2026\u201dThe nobles were in great uproar. That was Luisen, someone who had always been surrounded by luxurious and high-quality items without a single rumpled hair on his head. Compared to that, the young lord\u2019s hair was messy and his face looked rough. However, his eyes were more stable than ever; his expression was confident. He held the unique poise and solidity of a person who had seen and overcome hardships. As his inner character had changed, his outward aura also seemed different.As someone who had been observing Luisen since childhood, the Eastern Great Lord noticed the change and was amazed.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long while, Duke Assylus.\u201d Luisen nodded his head. Though they were similar in birth status, he should treat the other with respect befitting an older adult due to their big age difference.\u201cHow could this be?! Aren\u2019t you Duke Anies?\u201d The Easter Great lord exaggerated his gracious welcome. \u201cHow startling. And you were the famous pilgrim as well? It seems you\u2019ve accomplished many great deeds!\u201d\u201cWell, yes. As you can see.\u201d\u201cI see. Of course. You\u2019ve changed.\u201d The Eastern Great Lord looked at the young noble with a deeply satisfied face. Luisen thought it felt so awkward to see that expression on someone who used to always look upon him with disapproval.The surrounding aristocrats, who could only watch the proceedings with mouths wide open, were slowly recovering their senses.\u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d Luisen stated.\u201cI have much to talk about with you as well. Why don\u2019t you come with me for a while. We shall continue the banquet after I briefly converse with the Duke of Anies.\u201d The Easter Great Lord rose from his seat and then placed his hand on Luisen\u2019s shoulder. Since the man was reaching out with a friendly and affectionate gesture, Luisen could only follow him out with a sour look darkening his features.***In order to take their time as they talked, the Eastern Great Lord took Luisen back to his own tent. Carlton and Morrison remained behind, still prostrate on the ground, and only Luisen sat at the table with the Great Lord.\u201cHow did you know? I\u2019m certain you wouldn\u2019t have known that I was posing as a pilgrim.\u201d Luisen said.\u201cOnly you, among all other youngsters, would stand so upright before me. That\u2019s how I knew. So, you\u2019re the pilgrim. Yes. No one would guess you\u2019d pose as a pilgrim when you couldn\u2019t even remember a simple pre-ceremony prayer\u2013that was smart of you. After all, you would need to cover your conspicuous appearance, but, in most cases, covering your face would paint you as a suspicious person.\u201d\u201cYes\u2013it wasn\u2019t my idea. A friend of mine helped greatly.\u201d Luisen pointed towards Carlton. Though the Eastern Great Lord glanced towards the mercenary, he dismissed the man.\u2018As expected,\u2019 Luisen swallowed a bitter smile. He wanted to give the older noble a good impression of Carlton, but it was futile.\u201cI had no idea, and, in trying to find you, I kept catching\u00a0the wrong\u00a0people.\u201d\u201cYou tried to find me?\u201d\u201cI received a letter from your general. Since I learned you were on your way to the capital, I looked for you.\u201d\u201cThe General? Could I possibly see this letter?\u201dThe Eastern Great Lord gladly handed the letter over. Luisen began to read. Though the gaze of the other man was quite burdensome, he tried to stay calm and take in each written word. When the young lord finished reading, he could guess why the Eastern Great Lord was acting so friendly.\u2018So, I\u2019m apparently useful in keeping the royal family in check.\u2019The Eastern Great Lord\u2019s territory was close to the area the king had direct control over. As a result, the man was especially sensitive to matters related to the royal family\u2013even more than the other Great Lords. With the help of another Great Lord, Luisen (who was already on bad terms with the first prince), the Great Lords\u2019 authority may be maintained.This attitude\u2013so different from before his regression\u2013was quite understandable. The biggest difference between the timelines was that the Anies Duchy was still alive and well. Except for the duke\u2019s castle, the Anies Duchy wasn\u2019t as affected by the civil war; the farming yielded ample harvest, and the denizens and retainers were motivated and patriotic. If the territory passes this winter well, the duchy could go further than restoring any damages wrought by the civil war\u2013beyond regaining its past glory.The Eastern Great Lord must have received this letter from the general and, after contemplating this and that, continued to search for Luisen in order to extend help.Although the letter was written in logical and calm prose, there was a sense of desperation leaking through the handwriting.\u2018General\u2026\u2019 Luisen\u2019s heart stung. He went missing and never contacted his trusty retainer\u2013the general was ignorant of the young lord\u2019s situation. Nevertheless, he kept looking to help in any way possible. Waiting\u2026Believing\u2026that Luisen will endure and make it through.\u2018I must return to the duchy soon!\u2019 Luisen was resolute.\u201cSo, haven\u2019t I always said that lords like us only retain strength when the citizens and retainers hold their line firmly?\u201d The Eastern Great Lord prompted, thinking to seize the opportunity now.\u201cAh, yes yes,\u201d Luisen said a bit bluntly, still shaken by the surge of emotions running through him. Since ancient times, the older lord had nagged Luisen to stop playing with the two princes and to return to his territory to serve as its lord. The young lord hadn\u2019t taken the advice seriously at that time, but the words rang true.\u2018Anyway, I should be able to reach the capital safely without being chased away like last time.\u2019 Luisen, now relieved, explained all that had happened so far to the Eastern Great Lord. Morrison had asked him beforehand to keep the existences of the demon worshippers a secret, so Luisen vaguely glossed over those parts. Instead, the young lord claimed Morrison was a merchant that was traveling with him to repay the pilgrim\u2019s kindness.\u201cIsn\u2019t that why I\u2019ve told you to not let any riffraff into your fold? If you had thrown that redhead out when I told you to, this wouldn\u2019t have happened!\u201d\u201cDid you really say something like that?\u201d Luisen couldn\u2019t remember since the older lord nagged so much. Really, the words went in one ear and out the other. \u2018For some reason, everyone else hated Ruger.\u2019The Eastern Great Lord clicked his tongue and looked over Luisen\u2019s head to peer at Carlton. \u201cEven after being backstabbed like that, you still can\u2019t get your act together. You even have the first prince\u2019s dog by your side.\u201d\u201cHow could you call another human being a dog? Your words are too harsh.\u201d Luisen adopted a serious expression.\u201cThere\u2019s no difference between a dog and him.\u201d\u201cDuke Assylus!\u201d Luisen sprang up, enraged. \u2018This old man is really\u2013!\u2019\u201cAre you going to bring him along too?\u201d\u201cYes, both of them are part of my party. We\u2019ll definitely travel to the capital together. If you insist on dropping him, then I can\u2019t travel with you either.\u201d\u201cTsk. Even after the betrayal you still don\u2019t know how scary human beings can be. I thought you had become more mature, but you still have a long way to go.\u201d\u201cPlease leave your nagging to your grandson. That child is sure to listen to everything you say.\u201d\u201cFine, fine. If that\u2019s your wish.\u201dAfter all, no matter how much the older lord nagged, this was Luisen. Words that he found too bothersome flowed in one ear and out the other. Contrary to expectations, however, the Eastern Great Lord backed off after the young lord\u2019s vehement denial. \u201cI suppose it would be best for me to talk with those two for a while as well. Your party is now my party, after all.\u201dLuisen looked back at Carlton and Morrison. Both men indicated that they would be fine with that arrangement. Luisen was forced to grant permission.The Eastern Great Lord called for his granddaughter and asked her to personally take care of Luisen. Though Luisen was worried about Carlton, he had no choice but to leave the tent behind as he followed the granddaughter\u2019s lead.***Once Luisen left, the insides of the tent became silent. The Eastern Great Lord looked down at Morrison and Carlton wordlessly. Morrison and Carlton couldn\u2019t speak unless the Lord spoke first, so they had to wait.What does he want to say after dragging the time like that? Suddenly a pouch, full of gold coins, fell with a sharp thud before the inquisitor and mercenary.\u201cThis is payment for supporting the Duke of Anies thus far.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t do it for money,\u201d Carlton replied.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor beyond everything for someone like you, with such a poor status in life, to have guided and been invited to travel with a duke. Still, wouldn\u2019t it be worthwhile to take something tangible with you at least? Especially you.\u201d The Eastern Great Lord looked at Carlton with clear contempt.Carlton promptly noticed that gaze, but simply bit his lips.\u201cActually, if it were up to me, I would have chased punks like you away. How dare a dog raised by the first prince try to curry favor in my presence.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The situation itself was unacceptable; the fact that Carlton was allowed to run wild made the Great Lord uncomfortable.How many nobles had left their hometowns in order to request protection, frightened by the mercenary\u2019s existence? Considering their pitiful situation, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to place Carlton in jail right now and order the knights to torture the man.\u201cHowever, Duke Anies relied on you immensely. I\u2019m accepting you all for his sake, so don\u2019t act rashly.\u201d\u201cYes, Understood,\u201d Carlton replied, relatively tranquilly. The Eastern Great Lord\u2019s words were sharp, but this was not disgraceful compared to the humiliation he usually experienced at the hands of other nobles. Anyway, it wasn\u2019t worth summoning a beating by running his mouth. And, as the Great Lord said, it would behoove him to be conscious of Luisen\u2019s position.The Eastern Great Lord waved his hands. At that gesture, a servant said, \u201cLet us leave now.\u201dCarlton and Morrison couldn\u2019t utter a word of complaint even though the conversation was so one-sided. The two bowed politely to the lord who no longer even looked at them and turned around.Suddenly, the Eastern Great Lord opened his mouth, \u201cCome to think of it, I\u2019ve been hearing an incredibly absurd rumor. About *you* and Duke Anies,\u201d he said scornfully.\u00a01Carlton turned and looked back at the older noble.\u201cAccording to those rumors, he\u2019s been treating you in a special manner. Don\u2019t be mistaken, though. There have been many deluded fools who have lost themselves to fantasies after the Duke showed brief interest in them. He\u2019s the type to become tired of anything easily\u2013and that goes for people as well.\u201dThe Eastern Great Lord seemed to say, \u2018Don\u2019t think you\u2019re so special.\u2019 Carlton clenched his fist involuntarily; his trembling palms became white with tension. He was able to endure accusations that he\u2019d been acting for money\u2013he was fine with being treated like a stray dog\u2026but it was hard to bear any negative slights towards Luisen.Morrison looked anxious; he was ready to block with his body if Carlton were to rush forward. Earlier, as they had breakfast, Luisen slyly warned Morrison to stop Carlton at all costs if Carlton was unable to stand the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s rhetoric. The young lord said the older noble had no one in command who could stop the mercenary.\"\"But, contrary to Morrison\u2019s and Luisen\u2019s expectations, Carlton lowered his eyes. All the anger and contempt boiling within him was hidden by his eyelids. \u201cThank you for your advice, my lord. I shall keep that in mind.\u201dCarlton did not forget to maintain customary courtesy towards those of higher status until he left the tent. His insides burned as if he had swallowed a fireball, but the mercenary endured while thinking of Luisen.***The Eastern Great Lord reopened the banquet in the evening. Though Luisen had no intention of enjoying himself at the banquet, he could not excuse himself from the festivities as it was held to welcome Luisen\u2019s arrival.Although he ate delicious food and drank precious, expensive alcohol, his heart felt uncomfortable throughout the night. Carlton and Morrison were not at the banquet even though they were in the same party. No one else thought that strange, and only Luisen felt uneasy the entire time.The festivities continued into the night. Though the young lord narrowly managed to escape the Eastern Great Lord and the other noble\u2019s grasps, he was found by maids who came and pushed Luisen into a tent. He couldn\u2019t shake off the weak maids; he entered the tent in a state of disarray as he had been forced to drink a significant amount of alcohol just a short while previously.\u2018I was going to go see Carlton\u2026\u2019Luisen flopped into the bed. Though the mattress seemed quite simple, the wool made it fluffy. This was heaven compared to sleeping on a cape on bare ground, but the loneliness made the young lord feel empty. When he asked the maids where his companions were they informed him that Carlton and Morrison were assigned to a separate accommodation and were resting as well.The Eastern Great Lord was a man who observed the strict standards of one\u2019s status, so the young lord knew that, when he joined the older noble\u2019s party, he wouldn\u2019t be able to cling to his companions as he did before. However, now no one was around, Luisen felt so lonely.\u2018If I don\u2019t go, Carlton is sure to sneak out at night to come find me\u2026 I\u2019ll just have to wait.\u2019When Carlton came, Luisen resolved to comfort the man so that he would forget what the older noble said. The young lord was sure nothing good came out of the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s mouth.Luisen rubbed his sleepy eyes; he slapped his thighs in order to keep himself awake for Carlton\u2019s arrival. However, the mercenary did not come even after dawn broke. In the end, Luisen could not overcome the power of alcohol and fell asleep.\"\"***The next day:The Eastern Great Lord\u2019s party prepared for an early start. Following the older noble, Luisen climbed into the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s carriage.The young lord had no need to lift a single finger in this journey\u2013everything was taken care of by the maids. Delicious food and warm tea were always prepared. The older noble\u2019s carriage was steady and comfortable, and the other nobles riding along joked and bantered so that Luisen wouldn\u2019t feel too bored.Luisen used to take such luxurious trips for granted, but now he felt somewhat awkward.After traveling like that for the entire day, resting, the group once again set up tents and prepared to spend the night. Once again, the Eastern Great Lord hosted a grand dinner, so Luisen was occupied until the depths of the night.After the banquet finished, the exhausted young lord entered his tent and stretched out on his bed. This scene was similar to the previous night.\u2018For some reason\u2026 I think he\u2019s doing this on purpose.\u2019 Luisen whispered to himself. The young lord\u2019s perceptive eye had matured a little on this trip, and he gleaned that the Eastern Great Lord was deliberately keeping him from his companions.Luisen missed Carlton and was worried about him. He resolved to find the mercenary when he found the time. As the young lord rode in the carriage, his gaze looked out the window the whole time. And, when the carriage stopped, he wandered around, searching for the mercenary.However, before he could even walk around properly, he frequently had no choice but to return to the carriage as he was interrupted by various nobles or servants. One time, around lunch, Luisen spotted Morrison helping a few servants in the distance and tried to approach. But, before Luisen could get close, a nearby knight said something to him and dragged him away. The Eastern Great Lord even called upon Luisen from time to time, nagging away.As a result, Luisen had been unable to see Carlton since yesterday.\u2018\u2026There\u2019s no way Carlton was chased away and kicked out\u2026right?\u2019Carlton wasn\u2019t the type to obediently let himself be kicked out alone, and Morrison would probably have informed the young lord earlier if that were the case. The mercenary was surely somewhere in this large encampment.\u2018To think I\u2019ve spent an entire day away from Carlton. Unbelievable\u2019Just yesterday the two traveled together as if they were one body and soul. Though the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s carriage was of the highest quality\u2013it shook less and was quite plush\u2013it couldn\u2019t compare to Carlton\u2019s arms.The young lord struggled with this empty feeling and, once again, he waited for Carlton to come that night. However, even as the night deepened, no one visited him. The mercenary could certainly have avoided others\u2019 eyes on the way to Luisen\u2019s bed; it dawned on the young lord that the mercenary didn\u2019t try to come see him yesterday or today.\u2018Is something wrong?\u2019Did he really hear something horrible from the older noble? Is that why he\u2019s keeping to himself? Carlton had a large ego and sense of pride, but, at the same time, his self-esteem could be delicate.\u2018I can\u2019t let this lie. I suppose I\u2019ll have to go find him.\u2019 Luisen jumped to his feet. Since the tent was a simple construction, it wasn\u2019t difficult to sneak out. He crawled out of the tent, careful to not jostle the central pillar and make it collapse. The tent looked a bit misshapen afterwards, and his clothes became covered in dirt, but he didn\u2019t care. Carlton would accept him even if he rolled around in mud.The thought of meeting the mercenary made his steps light; where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. As soon as Luisen popped out of his tent, Morrison also popped out of somewhere.\u201cMy god. What are you doing here?\u201d Luisen asked, startled.\u201cI was searching around for suspicious people. What about you, my duke?\u201d\u201cI came out to look for Carlton. What good fortune to meet you now\u2013where is he?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Morrison adopted a vague expression.\u201cWhat is it? Is something wrong? Do you perhaps not know where Carlton is either?\u201d\u201cNo\u2013I know, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, guide me to him.\u201dMorrison couldn\u2019t win against Luisen\u2019s frown, so he took the young lord to a dark, open space as if he had no other option.There was an ongoing scuffle\u2013Carlton, armorless, was fighting barehanded with four armed knights. Anyone could see that the knights had started this unjustified duel.Carlton looked to be the overwhelming victor, but the situation seemed too dangerous and disadvantageous for him in Luisen\u2019s eyes. Holding a sword against an unarmed opponent\u2026wasn\u2019t that basically declaring one\u2019s intent to stab the other to death?!\u201cWhat are you all doing!\u201d Luisen roared thunderously.Carlton flinched and let go of one of the knights\u2019 collars. Luisen strode past him, placing the mercenary behind him, and looked at the knights. \u201cFor knights to attack one person in a group like that\u2026Aren\u2019t you ashamed? Which noble here carries around honorless knights like you all?\u201d\u201cNo, we were just\u2026\u201dWell. They were getting beaten one-sidedly. The knights were embarrassed and looked wrong, but they couldn\u2019t make any excuses either. After all, how shameful was it to jointly attack an unarmed person?\u201cName the lord you serve,\u201d Luisen commanded.\u201cE-esteemed Duke. Please have mercy\u2026\u201d\"\"\u201cDo as they say\u2013just let them go,\u201d Carlton said.\u201cBut these people just attacked you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve won anyway. And, I wouldn\u2019t want this to become a bigger incident.\u201dWhen Carlton, the person involved, said all that, Luisen couldn\u2019t hold onto his anger. \u201cLeave\u2013get lost. I\u2019ll keep all your faces in mind,\u201d the young lord said, scornfully.\u201cY-yes. Thank you so much. Thank you, Duke.\u201d The knights ran away without looking back. Morrison had already vanished from the scene, leaving only Luisen and Carlton in this dark, open space.Footnotes\ub124\ub188 is a way to say \u201cyou\u201d with a scornful, derisive tone. There\u2019s really no address in English that has that inherent derision, sadlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94\u201cThose wicked men. Does it make sense for a group of knights to attack one man?\u201d Still angry, Luisen looked back at Carlton\u2026though, since Carlton was the unilateral victor, he was perfectly fine. The young lord knew Carlton was inhumanly strong, but his startled heart had yet to calm down.\u2018How dare those people point blades at my Carlton!?\u2019\u201cTell me. Were there many people like them? Do the men here bother you? Who? Bring them all! I\u2019ll teach them a lesson!\u201d Luisen raged.\u201cThere won\u2019t be many fools here who would exchange blades with my Duke.\u201d Unlike Luisen, who was furious and unable to release his anger, Carlton was calm. As if this was an everyday experience. That\u2026wasn\u2019t like Carlton at all.\u201cDid something happen?\u201d\u201cNothing much happened.\u201dNo\u2013the young lord was sure something had happened. Luisen looked anxiously at his companion. Carlton, in turn, tried to be tranquil but failed and looked like a man that had lost all energy. \u201cBy any chance, did the Eastern Great Lord say anything to you?\u201dThe older noble was well known for being someone who could tear a person\u2019s heart apart with a single flap of the tongue. How bad must Carlton, who was already a prideful person, feel to hear pure hate from someone like the Eastern Great Lord, who probably didn\u2019t even consider, nor treat, the mercenary as another human being?\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you and Morrison alone. I should have stayed with you.\u201dCarlton shook his head when Luisen kept blaming himself. \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cThen, why do you look so down?\u201d Luisen cupped Carlton\u2019s cheek. Carlton leaned slightly into the young lord\u2019s hand without responding. As the other\u2019s soft touch gently caressed his cheek, Carlton wanted to tell him all about how hard the day was and how much he missed Luisen. However, he didn\u2019t want to appear weak in front of Luisen, so he simply closed his mouth without saying anything.He knew people would reject him, but this was more than he imagined.Although the nobles disregard him as a lowborn peasant, they also treated him as if he were a violent criminal\u2013a rapist, etc. The aristocracy underneath the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s wing and the first prince\u2026they were all the same.Still, the nobles on the first prince\u2019s side were at least aware of the mercenary\u2019s usefulness; they knew that the first prince needed him and kept him in line. Carlton, in turn, knew that the first prince would protect him, so he was able to spread his wings without having to be too wary of the people around him.However, here the Eastern Great Lord was openly at odds with the first prince, so Carlton was detested even more as the first prince\u2019s hands and feet.Carlton did nothing\u2013rather, he kept quiet\u2013but the nobles kept pouring out all their scorn and contempt at him. The knights constantly jeered and quarreled with him; the servants clearly showcased their discomfort at his presence as they avoided him.He wasn\u2019t even given a tent let alone a proper meal; Carlton was homeless. Even so, since Luisen said that he was part of the young lord\u2019s party, he at least was afforded this little grace. Otherwise, the mercenary would have been hung upside-down, beaten, and dumped in a random field.After spending a day with the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s entourage, Carlton acknowledged the reality that faced him.The winds of misfortune still blew over him. He had made countless contributions, but his effort was yet to be recognized; he made his name known to the world, but the fact of his identity as a lowborn mercenary remained the same. As his notoriety soared, it was clear that many people bearing numerous grudges against him would devour the mercenary if the protection of his powerful benefactors, whether that was the first prince or Luisen, disappeared.This was a matter of survival. And, it was more advantageous for his survival for him to remain next to the first prince than to stand by Luisen. He had already achieved much for the first prince\u2019s cause, and the prince had more use for a mercenary.Realistically speaking, Carlton\u2019s future direction became increasingly clear. If they were going to break up anyway, perhaps it\u2019d be best to neatly clean up and tie away the emotions as well.Carlton gazed at Luisen. The young lord\u2019s short hair was partially drawn back to reveal the forehead; the young lord\u2019s slim jawline constantly drew attention. Luisen was still looking at the mercenary with anxious eyes\u2013with that unrealistically beautiful face.The young lord\u2019s beauty made Carlton even more depressed.\u201cWould you like to come to my tent? No one will be able to do or say anything if you\u2019re accompanying me. Besides, there\u2019s good wine there as well.\u201d Luisen grabbed Carlton by the arm.The young lord smelled faintly of perfume; Carlton\u2019s heart throbbed. He whispered to himself, \u2018A man\u2019s instinct is surely reckless\u2013it makes one want to forgo reality and just follow the heart.\u2019 The mercenary had the urge to hold the young lord in his arms and inhale that perfume scent.They said that falling in love makes one stupid. Carlton smiled bitterly as he recalled how he laughed at such love-lorn fools.Then, suddenly, he became curious: what motive or feelings must Luisen have to treat him so kindly? The young lord didn\u2019t need him anymore, but Luisen still came to see him, got angry on his behalf, and took care of him despite the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s disapproval. Luisen never failed to be affectionate towards Carlton either.What if Luisen felt the same way as him? If the young lord regarded him as a special person, would it be best to rethink this decision?All these lingering thoughts remained, such as: \u2018What should he do if Luisen loves him back?\u2019 To be honest, Carlton thought he wouldn\u2019t do well if he were to stay in a peaceful agricultural territory like the Anies duchy. After all, he was good at fighting\u2013what amazing things could he achieve in the duchy?Nevertheless, Carlton leaned into the embrace and asked cautiously, \u201cMy Duke\u2026What will you do from here on?\u201dActually, he wanted to ask something else\u2013 \u2018What do you think of me?\u2019 and \u2018Have you thought about a future with me?\u2019 But, those questions were too straightforward and embarrassing; furthermore, he was afraid of a negative response.Compared to the mercenary\u2019s complicated, tangled emotions, Luisen\u2019s answer was quite simple, \u201cHm? After cleaning up my dealings with the first prince and catching the demon worshippers\u2026 I suppose I\u2019ll do my job?\u201d\u2018Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?\u2019 Luisen was slightly puzzled, but he thought nothing more of it.Carlton frowned before asking even more cautiously\u2013with more implied nuance, \u201cAnd then? What will you do when everything is sorted out?\u201d\u201cWell, I suppose I\u2019ll return to the duchy?\u201dThe young lord hadn\u2019t really formulated any specific plans, but his mind was made up when he received the letter from the General and after seeing the situation in the Eastern side of the kingdom. \u201cAs the Great Lord and Master of the duchy, I felt the heavy weight of responsibility. So, as soon as I\u2019m done, I\u2019d like to return to the duchy as soon as possible and fulfill my duties properly.\u201dLuisen expressed his ambitions confidently, but Carlton\u2019s face still looked incomprehensible,\u00a0 \u201cThen, what about me?\u201d\u201cYou?\u201d Luisen thought a bit more seriously.Carlton was ambitious and had the talent to support those ambitions. Though his touch was cruel and he was prone to anger, the mercenary had become much softer recently. If Carlton didn\u2019t truly anger those who didn\u2019t like him\u2013and built his base well\u2013he would not disappear from the world and be charged with treason, as had happened before the regression.\u2018I\u2019ll try my best to stop the events from the past timeline before returning.\u2019 Luisen thought.Carlton had been waiting for an answer with an uncharacteristically nervous expression. Luisen thought these questions were quite sudden, but perhaps the mercenary also grew worried as the day they\u2019d reach the capital was quickly approaching. After so many people harassed him during the day, while Luisen was absent, perhaps it was normal to hear such vulnerable emotions from Carlton.Luisen opened his mouth, \u201cI\u2019m sure the first prince will admit your immense contributions. You\u2019ll probably receive a proper government post and a title. There\u2019s nothing to worry about\u2013after all, you have me.\u201d\u201cYou, my duke?\u201d\u201cOf course. You\u2019ve been of great help to me, and I\u2019m someone who repays others\u2019 grace. I\u2019ll try my best to help you establish yourself in the royal castle.\u201d Luisen spoke brightly and tried to be convincing to reassure Carlton, but Carlton\u2019s expression hardened and became indescribably cold.\u2018So, this person is definitely sure we\u2019ll be parting from each other,\u2019 the mercenary thought.Luisen is a duke, and Carlton works under the first price. Perhaps the road forward was so clear, the duke naturally never seemed to have any further questions about the upcoming breakup. Even the duke\u2019s words seemed to draw a line in the sand between them.Carlton took a step back, removing the duke\u2019s hands and embrace. Luisen tried to follow reflexively, but Carlton raised his hand to block the young lord. The mercenary dodged the other\u2019s gaze, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to see Luisen anymore, turned around, and left.\u201cCarlton\u2026\u201d Luisen called the man\u2019s name, but Carlton never looked back. The young lord felt bewildered; just before the mercenary turned away, he looked hurt. As he saw those trembling eyes, Luisen realized something was wrong.The young lord reached at air belatedly. Though he couldn\u2019t reach the mercenary, he continued to watch Carlton move away.***The next day:Luisen awoke with a terrible hangover.After parting ways with Carlton last night, he returned to his tent alone. Since the young lord was supposed to be in the tent all night and appeared now covered with dirt, there was a little pandemonium. Disregarding all that, though, Luisen drank all the wine he had brought out to drink with Carlton by himself, became drunk, and laid languidly on his bed.Luisen grabbed his spinning head and entered the tent that doubled as the canteen. The Eastern Great Lord was waiting, as if he had been ready to nag at the young lord. \u201cWhy do you look like that? I heard you walked around covered in dirt last night. Haven\u2019t I told you to maintain the image of a Great Lord at all times?!\u201d\u201cYes, Yes.\u201d Spirit drained, Luisen let the words go in through one ear and spill out the other. The Eastern Great Lord called out his granddaughter and scolded her, dissatisfied with Luisen\u2019s reaction. He shouted that he had ordered her to take care of Luisen\u2013how could she let this happen? He ordered her to apologize and stick by Luisen\u2019s side all day.The older lord\u2019s scheme to place his granddaughter next to Luisen was obvious, but Luisen let that happen as he was too tired to deal with it. Regardless of the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s schemes, Luisen\u2019s head was full of Carlton.It felt painful to think of Carlton\u2019s hurt-filled face at their parting.\u2018Why was he like that? Did something really happen?\u2019The issue was, no matter how hard Luisen wracked his brain, he couldn\u2019t figure out the reason behind that pained expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Luisen reflected on the previous night\u2019s events.\u2018Now that I think about it, he wasn\u2019t in a good mood from the very beginning.\u2019It wasn\u2019t like Carlton to just send away the knights that had been harassing him. He hadn\u2019t come to see Luisen, and he managed to render himself unnoticeable despite his large stature. Truly, he must be hiding something to save himself.\u2018Then, the main culprit must be\u2026\u2019Luisen looked at the Eastern Great Lord. The older noble was dining on some egg-based dish and looked at Luisen as if he were saying, \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Why are you staring at me?\u2019\u2018That\u2019s right. This person is someone that could make Carlton act weirdly.\u2019\u201cWhat did you say to my party in my absence?\u201dThe Eastern Great Lord frowned slightly at Luisen\u2019s direct question, \u201cApparently you met that punk last night. Didn\u2019t he tell you everything?\u201d\u201cIf he had, would I be asking you right now?\u201d\u201cI simply told him to mind his manners. Since I had accepted them as part of my party, I believe I can ask that much from him.\u201d\u2018There\u2019s no way he said something so gentle?\u2019 As Luisen stared, the Eastern Great Lord added to his statement, as if nothing could be helped, \u201cI also mentioned a strange rumor that circulated regarding you two.\u201d\u201cAh\u2013Do you mean our flight of love?\u201d\u201cYou knew about it?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard about it.\u201dMorrison had already informed the young lord about the rumor\u2019s existence. Luisen had dismissed it as mere groundless gossip that might circulate the streets, but, if the Great Lord all the way in the eastern region of the kingdom knew about it, how far did this rumor travel?\u201cAnd you still chased after that man in the middle of the night even if you knew that such a rumor existed?\u201d\u201cEveryone important will know that rumor is false.\u201d Luisen was dumbfounded. It was obvious that the person who had made up this rumor didn\u2019t know Carlton very well. How could an ambitious man like the mercenary run away due to love? Carlton lived fiercely and was proud of his life\u2019s achievements. He wasn\u2019t romantic enough to throw all of that away for just \u2018love.\u2019\u201cWhy in the world are you and the men surrounding you always the subject of rumors?\u201d The Eastern Great Lord grumbled.\u201cWhat else was there?\u201d\u201cThere were wagging tongues about that traitor!\u201d\u201cWhat? Ruger and I? Well, that doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough with this talk!\u201d The Eastern Great Lord waved his hands, as if he loathed hearing anything. \u201cThis is all because you\u2019re unmarried.\u201d\u2018Honestly\u2013how did the topic change to that?\u2019 Luisen thought.\u201cYou should meet and marry a lady from a prestigious family and have many children! It\u2019s an obligation for people like us to leave many descendants. You have to continue your family line,\u201d he said, grandiosely.As the Eastern Great Lord showed signs of gearing up to make a speech, Luisen tried to listen with only one ear, as usual.However, suddenly, the other noble adopted a serious and sincere expression. \u201cHow about my granddaughter?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Luisen was flustered. Did he mean the granddaughter he scolded just now? The granddaughter he ordered to attend to Luisen all day? Even now, she was busily preparing tea next to the young lord. Certainly, it must be embarrassing to hear about marriage matters, but she calmly poured the tea into a teacup.It seemed that the Eastern Great Lord must have talked about this match before\u2013to some extent.\u201cI still haven\u2019t thought about getting married yet\u2026\u201dBefore regression, Luisen was too absorbed with himself; even after joining this timeline, he was busy solving the issues that popped up before him.\u201cThink about it seriously. You are close in age and in family status\u2013there won\u2019t be a better marriage match than this. Your household needs more bodies, and you are the only direct descendent. You must hurry.\u201d\u201cThere are too many things I must take care of, first.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean you must have a wedding immediately. Considering the current situation, we must prepare for a national funeral before winter passes.\u201dLuisen nodded\u2013he also knew well that the King\u2019s condition was grave.The Eastern Great Lord continued, \u201cAfter the new king\u2019s coronation ceremony, you\u2019ll want to return to your duchy before spring arrives, correct? Let\u2019s talk and settle the matter before then.\u201dThough there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s words, Luisen felt he couldn\u2019t keep up with the flow of the conversation.Luisen was someone who lived in the moment. The future was blank to him since, out of habit, he never thought deeply about it. Right now, he merely drafted a rough timeline of defeating the demon worshippers, going back to his home city, and living well.In other words, his mind came up empty.\u201cOf course. Just think about it.\u201dLuisen shut his mouth without responding. Marriage, huh? If he wanted to give up his playboy, trashy ways, he must think about marriage, but he couldn\u2019t stop procrastinating. His lips wouldn\u2019t utter, \u2018I\u2019ll think about it,\u2019 as Carlton\u2019s face suddenly came to mind.\u2018Mm, why am I suddenly thinking about Carlton?\u2019In any case, perhaps the culprit behind Carlton\u2019s uncharacteristically heartbroken appearance wasn\u2019t related to the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s scolding. If so, then Luisen realized that he or something he said yesterday must be the culprit.The Eastern Great Lord nagged for a long while\u2013Luisen was submerged in nagging hell where each complaint would summon even more nagging for the older man. Even the attending maidservants gave Luisen pitying looks. However, Luisen did not notice; he was lost in thought.What exactly had hurt his feelings?Carlton had a delicate side, contrary to his appearance. He noticed small interactions that others would pass over easily; he was also good at looking at others\u2019 faces and matching their speed. As someone who lived his entire life balancing on a tightrope, he had to be twice as sensitive as others.However, Luisen was the opposite. The young lord had changed a lot as he experienced the bitterness of life, but he was still ignorant in interpersonal matters. His habit of not concerning himself with others\u2019 emotions had not yet been rectified.No matter how much the young lord wracked his brain and tried to read the incomprehensible lines in Carlton\u2019s body language, it was still difficult to fully understand the mercenary, who had been born into bitterness.\u2018Who knows!!\u2019 he wailed internally.\"\"However, Luisen had learned from the saint what he should do at this time. If he has no answer, he could ask someone else he knew well instead of hastily guessing.\u2018Fine. After eating breakfast, let\u2019s look for Carlton.\u2019Since the matter involved Carlton\u2019s heart, Carlton should know best, shouldn\u2019t he? The young lord had made up his mind, but the day didn\u2019t go as Luisen had planned. Towards the end of breakfast, a servant entered the tent. They informed the nobles present that a noble of a nearby territory had asked to see the Eastern Great Lord. The noble in question was merely a poor viscount, but the meeting was allowed since the noble was the cousin of an aristocrat that was in the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s good graces.So, Luisen also had to accompany the Eastern Great Lord to this unexpected meeting.The noble was an extravagant man who had adorned himself with jewels all over his body. \u201cGood morning, my Dukes. I am called Roks Boton. I have recently been titled the Viscount and now rule over the Boton territory.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re the new Viscount Boton? I heard that there was a great catastrophe in your estate not too long ago.\u201d The Eastern Great Lord said.\u201cYes, thankfully, with your grace, I was able to endure safely.\u201dAs someone that loathed creating enemies in the East, the Great Lord acted quite generously, and the Viscount Boton muttered flatteries with his tongue smoothly, as if it had been coated in oil.From the side, Luisen stared at the viscount quietly. Even though this was the first time they had met, the man somehow felt familiar.\u2018Viscount Boton\u2026 Boton\u2026 Where have I heard that name\u2026 Ah!\u2019The three knights Carlton had knocked over! He had definitely heard that the three knights that were killed and used as ghouls by the demon worshippers were the knights of the Boton estate.\u2018Rumors stated he left his territory and ran away\u2026But he\u2019s alright?\u2019He had a dull complexion and wore incredibly thick makeup to cover it. Still, the man\u2019s limbs were intact and his skin was plump and bouncy. If Carlton had seen the Viscount Boton, he would have sneered and said the razing of his estate couldn\u2019t have happened to a better person.\u201cTo be frank, I had come to see you despite my shabby appearance because I had an earnest question to ask. I\u2019m sorry to bother your busy selves like this, but, since you were passing by my territory, I couldn\u2019t let this opportunity pass by.\u201d\u2018So, now the Viscount\u2019s main point is about to appear? He\u2019s going to leave behind his territory and vassals and entrust himself into the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s circle, isn\u2019t he?\u2019Luisen made sarcastic remarks inwardly, but, unexpectedly, Viscount Boton\u2019s words contradicted his cynical thoughts. \u201cMy mansion is less than half a day from here. As you\u2019ve been on a rough journey for the sake of our country, I\u2019d like to offer my abode for one night.\u201d\u2018Huh? You want to invite us to your mansion? Didn\u2019t you run away from your estate?\u2019 Luisen, who originally had no intention of speaking up, had no choice but to ask, \u201cI\u2019ve heard something about your situation\u2026 Can you, at this time, really entertain guests?\u201d\u201cI was away from my territory for a short while, but everything is alright now. Of course, what I have may not be enough to satisfy your esteemed selves, but I will do my best to host.\u201d Far from being agitated, Viscount Boton became even more confident.The Eastern Great Lord must have been pleased with that self-composed answer, he chuckled, \u201cYour heart and sincerity is quite praise-worthy. Very well, I\u2019ll stay at your mansion for one night.\u201d He readily agreed to the Viscount\u2019s request.Luisen whispered quietly so that only the Eastern Great Lord could hear, \u201cIs that alright? We must go to the royal palace as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cIt shall be fine. This old man\u2019s body cannot keep up with such a fast pace\u2013how could anyone fault me for that? If we hurry, we\u2019ll be dealing with my funeral first rather than his Majesty\u2019s.\u201dLuisen groaned\u2013he knew this would happen. Though their journey had been somewhat luxurious so far, the Eastern Great Lord was very dissatisfied that they had to set up camp and sleep in tents in the middle of a field. Though, to be fair, traveling is quite hard on the elderly.In any case, even if the mansion may be simple, the Eastern Great Lord found no reason to reject sleeping in the noble\u2019s home. Moreover, he found the Viscount Boton, who came to find them in order to treat them, admirable.From the Viscount\u2019s position, it may be natural to actively create an opportunity to foster some sort of relationship with the two dukes simultaneously.Though this was an advantageous situation in various ways, Luisen still felt uncomfortable. Was that because he kept thinking about the knights on the bridge? Was his discomfort due to the way that they had died while being used by the demon worshippers?However, since the demon worshippers\u2019 existence was being kept secret, Luisen had no choice but to shut his mouth. It was impossible to sway the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s heart just by saying that the young lord felt uncomfortable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Eastern Great Lord\u2019s party had switched direction towards the Viscounts Boton\u2019s Mansion. The people seemed to be delighted thinking about sleeping in a proper bed for the first time in a long while; similarly, they looked forward to the dinner Viscount Boton promised.In the midst of this excited atmosphere, Luisen continued to follow along while feeling a strange sense of uneasiness. He had told the Eastern Great Lord that they should be cautious, but the older man simply criticized the young lord for being picky for no good reason.Naturally, the older lord had felt no crisis since he was ignorant of the demon worshiper\u2019s existence; he had no idea that Luisen was a target. Besides, his knights all had outstanding talent, and the nobles in his group had also brought along a considerable number of soldiers.Regardless of Luisen\u2019s concerns, the entire procession arrived at the city where the mansion was supposedly located. After passing through agricultural land, the village boasted blacksmiths and grain warehouses. And, in front of a small church, was Viscount Boton\u2019s mansion, the headquarters for the territory\u2019s governance.It was just a normal manor, neither small nor large. Viscount Boton\u2019s mansion was, as expected, typical of a provincial aristocrat\u2019s home. However, the flowers that decorated the building\u2013especially placed for the sake of the two Great Lords, were eye-catching.Everything seemed normal. \u2018Was I being paranoid?\u2019 Luisen lowered his vigilance.The Viscount declared that he\u2019d hold a banquet in the evening, and, until then, everyone was given time to rest freely. Luisen left his designated room and wandered around, looking for Carlton.\u2018Carlton~ where are you\u2026?\u2019 The young lord eagerly shuffled here and there, but the mercenary could not be found. There were only useless and burdensome nobles that tried to cling onto him. At that moment, Luisen coincidentally happened upon Morrison.Morrison was with the servants. Though only three days have passed since they joined the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s entourage, the inquisitor naturally incorporated himself into the servant\u2019s group as if he were a native of the area. They exchanged jokes with each other like close friends.\u2018Even if he looks so jovial and casual like that, he\u2019s probably digging for information on anything suspicious.\u2019Luisen felt goosebumps travel up his spine; it was difficult to reconcile his current appearance with the cruel inquisitor who calmly stated he had demolished a demon worshiper\u2019s ankle.\u201cMorrison.\u201d\u201cAh, my Duke!\u201d\u201cI wanted to ask you something.\u201dAs soon as Luisen approached, the other servants quickly bowed and scuttled off to someplace else.\u201cDo you know where Carlton is?\u201d\u201cCarlton is\u2026.\u201d Morrison looked over Luisen\u2019s shoulder. His eyes met with another pair of gleaming pupils behind the lush trees\u2013those eyes had the fierce glare of a predator staring at prey. That was Carlton.Actually, Carlton had been following the young lord all day. Since he had been at a distance and dampened his aura, no one had noticed him. The Eastern Great Lord\u2019s knights were all powerful, but none were as outstanding as the mercenary.Last night, after parting with Luisen, Carlton couldn\u2019t pull himself together for quite a while. It was his first time liking someone so deeply, but he couldn\u2019t confess properly and was dumped instead.The pain of a broken heart was worse than he had imagined. He would rather fight trolls for three days and two nights consecutively. Carlton, who was used to enduring pain, found it difficult to withstand the tearing ache inside his chest. This was the first time he understood why people might want to drink cheap but potent alcohol.\u2018Didn\u2019t he like me?\u2019They had never defined their relationship; they didn\u2019t even say they liked each other. However, Carlton thought there was something special between Luisen and himself\u2013like they were lovers.\u2018How could he talk about breaking up so casually?\u2019Carlton couldn\u2019t understand and buried his head in his palms. \u2018Then, why did he accept all those kisses? Was he playing with me?\u2019\u00a0 He jumped to his feet, angered.\u2018\u2026No. He\u2019s not such a horrible person. It\u2019s just\u2026his heart wasn\u2019t as smitten as mine, I suppose.\u2019Then, what about the time they spent together? Despairing, Carlton squatted down.\u2018Am I that unattractive?\u2019 As Carlton became more depressed, his body drooped. He repeated the same thoughts and actions like a madman. As a result, he stayed up all night.By the time the sun rose, the mercenary was utterly exhausted and his head was spinning coldly in circles.\u2018What a pathetic sight I must make\u2026\u2019Luisen\u2019s emotions were not as deep as his, so it would be foolish to stake his life on this love. He had to wake up now and take care of his own life. He promised himself that he would no longer be swayed by the young lord.However, after preparing his mind, he suddenly thought, \u2018I sent him home alone yesterday. Did he return to his tent well?\u2019Of course, he must have returned well; it wasn\u2019t a long distance, and there were others around. If something had happened to Luisen, there would have been pandemonium long ago.As he tried to be calm and objective, his brain crafted its own counterarguments.\u2018However, can I really trust that if I haven\u2019t seen his safe return directly?\u2019Thinking back to what Luisen had experienced so far\u2026. While running through the woods alone at night, he almost died by a goblin\u2019s hand; he fell behind during an excursion and was surrounded by a mob; he was almost kidnapped by Ruger\u2026kidnapped by Morrison.An incident occurred every time he took his eyes off the young lord. But, it wasn\u2019t like things were safe even if Luisen stayed still. After all, the young lord repeatedly broke Carlton\u2019s expectations, and now the mercenary didn\u2019t know what to expect.As his thoughts swirled to a climax, Carlton became incredibly anxious. \u2018I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s an incident happening at this very moment, right?\u2019 If he thought rationally, how could Luisen, who was in the midst of the Great Eastern Lord\u2019s party and receiving the best protection, be in danger? However, anxiety wasn\u2019t something that could be quenched through reason.Eventually, Carlton sneaked into Luisen\u2019s tent at dawn, escaping the public eye. The young lord, who was drunk, was sleeping quite deeply while exuding the scent of wine. The young lord\u2019s sleeping face was tranquil and lovely, and it felt as if the pain that had plagued him all night had melted away.Carlton stared at Luisen\u2019s face for a long while before quietly leaving the tent when he heard servants moving outside.\u2018Since I saw that he was fine, that\u2019s enough.\u2019It had to be enough.Obviously, that should have been enough, but, when the mercenary returned to his senses, he kept hovering around Luisen.\u2018He\u2019s sure to have a bad hangover\u2013what if he falls down?\u2019\u2018He\u2019s extra spaced out today\u2013what if he wanders away from the group like that?\u2019\u2018It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s arriving at Viscount Boton\u2019s mansion. How could I leave him alone in a strange place?\u2019He kept making excuses.Luisen was not alone; he had servants and knights to take care of him. But, Carlton still couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the young lord, like a mother who had left her child at the riverbank, floating on water.Furthermore, how was the young lord even prettier today? Unlike usual, his cold eyes exuded a sense of superiority. The young lord\u2019s hidden audience\u2019s heartstrings were tugged even more.\u2018Once we reach the capital, it\u2019ll be hard to see this sight anyway\u2026\u2019Carlton continued to chase Luisen around, giving himself new excuses simultaneously. He was glad to see that the young lord was also wandering around looking for him. His heart overflowed with the thought that perhaps the young lord\u2019s actions meant that Luisen still needed him and cared about him.\u2018Didn\u2019t I decide to give up? Shouldn\u2019t I take this moment to try and find a way out of his embrace instead of chasing him around?\u2019His cool, objective rationality warned him, but his body replied, \u2018Hm, who knows? Who cares? I\u2019m going to continue to watch Luisen,\u2019 before moving almost automatically.What was he doing? Carlton felt a deep shame. It\u2019s one thing for a small dog, but it was disgusting for a grown man to follow another man around.And, Morrison caught him in the act. Carlton\u2019s shame reached its peak as soon as his eyes locked with Morrison\u2019s; the inquisitor hesitated, unsure whether or not he should tell Luisen of this matter.The mercenary quickly gestured with his hands: he pointed at Morrison with his index finger and pretended to slit his throat with his thumb.\u2018If you speak, I\u2019ll kill you.\u2019Morrison felt a stream of cold sweat run down his back at the terrifying warning. Though the vicious energy must have passed behind the young lord, Luisen didn\u2019t even notice. The young lord\u2019s obliviousness was a grand thing.Morrison did not see what had happened the previous nights, as he left the two alone. He was simply someone that loved others\u2019 romance vicariously; he wasn\u2019t a voyeur.However, looking at their behavior today, he could sense that something had happened.He thought, \u2018Something I said to Carlton pretty thoughtlessly in the past was a problem, huh\u2026\u2019Morrison sincerely liked seeing Carlton and Luisen together. \u2018There will be difficulties in your future, so I hope you overcome them well!\u2019 He sincerely meant that, with no malice at all. He had no idea that what he said so casually would turn into the source of a conflict. The inquisitor had overlooked that Carlton was more delicate than his appearance would suggest and that Luisen was a bit socially oblivious.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Since Morrison kept looking at the distant mountain range, Luisen also looked back. However, all he could see was a thick thicket of trees and nothing else.\u201cAh, nothing. How fortunate\u2013there was something I wanted to ask my Duke. I wondered how I should send my message to you, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come to me first.\u201d Morrison chose to quickly change the subject. Before Luisen could notice anything strange, Morrison rapidly took something out of his pocket.He held the identity cards of the gang of knights who had occupied the bridge as highway bandits, died, and then were manipulated by demon worshippers before being abandoned. The inquisitor had stored these keepsakes separately after disposing of the corpses-turned-ghouls.\u201cWould you give these to the Viscount? As the knights served under him, the lord may know if the men left behind any bereaved family. I believe it would be more appropriate for the Duke to do this than me.\u201d\u201cAh, of course.\u201d Though Luisen\u2019s party wasn\u2019t the one to kill Viscount Boton\u2019s knights, it would still be difficult for Morrison, a commoner, to demand an audience with the viscount himself. He could also be falsely accused of murdering them.If Luisen were to deliver the keepsake, Viscount Boton would not be able to pick faults recklessly.\u201cAnd, I\u2019d like you to carefully observe Viscount Boton\u2019s reaction as you deliver this,\u201d Morrison continued.\u201cHis reaction?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s quite strange that a knight of a decent, normal territory would commit robbery. I\u2019m still a bit stuck on the fact that the demon worshippers chose to use those knights.\u201d\u201cI see. The banquet will begin shortly, so I\u2019ll hand this to him there and observe his reactions for you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m counting on you, my lord.\u201dLuisen packed up the knight\u2019s keepsakes; it was time for him to return to his room and prepare for the evening banquet. \u201cI\u2019ll be on my way now. If you see Carlton, please tell him to come see me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dThe young lord did not forget to ask what had been on his mind. Once Luisen disappeared, so too did Carlton.\u2018Right then\u2026Just behind you\u2026 Carlton was there\u2026\u2019 The truth that Morrison couldn\u2019t spout merely tumbled around in his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Feeling a bit regretful, Luisen wandered around more but still couldn\u2019t find Carlton. The young lord then trudged down the corridor, despondent.\u2018Honestly, how was it so difficult to find him? I deliberately searched for Carlton in places he was likely to be\u2013places where there were no people\u2013but I still couldn\u2019t find him.\u2019\u2018Is he avoiding me?\u2019Luisen suddenly paused in the middle of walking.Despite the fact that there were many people within this traveling group, it was strange that he still couldn\u2019t find the mercenary. And, considering that Carlton never came to find him, the suspicion that the mercenary was avoiding him became more certain.\u2018Hmm\u2026 What to do\u2026\u2019Carlton seemed angrier at him than Luisen thought. The young lord sighed deeply. \u2018Where did it all go wrong?\u2019 he thought. With all his might, Luisen tried to think, but his concentration was interrupted by a thudding noise.\u2018What? Is there a mouse scurrying around somewhere?\u2019Luisen looked around, annoyed. There was no one else in the hallway. Only a red carpet and a tapestry embroidered with Boton\u2019s symbol stuck to the wall. Maybe the incoming dusk added to the atmosphere, the empty hallway looked especially creepy.He suddenly recalled how he had been attacked by Ruger\u2019s gang in the abandoned village a few days ago.\u2018Why am I suddenly thinking about that? And, has it gotten a bit cold?\u2019 Luisen futilely rubbed his arms.\u201cMy Duke!\u201d At the far end of the corridor, some maids rushed to him.They had been anxiously searching for the young lord, worried that he had snuck out to search for Carlton. Surrounding the young lord, they said tearfully, \u201cWhere did you go without telling us?\u201d\u201cIf my Duke goes around alone like this, we shall be scolded by our Lord. Please, feel free to command us if you need anything.\u201dAs the maids appealed to him with tears in their eyes, Luisen felt quite sorry.\u201cYou\u2019ve found the Duke then?\u201d The Eastern Great Lord\u2019s knights, who were tasked with escorting Luisen, and Viscount Boton appeared, one after another. The maids must have asked for help from various locations to find the young lord. Luisen simply walked around the mansion by himself\u2013what\u2019s with all this mess?However, things had worked out; Luisen had business with Viscount Boton. \u201cGive me a brief moment of your attention. I have something to say to you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Luisen\u2019s words must have surprised the Viscount Boton\u2013his eyes opened wide. \u201cWhat is the matter\u2026? Was there something strange in the mansion?\u201d\u201cHm? Ah, no. I just wanted to hand this over to you.\u201d Luisen handed the Viscount a small pouch\u2013exactly what Morrison had given him earlier.The Viscount took the pouch with an anxious expression and loosened the strings. The identity plaques of the three dead knights were inside.\u201cWhat\u2026Is this?\u201d Viscount Boton asked, puzzled.\u201cIt\u2019s your knights\u2019 identity cards. Don\u2019t you recognize them?\u201dA knight\u2019s identity card looked different from that of an ordinary citizen. The Arms of the Boton family were stamped atop the surface, and spears, symbolizing one\u2019s knighthood, were drawn in bronze. There was no way the other wouldn\u2019t recognize this.When Luisen narrowed his eyes suspiciously at him, the Viscount hurried to explain, \u201cO-Of course. I recognize them. I gave this to them personally, after all. Rather, I meant \u2018Why does the Duke have this?\u2019 Do you have any connection with my knights?\u201d\u201cA few days ago, I met your knights by chance. They had taken over the sole bridge along a path and were demanding a toll from passersby.\u201dAt Luisen\u2019s words, the faces of the knights around him contorted. To think that they would commit robbery after becoming a knight. They were naturally offended by the errant knights\u2019 actions as it undermined the honor of knighthood.Luisen continued, \u201cAt that time, we crossed the bridge safely, but we somehow found them dead in an abandoned village. It was hard to just pass them by, so we cremated them and kept their keepsakes.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Viscount Boton calmly pocketed the pouch. His reaction was completely different than what Luisen had expected. The knights who bore the name of his family committed disgraceful acts; these actions were bound to return disgrace upon the Boton family and the Viscount himself. If someone were to take this maliciously, they could state that the Viscount himself committed robbery against the citizens.Even if Viscount Boton was not related to this matter, it was clear that he would be harshly ridiculed for being ignorant of his knights\u2019 behaviors and for his inability to control a few knights.The young lord had expected him to be restless, worried that the story would spread; Luisen had expected him to walk on eggshells around the young lord. Of course Viscount Boton was sneaking glances at him quite a lot, but there was something different in that gaze.\u201cIs that all you have to say?\u201d the viscount asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dViscount Boton sighed\u2013a sigh of relief?That sound got on Luisen\u2019s nerves. \u201cYour knights are dead, and yet you are indifferent?\u201d\u201cAh, yes, well. Those men weren\u2019t originally all that loyal. They caused many accidents, and, the last time I saw them, they said they wouldn\u2019t follow my rule and basically threw me away. It\u2019s quite unpleasant to hear they committed robbery under my family\u2019s name, but I can\u2019t punish those men since they\u2019re already dead. I merely was relieved that they weren\u2019t the cause of a larger disaster.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Luisen was still suspicious, but the others seemed to be convinced by that explanation.\u201cWe must slowly go and get you ready to attend the banquet, my Duke,\u201d the maids said.Luisen nodded at their words. \u201cIf the bereaved families of the knights want to find their remains, tell them to come find me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe such a thing will happen. You can let go of any concerns.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll be seeing you later.\u201d Viscount Barton bowed politely and retreated, promising to meet later at the banquet hall. Luisen followed the maids and, after a while, suddenly looked back. Viscount Boton was walking into the distance in this somewhat empty, somewhat lonely corridor. The viscount\u2019s back appeared especially creepy, and the young lord felt chilly, as if a cold wind passed through him.***In the evening, the nobles in the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s entourage gathered in the banquet hall\u2013a feast to welcome and celebrate the visit of two Great Lords from the East and South. The nobles didn\u2019t expect much from Viscount Boton\u2019s banquet; after all, the party was prepared on short notice nor was there much staff to maintain his mansion.However, contrary to expectations, the banquet was actually impressive. The hall was decorated so beautifully\u2013one could even say that the Viscount must have poured his soul into the designs. A sweet and savory scent wafted through the halls. The food was excellent, and the party contained luxurious alcohol that could rarely be seen in these rural territories.As their expectations were low, the eastern aristocrats were even more satisfied; similarly, the eastern great lord was also pleased that he could boast the power and forward thinking of a fellow noble in his territory in front of Luisen. Everyone greatly enjoyed the celebrations, and an exciting, delightful atmosphere was quickly created.Meanwhile, the sky completely darkened outside. Carlton sat on a branch, staring silently into the banquet hall through a window. The way the aristocrats were dressed up so prettily and moved back and forth in disciplined, graceful movements made the mercenary feel as if he were watching a theatre play made with dolls.Other men and women were dressed up to the nines, but only Luisen caught Carlton\u2019s eye. Although the young lord did not adorn himself with any jewelry and his clothes were borrowed, Luisen shined more than those who draped themselves in finery and shining gems. This wasn\u2019t merely Carlton\u2019s blind love speaking\u00a01, the other nobles took sneaky glances at Luisen.Luisen stood with a bored look on his face; the other\u2019s glances slid off his countenance. Such indifference made Luisen look nobler, but Carlton knew\u2026\u2018That expression means he has nothing in his brain.\u2019\u2018Why was he being so absent-minded?\u2019 Carlton coughed before suddenly frowning. Another noble\u2013perhaps the same age as Luisen\u2013flirted with the young lord while offering him food. Luisen did not refuse the offer and instead stood there, listening to the person.\u2018I told him not to eat food that\u2019s been given by an unknown person! Luisen even smiled during their conversation.\u2019 Flames surged forth in Carlton\u2019s eyes.\u2018I can\u2019t even step into the banquet hall, and you\u2019re flirting with someone else because I\u2019m not there?\u2019 He felt as if he were burning up from jealousy. The aristocrat\u2019s hand touched Luisen\u2019s shoulder. Carlton stared viciously, as if he were watching an unfaithful spouse.The mercenary was about to break into the banquet hall, swearing, but when he saw Luisen push the other away, Carlton frantically reined himself in. The patience he had cultivated during this trip had helped in times like these.\u201cI\u2019m going crazy.\u201d Carlton threw away branches that he had unwittingly broken and sighed. Luisen hadn\u2019t done anything wrong, but the mercenary felt quite pathetic just observing the young lord having fun alone. How pitiful\u2013to grow angry and be swayed by another like this.Luisen did not take his future with Carlton seriously\u2013that meant his feelings weren\u2019t so deep. Therefore, Carlton chose reality over love; certainty over uncertainty. He had decided to keep his distance from the young lord and settle his mind before the eventual breakup. His intentions remained unchanged\u2013this was the most reasonable judgment he could make.Then, why was he acting differently from his plan? There\u2019s nothing stupider than a man who can\u2019t give up after being dumped, and he\u2019s acting just like that kind of fool.Buried in his own shame, Carlton was about to stop being a peeping tom, when suddenly Luisen sneaked out onto the terrace. The area wasn\u2019t far from the tree that held Carlton. The garden was dark, so Luisen couldn\u2019t find Carlton\u2026but they were close enough to have a conversation.However, Luisen never behaved according to Carlton\u2019s expectations.Luisen looked grim as he crossed over the terrace\u2019s railing. Each window of the hall had its own separate terrace. Luisen crossed the railing to climb over to the next terrace.However, problematically, the young lord was seriously not athletic. He had no idea how he should place his feet, but eventually, he grabbed the railing and began to tremble. The banquet hall was on the second floor; the distance to the next terrace would be wide enough for an adult male to cross with one stride, but that was too much for Luisen.\u2018Honestly, if you wanted to go there, you should go back through the banquet hall.\u2019 Bewildered at the young lord\u2019s actions, Carlton was dumbfounded that he forgot his resolution and approached Luisen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 98Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCarlton jumped from the tree to the terrace. Luisen looked up in surprise\u2013a person just popped up in front of him. He frowned like a wary cat before smiling happily when he realized that the person before him was Carlton.Carlton thought, \u2018whoops.\u2019 He was avoiding running into the young lord, but he was so dumbfounded at Luisen\u2019s behavior that he couldn\u2019t help but approach the young lord immediately.\u2018You never noticed that I was chasing you, right?\u2019 Carlton thought. But, instead of that sharp question, he bluntly asked, \u201cWhat in the world are you doing?\u201d\u201cAsk questions later\u2013can\u2019t you help me? I\u2019m starting to get tired, hm?\u201d Luisen tearfully begged. His arms shook like a newborn deer.\u2018This is why I can\u2019t help but be anxious; I can\u2019t tear my eyes away from him.\u2019 What would have happened if the mercenary had left earlier? Carlton sighed inwardly, but stood in front of Luisen.\u201cGive me your arm.\u201d Carlton grabbed Luisen\u2019s arm and placed it around the mercenary\u2019s neck; Carlton then lifted the young lord as the young lord climbed firmly over the railing. Then, as simply as if he were crossing a small puddle, Carlton leaped with the young lord to the next terrace.After landing stably, Carlton placed Luisen down on the solid ground\u2013the terrace. However, Luisen did not loosen his hold; instead, he went up on tiptoe and hugged the mercenary with all his might.\u201cYou can let go now,\u201d Carlton said.Luisen shook his head; his malleable cheeks and soft hair brushed against Carlton\u2019s neck. Carlton\u2019s heart was weakened by that sudden childish show of affection; this was a man he had dearly missed that was now right before his eyes. Luisen, who was warmed from the warmth of the banquet hall, could even heat Carlton\u2019s cold body, which had grown icy from being outside during the entire banquet.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Hm? Did something inside upset you?\u201d Carlton asked in a much softer voice. Luisen felt tears surge forth when someone he had been concerned about since last kindly soothed him.\u2018The man doesn\u2019t show up when I\u2019m searching for him, but he shows up the minute I give up and attempt to focus on something else? Furthermore, isn\u2019t it cheating to suddenly appear like a hero in my moment of crisis?\u2019 Luisen embraced Carlton even tighter.\u00a0 He had a separate reason for exiting to the terrace, but now he didn\u2019t want to be separated from Carlton, whom he had a hard time meeting. Though his heart felt utterly happy\u2013elated\u2013he also felt equally melancholy for some reason.\u201cIf I release you, won\u2019t you escape to someplace else?\u201d\u201cNo\u2013why would I do something like that?\u201d\u201cYou were avoiding me.\u201d\u201cImpossible.\u201d\u201cThen, where have you been all day? Do you know how long I\u2019ve been searching for you?\u201dCarlton knew\u2013he had been watching. And, even though he knew, Carlton asked, \u201cYou searched for me? Why?\u201dAlthough he himself thought his question was a bit decietful and hypocritical, he wanted Luisen to confirm his thoughts out loud.\u201cYou left so suddenly yesterday. \u2018What happened?\u2019 and \u2018What did the Eastern Great Lord say to you,\u2019 these sorts of thoughts swirled around. Do you know how worried I was?\u201d Luisen said.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Nothing my duke should be concerned about.\u201d\u201cWhy would you say something so upsetting?\u201d\u2018Now, after all that happened, he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t want to look after me?\u2019 Luisen leaned his torso back and angrily looked at Carlton. Though the young lord thought of grabbing the mercenary by the collar, he paused since the mercenary\u2019s face looked unexpectedly melancholy.\u201cMy Duke doesn\u2019t need someone like me anymore, correct? You have knights and servants.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s true.\u201d Luisen carefully cupped Carlton\u2019s cheeks with his hands. Carlton placed his hand on Luisen\u2019s wrist but did not push the young lord\u2019s hand away. The way the usually fierce and powerful man lacked strength tugged at Luisen\u2019s heart.\u201cWhy would you compare yourself to others? You\u2019re special to me\u2013I\u2019ve said this before,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cIs that so.\u201dCarlton\u2019s ambiguous answer ran close to denial. Luisen had clearly only said good things to him, but why did Carlton have a hurt expression that mirrored last night? Luisen stared at Carlton with a stifled and heavy heart.Then, Carlton slowly began to speak his innermost thoughts, \u201c\u2026It\u2019s just as you said last night. My duke will return to the duchy, and I\u2019ll stay in the capital. You so certainly confirmed our farewell\u2013how could I be a special person to you?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026.What?\u201d It was only then that Luisen finally came to a realization\u2013the misunderstanding that lay between them since last night. Luisen had thought Carlton was worried about how to establish himself after they had returned to the capital, and the young lord, in turn, was determined to keep the tragedy from the previous timeline from repeating itself.However, Carlton had, instead, been worried about their future together. Last night, Carlton\u2019s question wasn\u2019t regarding his ambitions. In retrospect, Luisen\u2019s answer was the absolute worst.It was as if one person in a couple asked, \u2018We\u2019re going to keep seeing each other, right?\u2019 and the other responded, \u2018No? Of course we\u2019re going to say our farewells!\u2019 And then, that same person asked their partner to drink alcohol and tried to seduce them. Of course that kind of person would be seen as utter trash!\u2018I\u2019m that trash!\u2019 Luisen hurriedly denied, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant! My answer simply conveyed my desire for your successful future\u2013that\u2019s what I thought you were talking about. I had no idea you were inquiring about something different. You know it too\u2013you know I\u2019m not as perceptive or thoughtful as you are. If you speak in circles like that, I can\u2019t understand\u2026\u201dAt the end, the young lord\u2019s voice shrank in volume and sounded almost tearful. That sight was just so pitiful that, for a moment, Carlton wondered if he had done something wrong. For example, his question may have been too complicated for a simpleton like Luisen. Perhaps he should have paid attention to how distinctly different their personalities were.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll ask you clearly, this time.\u201d Carlton mustered up his courage. No matter how perceptive the mercenary may be, only Luisen knew the matters of his own heart. \u201cThen, does my Duke believe a future for us is\u00a0possible?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d Luisen couldn\u2019t answer easily.\u2018I\u2019ll only travel to the royal palace once or twice a year. Additionally, there\u2019s no guarantee that Carlton will be in the capital at those times\u2026\u2019At best, they could meet once a year; at worst, they\u2019ll go several years without seeing each other. However, what if Carlton followed him? As someone who initiated conquest against the duchy, he could not be accepted as a knight of the estate. Furthermore, Luisen could not give him a noble peerage or land\u2013that fell under the king\u2019s authority. If the mercenary followed Luisen, his destiny would be to become a mistress.On the other hand, if Carlton remains faithful as the first prince\u2019s hands and feet, he\u2019ll continue to be given opportunities to earn victories and remain in the royal family\u2019s service. Alongside a noble peerage and land, he may very well rise to the position of the kingdom\u2019s general.Of course, there would be no problem if Carlton was granted a title and an estate close to the Anies duchy.\u2018But, it\u2019d be difficult for him at this rate\u2026\u2019The southern region of the Kingdom was very stable due to Luisen\u2019s active efforts after the regression; there were no abandoned territories that had lost their ruling lords. Moreover, the Southern region of the country had arable land that grew crops well. Many eyes coveted this land, and there was no reason nor guarantee that, if a vacancy appeared, such prime real estate would be granted to the mercenary.In the end, the best way forward for each person, independently, lay distant from each other.\u201cStill, I don\u2019t want to part from you,\u201d Luisen whined as he leaned his head against Carlton\u2019s chest.Carlton, in contrast, smiled brightly. \u2018He didn\u2019t want to leave me. He wasn\u2019t thinking of me lightly or casually.\u2019Carlton forgot about all the practical problems that lay between them; he was elated by the fact that Luisen wanted to be with him. The mercenary kissed the young lord on the cheek out of sheer joy.Luisen looked at Carlton, wondering if the mercenary had been driven insane. \u201cI\u2019m being serious right now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m happy about.\u201dLuisen looked at Carlton, wondering what he was talking about, and blinked his eyes. He sighed, \u201c\u2026Occasionally, I have a hard time understanding you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dConversation and communication. How important those things were\u2026 The Saint always emphasized that fact. Time and time again, Luisen admired the one-armed saint\u2019s wisdom.\u201cIn any case\u2026 I\u2019ll take some time to think about this matter. When I reach the capital, I\u2019ll stay there for a while; there are still demon-worshippers to consider as well. It\u2019s not yet time to agonize over farewells.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t ask you to pretend as if we don\u2019t know each other when we reach the capital. Besides, you\u2019re sure to have subordinates there; you won\u2019t have to walk on eggshells and fight for your life as you did in this group.\u201dLuisen kissed Carlton sweetly on the lips, trying to soothe the man. Over and over again, clearing away the misunderstandings with each lip smack.After embracing the young lord for a while, Carlton asked, \u201cBy the way, why did you want to cross the railings and climb over to this terrace?\u201d\u201cAh! That\u2019s right!\u201dBecause of Carlton\u2019s sudden appearance, Luisen had briefly forgotten why he was here; Luisen had a separate motive than to search for the mercenary. \u201cI was trying to sneak out of the banquet hall without alerting anyone else. No matter what, I believe Viscount Boton is suspicious, and I wanted to investigate.\u201dLuisen was always in the spotlight; if he tried to leave the banquet hall to complete his own business, the young lord was bound to stand out. Therefore, Luisen excused himself to the terrace by saying he\u2019d like a minute to rest alone. His plan involved climbing to the next terrace without anyone\u2019s notice, hiding behind a pillar, and exiting through a nearby passage used by servants.Regrettably, the young lord did not include his physical limitations in his calculations, but that meant that this matter was even more urgent to if it could frazzle the young lord into making hasty plans. Even if he had to push himself, it was necessary to investigate Viscount Boton.\u201cHe certainly is quite suspicious.\u201d Carlton, from afar, had also watched Luisen deliver the knights\u2019 keepsakes to the Viscount. At that time, Carlton also thought that the Viscount\u2019s reaction was unusual.\u201cRight? That\u2019s not all.\u201d Luisen had kept one eye on Viscount Boton throughout the banquet. Now that he had the luck to serve two Great Lords, the Viscount acted suitably aristocratic and courted the attention of these influential nobles and the others in his court. At first glance, nothing was off. However, another noble approached Luisen when they noticed the young Great Lord paying attention to the Viscount.\u201cAre you talking about the man who was flirting with you, my Duke?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. How did you know?\u201d\u201c\u2026Anyway, what about him?\u201d Feeling various emotions stab into him, Carlton quickly changed the topic. Luisen\u2019s social dullness was of great help in these situations. Without any lingering doubt, Luisen continued to speak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cI deliberately praised Viscount Boton, of course.\u201dWhen someone that was part of one\u2019s faction was attacked, a man tends to cover and defend their fellow faction member; but, it was an aristocrat\u2019s tyrannical tendency to bite that same ally without mercy when the ally is judged to be better off than he was in the eyes of high-ranking noble.Luisen understood that and exercised his wit, \u201cThen, as expected, he began to gossip. According to him, no one lives in this mansion except for Viscount Boton.\u201d\u201cNo one else?\u201d\u201cYeah. No servants, no soldiers\u2026even his family is absent. Look at the banquet hall\u2013all the servants are the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s people. Apparently, the cooks are the same.\u201dThe Eastern Great Lord, who wanted to show off his prestige, lent his people to work for Viscount Boton and helped prepare for the banquet.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 truly strange,\u201d Carlton said.No matter what catastrophe had happened\u2013even if he had run away and then returned\u2013it didn\u2019t make sense to have a single aristocrat in a noble\u2019s mansion. At the very least, he should have brought back some commoners to take care of him.\u201cAnyway, since the situation was suspicious, I decided to poke around,\u201d Luisen hesitated before grabbing Carlton\u2019s sleeve, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to let me go alone, are you?\u201d\u201cOf course, we\u2019ll go together.\u201dIf the mercenary let Luisen go alone, Luisen might be found dangling from the walls of the mansion this time. Carlton nodded emphatically.***Luisen and Carlton succeeded in escaping the banquet hall unseen. Viscount Boton\u2019s residence was deserted\u2013which was consistent with the other noble\u2019s gossip.The mansion, which had a long history, was surrounded by a bleak atmosphere due to the emptiness of its halls. Cold air, penetrating through the thick tapestries, chilled the skin. All in all, the area felt strange, although they couldn\u2019t pinpoint what exactly was strange about it.Their destination was the hallway where Luisen and Viscount Boton conversed earlier in the day. At that time, Viscount Boton had asked Luisen if he had found something strange about the mansion. Without context, that was such a random question. Wasn\u2019t that something someone would say because they already knew that the place was unnatural?When they arrived in the hallway and stood still and silent, they heard distant thuds. Normally, they would have gone unnoticed, assuming the sound was made by some critter like a mouse, but Carlton\u2019s keen senses couldn\u2019t be evaded.\u201cI hear something over there\u2013the sounds of repeated hits.\u201dCarlton pointed to the origin of the noises: Viscount Boton\u2019s office. Carlton first took out his knife and warily approached the office. Luisen followed at his heels.Viscount Boton\u2019s office was a mess; it looked as if creditors had come and gone. Books and papers lay scattered on the floor; pots and various ornamental items were strewn on top.Thud\u2013 Thud\u2013 Thud\u2013There was another door inside the office; the repetitive sound came from the other side. Carlton told Luisen to wait and approached the door.Luisen stood quietly as he was ordered and looked around the office, \u2018Is there anything else that\u2019s strange?\u2019The portraits on the wall caught the young lord\u2019s eye; the subjects of the paintings were the previous Viscount Botons, arranged from the most distant ancestors to the most recent. It was a common custom to decorate the office with the portraits of its past owners. The Anies duchy, as well, contained many portraits spanning the generations from his ancestors to Luisen himself.\u2018They all look similar.\u2019Perhaps because they were descended from a common ancestor, all of the previous Botons\u2019 faces looked similar. There, Luisen felt a sense of disharmony; he quickly scanned the portraits and looked towards the last one\u2013where the present-day Viscount should be.The young lord\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cWho is this person?\u201dThe current Viscount\u2019s portrait, hung at the end of the room, was a completely different person than the man Luisen had met. Portraits often differed from their model\u2019s faces, as many of the paintings were beautified, but it was never to this degree. Although the Viscount Boton\u2019s thick, caked makeup confused the young lord, if one looked closely, the features\u2013the color of the eyes and the shape of the chin for example\u2013was different. Everything was different.Did I discover something? Luisen was so bewildered, he called his companion over, \u201cCarlton\u2026 Come here and take a look at this.\u201dBam\u2013!At that moment, a large thud\u2013as if something heavy had crashed down\u2013came from the room inside the office.\u201cMy duke, you should see this. There\u2019s a ghoul here.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u2018Why was there a ghoul here?\u2019 Luisen ran hurriedly to the mercenary\u2019s side. Inside the door, from where the sounds could be heard, there was one ghoul lying on the ground. It had fallen backwards, struggling and moaning.\u201cJudging by his clothes, he appears to have been a nobleman,\u201d Luisen said.\u201cI think we should look at his face in closer detail.\u201d\u201cPlease be careful.\u201dCarlton placed a candle closer to the ghoul\u2019s face with a stiff expression. The decomposition had progressed to a large degree, which was somewhat disgusting, but the mercenary endured. Fortunately, the corpse wasn\u2019t decomposed to the point that he couldn\u2019t recognize the face.\u201cIt\u2019s the same as that portrait.\u201d Luisen commented. The ghoul\u2019s face matched the face in the current Viscount Boton\u2019s painting.\u201cThe portrait?\u201d\u201cOver there.\u201d Closing the door so that the ghoul couldn\u2019t escape outside, Luisen showed Carlton the portrait in the office. As someone with a keen eye, Carlton was quick to recognize that the ghoul was actually the subject of the portrait.\u201cIf that ghoul really is Viscount Boton, then\u2026 Who the hell is the viscount in the banquet hall?\u201d\u201cMore importantly, we must note that the fake Viscount invited us to this mansion\u2026\u201dWhy would a man pretending to be an aristocrat do such a bold thing? There must be some scheme.The birth of a ghoul was obviously associated with the demon worshippers. Given that the real Viscount Boton had become a ghoul, it was highly likely that a demon worshiper was involved in his death. The fake Viscount *must* be aware of this situation, so it was almost certain the fake was related to the demon worshippers.Luisen and Carlton forgot what they were going to say and stared at each other\u2019s faces. Goosebumps ran down their spines at the creepy nature of this situation.\u201cAwooooo!\u201dThrough the gap in their conversation, they heard a distant wolf cry. The cry was chilling and seemed to scratch their eardrums. Carlton\u2019s bloodthirst instinctively reared up sharply.The mercenary ran to the window; the surrounding grounds and the lord\u2019s personal manor were dark\u2013not a single light shone. If a person lived there, there should be even a small light, but he couldn\u2019t see anything. There was only vast darkness, as if he were looking into the sea at night.However, dark red smoke began to pour in, moving toward the mansion; it half-resembled a cloud and half-resembled thick fog. But, its oncoming speed was as fast as the trade winds; it quickly occupied the estate grounds before reaching the house.As the dim moonlight shone through the dark red fog, they could see people in its midst. For some reason, they were wriggling. At first glance, one could tell that the people\u2019s movements\u2013excruciatingly slow and grotesquely jerky\u2013were not normal.\u201cThey\u2019re all\u2026 ghouls, right?\u201d Luisen asked.\u201cThat seems\u2026to be the case.\u201dThe swarm of ghouls approached, narrowing their siege formation as they approached the mansion. Ghouls had no intellectual ability, so they couldn\u2019t move systematically. Therefore, they were under someone\u2019s control.Just like the viscount\u2019s knights the other day\u2026when they attacked Luisen\u2019s party.\u201cThe demon worshippers\u2026 It\u2019s those bastards.\u201d Carlton growled.This was an undeniable fact that could no longer be ignored. Viscount Boton, this mansion, this banquet\u2026Everything was a trap to try and capture Luisen.***The Eastern Great Lord\u2019s knights were all on night patrol. They weren\u2019t motivated to stand guard with soldiers who were of lesser status than them\u2013after all, the nobles simply enjoyed their food and drink in the hall. There was no feeling of crisis or urgency, as this was a country lord\u2019s home.Soldiers standing guard near the mansion weren\u2019t so different from the knights. Some of them had even fallen asleep, leaning against a window. The knights bashed the heads of such soldiers to wake them up before continuing on their half-hearted patrol.\u2018Please make time fly faster\u2026\u2019 They all thought. Their only expectations were to receive the leftovers from the banquet. They strolled around, absentmindedly, when they heard a strange sound.Grrrrr\u2013 Grrrrrr\u2013\u201cWhat is that?\u201dThis mansion was already quite eerie in a way that was hard to pinpoint, but when they heard a strange sound, their nerves were on edge. The knight became frustrated from anxiety.\u201cS-Sir Knight. Sir Knight. There\u2019s trouble.\u201d A soldier rushed towards the knight.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this fuss about?\u201d\u201cCorpses\u2026There are corpses approaching us.\u201d\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201dAt that time\u2013with eerie timing\u2013a soldier\u2019s scream could be heard from a nearby distance. The knight returned to his senses. Though he was suffering currently from a lethargy, he had become a knight through a rigorous process, after all.The knight ran towards the origin of the scream\u2026 And he stood there, stunned. At first glance, he saw people dressed in peasant clothes, so he had thought the local residents flocked to the mansion. But, as he approached closer and closer, he noticed something strange. Their eyes were cloudy like fish that had been caught long ago; their bodies were rotten and smelled of decomposition. As the soldier said, these were walking corpses.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026?\u201dAs they stood dazed, the ghouls rushed towards the knight and soldier. Their movements were quick, even though they were dead bodies\u2013too quick even for an ordinary living commoner.\u201cAaargghh!\u201d The soldier was torn apart by the ghoul\u2019s teeth in an instant. The knight, surviving by a hair\u2019s breadth, turned back without hesitation and started running away.\u2018This isn\u2019t a matter I can sort out on my own. Hurry\u2026I\u2019ll have to hurry and tell the lord\u2026\u2019The knight ran like crazy. The banquet was in full swing, so, fortunately, all the nobles were gathered in one place. As he ran down an empty hallway, the knight kept looking out the window.Looking down from above, he could see the dark, red smoke rapidly approaching the mansion. Somehow, the smoke felt even eerier than the living corpses. He could see dead bodies scrambling throughout the entire area.The soldiers tried to respond, but they were helpless. Not only was this an ambush, but they were also scared by these living corpses and thus were unable to utilize their full ability and skills. At times like this, the strong power and authority of a leader were needed.Faster.The knight threw open the door to the banquet hall with all his might and yelled, \u201cMy Lord, It\u2019s a disaster!\u201dThe nobles who were enjoying their party looked back with eyes wide open. One aristocrat even scolded the man with a displeased expression, asking what all this fuss was about.However, the knight couldn\u2019t say anything\u2013the dark red fog, which had stayed near the mansion as he ran down the hallway, had finally passed through the windows and filled the banquet hall. Starting with those nearest to the windows, people fell, one after another.\u201cAgh! What\u2019s going on!\u201d\u201cHey, call a doctor!\u201dThe banquet hall quickly fell into pandemonium, but even that didn\u2019t last long. In the blink of an eye, dark red smoke filled the banquet hall, and everyone inside collapsed.Both the knight that came to deliver the news and the Eastern Great Lord, who needed to deliver instructions to everyone else, had fallen unconscious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Circumstances of a Fallen LordCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe tallest building in the Viscount\u2019s manorial estate was his mansion, followed by the estate church.At the time Luisen and Carleton made their gruesome discoveries in the viscount\u2019s office, on the roof of that church building, not too far from the mansion, Ruger and the ninth demon worshiper stood and looked over at their quarry: the mansion. The two waited for the ghouls to make their way inside the building, waiting for the right moment to enter the mansion without getting involved in useless and unnecessary fights.The ghouls, controlled by the ninth worshippers, attacked the Eastern Great Lord\u2019s soldiers. The soldiers couldn\u2019t respond properly to the ambush, and the ghouls broke into the mansion.The dark red fog shook violently, as if it were alive, as it moved towards the mansion. It was the color of blood\u2013rich enough to stand out beneath the dark, night sky.The Viscount Boton\u2019s mansion was a trap set by Ruger and his group from the very beginning. The Viscount in the mansion was actually the twelfth demon worshiper, who joined on behalf of the injured eleventh demon worshiper.Using the fake Viscount Boton, Ruger invited the Easter Great Lord\u2019s party to the mansion. Considering the Great Lord\u2019s temperament, he knew the lord would not be able to refuse. Then, Luisen, who was indebted to the older noble, would naturally, albeit reluctantly, follow.In other words, they took advantage of how Luisen joined the Eastern Great Lord for safety against the young lord.The Eastern Great Lord did more than they expected. According to the fake Viscount, the older noble incited a split in Luisen\u2019s party\u2013great news for Ruger.However, kidnapping a duke in front of so many people was quite reckless even for a demon worshiper. As with all heretics, the demon worshippers wanted to hide in the shadows.So, they had prepared large-scale magic: the dark red fog approaching the mansion.When inside that fog, people will become unconscious. In that state, the demon worshippers will be able to manipulate their memories. For example, they had planned, in the past, to fabricate the memory that the Duke of Anies hadn\u2019t surrendered\u2026or that the Duchy had not recognized that Carleton was the first prince\u2019s messenger and tied them up.However, this time, they had to apply their magic in a broader area, and this ability required a tremendous amount of offerings in order to instill an intense nightmare in so many people. So they killed and sacrificed any living being they could find\u2013the people that lived in this area, livestock, small birds, and even the insects in the grass.Perhaps that\u2019s why the magic fog was dark red, as if it were made from the blood squeezed from the denizens of this territory. The dead bodies of the inhabitants were then turned into ghouls. Now that the demon worshippers manipulated them, the ghouls turned into their own private army.\u201cHahaha! Look at my troops! Even that stern Eastern Great Lord can\u2019t raise a finger against me!\u201d the ninth worshiper excitedly cried. He jumped and stamped on the church\u2019s roof with his boots. Because he had deliberately muddied his shoes in order to insult the sanctity of the church, the pure white roof quickly became dirty.\u201cHey you, aren\u2019t you feeling it? \u2018He\u2019 is happy at this sight!\u201d The ninth worshiper placed his hand on Ruger\u2019s shoulder. Then, looking between the sky and the ground, he roared ecstatically.Ruger frowned as he shook off the hand. \u2018These people are crazy.\u2019Frankly, none of this\u2013whatever the demon worshippers did or the devil they worshiped\u2013mattered to Ruger. Furthermore, he held deep antipathy for the church as well.Ruger was an illegitimate child. His mother gave birth to him while she was still an unmarried maiden. The church rejected everything except for a marriage ordained by a priest, so Ruger, born from an extramarital relationship, became a fatherless child.The church called such children the devil\u2019s seed. Thanks to this, he lived his whole life experiencing ridicule and hatred. He always held strong hatred in his heart for the so-called \u2018God\u2019 and the church.When he was young, he thought that his situation could be overcome with effort. If he became the most honorable knight, he believed that the world would acknowledge him. Excellent skill, good manners, and a courtly code of conduct. He had no shortage in these aspects, but all his efforts were wasted due to his label as an illegitimate child.In the end, the only way to rid himself of this burdensome stigma was for his biological father to recognize him as his child.So Ruger, after finishing his knighthood training, found the man he knew to be his father and pledged allegiance to him\u2026with the hope that one day, the man will legitimize Ruger. Underneath that man, he committed all sorts of dirty work. Killing people wasn\u2019t even a hardship.Still, even to someone like Ruger, the demon worshippers\u2019 behavior was becoming increasingly difficult to witness. Not long ago, these people chatted and laughed normally, but now they had degenerated. The dead bit at the living; those who died in these attacks were resurrected again as ghouls. That endless chain\u2013the undermining of human dignity and death\u2026 Ruger couldn\u2019t help but feel instinctive disgust.What was even more gruesome was that the demon worshippers genuinely enjoyed this work. More than anything, they wanted to instill hell upon this land.\u2018Father, what must your liege be thinking for you to meddle with these lunatics?\u2019A small feeling of reluctance and resistance surged in Ruger\u2019s heart. Anyone would feel the same if they retained humanity, but now he had come too far to follow those emotions. Ruger had no other path.\u201cI think we can slowly enter,\u201d the ninth worshiper said.\u00a0 Though it still seemed a bit early in Ruger\u2019s perspective, the commander of the operation was the ninth worshiper. Silently, Ruger inspected his battle gear.The grounds around the mansion were a complete mess. If all went according to plan, though, the world would become a terrible place with which even this pandemonium couldn\u2019t compare.It didn\u2019t matter if the world was ruined. However, Ruger couldn\u2019t help but think of Luisen. Could the young lord endure a hellish world?For some reason, his heart was thrown into turmoil. Were his senses latching onto something ominous? Or was he simply feeling unease? Even he could not comprehend his own mind. One thing was certain, though: Ruger could not turn back. He could only advance towards that hell.In order to carry out the orders he had been given, Ruger pulled himself together. He thought only of advancing towards his long-awaited dream.Ruger and the demon worshippers mounted their dire wolves and headed for the mansion.***The dark red fog was on the verge of devouring the mansion.Luisen and Carlton ran out of Viscount Boton\u2019s office. Morrison, who happened to be looking for them, joined the two. The inquisitor had also felt that the place was strange and was looking around the house.The situation was graver than they had imagined. Outside the mansion, the helpless soldiers were being attacked by the ghouls\u2013a monster they had never fought before in their lives; even if the knights were experienced and the soldiers were many, it was only a matter of time before the protective barrier was breached. Despite the chaos outside, all the nobles were gathered in the banquet hall, enjoying their party.Now that they grasped the situation, the three hurriedly shared their opinions on their next actions. They quickly came to a conclusion\u2013they devised the best plan they could under these current circumstances.Morrison cast a blessing on Carlton and Luisen. Then, with Carlton\u2019s help, the young lord climbed the tree and crawled back onto the banquet hall\u2019s terrace.Luisen stood on the terrace alone, and Carlton remained in the tree. When Carlton couldn\u2019t bear to leave and hesitated, the young lord soothed his ruffled emotions, \u201cIf all goes as planned, it will all be fine.\u201d\u201cStill, I don\u2019t want to leave my Duke alone.\u201dHis voice was full of worry and distress.Luisen reached out and caressed his cheek, \u201cThen, return to me soon. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201dThe mercenary overlapped his hand over the young lord\u2019s and kissed him deeply. Morrison, underneath the tree, urged the two to be quick; they were running out of time and had no leisure to drag things out.After Carlton descended the tree, he and the inquisitor dispersed to their respective positions.Luisen gazed at the two\u2019s disappearing backs for a long while before looking away. The stench of death wafted up from the mansion grounds.The wind carried the sounds of screams, and a dark red fog came pushing towards him as if to devour him.\u201cIt\u2019ll all work out. It\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Luisen was scared, but he didn\u2019t avoid the approaching fog.Luisen turned around and entered the banquet hall. The bright lights within were somewhat blinding; the young lord felt like a moth rushing towards the fire.He was worried that he may have been caught leaving the banquet hall, but no one was the wiser. The banquet was in full swing, and no one seemed vigilant. Not a single noble knew what was going on.However, that ignorance was brief.The music stopped, and a scream burst out. Everything was completely buried by the fog.***Ruger and the ninth worshiper entered the mansion without anything or anyone to interrupt their break-in. The two were protected by monsters like direwolves and goblins.A man who manipulated corpses\u2026 A man followed by monsters\u2026Even the knights who took pride in dealing with hitherto unseen dangers did not dare to block their entry.When they entered the banquet hall, the hall was filled with red fog as they had planned. All the nobles had fallen down, unconscious.The only person left standing, the twelfth worshiper who posed as Viscount Boton, welcomed the two. \u201cThere\u2019s no problem here\u2013everything is progressing as planned.\u201dRuger looked through the banquet hall, ignoring the twelfth worshiper\u2019s words. No matter how crowded and obstructed his view was, it did not interfere with his search for Luisen.Ruger, who found his ex-lord in a flash, strode up to him. Luisen lay still, as if he had fallen asleep. His figure was tranquil; it reminded the ex-attendant of a sleeping princess straight out of a fairy tale.He sat on one knee in front of the young lord. He took off his gloves and swept Luisen\u2019s messy hair behind the young lord\u2019s ears. Then, with his index finger, he carefully stroked Luisen\u2019s cheek.Now that the young lord\u2019s hair was in order and the young lord was adorned in a suit, old memories suddenly rose to the surface of Ruger\u2019s mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
