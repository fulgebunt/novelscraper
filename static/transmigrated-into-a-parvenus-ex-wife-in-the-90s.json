She kept seeing black in front of her eyes. Oh boy, all she did was go to bed a little later than usual last night. Could that be the cause of the splitting headache that she was experiencing right now? Was she running a fever?Her arms and legs felt weak; in fact, her entire body felt weak. She opened her mouth a little, and her throat felt like it was blocked and she couldn\u2019t make a sound.Oh sh*t. So she wouldn\u2019t even be able to call an ambulance for herself?She sat motionlessly for a little before she tried again. Okay, at least she got her voice back. She frantically looked for her cellphone to call for an ambulance. She worked in a foreign city and rented a small room by herself. If she waited for someone to find her, her body would already be cold and stiff.She fished around under her bed and grabbed a bundle of money. Light blue hundred-dollar bills? Shu Yan paused for a little. She was familiar with this currency \u2013 this was the currency used when she was a child. But, the government had issued new bills and these had been gone from the market.She was very certain she did not have a stash of these bills under her bed. Yesterday was her day off, and she had just put on new bedsheets. Her cellphone was the only thing under her pillow. She did not leave the house all day long, and nobody has been in her room, so where did this money come from?The most horrifying of all was her hands. Shu Yan might only be fair looking, but she has very pretty hands. Her fingers were long and slender, and her fingernails a heavy rose color. Many people had told her that she should have been trained in piano playing.But, the pair of hands in front of her were dark and meaty. The skin was coarse and covered in calluses. Shu Yan wriggled the fingers; her hands were not her hands\u2026Frantically, she flipped over the blanket. Her slender body turned into a chunky one. She pinched the bulged-out stomach and felt pain. A scream was suppressed in her throat and her body trembled uncontrollably.After a long while\u2026.\u201cDreaming. I must be dreaming.\u201d Shu Yan covered her mouth frightfully. This soft voice did not belong to her; her voice was harder than this.Everything in front of her turned black again, and she fell back down. A sharp pain and she gained memories that did not belong to her. It was somewhat like watching a movie, except it was someone\u2019s entire life.This person\u2019s name was also Shu Yan. She was born in 1967. She came from a poor farming village. Her family has five children with her being the fourth one. She has two older brothers, one older sister, and one younger brother. After graduating from her third year in grade school, Shu Yan started taking care of her little brother as well as taking care of household chores.She married Ye Zhiqiang from the next village at 17 and gave birth to her eldest daughter, Jingjing, at 18. As she was a daughter, she did not earn her the fondness from her husband or her in-laws. She finally gave birth to a son a year ago. One would think that her hardship should be over by then. Unfortunately, Ye Zhiqiang was wealthier now and was no longer content. He now has a lover who was a college graduate and started complaining that his wife was fat, ugly, and uncultured. He insisted on getting a divorce. The original owner was so upset that she committed suicide.Which was to say that she had transmigrated to become this Shu Yan?Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just because she stayed up a little late reading novels last night, she had transmigrated?Speaking of the novel, Shu Yan\u2019s spirit was a little more uplifted. The parents of the original female lead seemed to be Ye Zhiqiang and Li Jiaojiao, the name of the original owner\u2019s ex and his new lover. And, the original owner\u2019s children\u2019s names were Ye Jingjing and Ye Tianbao, the names of the primary cannon fodders in the novel. Most importantly, there was a cannon fodder, Shu Yan, who never even appeared in the book. As her name was the same as hers, she paid particular attention to that portion of the book.The female lead of the novel, Ye Ranran, was the daughter of Ye Zhiqiang and Li Jiaojiao. She has two half siblings, the ones from Ye Zhiqiang and his ex-wife \u2013 Ye Jingjing and Ye Tianbao. The ex-wife gained custody of them during the divorce. Their mother died in a car accident when they were both very young. The two of them grew up with their maternal grandmother and their days weren\u2019t too happy. As such, they hated the female lead so much that they have decided to set her up but, unfortunately, they were annihilated by the male lead who got there just in time to save the female lead.Ye Jingjing and Ye Tianbao appeared in a total of five chapters in the book. The name Shu Yan was only mentioned once by Ye Jingjing. These weren\u2019t enough to support that she had transmigrated but if you added in the names of the female lead\u2019s grandparents and uncles, then this was unmistakably the novel that she was reading last night.So\u2026 she had transmigrated into a novel?Not as the female lead, or the female supporting characters, but as the mother of the female cannon fodder. Someone who showed up only once and was already dead.Now that she has become the Shu Yan in the book, wasn\u2019t the death of the original owner analogous to the death of her?Would she be able to return to her own world if she died?Shu Yan had a common life. She was born in a small town, and her parents owned a fruit shop. She has a younger brother that was seven years younger than her. They hadn\u2019t been spending as much time together as they used to after he had left for college, but the two of them were quite close. She had originally returned to her hometown after college to seek work.Her initial plan was some sort of a government job but she finally started to buckle under the pressure from her family to get married. So, she packed her bags and moved back to the town she went to college. She was still single at 30. This wasn\u2019t because she wasn\u2019t able to find someone, but because she didn\u2019t want to compromise.All her friends had gotten married and had kids. Their center of attention had shifted to their families, and Shu Yan had less and less in common with them. She had become progressively nerdier as she spent less time with her friends. Her everyday entertainment was to watch some shows online and read some novels. She didn\u2019t think reading a novel would lead to transmigration. Sure, she grumbled about her life from time to time, but she never wanted to become someone else.How sad would her parents be when they found out that she was dead? For reasons that she couldn\u2019t explain, she knew that she was dead in her original world. The feeling was very strong, and a strong sense of sadness washed over her. Tears started to stream down her cheeks. Her only comfort was that she still has a younger brother who would be there to take care of their parents.Going back was probably not an option; she didn\u2019t have the guts to kill herself. So what other choice did she have other than to live her life here?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On top of it was an empty pill bottle. She picked up the bottle and sighed.\u201cWhat a silly woman. How is this scum of a man worth you killing yourself over?\u201dAs soon as she finished saying that, the world turned dark in front of, and she almost fell to the ground. Feeling desperate, she almost wanted to commit suicide so it\u2019d all be over.As she clutched her chest, Shu Yan\u2019s look was fierce, \u201cHe was a scum. Other than being a wife, you are also a daughter and a mother. Killing yourself over a scum with no regards to the parents who birthed you and your young pair of children, and you still think you are in the right?\u201dThe sense of desperation dissipated slowly, only to be replaced by a sense of unreconciled feeling.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let the scum man and woman off easily. Now that I am using your body, I promise I will take care of your parents and your children.\u201dAs soon as she said that, a burden was lifted off of her body. Shu Yan breathed a few times. She didn\u2019t think one sentence from her would trigger whatever remained of the original owner. Had she not responded fast enough, she just might be affected enough to have committed suicide as well.Of course, she would be true to her words on whatever she had promised the original owner. She had no idea why she was brought here, but now that she has someone else\u2019s body and memories, she would live with the consequences of this body.Shu Yan organized her thoughts again and learned that the year was 1992, and the world was more or less on par of her own 1992. Certain countries and some local locations were different, but the bulk of them were the same. That was a good thing for her. The nineties were the golden time for businesses. She trusted that with her knowledge of the future, she wouldn\u2019t do too poorly.The original owner was born in 1967 and was 25 currently, five years younger than Shu Yan, but she was already a mother of two. Her older daughter was 7 years old and about to start grade school, and her younger one was already 3.That could be a little tricky for Shu Yan, who was still single at 30 in her previous life. Bam! Starting out as a mother. How exciting!She spent a little time to regroup before she processed more of her memories. The original owner graduated after three years of grade school to help out at home and take care of her young brother. But that was the norm for most girls in this era. At least she could read a few words, her older sister had never step foot in a school.Both her older brother along with her younger brother had graduated from junior high school. All in all, boys were valued more than girls. Her older sister was married off so her Third Brother could get married. She was married off so her younger brother, who was 2 years younger than her, could get himself a wife. It wasn\u2019t that much different than selling their daughters.\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both the original owner and her second sister wholeheartedly sacrificed themselves for their family and their brothers. All in all, the original owner had given quite some money to her parents.This wasn\u2019t the first time the scum had an affair, as Shu Yan had learned in shock.Ye Zhiqiang already had an affair when the original owner was pregnant with Ye Tianbao. Back then, the original owner cried and fuzzed, and it was her own mother who came to tell her to overlook that. More or less what she meant to say was that Ye Zhiqiang was a somewhat successful man, and all successful men have women beside their wives. So, as a wife she needed to learn to overlook these things. What was unbelievable was that the original owner had agreed to it. She only tried to commit suicide this time because the scum of a man insisted of getting a divorce.From the original owner\u2019s perspective, one listens to her father when she was single and her husband after she gets married. Ye Zhiqiang was her entire world. And now that her world was crumbling around her, she could no longer live.Shu Yan was shocked by her way of thinking. This was already 1992, these types of values still existed?!There was no way that Shu Yan would agree with this type of value. Before she organized her memories, she figured that the original owner\u2019s parents were probably more or less the same as her own. But now that she knew that was how her parents were like, Shu Yan felt that it would be very difficult for her to be genuinely nice to them. She wouldn\u2019t sacrifice herself for her brothers. They were all grown and had their own families; they should learn to be independent.But, as she had promised original owner to take care of her parents, she wouldn\u2019t just completely ignore them. In the future, when they were sick and needed to go to the hospital, she would help out. When they were old and needed to be taken care of, the cost would be shared between the 5 siblings. The relationship between parents and their children should be a two-way street. The original owner\u2019s parents only viewed her as an ATM. The original owner was foolish, but she wasn\u2019t.Luckily, the original owner never told her family that Ye Zhiqiang wanted to have a divorce. It was best that they didn\u2019t know about it. They would never agree to it, and there would be too much drama. The original owner didn\u2019t want to get a divorce, but Shu Yan very much wanted one.The original owner had never worked a day after she married Ye Zhiqiang. Prior to that, she had been raising the kids and taking care of the farm back in the village and only moved in with Ye Zhiqiang a year ago. She only knew that he was a contractor of sort, but she knew nothing more beyond that.Ye Zhiqiang was rich and had a lot of ties, that put Shu Yan at a disadvantage.Shu Yan threw away the empty bottle in her hand and picked up the document. It was the divorce agreement.It was all in legal mumbo jumbo but it boiled down to three points:The house would go to her, the car to Ye Zhiqiang;All the savings would go to her;The two children would also go to her.How much liquid money would a contract have? These were the times when cars were more expensive than houses. Ye Zhiqiang thought he could easily get rid of his wife and kids and live a happy life with his lover?In. His. Dreams!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Zhiqiang and Li Jiaojiao have been seen together day and night and that was the best evidence. Unfortunately, nobody would testify for her due to the difference in social status between the two of them. If witnesses were not an option, she would need to gather physical evidence.She\u2019d need to hire a PI or something to get intimate photos of Ye Zhiqiang and Li Jiaojiao, preferably if they could catch them in bed together. It wasn\u2019t just women that valued reputation. Reputation was also very important to Ye Zhiqiang. If she has photos in hand, the ball would be in her court.Basing on her calculation, Li Jiaojiao was already pregnant. That was the only reason why Ye Zhiqiang wanted to rush to have a divorce. She needed to figure out which hospital Li Jiaojiao was having her checkups. It would be best if could get her hands on the hospital reports.She didn\u2019t have much time left. Ye Zhiqiang was forcing the original owner to get a divorce. He might not take any actions himself, but he was a contractor. He had plenty of men working for him. When a man decides to have something done, they wouldn\u2019t care that you were their wife or that you have children with him.She immediately got up to get dressed so she could go out and look for help. Standing in front of the wall mirror, her high spirit was immediately knocked down a notch. She wasn\u2019t exactly a pretty girl, but she wasn\u2019t ugly either. She was average, but when she cleaned up nicely, she would still get a praise or two here and there.But this one in the mirror?She was at most 1.57 meter. She wasn\u2019t tall, yet she was fat, probably around 65 kg. And her stomach, she looked like she was 7-8 months pregnant. Her skin was dark and coarse. Most importantly was her face, she had melasma all over her face, and her hair was a mess. She looked like she was over 40 years old. The only saving grace was that her features weren\u2019t too bad, but that still couldn\u2019t withstand the horrible way she had been treating herself. She turned away, discouraged. The first thing that she must do after her divorce was to lose weight, then work on improving her skin and the melasma condition. She might not become pretty one day, but she could at least look lively and 25 years old.There wasn\u2019t much clothing inside the closet. Shu Yan casually pulled out some casual wear and put on a pair of popular plastic sandals and headed downstairs.The house was five-story tall. The first floor made up of the living room and the kitchen, the second floor has two bedrooms located in the front and back. The front one belonged to original owner and Ye Zhiqiang. Granted, Ye Zhiqiang rarely came back anymore, so it was mostly just the original owner and Ye Tianbao. The one in the back belonged to Ye Jingjing. The third to fifth floor were just painted white, with no furnishings.This house was given to Ye Zhiqiang by a customer of his who couldn\u2019t pay his bills. Its current value was around $15,000. Nineteen years later, it would be worth around $5-$6 million, and that was if someone was selling one.Shu Yan looked around quickly. The house was very quiet. The two children were staying with their grandmother in the village. This gave her the perfect opportunity to focus on gathering evidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its geographical environment, language, and customs were fairly similar to where she used to be. That was the silver lining; she wouldn\u2019t have to grapple with so much.She was dumbfounded as soon as she walked outside of the house. There were no cellphones or internet during this era. How was she going to look for a PI?Never mind the original owner, who was just a housewife. She, too, was just a commoner and had never been in contact with anyone like that before. She really had no idea where to start.Shu Yan searched her memories desperately and suddenly she got something. The original owner\u2019s big uncle\u2019s young son was a street hooligan in City Xi. Words had it that he was now a regional lead. Last year, when big uncle was beaten up by someone, his son just brought a gang back with him and the incident was finally settled with the opposing party paying a lot of money to them.Back in the village, anyone who didn\u2019t have a real job would be gossiped about, especially someone as infamous as this cousin of hers. Nobody would say anything to his face, but they would say a lot behind his back. Long story short, Shu Yan\u2019s parents had always told her and her siblings to not have anything to do with this cousin. The original owner had been to City Xi for over a year now and never been in contact with this cousin. That ought to tell you how distant their relationship was.The original owner might feel that he was just a hooligan and not someone she wanted to be associated with, but Shu Yan begged to differ. As far as she could remember, this instant cousin of hers had always been protective of his siblings when he was a child. Anyone that dared to bully them at school had been beaten up by him before. Even now, whenever any of the relatives were bullied and asked for him, he\u2019d always rushed back with a gang.He also showed filial piety to his parents and grandparents. Last year, he took his grandparents to the hospital for a checkup. What other elders in the village had checkups in this era? Her grandparents were definitely the pioneers of that. All in all, he was much more reliable than the original owner\u2019s own siblings.There were, of course, certain risks for looking for him. She couldn\u2019t afford to have the elders back home found out about the divorce.Shu Yan walked around the city first. There were clothing stores, food stands, department stores, but no PIs. Not even an advertisement for them.She saw a photography shop. After a little bit of hesitation, she went inside.\u201cHi comrade, are you looking to have your pictures taken?\u201d It was a man in his thirties with a goatee and long hair. He was definitely the artistic type.\u201cNo, I am just looking around.\u201d Shu Yan nodded, then she turned around and left. If she told him that she needed pictures of her husband and his lover taken, he just might feel that she was insulting his artistic talent. Sigh. She would just have to head to the next shop.The man at the next shop didn\u2019t look too artistic, but he was old enough to be her grandfather. Her original plan was to find some photographer and pay them a little extra to help her take a few pictures, but she was afraid she\u2019d have to give up on that plan.Seeing that the old man seemed well experienced and any local photographers in this era was already pretty upscale, she decided to see if she could get some information from him.\u201cHi, mister. Do you know where I might be able to find a PI in City Xi?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since when do we have PIs in China?\u201dOf course there were PIs, most people just didn\u2019t know about them, that was all. Shu Yan thanked him and left. Perhaps, seeking out her cousin was the only option she had.She went to a few clubs before she found her cousin, who was playing mahjong.\u201cWho did you say was looking for me?\u201d asked Shu Jianyang with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, looking at the person dubiously.\u201cShe said she\u2019s your cousin. Her name is Shu Yan.\u201d They had the same last name. She couldn\u2019t be lying about it.\u201cThird Brother, is that really your cousin? Is she pretty? Why don\u2019t you introduce her to us?\u201d The man with dyed yellow hair sitting across from Shu Jianyang chuckled.The cousin shoved him aside and said impatiently, \u201cGet out of here. Old Fifth, you sit in for me. I\u2019ll go talk to my cousin.\u201dLooking at his cousin standing by the door, Shu Jianyang lifted his brows. This cousin of his normally avoided him like a plague, what brought her here today? Have pigs been flying?\u201cThird Brother,\u201d Shu Yan recognized him right away when he walked out. She said directly, \u201cI came to ask for a favor today.\u201dAfter running around for most of the day, she didn\u2019t think she would be able to get any help other than from her instant cousin.Shu Yan\u2019s words surprised Shu Jianyang even more. He never thought she\u2019d come and ask him for help.\u201cOkay, hang on. Let me let them know.\u201d Shu Jianyang didn\u2019t ask anything, but turned around and exchanged some words with the rest of his crew before taking Shu Yan to a tea shop nearby.The servers at the tea shop was very familiar with Shu Jianyang. Smiling, they took them up to a private room on the second floor. Shu Jianyang obviously visited this tea shop a lot.\u201cIt is safe here. You can feel free to say whatever you need,\u201d said the cousin as he smacked his own thigh. He was being silly, the most she was going to ask was to stand by her over some issue. How serious could it be?\u201cBefore I say anything, can I ask you to promise me something?\u201d Before she came to Shu Jianyang, Shu Yan had analyzed his personality. He was open-minded, true to his words, trying to persuade him would work better than trying to be forceful with him.Shu Jianyang frowned.\u201cNothing very difficult. I just don\u2019t want those back home to find out, especially my family. If this puts you in a difficult position, just pretend that I was never here,\u201d added Shu Yan quickly.Shu Jianyang was a little surprised. He looked up and down his cousin. Yes, that is Shu Yan alright, but her personality seemed to have changed drastically. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll promise you. What is it?\u201dShu Yan started to cry, \u201cThird Brother, Ye Zhiqiang has a lover and asked for a divorce.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Shu Jianyang\u2019s face dropped. He and Shu Yan weren\u2019t close, but he wouldn\u2019t allow anyone outside of the family to bully his cousin!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

While was normal for a man to have a couple women at the table when they were talking about business, having a lover was a whole different story. And now he had asked for a divorce?\u201cThis is a serious matter and you want to keep it from your family? What is going on?\u201d In theory, Shu Yan should be turning for her own parents and brothers for help. Not only did she not want them to find out, but she sought him out for help?Shu Yan shook her head and choked back her tears, \u201cThird Brother, don\u2019t you know my parents and my brothers? They can\u2019t find out about this. If they do, they will never let me get a divorce.\u201d\u201cYou want to get a divorce?\u201d Now Shu Jianyang was completely shocked. He looked as Shu Yan with his eyes widened.He thought she was here to ask him to go and threaten Ye Zhiqiang to end things with his lover and go back to her. Never in a million years would he thought Shu Yan wanted to have a divorce.\u201cYe Zhiqiang is forcing me to divorce. He has his mind made. He\u2019s willing to give up his two children for that women, let alone me.\u201d Shu Yan sniffled. \u201cI will divorce, but it will cost him. We can get a divorce, but I want every penny that he\u2019s got.\u201dLooking at the vicious-looking cousin in front of him, Shu Jianyang gulped. As the saying goes, \u201cthe most vicious thing is a woman\u2019s heart.\u201d When a woman has her mind set, why would they even need a man?\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d\u201cThird Brother, you know the PIs that you have seen in Hong Kong movies?\u201d Seeing that Shu Jianyang had nodded, Shu Yan carried on, \u201cI will need a PI to take some pictures for me. The more the better, the more intimate the better. Voice recording would be best. If they can catch them in bed together, that\u2019d be perfect.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d Shu Jianyang took a sip of the tea and cleared his throat. Seemingly a little bit out of it, he asked, \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cYe Zhiqiang\u2019s lover is pregnant. Can help me find out which hospital she has been going to? If we can somehow get a copy of her medical report, that would be very helpful as well.\u201dShu Jianyang didn\u2019t say a word and Shu Yan was getting anxious. She tried to remain calm appearance as she waited.After a long while, Shu Jianyang nodded, \u201cAlright, I will take care of that.\u201d\u201cThank you, Third Brother,\u201d said Shu Yan as she let out a sigh of relief. She fished out a roll of bills and handed it over to him. \u201cI left in a hurry and didn\u2019t head to the bank. Here\u2019s what I have for now.\u201d\u201cTake that back,\u201d said Shu Jianyang unhappily, his face dropped.Shu Yan shook her head, \u201cThis is not something Third Brother can do on your own. You are my cousin and I don\u2019t have to pay you, but you will have to pay your men. Third Brother, there isn\u2019t that much money here. Here, take it. Don\u2019t make it more difficult for me.\u201dSeeing how determined she was, Shu Jianyang sighed and took the money, \u201cAlright, but this is enough. Don\u2019t pay me more next time.\u201dSeeing that he had accepted the money, Shu Yan smiled and nodded, \u201cWhen does Third Brother plan on acting? What do you need me to do?\u201d\u201cNo rush. Let me make some arrangement and I\u2019ll let you know when we catch them in bed together,\u201d snickered Shu Jianyang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had been running around all day long and that was quite tiring.On the top of the night table, there were pictures of the two kids. Perhaps, because she had the memories of the original owner, Shu Yan felt a closeness to the two children. Recalling their endings in the book, she felt a stiffness in her chest.In the book, the two of them did not have a happy life. Ye Jingjing quit school after graduating high school and joined the workforce in order to support her brother, Ye Tianbao, to continue to go to school. The two of them hated Ye Zhiqiang their entire lives.One time, Ye Tianbao\u2019s company had a project together with Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s company, and Ye Ranran was Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s company\u2019s representative. Ye Jingjing saw the white swan like Ye Ranran, became crazy jealous of her, and wanted to set her up. And, Ye Tianbao decided to help out his sister.During dinner, Ye Tianbao added drugs to Ye Ranran\u2019s food. Ye Jingjing worked at the hotel and her plan was to take Ye Ranran, who looked like she was drunk, into a room and take naked pictures of her.Of course, the female lead would never truly be hurt. Right when Ye Jingjing was leaving with Ye Ranran, they ran into the male lead, who just arrived at the restaurant. He saved the female lead.After that event, the male lead set Ye Jingjing up and sent her straight to jail. Ye Zhiqiang, seeing that Ye Tianbao was his oldest son, protected him, but he was still forced to leave City Xi. He was brought up one more time in an extra chapter where he died in a car accident like his mother. Shu Yan didn\u2019t think much of it when she was reading the novel; they were merely cannon fodder. But now that she had become their mother, she had a different take on it.Wasn\u2019t that too much of a coincidence? There weren\u2019t that many cars back in \u201992. According to the original owner\u2019s personality, she would most likely have taken both of her children back to the village where she came from. Other than the two buses a day, Lingan Township only has a few tractors. How did she end up dying in a car accident? And her son Ye Tianbao, he was forced out of City Xi, then died in a car accident shortly thereafter. How did both of them die in car accidents? And both died on the scene no less.Shu Yan shuddered from her own conspiracy theory. Ye Zhiqiang didn\u2019t care about his children, their fate would probably be worse being with him than with her. She had promised original owner that she\u2019d take care of her children. In addition, Shu Yan quite like children. Now that she had gained two children without having to carry them for 10 months in pregnancy, she quite honestly felt like she had gottem the longer end of the stick.She heard the sound of a door opening, and her heart tightened. Ye Zhiqiang? What was he doing here?She saw Ye Zhiqiang. Just like in her memory, he was wearing a floral shirt paired with a light-colored pants and a gold chain that was the size of a pinky finger along with his bald head. He couldn\u2019t look any more like a parvenu.\u201cHave you signed the papers yet?\u201d was the first thing he asked.Shu Yan pursed her lips and faked a sad look. She couldn\u2019t afford to alert him right now. She needed to wait till she had collected the evidence that she needed\u2026\u201cWhat about our kids if we get a divorce? You don\u2019t even want your son anymore?\u201d said Shu Yan as she choked back her tears.\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my son, why would I leave you the house? You will have the house and money. And, I will send you an additional $300 a month so you can just stay home to bring up the kids. Go ask around Lingan Township. You\u2019ll see that your situation is the best out of all of them. Alright, stop dragging it out, just sign the papers,\u201d said Ye Zhiqiang impatiently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If they didn\u2019t get married soon, her stomach would begin to show. His children should be from Jiaojiao. They would for sure be pretty and smart. He should have never married this whale. If he hadn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this mess right now.\u201cI don\u2019t want a divorce! No way!\u201d shouted Shu Yan hysterically. \u201cYou are a horrible man, Ye Zhiqiang. If I hadn\u2019t stayed and worked with you all those nights and days at the construction site, you would never have made it.\u201d\u201cBullsh*t! It was my own talent. Shu Yan, do not test my patience. Sign the documents if you know what\u2019s good for you.\u201d\u201cNo! I would not sign them! Ye Zhiqiang ,you are a monster!\u201d Shu Yan sat and bawled at the end of the bed.\u201cHusband, are you done yet?\u201d came a delicate voice from downstairs.Shu Yan\u2019s eyes dimmed. Damn this Ye Zhiqiang, he straight up just brought Li Jiaojiao with him. He was truly fearless.Ye Zhiqiang acknowledged her.Shu Yan almost had goosebumps from hearing the tenderness in his voice when he spoke to Li Jiaojiao. It was so different to how he had been talking to her.\u201cYou better think this through. I have already decided to get a divorce, end of discussion.\u201d With another call from Li Jiaojiao, Ye Zhiqiang left with these words and took off.Shu Yan looked up, and all the sadness was gone. She let out a harumph. She needed to ask Third Brother to hurry up. This couldn\u2019t be dragged on much longer. She needed to move quickly.***Shu Jianyang was quite quick. Three days later, a not-too-old man came looking for Shu Yan and asked her to go with him to Hotel Rixin.\u201cHotel?\u201d Shu Yan\u2019s eyes beamed. \u201cDo we go now?\u201d\u201cYes, Third Brother said everything had been arranged.\u201d The man eyed Shu Yan up and down subtly and was a little disappointed. He had to fight a few guys for the opportunity to come and deliver this news. They figured that Third Brother was so handsome, so his cousin must be fairly pretty too. Well, the higher the hope, the higher the disappointment. This cousin of Third Brother\u2026. He wasn\u2019t even sure what to make of her.What he thought was subtle, Shu Yan caught it all. She had a pretty good idea what this body looked like. It wasn\u2019t worth getting upset over. The most important part right now was to go catch the couple in bed.When she arrived at the hotel, Shu Jianyang was already waiting for her there.\u201cYe Zhiqiang just walked inside; there\u2019s no rush there. These were what I was able to dig up. You can take a look at them first,\u201d said Shu Jianyang as he handed over a few large document envelopes to Shu Yan.Shu Yan gave him a look and took the envelope from him. Inside the first one, there were documents that showed was all of Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s assets. He had a construction company, 4 houses, two trucks, and a sedan under his name. Perhaps, he figured that Shu Yan was ignorant, or that he was simply an over confident man, all of his assets were under his name, making it very easy for Shu Yan.The other one envelope contained Li Jiaojiao\u2019s hospital report. She wasn\u2019t even trying to hide anything; she went straight to the People\u2019s Hospital. She was 14-weeks pregnant, a little over 3 months. No wonder they were rushing.\u201cThese are some of the pictures that we were able to get. Not a whole lot, but we should be able to get more shortly.\u201d Shu Jianyang lifted his chin and gestured Shu Yan to open up the next envelope.There were pictures of Ye Zhiqiang having dinner with Li Jiaojiao, walking down the streets hand-in-hand, and also shopping for kid\u2019s clothes. Ye Zhiqiang hadn\u2019t done any of these things with the original owner because he felt that she was not presentable and never wanted anyone to see her.These pictures alone wouldn\u2019t be enough, but she trusted that once they have pictures of them in bed together, the physical evidence would be mounting.\u201cIs this where they always come to get together?\u201d Shu Yan looked around the hotel. This was not a bad setup for \u201992. She glanced at the price list, a deluxe room cost $50 a night. $50 in \u201992 was more than $100 in 2019.\u201cYe Zhiqiang bought a house for that woman, and it\u2019s currently being remodeled. He has a standing room here and have been staying here for the most part,\u201d said Shu Jianyang as he watched Shu Yan\u2019s look carefully. She showed no signs of emotions. She had truly given up on this man. Which was not a bad thing. Once she has money, she could\u2026. get married again\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Maybe just like his cousin wanted, he would take him for every penny that he had. Otherwise, it just might be\u2026 a little difficult\u2026 for her to get remarried.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe young man who fetched Shu Yan earlier whistled around the corner, and Shu Jianyang patted Shu Yan on her shoulder. The two of them fiercely walked toward room 505 and with a switch kick from Shu Jianyang, the door flew open.Shu Yan looked at the door that was cracked open and gulped. Third Brother was so heroic.Those two people were naked in bed together. Ye Zhiqiang was startled by the loud noise.Shu Yan scanned over his unmentionables and wondered if he would be traumatized by this event.Ye Zhiqiang turned around and saw Shu Jianyang and Shu Yan behind him. His face was beet red and right when he was about to say something, he heard the sound of shutters clicking. He looked over and saw something taking pictures of them from all sorts of angles.Li Jiaojiao shrieked and wanted to grab the blanket, but Shu Jianyang\u2019s man had already grabbed the blanket and thrown it out of the fifth-floor window along with their clothes, including their underwear.Shu Yan looked sad, but she was cheerful for the smart boy deep down inside. Good job, little boy. I\u2019ll pay you bonus money afterward!\u201cStop taking pictures! Do you hear me!\u201d Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s eyes were beet red. \u201cShu Yan, what the hell are you doing?\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t believe that Shu Yan had what it took to pull this off, but Shu Jianyang was a whole different story. He turned his head to negotiate with Shu Jianyang. \u201cThird Brother, we had never crossed each other in the past. What\u2019s going on between Shu Yan and I is family business. Don\u2019t you think you might be overreaching a bit?\u201d\u201cI was the one who asked Third Brother to help me out,\u201d said Shu Yan as she pointed as Li Jiaojiao. \u201cYou wanted to divorce me for this wench? You are a horrible monster, Ye Zhiqiang.\u201d\u201cStop! Stop taking pictures! Oh, Zhiqiang, make them stop!\u201d Li Jiaojiao curled up and covered up her face.Shu Yan ran over, grabbed Li Jiaojiao by her hair ,and slapped her twice on her face, \u201cIs that why your parents paid for you to go to college? So you can seduce something else\u2019s husband? You shameless wench\u2026.\u201dShu Yan was anxious. She was brought up way too well by her parents from her past life, so she didn\u2019t even know how to yell at someone.Seeing that his Jiaojiao was attacked, Ye Zhiqiang wanted to go and beat up Shu Yan. With a wave of Shu Jianyang\u2019s hand, a couple of his men went over and beat up on Ye Zhiqiang.Li Jiaojiao was pregnant, so Shu Yan didn\u2019t want to be too vicious. Slapped her a couple times? Sure. But, she didn\u2019t want her to lose her baby. That would turn her into the perpetrator instead of the victim.\u201cEnough, Shu Yan. Have them stop. We can talk it through like adults.\u201d Ye Zhiqiang covered up his head and let out a small cry here and there.Shu Jianyang\u2019s men were professionals. They knew where to hit that would cause the most pain but leave no evidence.\u201cThird Brother?\u201d Shu Yan looked over at Shu Jianyang. She had asked him for help, and Third Brother had also said that he\u2019d take care of it, so she must look to him to see what his thoughts were.Shu Jianyang nodded and his two men gave Ye Zhiqiang one final kick before they went back to stand behind Shu Jianyang.\u201cOkay, since you wanted to talk, then let\u2019s talk.\u201d Shu Yan looked at Ye Zhiqiang and seeing his painful look, she felt redeemed.No matter what, they had given him a beating. That was for the original owner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You still know what shame is? Then why did you do this in the first place? If this happened ten years ago, you would have been executed for this.\u201d Shu Jianyang scanned over them before turning to the man with the camera, \u201cHow do they look?\u201d\u201cSo amazing. One roll of film wasn\u2019t even enough,\u201d said the man excitedly.Having heard that, the hearts of Ye Zhiqiang and Li Jiaojiao dropped. Exactly like Shu Jianyang had said, if these pictures were leaked, they would have been dragged through the streets with signs on them ten years ago. If it was during the crack down period, they very well might be executed immediately. Even though the political environment was a little laxer now, it was still very conservative overall. No matter what, they couldn\u2019t let these pictures see the light of day.Li Jiaojiao was even more scared than Ye Zhiqiang. She may not have attended a great college, but she was still a college graduate after all. As she wasn\u2019t from a prominent family, she was assigned to a not-so-good factory. Many of her colleagues wanted to be transfer to a better unit. She didn\u2019t want to spend her entire life in a factory that may or may not even be able to pay her salary, which was another reason why she was with Ye Zhiqiang.If word got out about their affair, especially if these pictures were leaked, she would be fired from the factory, her school would delist her, and her life would be over.The more she thought about it, the more scared she was. Li Jiaojiao wrapped her arms around herself and shivered. She looked nothing like the previous proud woman that had once stood in front of the original owner.They didn\u2019t give them their clothes back, but one of Shu Jianyang\u2019s men grabbed two towels from the bathroom and threw them onto them, so they could cover up some. Mostly, these men didn\u2019t want to hurt their eyes looking at them.\u201cThis is our family matters after all, Third Brother. Do you think I can talk to Shu Yan alone?\u201d Ye Zhiqiang asked Shu Jianyang very nicely now that he has evidence against him.Shu Jianyang didn\u2019t say anything ,but turned and looked at Shu Yan. He was just here for her; this was her decision.Shu Yan nodded, \u201cThe wench will leave as well.\u201dBefore Li Jiaojiao walked out, she poked Ye Zhiqiang with her finger and pleadingly looked at him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You go wait for me outside.\u201d Ye Zhiqiang pulled out a few hundred dollars for the wallet that he was somehow able to keep and told her, \u201cGo look for a server and get us some clothes.\u201dShu Jianyang didn\u2019t interfere with that but turned and said to Shu Yan, \u201cI will be right outside. Holler if you need me.\u201d He glanced over at Ye Zhiqiang as he spoke, obviously he was partly talking to him as well.With nobody else left in the room, the atmosphere became suffocating all of a sudden. Shu Yan dragged over a chair and sat down. She leaned against the chair and said, \u201cYou want to have a seat?\u201dYe Zhiqiang took a deep breath, now that he no longer had the upper hand, he didn\u2019t dare to speak from a higher position. He forced a smile and said, \u201cShu Yan, did Third Brother force you into this? Is he thinking that he will somehow be able to gain something from our divorce?\u201dEven now Ye Zhiqiang couldn\u2019t believe that Shu Yan would be here to catch him red-handed or that she has what it takes to do that.\u201cNo, this wasn\u2019t Third Brother\u2019s idea. I reached out to him for help,\u201d said Shu Yan with a smile that wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cYe Zhiqiang, you sure you want a divorce, right?\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t that she still looked the same as she did before, even Ye Zhiqiang would think it was someone else sitting in front of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can you really say that we were in love with each other? Shu Yan, I know that you have been taking care of the home all these years and taking care of the kids, which was why I have decided to give you the house and all the cash we have at home. Worse case scenario\u2026.\u201d Ye Zhiqiang gritted his teeth, \u201cI will take the children. I didn\u2019t think it through clearly before. It\u2019d be difficult for you to get remarried with two children. Without them and with a house and some cash, you can easily find someone better than me.\u201dHe had only seen the children from Shu Yan a few times, hugged his son a couple of times when he was born, but that was it. He was never that close to them, which was why he had no hesitation when he said he\u2019d give both children to Shu Yan when Li Jiaojiao said she was worried that her child would be bullied by its older half-brother and half-sister.Ye Zhiqiang figured that he didn\u2019t mind spending a small amount of money. He would pay for their tuition later on as well. All in all, he wouldn\u2019t let anything bad happen to Jiaojiao\u2019s child. In her words, this child was the product of their love.But the situation had changed. Now that she was lording over them with such evidence, he\u2019d have to take a step back. Worst case scenario, he could always give the children to his parents back in the village. That way, they would not affect his life with Jiaojiao at all.It was true that the two of them met through a matchmaker. But, they had spent so many years together, not to mention the original owner had given him two children. There should be some love between them even if they were not in love with each other. Afterall, that\u2019s how everybody spent their lives back in the village, no? At the end of the day, Ye Zhiqiang has money now and he no longer want the wife that he had at home. He wanted to upgrade to a younger, prettier, and more cultured woman.\u201cWe can get a divorce,\u201d said Shu Yan directly, not wanting to beat around the bush anymore, \u201cBut I don\u2019t agree with what you have proposed earlier.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? You didn\u2019t think that\u2019s enough money? You know that all my money is tied up in the projects, and I still owe material fees to my suppliers. Not to mention all the men\u2019s salaries that needed to be paid out.\u201d Looking at Shu Yan, Ye Zhiqiang gritted his teeth and said with great difficulty, \u201cHow about this? I will go borrow some money. I should be able to get another $20,000. That\u2019s in addition to the $10,000 we have at home. That will give you $30,000. How many in your village has $30,000 under their name, huh?\u201dShu Yan snickered to herself. Had she not known about all his assets, she might have fallen for this. He wanted to get rid of her for a mere $30,000. Not a chance!\u201cI\u2019ll have a divorce. You leave me with everything you have.\u201dYe Zhiqiang stood up in surprise, \u201cWhat made you think you could do that?\u201d\u201cFrom you having an affair? And knocking up your lover. If we are to go to court with that, that\u2019s what the court would have sentenced you anyways. Ye Zhiqiang, I have witnesses and physical evidence. If you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019d go leave me with everything you have and leave. Otherwise, I will see you in court.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He thought that his simple and dumb wife wouldn\u2019t change so much. Was it because of the shock from him asking for a divorce? She was like an entirely different person.No. That couldn\u2019t be. She must have got all these from that Shu Jianyang. That would be the only thing that made sense. She hadn\u2019t even graduated elementary school. What did she know about the law? She got all this information from Shu Jianyang. He must have his eyes on his company.\u201cYanyan, what did that Shu Jianyang say to you? He doesn\u2019t have your best interest in mind. Trust me, he just wanted to use you to get to my assets, only to take them from you. Then, you wouldn\u2019t even have a penny of it left.\u201d The more he said, the more he was convinced that was the case. \u201cNeither one of us would have any money. How are we going to support the kids? Do you want to see the kids suffer?\u201dShu Yan shook her head and looked at Ye Zhiqiang, \u201cYou know how many women you have been with since we have been married. I had never said a word for the kids. But now I realized that you didn\u2019t even care for your own kids. How could I trust you then? So, Ye Zhiqiang, I don\u2019t care what you have to say. We will get a divorce and you will leave me with every penny that you got.\u201dThe original owner might believe in Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s words, but Shu Yan didn\u2019t buy any of it.\u201cThen we won\u2019t get a divorce,\u201d said Ye Zhiqiang as he stared at Shu Yan. \u201cIs that what you want?\u201dHe had been going to give her a house and some money, only because she had given him two children. He had been too soft to her. So she didn\u2019t want to get a divorce? Okay, we will see!Shu Yan chuckled, stood up, and said nonchalantly, \u201cIt\u2019s not you who wants a divorce now. I want a divorce. This is going to happen. All the assets and the children will go to me. I don\u2019t care if you want to be with Jiaojiao or Yanyan, just get as far away from me as possible.\u201d\u201cShu Yan, you are going too far,\u201d said Ye Zhiqiang, anxious as he looked at the wife he no longer knew.Going too far? Shu Yan scoffed. She fished out the documents from her purse and threw them at Ye Zhiqiang.\u201cThese are pictures of you and Li Jiaojiao together and also Li Jiaojiao\u2019s hospital report. Not to mention, we have all the amazing photos that we have taken today. You might want to think twice about it, Ye Zhiqiang.\u201dThe items on the table make Ye Zhiqiang shudder. His eyes reddened with a vicious look, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cI have said it many times already. You, leave with nothing. Take your Li Jiaojiao and get as far away as possible.\u201d Shu Yan would love to choke him to death right now. She enunciated one word at a time, \u201cBy the way, I already had someone looked up all of your assets and had them certified by a lawyer. Don\u2019t even think about transferring any of them out.\u201d\u201cShu Yan, I am going to kill you.\u201d He couldn\u2019t leave with nothing. He had earned all these himself, why did he have to give them to this damn, fat woman?\u201cThird Brother,\u201d Shu Yan took a couple steps back and called out.

I hope you will make up your mind soon. Remember, I am only giving you three days. If you don\u2019t make up your mind in three days, I will make it for you.\u201d The way that Shu Yan was standing was exactly the same as when Ye Zhiqiang looked for her and tried to force her to sign the documents, even her tone was the same as his the other day.His anger was bubbling up all over again, but with him being grossly outnumbered, Ye Zhiqiang had no choice but to keep himself in check.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Third Brother.\u201d Shu Yan was loving the feeling that he wish she\u2019d drop dead but there was nothing he could do about it.Once they went downstairs, Shu Yan smiled and said, \u201cThank you so much, Third Brother and all your brothers. I would love to take you all out to lunch. Please do allow me to do so.\u201d\u201cSure, let\u2019s go somewhere else,\u201d said Shu Jianyang and he took them to a restaurant not too far from the hotel and went up to the second floor.\u201cThis restaurant\u2019s food is quite good. We come here quite often.\u201d \u201cWe\u201d in this case of course referred to someone of Shu Jianyang\u2019s caliber. This was his men\u2019s first trip here. They all looked around at the decor somewhat excitedly.After everybody had finished eating and drinking, Shu Yan gave everyone today another red pocket of $100 each.

He knew full well how important a career was to a man. Ye Zhiqiang had worked hard for what he had accomplished today. He wouldn\u2019t easily give them all up.\u201cHe has to,\u201d said Shu Yan. She hesitated a little and said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I will go home in the next couple of days. Maybe I\u2019ll check into a hotel close to Third Brother.\u201dYe Zhiqiang was a contractor, who owned his own construction company and had many men working for him. These days, fights were common when competing over construction projects. Being able to go from a boy from a village to be as successful as he was today, Ye Zhiqiang wasn\u2019t a nice guy. She didn\u2019t want him to send someone to abduct her from her place and take some unmentionable pictures of her with some random man. He wasn\u2019t above doing that.Shu Yan had already thought about this before, so she brought with her her ID and bank deposit book. For safety\u2019s sake, she would stay somewhere close to Shu Jianyang. As mean as Ye Zhiqiang was, he wasn\u2019t as mean as a gangster. She didn\u2019t think he\u2019d have the balls to pull anything in Shu Jianyang\u2019s territory.\u201cAlright,\u201d even if Shu Yan hadn\u2019t suggested that, Shu Jianyang would have suggested the same anyway.\u201cThank you, Third Brother.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The area back in \u201992 was nowhere near what it was in 2019. This was not a good area, and fights broke out here all the time. Shu Yan felt that her look was very safe and that nothing bad would happen to her.\u201cThis area is unsafe. Let\u2019s have Xiao Fei and another guy be with you.\u201d Shu Jianyang was worried. Rape was not the only thing to worry about here. Most of the time they were after money. One couldn\u2019t be too safe.Xiao Fei was the young man who ran to get her last time. The other man was a well-known muscle under Shu Jianyang. They were both the left- and right-hand man of Shu Jianyang.\u201cThank you.\u201d Shu Yan was only tough on the outside. She was a single woman who had just transmigrated into a character in a book. She hasn\u2019t even had a chance to adjust herself before she had to clean up after the original owner\u2019s mess. Facing off a mean character like Ye Zhiqiang, it\u2019d be lying to say she wasn\u2019t scared. She had only done so well so far because she was backed by Shu Jianyang.\u201cThird Brother, I have another favor to ask.\u201d Shu Yan really had nobody else that she could turn to, so she had to shamelessly ask Shu Jianyang for help again.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Shu Jianyang had already given her his words that he\u2019d help her out. He wasn\u2019t going to stop now.\u201cMy two kids are still back in the village. I worry that Ye Zhiqiang will use them as bartering chips when push comes to shove.\u201d She wasn\u2019t as worried for Ye Tianbao; she was worried more for her daughter Ye Jingjing. Who knew what Ye Zhiqiang could do to her?There was certainly that possibility. Shu Yan has asked Ye Zhiqiang to leave everything behind. Who knew what he would do when he was pushed too far?\u201cYou want the kids with you?\u201d Shu Jianyang thought about it for a little bit and said, \u201cOkay. School hasn\u2019t started just yet and Second Brother should still be home. I\u2019ll have him bring the kids to town. I have a very close brother who has his own car. It won\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u201dJust like Shu Jianyang, her second cousin Shu Jianbo was also quite well known. But, their reputation was quite the opposite. Shu Jianyang was known for being a character, while Shu Jianbo, on the other hand, was known to be a well-respected man and the principal of a grade school.He was the only college graduate of the Shu\u2019s and also the only college graduate in the village. He could have chosen to stay in the capital city. Even at the province level, he could have any jobs that he wanted, but he chose to return to his hometown to be a teacher.Lingan Township wasn\u2019t too poor of a village, but it wasn\u2019t great either. No teachers really wanted to teach there. An entire township with several hundred of students had a total of eight teachers, four of them were junior high graduates. One could gather the quality of the teachers there. When the township learned that a college student wanted to come back to teach, they\u2019ve made him the model and the vice principal directly. As soon as the old principal retired, he became the principal.Under Shu Jianbo\u2019s hard work, Lingan Grade School now has a new building and also a few more teachers. At least, they now have a different teacher for each grade.Academic was the easiest and fastest path to success for someone in poverty. Everybody wants to go to college and get assigned to a good unit and live off of the government.So everybody, regardless if they have a school-age child, has deep respect for ShuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If anyone else went to pick up the children, the elders would definitely ask a lot of questions, but not so much if it was Shu Jianbo.Shu Jianyang, however, did not tell Shu Jianbo the whole story. Shu Jianbo was not without his own weaknesses. From Shu Jianyang\u2019s perspective, Shu Jianbo had been in the academics for way too long and was very stuck in his ways of thinking. He also cared a lot about reputation. He would never agree to Shu Yan getting a divorce. Had he known about it, never mind about picking up the children, he would first lecture them and then tell that to the elders back home.\u201cSecond Brother, it\u2019s me. Shu Yan, Second Uncle\u2019s daughter has a favor to ask. Yes, Second Uncle\u2019s daughter. Nothing much. Ye Zhiqiang had been very busy with his work lately, and Shu Yan had been sick and couldn\u2019t go back to pick up the kids. Since school was about to start in a couple of days, they didn\u2019t want the kids to miss the start of school. As such, can we trouble you to pick up the kids and bring them into town? I have a brother who has a car and can take them to the city.\u201d Shu Jianyang made up a very convincing story in no time flat.\u201cYe Zhiqiang was so busy with work that he can\u2019t even come to pick up his own kids? Hand him the phone, I need to have a talk with him. How could his business be more important than his kids?\u201d said Shu Jianbo, displeased.Shu Jianyang almost rolled his eyes. What went through his second brother\u2019s mind was never the same as what went through his. He was just about to say something when Shu Yan took the phone from him.\u201cHi, Second Brother. It\u2019s me, Shu Yan.\u201d Shu Yan waited for him to figure it out before she continued, \u201cYeah, there was some issue with some supplies on site, and Zhiqiang went over to the factory directly to negotiate. That was a few provinces out, and I couldn\u2019t really get a hold of him. If I have any other options, I wouldn\u2019t have thought to trouble Third Brother. I should be the one to go pick up the kids, but I was just really been sick these last couple of days. Second Brother,I don\u2019t want to ask my parents. You know how it was between my parents and Zhiqiang\u2019s parents. They fight each time they see each other\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, I will go pick them up in a bit.\u201d Shu Jianbo took a look at the time. It\u2019s 1:30 PM and there\u2019s one more bus leaving at 2:30 going into town. He should have enough time if he left soon and took his motorcycle.\u201cLook, Third Brother, I have been troubling you for all sorts of matters.\u201d Shu Yan felt bad about that.She couldn\u2019t count on the original owner\u2019s own parents or her brothers, but the cousin that she wasn\u2019t closed to ended up giving her so much help.\u201cWe\u2019re family. Don\u2019t say such a thing. Go and get some rest. Your kids will be here soon.\u201d Even though Shu Jianyang didn\u2019t own a lot of clubs, he still has a lot of matters to attend to on a day-to-day basis.It only took some 10 minutes of motorcycle ride from the Shu\u2019s village to the Ye\u2019s village. When Shu Jianbo arrived at Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s house, the two children were playing in the courtyard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Old Mrs. Ye wouldn\u2019t let them go over to the Shu\u2019s, so they didn\u2019t recognize this uncle of theirs.They might not know him, but old Mrs Ye did. She put down what she was working on and greeted him with passion.\u201cAunty, please don\u2019t trouble yourself. I came as a favor to someone else. Zhiqiang was too busy with his business, and my cousin has been sick the last couple of days. School is about to start in the next couple of days. and it so happened that I have a friend who has a car and is heading into the city. We thought we could trouble him to take the kids into the city.\u201d Shu Jianbo didn\u2019t take a seat. The bus stop was about 20 minutes from where they were. He worried that they\u2019d miss the last bus if they didn\u2019t hurry.\u201cNeither Zhiqiang nor his wife had told me about this. This is so sudden,\u201d mumbled old Mrs. Ye. She didn\u2019t care if the granddaughter left, but the grandson was like her lifeline. Even dinner didn\u2019t taste as good if she didn\u2019t see him for a day. Once he left, she wouldn\u2019t be able to see him till the end of the year.Old Mrs. Ye grumbled and packed up their stuff at the same time. Ye Jingjing didn\u2019t have a lot of clothes; everything of hers fit into one bag. Ye Tianbao, on the other hand, had much more \u2013 all sorts of clothes, shoes, toys, snacks. He had two full bags plus another denim backpack.\u201cShould we give Zhiqiang a call?\u201d Grandpa Ye was a little worried.Neither Zhiqiang nor his wife had said anything but suddenly sent Shu Jianbo over to pick the children up. Was everything okay?\u201cNever mind that. Round trip to make a call would take more than 10 minutes. They will miss the last bus. Plus, it\u2019s Principal Shu who came to pick up the children, what could go wrong with that?\u201d said Grandma Ye as she hugged her precious grandson. \u201cAiyo. Our Tianbo is going to go back to mom and dad\u2019s. Grandma doesn\u2019t want you to go!\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t go. I will stay and keep grandma company.\u201d Instead of his mom and dad, Ye Tianbao much prefer to stay with his grandma and grandpa who always let him have his way.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that. Our Tianbo is a city boy and will need to go to a kindergarten in the city so you can become the number one scholar in the future.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will become number one scholar for grandma.\u201d Ye Tianbao patted his own chest and made a promise to his grandmother.The two elders wanted to take the children to the bus stop, but after Shu Jianbo had loaded up all their bags, there were only room enough for the two children.\u201cIt\u2019s almost 2. Uncle, Aunty, I am going to take off now.\u201d***Ye Zhiqiang held his hand over his stomach. His entire body ached, but nobody could figure out what was wrong with him. He knew he had ran into professionals this time.\u201cQiang-ge, are you alright?\u201d Li Jiaojiao had her checkup as well. She felt a little discomfort around her stomach after the scare. She wanted to make sure her child was alright.\u201cI am fine. What about you?\u201d Ye Zhiqiang looked more relaxed when he looked at Li Jiaojiao.\u201cQiang-ge, I am so scared!\u201d Li Jiaojiao threw herself into his chest and so happened to bump into where it hurt the most. She quickly backed off after she heard his soft moaning nose. \u201cI thought you said you weren\u2019t hurt. Where was it that hurt? Let me see.\u201d Li Jiaojiao rubbed his chest and her heart ached for him, \u201cHow could she do that? Having so many people to beat you up.

It\u2019s fine. I will be fine in a couple of days.\u201dLi Jiaojiao pursed her lips and feeling worried, she asked, \u201cQiang-ge, what do we do now? We can\u2019t let them leak those pictures. Or we will be done for.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t let her have her ways,\u201daid Ye Zhiqiang viciously.She started this. Wanted to blackmail him with the photos? Don\u2019t even think about it. It\u2019s just photos. He could do the same to her.After Ye Zhiqiang had placated Li Jiaojiao, he took a few men with him and headed straight toward Shu Yan\u2019s house.\u201cQiang-ge, we have searched from 1st to 5th floor. There\u2019s nobody here.\u201dYe Zhiqiang grabbed a cup from the table, smashed it on the floor, and said through gritted teeth, \u201cShe must be over at Shu Jianyang\u2019s.\u201dJust as Shu Yan had thought, Ye Zhiqiang wasn\u2019t brave enough to try to go at her on Shu Jianyang\u2019s territory. But, of course, neither was he going to leave everything to her.She was just a woman. She cared about her children. Thinking of that saying, Ye Zhiqiang immediately called his parents.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cUncle, it\u2019s me. Zhiqiang. Nothing much, I just wanted to talk to my folks.\u201d Ye Zhiqiang thought it was about time to install a phone at his parents. This was way too inconvenient.About twenty minutes later, Ye Zhiqiang called back. This time, it was old Mr. Ye who picked up the phone.\u201cDad, it\u2019s me. Where are the kids?\u201d Ye Zhiqiang cut straight to the chase. He was in no mood to chitchat right now.\u201cThe kids? Didn\u2019t you send Shu Jianbo to come and pick them up?\u201d Old Mr. Ye\u2019s heart fell to the bottom. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know about this?\u201dYe Zhiqiang stood up abruptly and said, \u201cShu Jianbo picked up the kids?\u201dHe should have thought about this sooner. Shu Jianyang was never a pushover.\u201cYes, not too long ago. They should be on the last bus out now. What\u2019s the matter? You didn\u2019t send him?\u201d Old Mr. Ye was worried.\u201cI have been very busy these last few days and didn\u2019t know what was going on at home. I thought school was about to start soon so I was going to give you a call. Perhaps, Shu Yan had sent her cousin to pick them up. I\u2019ll call and ask her.\u201d He has not yet told his family about the divorce and now all the more he couldn\u2019t. Wasn\u2019t there enough happening already?\u201cOkay, then call and find out soon.\u201d Old Mr. Ye\u2019s eyelids had been twitching all day long today, and he couldn\u2019t shake this feeling that something was not right.\u201cI know. Shu Jianbo is a principal. There\u2019s nothing wrong with handing the kids over to him. Okay, I\u2019ll hang up now and call you again some other time.\u201d After he had hung up, he was clenching down so hard that he almost broke his teeth.Lingan Township was a 40-minute bus ride to town. The two children were not used to riding in buses, so they were fairly dispirited. By the time they had arrived, the man arranged by Shu Jianyang was already waiting there. He picked them up and took them all the way over to City Xi.\u201cYour kids are here,\u201d said Shu Jianyang as he knocked on Shu Yan\u2019s door.They were here already? Suddenly, Shu Yan felt a bit hesitant. Certainly, she had said that she had the long end of the stick earlier, but after all, she was a single woman who had just became an instant mother. There were certain pressures that came with that.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the original owner\u2019s responsibilities, and she had adopted her body, so now she had adopted the original owner\u2019s responsibilities.Neither one of the two children reacted much when they saw their mother. Ye Jingjing was intimidated and kept her head low, only looking up at Shu Yan from time to time with some longing and some fear. Her brother, next to her, was the exact opposite, and perfectly comfortable being in a brand-new environment. He didn\u2019t seem particularly happy seeing Shu Yan, nothing like the normal closeness or happiness when a child saw his mother.Between the two kids, the daughter stayed with the original owner, but the younger son was taken by his grandmother shortly after he was born. Other than the time when he was being breast-fed, he had very limited contact with the original owner, which explained why he wasn\u2019t close to his mother at all.Logic would dictate that as the original owner was raised in a family that valued boys more than girls and that she had been mistreated since she was a child and that her husband\u2019s family was displeased with her after she gave birth to a daughter, she would treat her daughter even better. And yet, the original owner also felt that the daughter was but a lost cause and all she needed was just enough to eat and stay warm. She\u2019d be marry off when she turned 17-18 and belonged to someone else.From victim to perpetrator, Shu Yan couldn\u2019t understand their mentality. They had already suffered under the idealism that boys are better than girls. Shouldn\u2019t they treat their daughters even better?One of the two children was neglected her entire life, so she was timid and has an inferiority complex. The other one was spoiled by his grandparents his whole life and was always given what he wanted. The way he talked could be very overbearing, almost as though he was a young emperor at home. Perhaps, picking up from his grandparents, he even seemed to have some negative emotions toward Shu Yan.This wasn\u2019t how a young child should behave toward his own mother. Never mind that Shu Yan never had her own children, but she still knew that these two children hadn\u2019t been raised correctly. Luckily, they were both still young and that could be fixed.Her own world had already entered into the age of information. One could learn everything from the comfort of one\u2019s own home. She might not have her own children, but she had read and seen enough to make her half a child-care \u201cexpert\u201d.She couldn\u2019t rush about their education. What\u2019s important right now was the matters with Ye Zhiqiang. He definitely wouldn\u2019t want to leave everything behind. The most pressing question right now was what was going to be his next move.Seeing Shu Yan back to the front of her room, Shu Jianyang left after a few more parting words. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day. Why don\u2019t you get some rest? I\u2019ll have someone bring dinner to your room and also send someone to keep an eye out on Ye Zhiqiang.\u201dGoing to his room, Ye Tianbao threw a fit. \u201cI want to go home! I want grandma and grandpa!\u201dShu Yan could understand Ye Tianbao throwing a fit being suddenly pulled away from a familiar environment and family members and thrusted into a strange environment, especially when the two of them were never that close.\u201cYou guys had been travelling most of the day and have started to smell. Go and take a bath.\u201d Especially Ye Jingjing. She was so dirty that her sweat left streaks down her cheeks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am not bathing! I want grandma and grandpa! I want grandma!\u201dShu Yan was stunned. This was the first time she saw a kid rolling on the ground throwing a hissy fit. What did the experts say about this? Oh right, ignore the child. The more attention you paid him, the worse he would get.She took his sister into the bathroom and let Ye Tianbao roll around outside all he wanted.Noticing that his mother had ignored him, Ye Tianbao started to cry. He cried louder and louder and finally that turned into tearless shrieks.\u201cMom, little brother is crying,\u201d said Ye Jingjing carefully.She was deadly afraid of her little brother crying. Every time he cried, grandma and grandpa would yell at her.\u201cDon\u2019t mind him. He\u2019ll stop on his own.\u201d When she was washing Ye Jingjing\u2019s hair, she noticed that they were dried and knotted and covered in little white dots. Shu Yan patted at them. They were not dandruffs. She has to pull them free through the entire strand of hair. Looking at them carefully, they were head lice eggs. \u201cWhen was the last time you had your hair washed?\u201dFrom her initial assessment, she has lice on almost every strand of her hair. Some of strands of hair having more than one. Shu Yan felt goosebumps on herself, and her scalp started to tingle. She could almost felt head lice crawling on her own head.\u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d said Ye Jingjing after thinking for a little while and shook her head.Well, okay. That didn\u2019t matter now. No matter what, she needed to clean the child\u2019s hair first. When she was washing her hair, she came across a few head lice and she grabbed and killed them. They made a crunchy sound when you did that. Then she bathed her with a simple wash, and a layer of mud came off. She must not have bathed for ten days to two weeks. This was the dead of summer. It must feel awful even not bathing for one day. One could tell how much the old Mr. and Mrs. Ye did not care about this granddaughter of theirs.Half way through the bath, Ye Tianbao had finally stopped crying outside. He must be tired. Shu Yan stuck her head out and took a look. Seeing Shu Yan\u2019s face, the sniffling Ye Tianbao resumed his shrieking all over again.Shu Yan pulled her head back right away. Ah, rookie\u2019s mistake. Never peek again in the future.\u201cLittle brother is crying again,\u201d said Ye Jingjing again as she looked at Shu Yan, worried.\u201cIgnore him. Sit here. Let me go get some clothes for you.\u201d She had to apply soap three times in order to get Ye Jingjing clean.Seeing Shu Yan, Ye Tianbao paused for a second and thought that Shu Yan was finally going to pay attention to him, only to find her walking around him to the chair behind him to look for clothes for his sister. Ye Tianbao plopped right back onto the ground and continued to roll around.This kid was at least somewhat smart. He knew to pick an empty spot to roll around. Shu Yan lifted her foot and kicked him gently, \u201cDon\u2019t just stay in the same spot. Go roll around over there to. That will save me the hassle of having to sweep over there.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What happened to his mom today? He burst into tears for real this time. He said as he cried, \u201cI want to go home! I want to tell grandma that\u2026. Mom was being mean to me.\u201dWow, so spoiled. That was being mean to you? Tere would be more being mean to you then.Exactly how terrible was the Ye\u2019s to Ye Jingjing? Ye Zhiqiang had made quite a bit of money and only had these two children. As much as they subscribed to the idealism that boys were better, this was ridiculous. Ye Jingjing had a total of three sets of clothes. One set was from last summer, and the other two were the cheapest one could find in the market.She searched her memories and she couldn\u2019t even blame this one onto old Mrs. Ye. The problem laid with the original owner.Ye Zhiqiang was quite generous with his money and has been giving $500 monthly to original owner. Back in \u201992, $500 was a lot of money. Many farmers barely made that much in an entire year. And yet, the original owner was so frugal and saved every penny that she could so she could give them to her own family.The more she learned about the original owner, the less Shu Yan felt bad for her. As the saying goes, everything happens for a reason.She picked a set of clothes for Ye Jingjing and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s head out.\u201dShu Yan quite liked daughters. She had always thought about how she\u2019d dress her daughter up when she has one. Well, that dream had sort of came true. Once she finalized her divorce, she would take Ye Jingjing and buy her all sorts of pretty clothes.This time when she walked outside, Ye Tianbao finally stopped crying. Children were really smart. The more attention you paid them, the more they knew you care. If you didn\u2019t pay them a lot of attention, they\u2019d know that fussing was moot and wouldn\u2019t that again the next time.\u201cGet up,\u201d said Shu Yan as she kicked him on his foot.\u201cNo!\u201d Pouted Ye Tianbao, still throwing a fit.Shu Yan didn\u2019t bother reasoning with him. She just picked him up and walked inside the bathroom.Ye Tianbao kicked his feet frantically. He was strong, and Shu Yan almost couldn\u2019t subdue him. She walked inside the bathroom in a few steps, quickly placed the eel-like Ye Tianbao onto the floor, turned on the shower head and sprayed on him.\u201cLook how dirty you are. Others would laugh at you if you go out like this.\u201d Shu Yan cleaned him up with a few, swift moves, just the same way she used to help her mother bath their puppy.Once she was done, she carried the butt-naked Ye Tianbao outside and tossed him onto the bed. She told Ye Jingjing to watch over him when she returned for a quick shower herself.\u201cMom, someone\u2019s knocking on the door,\u201d said Ye Jingjing outside the bathroom door in a low voice.Shu Yan had told her not to open the door if someone came knocking but to come and get her.Shu Yan acknowledged her, put her clothes on, and asked from behind the door, \u201cWho is it?\u201dShe looked through the peephole but could only see the clothes, and they were a blur no less.\u201cI am a server with the hotel. Downstairs complained about water leaking. I came to check it out.\u201dThe voice was unfamiliar, and Shu Yan was alarmed right away, \u201cWe didn\u2019t even use the bathroom earlier. Why would there be any leaking?\u201d said Shu Yan purposefully.\u201cBut the guests downstairs said there was some leaking. I just want to come in and take a look. It won\u2019t take too long,\u201d explained the server patiently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why don\u2019t you come back in a little?\u201d\u201cBut the guest downstairs is waiting. Can you please do us a favor? I just work here. If the guest downstairs complain, my pay this month would be docked,\u201d said the server pitifully.\u201cThen put him into a different room and charge that to me.\u201d That was too much of a coincidence. One couldn\u2019t be too careful. Shu Yan would rather spend some more money.After a little while, Shu Yan didn\u2019t hear anything else. She did not open the door and check. She had seen it enough times in TV shows and movies that curiosity never lead to any good outcomes. She was timid; she would forego her curiosity.Some 10 minutes later, she heard Xiao Fei\u2019s voice, \u201cWho are you and why are you standing there? Stay right there, you\u2026.\u201dShu Yan felt her scalp tingled. Her heart beating frantically. There was something going on.\u201cMom?\u201d said Ye Jingjing as she grabbed onto Shu Yan\u2019s hand and turning pale. She was scared.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Mom is alright.\u201d Shu Yan tried to calm herself down. She was nervous all over again when she heard knocking again.\u201cYan-je. It\u2019s Xiao Fei. Third Brother sent me to bring over dinner.\u201dShu Yan looked through the peephole again. She could see the person this time. Confirming that it was, indeed, Xiao Fei, she finally opened the door.\u201cWas someone waiting outside my door earlier?\u201d asked Shu Yan as she stuck her head out. There was nobody there.\u201cI let that little fart get away.\u201d Even Xiao Fei couldn\u2019t believe that someone dared to make a move on Third Brother\u2019s territory. \u201cI had Ah Biao deliver the message to Third Brother already. I will be staying here. You have nothing to worry about.\u201dShu Yan nodded in fear. Distracted, they finished dinner. The two children were tired from travelling all day and felt asleep shortly. Shu Yan pulled the blankets over them before heading over to the room across the hall with Xiao Fei to meet up with Shu Jianyang.\u201cXiao Fei had already briefed me with what happened. It seems Ye Zhiqiang was making his moves. Forget about the three days. Let\u2019s go look for him tomorrow. We need to wrap this up quickly. The longer this drags on, the worse it is going to get.\u201d Shu Jianyang squinted his eyes. It didn\u2019t seem that Ye Zhiqiang had done his research. How dare he tried pulling anything on his territory.On the other hand, Ye Zhiqiang found out that not only did his men fail to capture Shu Yan, they had alerted them. He looked even worse than before.\u201cHei-ge didn\u2019t answer his call?\u201d In the construction world, they would inevitably come into contact with certain local powers and Hei-ge was one of them. They have had plenty of wining and dining together.His man shook his head. They had called over ten times but still no answer.\u201cSh*t. And they said we were brothers. Just a small thing and they disappear on you.\u201d Right after Ye Zhiqiang finished saying that, his phone rang. He beamed and picked up his phone immediately.\u201cYe Zhiqiang, I changed my mind. Three days is too long. We will meet tomorrow morning at 9 AM. Come to the tea shop next to Huayue Men. If you don\u2019t show up tomorrow, I will see you in court.\u201d Shu Yan slammed the phone down she was done. She didn\u2019t have time for this sh*t.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Zhiqiang arrived at the tea house on time, bringing only two men with him. On Shu Yan\u2019s side, she had with her Shu Jianyang and also two others.The purpose of today was to negotiate, not to fight.\u201cYanyan. We are, after all, a married couple. And we have two children together. Is this really necessary?\u201d Ye Zhiqiang said as he looked at the divorce papers that Shu Yan had drafted up, leaving him with absolutely nothing.\u201cYe Zhiqiang, you want to talk about being a married couple? Why didn\u2019t you mention that when you were forcing me to have a divorce? And didn\u2019t you send someone after me yesterday? If I wasn\u2019t cautious enough, would I be sitting here right now? What leg do you have to stand on to say such a thing?\u201d Shu Yan let out a sigh. She was so angry at him. \u201cAlright. We all knew what is going on here. You can stop pretending now. Stop with the bullsh*t and just say whether you agree to my terms or not. If you\u2019re good with it, sign the papers and we are divorced. If not, I will see you in court and we will let the country decide.\u201dThis was the early 90s and a person\u2019s personal behavior was very important in the society. Shu Yan had all the evidence that she needed. If they were to go to court, she would definitely win the case.\u201cYou sure you want to go to court? If we go to court, all the photos will become evidence for everybody in court and the jury to see. There\u2019s no embarrassing photos of me so I don\u2019t really care one way or another,\u201d Shu Yan said nonchalantly.\u201cShu Yan,\u201d Ye Zhiqiang said through gritted teeth. He couldn\u2019t figure out how the woman who was dumb like a pig just a few days ago would turn into someone so sharp.\u201cI\u2019m not deaf,\u201d Shu Yan said as she scanned over him, beginning to lose her patience.Ye Zhiqiang took a deep breath, suppressing his anger, and said, \u201cJust think about it, I am still the father of our two children. When I said I wanted a divorce, I never said I\u2019d leave you penniless, right? This is a little extreme, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to be extreme, but you guys had gone too far.\u201d Shu Yan sat up straight and stared squarely at Ye Zhiqiang.From her memories, Ye Zhiqiang started being abusive to the original owner about 6 months ago and wanted to get her to leave on her own accord. When that failed, he started picking on her and beating her. She was beaten six times in two months\u2019 time. During that time, Li Jiaojiao would also go to their place periodically and say all sorts of things to insult the original owner and walk all over her. The original owner only committed suicide because she had no other options left.No matter what kind of a person the original owner was, she was pushed to her death by the two of them. A life, just like that, was gone. No, Shu Yan did not feel that she was being extreme.Neither one of them would budge, so the conversation could not go on. Ye Zhiqiang left in a huff. He would not be left penniless. Even if they were to go to court, that would take time. That would buy him time to figure something out.He wanted to drag this out, but Shu Yan didn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t keep on living in fear. Even if she could handle it, it wouldn\u2019t be fair for the two children.\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d Shu Jianyang asked. \u201cI can have someone jump him. He\u2019d be much more amenable after we\u2019ve broke an arm and a leg.\u201dShu Yan wasn\u2019t sure what to say to that. Her cousin might look tall and handsome, and even seem very gentlemanly and refined when he was just sitting there quietly, but deep down under, he was still a ruthless man. He didn\u2019t get to where he is today by being nice.\u201cThird Brother, there are laws in the society. That\u2019s kidnapping, blackmailing, and assault. If he takes it to court, we will be the side in the wrong.\u201dBeing a gangster was not mainstream after all. Shu Jianyang had gave it his all in assisting her, Shu Yan, on the other hand, would also like to be able to help him out in some ways.\u201cThen what are you suggesting?\u201d After the last few days of being with her, Shu Jianyang no longer looked at her as an ignorant village woman. Instead, he truly looked at her as a peer of his.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did they think she had forgotten about her? She just hasn\u2019t got around to her was all. She thought perhaps if Ye Zhiqiang would cooperate, then they would wait on it. But now that Ye Zhiqiang wasn\u2019t willing to cooperate, then Shu Yan would just have to do what she needed to do.As the female lead\u2019s mother, there was a long and detailed background on Li Jiaojiao in the book.Back in \u201892, college graduates would be assigned a job upon graduation. Li Jiaojiao attended a middle-of-the-road college but was still able to secure a position \u2013 as a finance personnel at a wine factory. In the book, Li Jiaojiao had very good eyes and had them set on the uncultured Ye Zhiqiang from the very beginning. After they got married, she used her wit to get into a government unit. With her good handwriting and writing skills, she was able to become the secretary of some higher up officials. By the time the female lead appeared in the book, Li Jiaojiao was already the head of Education Department. Ye Zhiqiang, meanwhile, also expanded his work tremendously and became one of the largest construction companies in City Xi. The female lead was born with the silver spoon, as the saying goes.Most readers got the impression that Ye Zhiqiang left his ex-wife first before he got together with Li Jiaojiao. After all, back in those days there were no such thing as a marriage certificate in the villages. All Ye Zhiqiang had to say was \u201cwe were young and didn\u2019t know any better\u201d and that was that.Looking back at traditional marriages from the perspective of 2019, they felt very informal. A marriage was not really a marriage without a marriage certificate. That being said, many also didn\u2019t think divorce was a big deal either. Plus, the book cleared stated that Ye Zhiqiang gave his ex-wife a house and all the savings they had in the house.Shu Yan only noticed all the details after she had transmigrated as the original owner. Or perhaps, it was because she was now looking at the entire incident from a whole different perspective. Had she transmigrated and become Li Jiaojiao? Shu Yan shuddered and didn\u2019t want to keep on thinking about that hypothetical.It didn\u2019t matter. She transmigrated as Shu Yan, the old wife who was about to be dumped by a heartless scum of man.All things considered, taking care of Li Jiaojiao was a much easier task. Considering that she didn\u2019t want to completely ruin things with Ye Zhiqiang just yet, Shu Yan only picked pictures that only had Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s back or side profile. She made three copies of the photos \u2013 one set for Li Jiaojiao\u2019s school, one for the factory that she worked at, and one back to her old home. She did not elect to use the post office. Everything was delivered by hand.They were posted on the bulletin board at school, the announcement board at the factory, and Xiao Fei, the one who took the pictures to the village, did not post the pictures on the wall but gave a stack directly to a woman in the village and asked her to pass them onto Li Jiaojiao\u2019s parents.\u201cHoly mother of God!\u201d the woman shrieked when she looked at the pictures. Her voice attracted many who gathered around her, all of them got very excited when they saw the pictures.Entertainment was rare back in those days. When the villagers had free time, they\u2019d always gathered around and gossip. Any man and woman that walked slightly closer to each other would be rumored that they were having a fling. Once the rumors spread, they sounded as though they were real.Now, there were pictures right in front of them. These were solid evidence. They might as well have witnessed the actual event themselves!\u201cIsn\u2019t that this college student from the village? Her mom always brags about how amazing she is. She\u2019s amazing, alright.\u201d A woman poked her head over and said, \u201cAunt Guihua, don\u2019t just horde them all. There\u2019s a whole stack, hand some over to me already!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We want to see how a college student is different from the rest of us,\u201d an innocent-looking young boy said.The normally stuck-up college student did what now? They may not be able to have her, but they could at least look!Xiao Fei snuck away while the group was happily looking at the pictures. He still has to head to the neighboring village. Yan-jie said to distribute them to all villages within a 10-mile radius.Within an hour, everybody knew that the Li\u2019s college-graduated daughter was no good. She slept with someone else\u2019s husband in the city, got caught red-handed by the wife, and these pictures were even sent back to her hometown.Li Jiaojiao\u2019s grandma passed out when she saw the pictures. Her uncle and aunt were so angry their bodies shook. They both have daughters. With a niece like this, their daughters\u2019 reputation would be ruined too. Especially Li Jiaojiao\u2019s Big Aunt, they were in the process of arranging a marriage for her daughter. She wasn\u2019t sure if that would still happen now that this had happened.When Li Jiaojiao\u2019s parents returned from the mountain, they just felt that everybody was looking and pointing at them. They were a little baffled. Everybody had always been friendly with them as they have a college student in their family. Now, they looked like they wanted nothing to do with them at all.When they arrived at their front door, they just saw a sea of people blocking the entrance. Their hearts sank. What had happened at home?Looking at the photos, Mother Li passed out immediately. After much hustle-and-bustle, she woke up, but sat on the ground, smacked her own thighs, and bawled, \u201cHow am I going to live? How am I going to live\u2026.\u201dFather Li sat to one side, smoking. He wasn\u2019t crying, but looked much more upset than Mother LI.While all these were going on at the Li\u2019s, Li Jiaojiao wasn\u2019t having it any better either. She just walked into the factory and found everybody pointing and gossiping at her. All her colleagues that she used to hang out with was avoiding her like she was a leper. Wang-jie, who had always been nice to her, looked at her with grave disappointment.\u201cWang-jie, what happened?\u201d Li Jiaojiao\u2019s heart was pounding. She felt that something terrible was about to happen.\u201cJiaojiao, you? Aye!\u201d Wang-jie\u2019s face was beet red but was too embarrassed to bring up the subject.\u201cLi Jiaojiao, the director wanted to speak to you.\u201d Another girl, who had started here at the same as Li Jiaojiao, said. There had always been a tension between the two of them. As soon as she saw the pictures this morning, she snuck some of them to the factory director right away.Seeing the pictures, Li Jiaojiao felt that all her blood had frozen, and she collapsed onto the floor.\u201cAs you can see, we can\u2019t possibly keep you after something like this had happened,\u201d the factory director said meaningfully. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to college. It wasn\u2019t easy for your family to put your through school. And you turned around and did something like this? You should go home and do some self-reflection.\u201dLi Jiaojiao\u2019s whole body was icy cold. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s all over. Her reputation ruined. Her job gone.When Ye Zhiqiang came back from his work site and saw Li Jiaojiao sitting there listlessly, he asked, concerned, \u201cWhat is going on? Are you feeling alright?\u201d\u201cQiang-ge, my job is gone.\u201d Li Jiaojiao moved her head slightly and looked at Ye Zhiqiang like a drowning woman looking at straw.\u201cSo what if you\u2019ve lost your job? Are you worried that I can\u2019t feed you?\u201d Ye Zhiqiang asked, unconcerned.That $300 a month wasn\u2019t even enough for her to buy herself a dress. She might as well just stay home and give him a light-colored, chubby, and smart son.Li Jiaojiao covered up her face and cried, \u201cOur pictures were leaked, and everybody at the factory had seem them. My school too. What am I going to do? I want to die!\u201dYe Zhiqiang stood up abruptly. His eyes were blood-shot, and he said, \u201cI need to have a talk with her.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though they were cousins, they were both adults. It\u2019d be awkward to live together. He was just a single man and could stay anywhere.Ye Zhiqiang did not find her at the hotel and spent a long time looking for Shu Jianyang. As he was looking for him, he started to cool down.\u201cWhere\u2019s Shu Yan?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to talk to her about?\u201d Shu Jianyang asked as he lifted his brows.\u201cWhat was that with the pictures.\u201d Shu Yan would never had been able to accomplish all those without Shu Jianyang\u2019s help.A stack of photos was tossed in front of Ye Zhiqiang, \u201cThat was just making an example out of her. Next time it would be you.\u201dYe Zhiqiang let out a sigh of relief when he saw that he could not be identified in any of the pictures. But then, his anger rose up again.\u201cWhat does Shu Yan want?\u201d\u201cSimple. Get a divorce and for you walk away penniless,\u201d Shu Jianyang said as he leaned back and propped his feet up. He rocked his feet as he casually said, \u201cIf I were you, I\u2019ll accept her terms. You know the saying, you can always make more money? With your ability, you will be back to where you are now in 3-5 years\u2019 time. It\u2019s fine if you want to stall, but how long can Jiaojiao wait?\u201dShu Jianyang was just saying this, but he could tell Ye Zhiqiang was seriously considering his suggestion. Was this really true love?\u201cWhere is Shu Yan? She needs to be here for this.\u201d Ye Zhiqiang didn\u2019t trust Shu Jianyang.The three of them met again at the tea shop. Shu Yan looked at Ye Zhiqiang and thought to herself that this was, indeed, the world of a novel after all. How else would a scum like him be willing to give up everything for true love?\u201cAll the money in the house, the house itself, and the car will all go to you. I\u2019ll cash out my company. That will leave me more or less penniless.\u201d When Shu Yan obtained all the evidence earlier, Ye Zhiqiang had looked into all sorts of ways. He couldn\u2019t transfer his assets. He had consulted with a lawyer; that would be illegal for him to do so. He couldn\u2019t ask Shu Yan\u2019s family to interfere either.There was a difference between the son-in-law being rich versus the daughter being rich. If the Shu\u2019s knew that they could have all his assets after the divorce, they\u2019d only tell Shu Yan to get one faster.He truly didn\u2019t have a lot of cash on him; all of them were tied up in his jobs. The only things of value were the few houses and the cars. He needed his company; that\u2019s his livelihood. He could borrow money or take out a loan and pay cash to Shu Yan. Once he finished his two ongoing projects, he would have made the money back already.Shu Yan weighed her options quickly. The ball was only in her court because 1) she blind-sided Ye Zhiqiang and caught him off guard and 2) she had the backing of Shu Jianyang. He may be able to help her once or twice, but she couldn\u2019t keep on bugging him indefinitely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s suggestion wasn\u2019t entirely unacceptable.\u201cThird Brother, do you think you will be able to locate someone from the assessment company?\u201d Meaning that she had already more or less accepted Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s suggestion.There were a total of four houses. With the exception of the one that the original owner was staying in, the other three were located in the busy area at the center of town. One of them could be used as a storefront. Shu Yan took a look at the address, Ye Zhiqiang had good eyes. The location of the shopfront and house combo would become the busiest pedestrian street in the future. The rent alone for the two floors would be in the tens of thousands.The other two would be taken down; whether the compensation would be in money or house form, they would both work out pretty well. The car was worth around $200,000. All of these combined came out to be around $1 million. His company started just the year before last, and there was only $100,000 in the books with most of the money tied up in his projects. Once he completed the two projects, there would be another $3 million. All in all, the net worth of the company was $1.5 million and Ye Zhiqiang would be paying her in cash.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Shu Yan suddenly remembered the other house that Ye Zhiqiang had bought for his affair. \u201cAccording to the letter of the law, everything after we have been married is joint properties, right? Do I have the rights to the house that he bought for his affair too?\u201dYe Zhiqiang\u2019s face dropped when he heard that, \u201cShu Yan, don\u2019t push it.\u201d\u201cAm I? Those was our joint property that you used to support your affair. You want to tell me to not push it?\u201d The agreement was he was going to leave penniless. He\u2019d better be penniless.Ye Zhiqiang took a deep breath. That house wasn\u2019t that expensive, but they had, however, put a lot of thought into the remodeling. Oh, whatever. They could always buy another one in the future.\u201cFine,\u201d Ye Zhiqiang said through gritted teeth. \u201cCan I pay you the cash for the company in installments? $1.5 million is a lot of money. I don\u2019t have that much cash with me.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Shu Yan replied right away. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201dShe needed to get the money and leave this town as soon as possible. The longer she stayed, the worse it was for her.Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s face darkened even more. He gripped his fists and said, \u201cI could only get $300,000 in cash. You won\u2019t need that much cash for the three of you for the time being. Just think of it as a loan to me, I\u2019ll pay you 2% interest.\u201dShu Yan just shook her head, \u201cI don\u2019t care how you are going to do it, but this money better be in my account within 3 days. In addition, anything happened to me and my kids within the next three days, I will assume you are the culprit. I won\u2019t promise what I wouldn\u2019t do if that happens.\u201dNo kidding. She would never see a penny of that money if she agreed to his terms.

Shu Jianyang had someone he was familiar with to help out and everything went smoothly. The entire process took a little over one hour. When Ye Zhiqiang walked away, Shu Yan had an extra $300,000 in her account.Shu Yan was very glad that she was in the 90s. If this was 2019, she would never be able to get Ye Zhiqiang to walk out penniless. If he has thicker skin, she wouldn\u2019t even be able to threaten him.When Li Jiaojiao saw Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s dark look, she was a little intimidated and asked in a soft voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, hubby?\u201d\u201cNothing much.

Shu Yan let out a sigh of relief. This was her first victory since her transmigration.On their way back, Shu Yan handed over the car and the car key. She had directly put it under his name when they were transferring the title the day before. He just needed to finish up the paperwork.\u201cWhat do you do that for?\u201d\u201cThird Brother, let me finish before you decline, okay? I trust that you have an idea what kind of person Ye Zhiqiang is. I am sure he will look for revenge after this incident. And you know how my family is as well. Once they found out that there\u2019s money on me, they\u2019d never leave me alone. My plan is to sell all the properties, move to a new city, and start over with my children. I can\u2019t drive and it\u2019s a waste to let it go to waste. Third Brother can be nice and drive it for me from time to time so it won\u2019t rust.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for Shu Jianyang\u2019s help, she wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything from Ye Zhiqiang.\u201cWhat are you talking about? This car is in great condition and it\u2019s worth at least ten of thousands. This is too expensive of a gift. I can\u2019t accept it.\u201d\u201cIt belonged to Ye Zhiqiang. What\u2019s the problem with taking it?\u201d Shu Yan shoved the key into his hand and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.Losing that battle with Shu Yan, Shu Jianyang finally accepted the car.Truth be told, Shu Yan liked the houses a lot. All she needed to do was to leave them there and their value would grow exponentially in the next few years, way better than any investments that she could get into. Unfortunately, she got these from Ye Zhiqiang, there were too many strings attached.She must sever all ties with him, so it\u2019s best to sell them all. Honestly, all house prices were really low in the country right now. Once she settled down in a new city, she could randomly buy some houses and they\u2019d still go up in value steadily in the next 10 to 20 years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Zhiqiang has got good eyes. All of these were centrally located. Especially shop-front-house, I have no idea how he came across it. I heard words that this area would be turned into a pedestrian street. It\u2019s only now that you can buy this if you have money.If I wasn\u2019t trying to avoid further hassle with Ye Zhiqiang, I\u2019d never sell this. I know Third Brother is nice to me, so I need to give you some genuine advice as well. Don\u2019t stay in your current business for too long. Who knows when the government is going to crack down again. Just look at Ye Zhiqiang; he has never been to school either and now he\u2019s a business owner. You can only do better than him, Third Brother. And you have all your men under you. If you go into the construction business, you have both the resources and manpower, it wouldn\u2019t take much to be successful.\u201dThey said back in the 90s, there were gold on the ground for everyone to pick up. Shu Jianyang was a smart man. If he decided to go straight, he just might be even more successful than Ye Zhiqiang in the future.Shu Jianyang felt very tempted after hearing Shu Yan\u2019s words. As he got older, he started to think about getting married and having kids. Once he had that idea, he started to want to settle down. Unfortunately, his trade was very dangerous. One never knew when one would die; how do one get married and have kids? Just like his cousin said, he\u2019s smart, he has money and resources, why couldn\u2019t he go into construction like Ye Zhiqiang?Or, he could be even bolder and just buy land and build the houses himself.Shu Yan had no idea yet exactly how bold her cousin was.\u201cLet me think about it. House? My dad wanted me to go home and build a house there,\u201d Shu Jianyang said, troubled.If he wanted to start his own business, he must allocate some money toward that. That would leave him with money only enough for one of the houses. And if he needed to build a house back home, then he wouldn\u2019t even have enough for that.\u201cYou only go back for a few days every year around new year time, what was the point of building a house there? Of course it makes more sense to buy one in the city. It\u2019s not easy to buy a house in the city that\u2019s nicely located, but you can build a house back home any time.\u201d Shu Yan knew that the older generation always had the idea to return to one\u2019s root. There was no concept to invest in real estate back in these days.Shu Jianyang was a fearless person; otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be so successful today. He felt that Shu Yan\u2019s suggestion was feasible so he decided to follow through with it. He immediately registered for a company and started it right on the second floor of that shop-front-house.He listened to Shu Yan\u2019s suggestion and bought the house from her. It cost $300,000, and he paid for it without even blinking an eye.It looked like her cousin had made quite a few bucks the last few years, being able to whip out $300,000 just like that. No wonder so many people joined the gang; surely it was a quick way to riches.Shu Jianyang\u2019s brothers bought two more of the remaining four houses. They couldn\u2019t resist after Shu Jianyang gloated to them about his purchase. Twenty years from now, they would get together, think about this day and be happy about their decisiveness today.All Shu Yan has left now was to sell the house that original owner was staying in plus the one that belonged to Li Jiaojiao, then she\u2019d be able to take the money, leave City Xi with her children, and start afresh in a city where nobody knew them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan, don\u2019t let that cousin of yours and your family take you for all you have got,\u201d said Ye Zhiqiang as he wrote his name down. Everything suddenly felt wrong.He had worked so hard for all these and, all of a sudden, they were all going to his ex-wife. Not to mention the way that she was taking them from him, and that Jiaojiao\u2019s reputation was ruined.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that.\u201d With the divorce decree in hand, Shu Yan let out a big sigh of relief. She handed over a paper bag to him and said, \u201cHere\u2019s the rest of the pictures and the negatives. We will be strangers from this point forward.\u201dWalking out of the government building and seeing Shu Jianyang driving his car, Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s mouth twitched again. He hrmped, turned, and walked away.\u201cDad!\u201d Ye Tianbao stuck his head out from the car and called out to him.Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s body shuddered, but he didn\u2019t turn around.\u201cDad!!\u201d shouted Ye Tianbao again, but still, his father did not turn around.Little kids didn\u2019t know any better. They gleaned what they could from what adults told them. Old Mrs. Ye had always told the kids how hard their father worked outside to make money to support them, and how nice he was to them. So even though the two children didn\u2019t see Ye Zhiqiang very often, they still very much looked up to him.Ye Tianbao bawled. Seeing that, Shu Yan wrapped her arms around him and patted him on his shoulder. Lately, Ye Tianbao had been throwing a lot of fits, and she had always ignored him. But today was different. As awful a person as Ye Zhiqiang was, in the eyes of the children, he was still their father. Not to mention Ye Tianbao\u2019s young age. He wouldn\u2019t know any better.\u201cMommy will take care of you and your sister from now on.\u201dYe Jingjing held onto Shu Yan\u2019s clothes cautiously. Her brother was still young and didn\u2019t know better. She, on the other hand, understood a lot of it. Her father no longer wished to be with their mother, just like the father of the Dai Niu, another girl from the village, who no longer wished to be with her mother and found Dainu a new mother.Shu Yan found out that night from Shu Jianyang that part of the money that Ye Zhiqiang had given her was from loans with outrageous interest rate. So, he was drowning in debt right now.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about him. As long as he doesn\u2019t do anything crazy and finish up his two projects on hand, he will be able to pay off all his debts as soon as he got paid,\u201d said Shu Jianyang, thinking that Shu Yan was feeling bad for him. After all, they had been married for years and had two kids together.To his surprise, Shu Yan shook her head and said extremely unhappily, \u201cI didn\u2019t think he would still be able to get out of this situation.\u201dShu Jianyang, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you have in mind then?\u201d Shu Jianyang felt that he still didn\u2019t know Shu Yan as well as he thought he did.\u201cThird Brother, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to open up your own construction company? Why don\u2019t you try to take away Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s jobs while you have the chance?\u201d The more Shu Yan thought about it, the more she thought her idea would work. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any working capital right now. Any little issues that arise, he\u2019d be stuck. Just take his manpower for example. Don\u2019t you want them?\u201dThat was tempting to Shu Jianyang. These last couple of days he realized that workers were difficult to find. Good foremen were difficult to find. He has the stage ready, but no actors. How was he to put up a show then?\u201cJust like you\u2019ve said. Both of his projects are quite lucrative. If you can take it over, it\u2019s a sure win.\u201d Shu Yan still felt that it was a great opportunity for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If his cousin was this smart this entire time, would Ye Zhiqiang had asked for a divorce? Or was she just faking it all these years while she waited for him to have an affair so she could gather evidence and sweep him out the door?Not knowing what Shu Jianyang was thinking about, Shu Yan inquired about the situation with the remaining two houses.\u201cBoth of them are located in very nice areas and you are not asking for a ridiculous price. There has been a lot of inquiries, so I trust that they would be sold shortly.\u201d Shu Jianyang didn\u2019t think that Shu Yan should sell all of her houses, \u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to keep one for yourself? What if\u2026 at least you and the kids will have a place to stay when you come back here.\u201dHe didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but Shu Yan understood what his worries were. A woman, going to a completely new place with two children. Better safe than sorry; having a house was a good safety net.\u201cOr you don\u2019t need to go at all. Third Brother might not be very capable, but I can at least protect the three of you.\u201d She was a woman with two children and a lot of money. If anything happened to her in a foreign place, there wouldn\u2019t even be anyone who could help her. At least he\u2019d be close to her in City Xi.Shu Yan smiled appreciatively and said, \u201cMostly, I want to start over somewhere where nobody knows me. I have too many bad memories in City Xi.\u201dThere was no way she could stay in City Xi. Nothing would remain a secret forever. It wouldn\u2019t be long before the original owner\u2019s parents found out about her divorce and that she had a lot of money with her. They would be coming daily to hassle her. Worse, they would come with Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s parents. How could her life go on like that?Shu Jianyang didn\u2019t say anymore. After the last few days, he noticed that his quiet cousin had a lot of ideas of her own and had been planning on leaving City Xi for a while now.There was some luck involved in selling houses. It could sell the next day, or it could take up to 1-2 years. Shu Yan decided that if her houses didn\u2019t sell in a week, she\u2019d ask for Shu Jianyang\u2019s help and leave with her two children.After she had fed her children and put them to bed, she started doing some calculations. She had the $10,000 that was in the house to begin with. Shu Jianyang bought the store-front-house which was a little pricier at $300,000; his two brothers bought two houses for $150,000 each, totaling $610,000. She received $1.5 million from Ye Zhiqiang, making it $2.1 million. The remaining two houses could probably fetch $200,000 ~ $300,000. All said and done, she has about $2.4 million in cash.$2 million back in the 90s was more than $20 million in the future. Even in 2019, not very many families have $2 million in cash.She kept her bank deposit book, household register, and ID close to her. Speaking of household register, a city household register was of high demand back in the 90s. Many tried everything they could in order to get one. As soon as Ye Zhiqiang had made some money, he registered the entire family in the city. When they divorced, Shu Jianyang pulled some strings and moved her household register out and added her two children under her using her old address. Once the house was sold, Shu Yan would convert the register to a virtual one until she settled down and bought a house elsewhere, and she\u2019d move her household register to the new location.***The night passed without dreams. Shu Yan stretched when she woke up. The two kids were still asleep. There were still tears in the corners of Ye Tianbao\u2019s eyes. Shu Yan was a little shock when she saw that. She didn\u2019t hear him crying last night; did he cry silently? She could see Ye Jingjing doing that, but Ye Tianbao? Normally, he\u2019d howl even without tears. She figured it had something to do with what happened yesterday.Shu Yan pulled his blanket back over him and sighed to herself. It hurt the children a lot when the parents split up; well, not much she could do when they have a father like Ye Zhiqiang!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course it\u2019s better for her to be with her mother rather than the father she had only seen less than two times a year. She had seen what it was like for Dai Niu in the village; she had never had a full meal since she gained a stepmother. And she got beaten on a regular basis. At least, she wouldn\u2019t starve or be beaten being with her mother. She might be young, but she was perceptive.\u201cMom\u2026\u201d said Ye Jingjing softly.\u201cYou awake?\u201dYe Jingjing could dress herself since a very early age, and she could also help her little brother get dressed and get ready, like a little adult. It made one\u2019s heart ache seeing her doing all those things at such a young age.Original translation is from fuyuneko dot org. If you\u2019re reading this elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.After she had gotten ready, Shu Yan changed out of her pajamas. She pinched herself around her waist. Her clothes seemed roomier now. Had she lost some weight?She examined herself carefully in the mirror. Yep, looked like she had lost some weight, but still quite overweight overall. Once they have settled down at their new place, she needed to lose weight fast.\u201cGood morning, Yan-jie,\u201d Xiao Fei brought over breakfast for Shu Yan while he was delivering Shu Jianyang\u2019s breakfast.\u201cThank you,\u201d said Shu Yan as she handed money over to Xiao Fei.\u201cThat\u2019s too much,\u201d resigned Xiao Fei. Third Brother\u2019s cousin was too generous.\u201cThe extra are for you to get some beverage.\u201d Sure, it was on the way for him, but it was still a nice gesture on his part. Others might not care too much, but she wouldn\u2019t take it for granted.She needed to show her house to some potential buyers in the afternoon, so she had Shu Jianyang help her babysit while she went over to her old house with her keys. Before she could see the potential buyers, she ran into the original owner\u2019s family.Shu Yan\u2019s first thought was that Ye Zhiqiang had notified them. But, she immediately put away that line of thinking. Had Ye Zhiqiang wanted to get her family involved, he\u2019d have done that a long time ago. He wouldn\u2019t have waited till now.The leader of the two unwanted guests was the original owner\u2019s mother, Lin Zixiang. She was followed by the youngest son, Shu Jianxiang. Just like any normal family \u2014 the oldest son was to prop up the family; the youngest one was the most loved one; the one in the middle was the most awkward one. Just use this matter of going to the city as an example, when the original owner\u2019s father comes, he\u2019d bring Shu Jianfei, their oldest son while Lin Zixiang would bring the youngest son. And, they\u2019d never leave before they get a large sum of money from Shu Yan.\u201cYou had a fight with Zhiqiang?\u201d asked Lin Zixiang bluntly.Shu Yan did not answer her question but brought them inside the house. She didn\u2019t want to give the neighbors materials to gossip about.Once they got inside the house, Lin Zixiang nudged Shu Yan a little unhappily and said, \u201cI\u2019m talking to you. Did you hear what I said?\u201dShu Yan thought; I\u2019ll put up with her for now.\u201cAll couples have fights from time to time.\u201d The potential buyers would be here any minute. She needed to send them away as soon as possible.She had no intention of letting them know about the divorce; they didn\u2019t need to know. She\u2019d be taking off with the kids, and they\u2019d have no way of finding them ever again.\u201cIs that really it? Listen, old Ye\u2019s came to our house asking for their grandson. They said you sent Jianbo to take their grandson from them. What was that all about?\u201d Speaking of that, Lin Zixiang was livid. \u201cDo you not have parents or siblings? Why would you go to your cousin for help? Your big aunt was gloating about it and I was so embarrassed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she found out that Shu Yan went to ask for Shu Jianyang, her son, for help, she gloated in front of Lin Zixiang\u2019s family for quite a bit. She hinted that their married daughter would ask her son for help because of her own three brothers\u2019 incompetency.That had made both Shu Youfu and Lin Zixiang very livid, which was another reason why Lin Zixiang was here with her son today.\u201cI know what I am doing,\u201d said Shu Yan. Of course she had to turn to Shu Jianyang for help. Her three brothers were all useless, each of them worse than the next. They\u2019d never be able to get her kids out from the Ye\u2019s.\u201cLike hell you do! What do you know?\u201d Lin Zixiang jumped up and down angrily. \u201cWhat were you thinking? How did I give birth to a loser like you? You can\u2019t even keep your own man under wrap! Where is Ye Zhiqiang? Let me go talk to him. Did he want to abandon his own wife and kids? Does he think he could just walk all over the Shu\u2019s?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll be home for lunch. You can talk to him then.\u201d As soon as she said that, Lin Zixiang immediately went quiet.She was only brave on her own turf. She would shout all sorts of things at her own two daughters, but when it came to Ye Zhiqiang, she wouldn\u2019t even dare raise her voice.\u201cLook at you, huh? Have you cousin picked up your two kids. If Zhiqiang didn\u2019t happen to call, he wouldn\u2019t even know that his kids have came to the city,\u201d said Lin Zixiang as her eyes scanned over the table top. Noticing that there wasn\u2019t even any fruit there, she said unhappily, \u201cWe\u2019ve been here for a while now. Are you going to at least offer us some fruits to quench our thirst?\u201d\u201cYe Zhiqiang is having an affair and I have been listening to you with pretending that I didn\u2019t know about it. But, this entire time, it was killing me inside. I am your daughter too. Can\u2019t you care about me some?\u201d Shu Yan purposely dabbed her eyes and said with a choking voice, \u201cI had no other choice but to pick the kids up. Ye Zhiqiang hasn\u2019t been home a lot. I figured if the kids are here, he\u2019d at least come back from time to time and I will be able to see him too.\u201dIn Lin Zixiang\u2019s eyes, kids were the best tool to hold onto men. She said in an understanding voice immediately, \u201cOkay, you have a brain after all.\u201dThen, giving her daughter a stare, she said again, \u201cWhat were you suggesting? That I don\u2019t care about you? All men are like that. Even the useless men in our village have women on the side, let alone someone as competent as Ye Zhiqiang. Look at all the girls back in the village, you are doing much better than them. You have a house of your own and a personal car. Your husband provides you with an allowance on the dot every month. He never lifted a hand at you. Look at our neighbor, Yingzi, her husband beats her every night and we can hear it from our house. I think your days are going too well, that\u2019s why you have all this time for these crazy thoughts.\u201dShu Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThird Sister, I am hungry,\u201d said Shu Jianxiang as he rocked his feet up and down. He gathered that his mom and sister were also done talking and made his demand like a lord.\u201cRight. We travelled half a day for your matters and didn\u2019t even have time for lunch. Quick, go cook something for your brother. We don\u2019t want him to go hungry.\u201d Lin Zixiang immediately felt bad when her son said he was hungry.\u201cYou know, Ye Zhiqiang never liked me sending money back home.

All these years and you still have no say in this house.\u201dThat being said, Lin Zixiang also found Ye Zhiqiang intimidating. That boy was a sly one. He could be blunt when he wanted to. He didn\u2019t care who he was talking to.\u201cWell then, give us travel expense and money for lunch. You don\u2019t want to cook for us, at least pay for our meal.\u201d One way or another, she was not going to leave empty handed.Shu Yan feign strong reluctance to part with her $100. She made a mental note. This $100 would be considered the amount the original owner gave to her parents for the year. In this age, how many married daughters from a village could afford $100 a year? She was pretty generous already.Lin Zixiang took the money disgruntledly while she stared intently at Shu Yan\u2019s pocket with a strong urge to pull it open and see how much money she really had on her. She only stopped herself considering that her daughter had always been very honest. She looked around the living room and grabbed two cups from the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having daughters? You came all this way to visit her and she won\u2019t even make you dinner.\u201dWordlessly, Shu Yan watched the two of them leave. She felt sorry for the original owner. Never mind about Shu Jianxiang, who didn\u2019t care about this sister at all. The entire time here, Lin Zixiang never said a kind word about her daughter\u2019s well-being. She just wanted to make sure that she wouldn\u2019t get a divorce. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get more money in the future. The original owner was not a daughter in her eyes, just a tool for her to get more money.Another ten or so minutes later, the potential buyers finally arrived. It was a man in his forties and he kept on apologizing to Shu Yan.\u201cI am so sorry I ran late.\u201d\u201cNo worries. That afforded me the opportunity to take another look at this house.\u201d Shu Yan just made up some excuse. It was lucky that he ran late. Had he ran into Lin Zixiang, she would still be going on and on about it.The house was right next to the new train station and very nicely located geographically. All the other houses in the area were already asking for $170,000 \u2013 $180,000. The $160,000 that Shu Yan was asking for was very fair.After touring the house, the man made the decision with alacrity without even trying to barter down on the price.Right after it was settled on this side, she got news from Shu Jianyang that the remaining house had also been sold for $150,000, along with all the furniture and appliances.\u201cNow that all your properties were sold, are you planning on leaving soon?\u201d Shu Jianyang had a new found respect for Shu Yan in the last few days.\u201cYeah, I plan on leaving tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSo soon?\u201d Shu Jianyang didn\u2019t expect her to be so efficient and just get up and leave like that.\u201cI had always plan on leaving within the next couple of days,\u201d smiled Shu Yan. \u201cThird Brother, I want to thank you so much for your help. Without you, that house and the $10,000 would be all I have for the rest of my life along with my two children.\u201d\u201cYou are not giving yourself enough credit. These were all your ideas. The only thing I have contributed was to have my men running errands was all. You\u2019d have been able to take care of Ye Zhiqiang all by yourself even without my help.\u201dShu Yan chuckled, \u201cThird Brother has so much faith in me.\u201dThe next morning, Shu Yan packed up the very limited items that the three of them possessed and got ready to head to the train station. She saw Shu Jianyang waiting for her as soon as she opened up the door.\u201cC\u2019mon, let me give you a ride,\u201d said Shu Jianyang as he took the sleeping Ye Tianbao from Shu Yan.After they arrived at the train station, Shu Yan waved at Shu Jianyang, who was standing outside the train, and said, \u201cThird Brother, you should go now. I\u2019ll call you once I am settled down.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

First of all, the air quality was awful. They had barely just sat down when those on the side started smoking and eating breakfast. Some of them even took their shoes off. The messy hallway was saturated with the smell of body odor, stinky feet, and cigarette smoke along with the smell of food.Shu Yan got close to a small window and took a breath. Luckily, the windows could be opened. Otherwise, she just might vomit.Shu Yan had purchased the map of the entire country and studied it before their departure. She had decided that their destination would be City Nan when they departed City Xi.She was thirty years old in her original life, but she would not consider herself as someone very experienced. She moved back home after graduating college and moved back to the college city after two years. Even the job that she had was not a very challenging one with an income that was just about enough to cover all of her expenses. She had gone through her life aimlessly.If it was just her, it didn\u2019t matter where she went. But now that she has two kids in tow, she must put them first when she made any decisions.She had picked the city which she attended college in. Mainly because she was already familiar with that place. Even though where she was now was a parallel universe of where she was from, the history wasn\u2019t really that different. It was still the same earth and the same country. The location names might be different, but the geographical location was the same.There were many variations when it came to small details, but not much in terms of big directions. For example, City Nan was still a super tier one city. It has the same geographical advantages that it offered; nothing could change that. The details within City Nan might have altered, for example, the subway routes might be different, or some places were to be taken down in her own world, but not in this one.Of course, these were just Shu Yan\u2019s speculations. It could be that this world wasn\u2019t even that much different than her own. What she knew for certain was that she could just buy a few houses in City Nan randomly and when the wave of force eviction takes place later on, she\u2019d be compensated with ten or twenty of them in return\u2026The cost of houses in City Nan would become astronomical in the future. If she invested in real estate now, all she needed to do was to stay home and count her money. How exciting would that be?\u201cMommy, I want to pee,\u201d said Ye Tianbao softly.Perhaps because he was still very traumatized from the last time he saw Ye Zhiqiang, he had been behaving very well lately. A noisy child was a headache, but when they are too quiet, one would worry that something was wrong with them. As the saying goes, kids were placed on earth to collect the debt that you owed them. Shu Yan believed that saying deeply now.Public safety wasn\u2019t very good back in those days. Shu Yan dared not leave Ye Jingjing at the seat by herself. Carrying Ye Tianbao in one arm and holding Ye Jingjing\u2019s hand with her other, they headed toward the bathroom.\u201cMom, our bag?\u201d Ye Jingjing wanted to grab their bag.\u201cNo need. It is just a few old clothes inside. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Everything that mattered was in her inner pocket.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had thought about buying some new clothes for her children, but things happened and she was distracted. Then she figured they\u2019d be leaving City Xi soon, and it was already difficult enough to have two children in tow. They might as well pack light. As long as she has money, she could buy them new clothes after they have settled down in City Nan.As for herself, she had no plans to buy new clothes in the next six months. The first item on her to-do list was to lose weight. She would buy new clothes after she had lost some weight. There was no reason to be wasteful.After Ye Tianbao was done with the bathroom, Shu Yan had Ye Jingjing went and used it too. It wasn\u2019t easy to do anything with two children in tow, going to the bathroom was even worse.Sitting across from Shu Yan was a very honest looking middle-aged couple. They looked to be in their fifties. The man was quiet, but the woman was very chatty.\u201cHi, sister. Where is the kids\u2019 father? How come he wasn\u2019t with you?\u201dShu Yan\u2019s heart dropped. As a woman with two kids, she was definitely the prime target of human trafficker. She must be cautious. People were difficult to read; one couldn\u2019t be too careful.Shu Yan smiled calmly, \u201cTheir father works in City Ning. He said he misses the kids and had me take a trip with them.\u201d\u201cCity Ning is a good place. What does he do? He must make good money. How else would he ask you to take a trip. A round trip there is not cheap,\u201d said the woman very matter-of-factly.\u201cHe worked too hard and didn\u2019t even come home for the new year, which was why he misses the kids now and had me take them to him.\u201d Shu Yan stroked Ye Tianbao\u2019s head slightly. Leaning close to him, she whispered into his ear, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything.\u201dYe Tianbao was so frightened that he pushed himself against Shu Yan\u2019s chest and Ye Jingjing tightly held onto the corner of her mother\u2019s clothes.Children were very sensitive; they could sense the adults\u2019 emotions.\u201cThat is true. We all work hard for our kids, right?\u201d chuckled the woman as she looked at her two children. \u201cYou two kids are so pretty. The daughter is a bit skinny though. Here, these are my homemade hardboiled eggs, take a couple.\u201dShu Yan felt even more alarmed. She smiled lightly and said, \u201cNo, no need.\u201d She declined, \u201cWe brought our own food.\u201d She took a bag of hardboiled eggs out from her pocket and gave them two in return. \u201cOur family made these for us. I worry that they won\u2019t keep in weather like this. Here, try some of mine.\u201d\u201cWe have ours too. Save them for the children.\u201dThe two pushed the eggs back and forth and finally all four of the eggs ended up on the floor, \u201cAiya! I\u2019m\u2026 so sorry. Here, I\u2019ll give you a couple more.\u201d\u201cNo need. You young people are so concerned about hygiene. The shell is still there. All the same after you peeled them.\u201d The woman waved her hand, picked up the eggs, peeled them, and ate them with her man.Were they not crooks? Was she being too overly cautious? It didn\u2019t matter. It was better to be suspicious rather than regretting after something bad had happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s not fun when they get sick.\u201d After the woman had finished her hardboiled eggs, she pulled out quite a bit of dates from her pocket, \u201cWe grew these dates ourselves. Whatever we couldn\u2019t finish, we sun dried them. These are good for both women and children. Have some, they are very sweet.\u201d\u201cWe have those too.\u201d Shu Yan felt that that woman was too overly friendly.Right then, a train attendant walked over and Shu Yan quickly asked him, \u201cHi, comrade. Can you tell me if there\u2019s still any room in the sleeper car?\u201dThey bought their tickets in a hurry and weren\u2019t able to get the tickets for the sleeper car. Shu Yan originally had thought that it was just ten or so hours, so they would just suck it up. But now she wanted to see if she could switch to a sleeper car.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not sure either,\u201d said the train attendant as he shook his head.\u201cPlease, comrade, help me out. Look at my two kids. They are not well,\u201d said Shu Yan as she gently nudged Ye Jingjing. Ye Jingjing was a smarty pants, she immediately coughed and feigned an ill look. \u201cCan you please take a look for me? I\u2019ll pay the difference.\u201dShe knew that trains would usually keep a few empty slots in the sleeper car. They were generally used for emergencies or for favors but difficult for the general public to purchase. After all, this body had died once and wasn\u2019t in good shape. And she had two children with her. The little girl was small and the kid she was carrying also looked pale. The train attendant had a stroke of conscience, took them to the captain, explained the situation to him, and let them purchase a spot in the sleeper train.\u201cYou think she caught on?\u201d The woman who was sitting across from Shu Yan asked her man after they were gone.\u201cYou were too eager. A woman with two children is usually very careful,\u201d grumbled the man in a low voice.\u201cShe would have been a great catch. I saw it. The man who saw them off drove a car and had on a watch and a gold chain. Look? She upgraded to the sleeper car just like that. She must have a lot of money on her,\u201d said the woman regretfully. \u201cThe two kids were cute too, especially that boy, light skinned and chubby. He\u2019d fetch a great price.\u201d\u201cShut up! Do you want others to overhear you?\u201d The man gave her a stare. This was a wasted trip.After they went into the sleeper car, three of the beds were already occupied. The empty one on top was theirs. The two spots on the bottom were taken up by an old man on the left and a young one on the right. Above him, it was a young woman.Shu Yan smiled at them, hesitated for a little bit, and finally decided against asking them to switch. Yes, this was a little more troublesome. She\u2019d make a mental note to buy tickets in advance going forward.She first helped her daughter climb up into the top spot before she carried her son up with her. After they were settled, Shu Yan let out a sigh of relief. She patted Tianbao on his back as she asked Jingjing softly, \u201cWere you afraid?\u201d\u201cNo, I am not.\u201d That might be what she said, but she clung onto Shu Yan\u2019s arm tightly the entire time.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Mom\u2019s right here.\u201d Shu Yan pulled Jingjing into her arms as well and said to her, \u201cRemember, never take anything from anyone you don\u2019t know in the future, especially food items.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan, with her backpack on her back, Tianbao in her arms and Jingjing\u2019s hand in hers, walked into the train station along with everyone else. They were finally here.\u201cComrade, would you like to stay at a hotel?\u201d\u201cComrade, do you need to get a room?\u201d\u201cComrade, do you need a ride?\u201d\u201cComrade, where are you heading?\u201d\u201cDo you want to go to Oupu? Just one slot left. Hop on and we can take off right away.\u201dMany surrounded her as soon as Shu Yan walked out of the station. Shu Yan didn\u2019t slow down and took the two kids to the bus station. She saw the old bus station exactly where she had remembered it and let out a sigh of relief. Luckily that hadn\u2019t changed.There weren\u2019t many routes and Shu Yan picked the one that she was most familiar with. They waited for over half an hour before the bus came. Nothing she could do. Buses weren\u2019t common back then, not like the future when a bus would come every few minutes.Shu Yan finally let out a slight smile after they had arrived at their destination. This was the college town that she was most familiar with. She had looked up the location of her college when she decided on coming to City Nan. It was at the same spot as the one in her own world. Shu Yan had a pretty good idea of the changes to come in the area surrounding the college. For example, Xuefu Street that was not too far from the university was a 100-year-old street, one of the attractions of City Nan.As it was a 100-year-old street, it meant there wouldn\u2019t be a lot of changes. Shu Yan found out that she was right when she arrived. The hotel that she had stayed in when her parents came with her to register for her university was already in existence. She walked inside with her children and noticed that the owner was not the same person.When Shu Yan first transmigrated here, she had made a call to her father\u2019s factory. The number did not exist and neither did the factory. So she could understand that the owner was not the same person. As similar as the two worlds were, they were two different worlds after all.\u201cHi, would you like a room?\u201d\u201cYes please. I\u2019d like a room. How much for one night?\u201d asked Shu Yan when she didn\u2019t see any prices listed.\u201cDo you want a single or a double? Single is $5 and double is $8.\u201d The owner smiled.\u201cCan I take a look at them first so I can make a comparison?\u201d Shu Yan walked upstairs with the owner. The rooms were quite similar except that a double is slightly bigger and has its own bathroom. Shu Yan picked the double room immediately, closed the door, and let out a long sigh of relief. They had finally arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Both children were exhausted. Shu Yan didn\u2019t let them go to sleep right away. She had Ye Jingjing watch Ye Tianbao while she went and bought two bowls of wonton.The portion size was substantial back in the 90s, and two bowls were enough for the three of them.***It was already the afternoon when they woke up. She had no idea what time it was without a watch or cellphone. The two kids were still sleeping and Shu Yan woke them up. If they slept too much in the day time, they wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep at night.\u201cMom,\u201d said Ye Jingjing softly as she rubbed her eyes.\u201cC\u2019mon, get up. Mom will take you out to get some lunch.\u201dIn contrast, Ye Tianbao\u2019s temper was much worse. He threw a fit after he was woken up. Shu Yan coaxed him a little and helped him change.\u201cWhat do you feel like?\u201d Shu Yan was very familiar with this area, but that was dozens or so years later. She wasn\u2019t entirely familiar with what it was like currently, luckily things didn\u2019t change too much in this area.She found the restaurant in her memory but the owner was a different person. Shu Yan felt a little bit disappointed.The original owner of this restaurant was from City Xi. Most of her colleagues from the north liked to dine there. Listening to the couple talking to each other in City Xi\u2019s dialect, Shu Yan found out that they were also from City Xi, but their dishes had already turned to City Nan\u2019s style.\u201cMommy, so sweet,\u201d said Ye Tianbao after he took a bite. He wanted to spit it back out but he didn\u2019t dare.Back in his old home, he\u2019d just spit out whatever he didn\u2019t like and grandma would coax him to eat a little bit. After he had spent the last few days in City Xi with his mother, he learned that if he spit it out and refused to eat it, his mother would really leave him alone. After he had gone hungry a few times, he had learned his lesson.Shu Yan tried a bite and it was alright for her. She has, after all, lived in City Nan for a while and had grown used to it. But it would be more difficult for the two children having it for the first time.\u201cBoss, the dishes that had not yet been served can you switch them to City Xi\u2019s taste?\u201d She had overlooked that. She thought it was just the owners that were different. She hadn\u2019t expected the food to taste different as well.\u201cYoung sister is from City Xi also?\u201d The boss lady asked passionately as she brought the dishes out.\u201cYes. It\u2019s not too bad for me; I can eat anything. It was the first time these two are having City Nan\u2019s cuisine.\u201d Shu Yan saw the dishes in the boss lady\u2019s hand and said, \u201cOh, if it\u2019s already done then never mind. Can you add another regular dish from City Xi?\u201dIn a friendly manner, the boss lady said, \u201cWe have late lunch working in a restaurant and are just about to have lunch. We\u2019ve made a lot of food. You can have some if you don\u2019t mind.\u201dOf course she wouldn\u2019t mind. Shu Yan thanked the boss lady. Before long, the boss lady returned with a large plate of food. On the plate, there was a combination of three different dishes.\u201cI gave you a little bit of everything. Let me know if that\u2019s not enough.\u201d It wasn\u2019t everyday that she ran into someone from City Xi; the boss lady was particularly happy that day.It had an authentic northwestern taste, and both children liked that a lot better. Shu Yan tried a couple bites of that before returning to the dishes from before. She could eat both styles, might as well save the City Xi ones for her children.\u201cMom, you have some too,\u201d said Ye Jingjing when she noticed that Shu Yan didn\u2019t touch the dish from the boss lady much.That\u2019s why they always said daughters paid more attention to details. Shu Yan smiled, put a chopstick full of meat in her daughter\u2019s bowl and said, \u201cMom prefers sweeter dishes. You and your brother can have these.\u201d Then, she put a chopstick full of food into the staring Ye Tianbao\u2019s bowl. \u201cYou have more too and grow up quickly. That way you can protect your mom and sister.\u201d\u201cProtect mom and sister?\u201d He had never heard these words before. Grandma had always told him that mom and sister were not part of the family. They were there to serve him and must listen to him.\u201cYes, mom and sister are girls and Tianbao, as a brave hero, must protect us.\u201d The child was still young and would learn what he was taught. He had been warped by the elder Mrs. Ye before. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t too late to bring him back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Like daddy?\u201dShu Yan paused for a little. In the mind of a child, their daddy would, naturally, be a hero. Shu Yan wasn\u2019t silly enough to reason with him.\u201cYes, a hero like daddy.\u201dYe Tianbao had another half a bowl of rice happily. Ever since he had been with Shu Yan, Shu Yan had stopped feeding him. He could eat very well by himself now with a small spoon.That\u2019s why when they said \u201coh, the kid doesn\u2019t eat and must be fed, it only meant they had been spoiled. They\u2019d know to eat when they are hungry.The boss lady was super nice and gave them some of their dishes that they\u2019ve made to take with them after they\u2019ve paid.\u201cYou\u2019ve already given us a lot of food. We can\u2019t possibly,\u201d said Shu Yan.\u201cIt\u2019s fate that we run into someone from the same home town. Take these. Just come over more often, okay?\u201d\u201cWell, then, thank you, older sister.\u201d Shu Yan had found out that the boss lady was 36 this year from their earlier conversation, 11 years older than her. But she lived a happy life and looked much younger than Shu Yan.There\u2019s an advantage to the hotel they were currently staying at \u2013 there was a communal kitchen in the back area. Guests could bring their own kitchenware and ingredients and cook for themselves. It\u2019s $0.50 to use it each day. Shu Yan planned on buying some kitchenware and cooking.There was a department store not too far away and they could find everything there. She had already planned on settling down in City Nan, so they could very well just buy everything that they need. But she has, after all, two kids with her. It\u2019s best to keep things light, so she only picked out three bowls, three pairs of chopsticks, two spoons, a large soup bowl, a rag to do dishes with, and two more dishes for food and that was all they\u2019d need for the time being.Ye Jingjing was a mature child and knew to carry the light items for Shu Yan. When Ye Tianbao saw that, he wanted to help out as well. Shu Yan did not discourage them from helping, but instead, praised both children excessively.She had read from experts that one shouldn\u2019t stop their kids when they offer to help, that\u2019d encourage the children to become dependent and lazy. Shu Yan thought that made a lot of sense.Once they got back to the hotel, Ye Jingjing played with Ye Tianbao in the room while Shu Yan went to the kitchen and washed all the kitchenware in hot water to disinfect them as she thought about their next steps.First, they\u2019d need to find a place to stay. If they could buy their own place, that\u2019d be ideal. Otherwise, a rental would be fine too.The next item on the agenda was Ye Jingjing\u2019s school. If they wanted to register now, school has already started. They\u2019d need to pull some strings to get into a school. When push came to shove, they could always get her into a private school. Then there was Ye Tianbao, he needed to start kindergarten as well. That too would be problematic. None of these were easy to accomplish.She needed to settle down with the two children first before she thought about the next steps.The next morning after she had woken up, Shu Yan went out to buy them breakfast.\u201cMom needs to go out to look for a house in a little bit. You play with your brother in the room, okay? Unless it\u2019s mom, don\u2019t open the door for anyone who knocks and don\u2019t go out. Can you do that?\u201d Her daughter was very mature. And luckily her daughter was so mature, otherwise this would be even more tiring.There weren\u2019t a lot of amenities in the hotel. The only appliance was an electric fan. Shu Yan purposefully placed the fan higher up so the two children couldn\u2019t reach it. She had opened up the teapot earlier in the day to cool it down. The children could just pour water for themselves when they are thirsty and wouldn\u2019t be burned from touching it. She looked around one last time to make sure nothing could endanger them before she left.She walked around blindly to look for houses. She knew there was an older district close by. It was a dormitory previously. When the factory moved away, the school bought it from them and let their teachers use it as a perk. Some of the teachers would rent the house out for extra income.She looked for the guard at the front and told him her intention. Unfortunately, the guard informed her that it was very rare that there was a unit for rent and when one became available, they didn\u2019t usually last very long.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was 1992, not 2019. The teachers made pennies back then and many single teachers couldn\u2019t even get assigned an individual unit but had to stay in group dormitories. Plus, City Nan has always had a shortage in houses. It would be impossible for her to get her hands on one.\u201cWould you know where I will be able to rent a place nearby?\u201d Shu Yan didn\u2019t give up and asked again.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of availability nearby,\u201d said the man as he shook his head.The economy had been improving, and many students have families who made some money doing businesses and wanted to better provide for their children. When the children had more spending money, more of them lived away from home.Shu Yan was a little bit disappointed. She figured that she was familiar with this area, and there were a lot of teachers around. She could pull some strings and get Ye Jingjing into the City Nan grade school. Once she got into the grade school, going from there to junior and senior high schools wouldn\u2019t be too difficult. Plus, when it came time for the college entrance examination, City Nan University would first accept graduates from City Nan Senior High school.\u201cYou can go to check out the Xiaonanmen area. They have quite a few places for rent.\u201d Seeing the way Shu Yan looked, the guard couldn\u2019t help but recommend.Shu Yan\u2019s eyes beamed. Of course she knew about Xiaonanmen. In the future that was the busiest business center. But they were probably all old houses back then and most likely joined courtyard where five to six families would live in an area of 20-30 square meters. An entire floor would share one bathroom, never mind about the living environment.Shu Yan could tolerate a lot, but she drew the line at shared bathrooms.\u201cSir, do you know if they have apartment buildings nearby?\u201d\u201cSure, there\u2019s apartment buildings! About 1 km north of here, a big boss developed a small section, but they are only for sale, not rental. Those houses have a very imposing style. The area was impeccable. The only problem is that they are very pricey. You should buy one there, I guarantee you they are awesome.\u201d The guard felt that Shu Yan\u2019s tone sounded pretty snobby so he purposely tried to intimate her.\u201cYou said that way?\u201d In her original world, that area was purchased by a school and built a campus on it. She just assumed that it was still bare land there and never thought to go look over there. She hadn\u2019t expected that the land was purchased by a developer and became apartment buildings.As she had said so herself earlier, as similar as the two worlds were, they were, after all, not the same one. She could use her word as a reference, but shouldn\u2019t assume that they were identical. Shu Yan made a mental note again, thanked the guard, and headed toward Xiaonanmen.She walked about a mile and saw the tall apartment buildings. There was a small area in the back where they did a great job in afforestation; at least it looked very comfortable from the outside. She found the sales office. Compared to the future, this place barely had visitors inside.That made a lot of sense if one really thought about it. Back then, many work units would assign living quarters. Many people dedicated themselves to work to get a residential unit. Some people even thought it\u2019s silly to buy your own house.The other reason was that this location was extremely expensive. Take this area that Shu Yan was looking at as an example, it\u2019s asking for $1,500 per square meter. It might not sound like a lot, but this was 1992. An average person in City Nan made about $300 to $400 / month. Their annual income was around $3,000. Even if they didn\u2019t spend a penny of it, they could buy at most 2 square meters a year. When you looked at it that way, the price was about the same as they were in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were plenty of people out there who\u2019d dressed poorly but were very wealthy.\u201cYes, I would like to look at some of the houses.\u201d Shu Yan smiled at the salesgirl and said, \u201cWould you mind giving me an introduction of the different kinds of apartments that you have?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d said the salesgirl as she pulled out the floor plans and walked through each of them in detail with her.The developer was a native of City Nan, but they have hired a designer firm from City Gang to be in charge of the design of the apartments. From the salesgirl\u2019s introduction, the designer even has a few international awards under his belt so their apartments were up to international standards and were very stylish and classy.Judging from the appearance and overall layout, they were very nice. Nice enough that they\u2019d still look very appealing even 20 years from now. All Shu Yan needed to find out now was what the floorplans actually looked like.There were a total of four different floor plans, they were 60 m2, 80 m2, 90 m2, and 120 m2. And, there were only ten or so of the 120 m2 ones.Houses in City Nan had always been tight. Most locals live in a 20 m2 unit, or a 30-40 m2 house. 120 m2 was like a mansion. Looking at the cost, 120 m2 at $1,500 per square meter, came out to be $150,000. For residents of City Nan whose monthly income was $400 or so, this was no doubt an astronomical price.The architect from City G had used every bit of the area to their max. The 60 m2 ones have 3 bedrooms and 1 living room, plus a patio; 80 m2 ones have 4 bedrooms, 1 living room, plus a patio; 90 m2 ones have 4 bedrooms, living and dining rooms, and 2 patios. The communal areas took up approximately 10% of the area, so a 90 m2 unit really only has 81 m2. Squeezing 4 bedrooms, living and dining rooms, plus a bathroom, one could imagine just how small the bedrooms were.The largest 120 m2 units actually have 3 bedrooms, living and dining rooms, and 2 bathrooms. Shu Yan understood the architect\u2019s purpose. Anyone who could afford the 120 m2 unit were naturally the wealth ones. They cared about comfort and wouldn\u2019t be happy if the rooms were too small.As for its geographical location, City Nan University was one of the best in the country and all the periphery areas would be well developed in the future. Houses in this area would inflate madly. Even if Shu Yan decided to buy another house in the future, she wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the one that she had vacated; she would always be able to rent it out.\u201cI would like to find out about other public amenities nearby, such as schools or hospitals, etc.\u201d If it was just her by herself, Shu Yan would have purchased this in a heartbeat. But she had two children, schools and hospitals would have to be factored into her consideration. Schools were, naturally, very important to Chinese. Also, the kids were still young and low in immunity. They would get sick from time to time. If anything happened, the distance of the hospital could play a very vital role.\u201cOh yes, there\u2019s a kindergarten right here in our district, and it\u2019s a dual language one as well. They have quite a few teachers from overseas. I am sure you are aware that the best time to learn a second language is when the children are young. If you head South 300 meters, there\u2019s Jiashi Grade School and City Nan No.2 Hospital is 4 km from here. In addition, there\u2019s a market not too far away behind the district so getting groceries is quite convenient too. All in all, our facilities are very comprehensive. I would say this with confidence. This is one of the best districts in City Nan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Its reputation rivaled that of City Xi Grade School and the two had, in fact, been rivals. Jiashi\u2019s overall grade might be higher than City Xi, but in the end, the ratio of students being accepted into a prominent college was 3:7. Meaning 3 from Jiashi versus 7 from City Xi. The discrepancy rooted in the fact that Jiashi\u2019s grades relied heavily on strict management \u2013 self-study in the morning, self-study at night, and a lot of homework.Shu Yan had tutored students from Jiahshi Grade School previously and was shocked by the amount of homework assignments. Three worksheets a day \u2013 Chinese, mathematics, and English \u2013 a 300 words essay, write all the vocabularies they have learned that day 20 times, idioms 20 times, English vocabularies 20 times, all that on top of all the exercise books that was mandated by the school\u2026While it was important for the school and their teachers to be strict to the children, it couldn\u2019t be overboard. Shu Yan felt that it might not necessarily be a good thing to be too overly strict with children. As evidenced by the proportion getting into a good college, once the children started junior and senior high schools and that the schools were not as strict, the children would rebound more, causing their grades to dip further.\u201cCity Xi Grade School isn\u2019t that far either, can they attend there instead?\u201d Shu Yan herself had been in school for many years and understood the pain. o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o She wouldn\u2019t wish that on her children.The sales girl looked at Shu Yan, surprised. Jiashi Grade School was much harder to get into than City Xi Grade School. Many of the parents looked at their houses here specifically for the new government policy of attending a school nearby. Being able to get into Jiashi Grade School meant the children were set for a prominent high school, then all the way to City Nan senior high school.\u201cCity Xi Grade School is fine too. We have their quotas as well.\u201d Naturally, any developers that was able to develop this location must have pretty sizeable background and resources. It couldn\u2019t be difficult for them to obtain the quotas for both schools.Shu Yan was quite happy when she heard that. \u201cMy daughter is 7 years old and just the age for first grade. Due to some reasons, she hasn\u2019t been to school yet. Is it too late to register for her now?\u201dThings were more lax back in the 90s, after all, the crackdown wasn\u2019t as strict.The sales girl was a little troubled. \u201cI am not sure about that. You will have to check with the school directly on that.\u201dShu Yan nodded, \u201cAlright, show me the model homes first and we can discuss the rest. Else all the discussions are moot.\u201d\u201cSure, may I please ask which model are you interested in?\u201d The sales girl smiled and Shu Yan could see her neat and pretty teeth. Having been in sales for a long time, the sales girl could tell the ones who were just asking from the ones who were seriously about buying. This not-so-pretty woman dressed completely out of style who was standing in front of her right now was one that was serious about buying. But, she put Shu Yan at the 60 m2 range. Even the smallest floor plan cost over $100,000, that\u2019s still a pretty sizable commission for her.\u201cShow me all of them.\u201d They have model homes of all the floorplans that she could look at directly.As they walked past a tall building, Shu Yan asked, \u201cAre these offices?\u201d\u201cYes, they are currently looking for tenants. If you are going to run your own business, this is a good location. There are a few colleges around and it\u2019s easy to hire college grads.\u201d The sales girl stopped on her way to explain to Shu Yan.Naturally, Shu Yan would not take that seriously. Back in these days, college students were still assigned to work units by the government. Who\u2019d want to go work for private companies?\u201cI suppose it wasn\u2019t easy to find tenants?\u201d smiled Shu Yan nonchalantly.In fact, \u201992 wasn\u2019t the best year to invest in real estate. The house prices would remain stagnant for the next few years. Money right now was better spent running businesses. When it got to \u201997 \u2013 \u201999, when the house prices dipped drastically, then you swooped in and bought some 10 \u2013 20 houses and you would be set for life.\u201cThat\u2019s not true. They have leased out almost all the units. Are you interested in taking a look?\u201dShu Yan shook her head. She didn\u2019t need an office. She wasn\u2019t planning on starting a company of her own. She should focus on a house first.The sales girl didn\u2019t say much. She\u2019d be more surprised had Shu Yan wanted to go lease an unit.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There is 24 hours surveillance, ensuring the safety of our residents. This is our district\u2019s very own dual-language kindergarten. There aren\u2019t a lot of kids just yet, but once our residents start to move in, it will be very lively.\u201dAs they walked into the second building, the sales girl said proudly, \u201cOurs is the only apartment building in City Nan that has elevators. And all of them were purchased from overseas so you wouldn\u2019t need to worry about your safety.\u201dThe district has a total of 12 floors and they headed first to the 60 m2 unit.The 60 m2 unit was as small as Shu Yan had expected. The rooms were small, as was the bathroom and the kitchen. At most, 2 people could pass by each other at one time, with 3 you would be stuck. The 80 m2 one looked to be the same as the 60 m2 one, except for the additional room. The 90 m2 one was much bigger. The patio also allowed a better view of the area. There were a total of 4 bedrooms, she and each of the children could have their own room and still one left for a study. This could work, but Shu Yan still wanted to check out the 120 m2 one.The 120 m2 unit was impeccable. The room was reasonably sized, the living and dining rooms were spacious. It further has 3 large patios and 2 bathrooms. Very pleasing overall.\u201cHow much is this?\u201d The starting price was the price of the one with the worst location. It was dark and humid. Anyone not of perfect health would probably get sick living in it. The one they were looking at definitely cost higher than the starting price.\u201cIs this the one that you like?\u201d The sales girl wasn\u2019t ecstatic. Most everyone liked the 120 m2 floorplan after they have toured it, but they were all scared away by the cost of it. The sales girl was deadly afraid that Shu Yan, too, would turn and leave after she heard the price, but she maintained her professional smile and said, \u201cWe have hired the best architect, the best construction company, and used the best materials\u2026\u201d\u201cJust tell me the price.\u201d The only reason she was rambling on was to support why it was so expensive.\u201c$4,200 per square meter.\u201dShu Yan almost wanted to laugh out loud. Whatever happened to the $1,500 per square meter? $4,200 was quite a bit higher than that.$4,200 might not seem like a lot, but this was $4,200 back in \u201992. The official salary of City Nan was $300 per month. That meant one wouldn\u2019t even be able to buy 1 square meter even if he didn\u2019t eat or drink for a whole year.Shu Yan hesitated about a house this size. It would cost close to $500,000. She\u2019d earn more in interest if she put the same amount into a savings account.The sales girl looked at Shu Yan nervously.\u201cWhat\u2019s the lowest amount? And, what about the parking spot?\u201d Shu Yan walked around the condo one more time. It was impeccable and she liked it a lot. Within City Nan right now, this was probably the best with the exception of the ones that were only permissible to be purchased by foreign corporations or individuals.\u201cIf you can pay it off right away, we can give you a 2% discount. The 120 m2 unit comes with its own parking spot. It\u2019s a freebie so it\u2019s a very good deal.\u201d The sales girl could see the hesitation on Shu Yan\u2019s face and added immediately.Shu Yan nodded. A free parking spot was nice. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we round down to $4,000 per square meter. I also want help with the process of enrolling my kids into school.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the authority to make that decision. I will need to consult my manager.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.

A girl in a suit brought her tea and also a variety of snacks. She randomly picked one to put into her mouth before she saw the sales girl returning, walking behind a middle-aged man.\u201cGood afternoon, miss. Xiao Li had told me about your requests. Both of them are somewhat tricky.\u201dShu Yan glanced over the name tag on the man and said, \u201cManager Wang. I am a person with alacrity. I don\u2019t think my requests are too unreasonable. $4,000 per square meter and admission to City Xi grade school. If you can do those for me, I can sign the contract right now.\u201dNanfu Mansion was one of the high-end districts for sale right now and it offered desirable environment and amenities, so its costs were relatively higher than others. The 60 m2 units were almost all sold, but not so much the 120 m2 ones, so the price wasn\u2019t too much of an issue. As for the grade school entrance\u2026\u201cI can accept the price. Entrance to the schools shouldn\u2019t be too much of an issue, but schools have already started this year. They might not let your child start mid-term. How old is your child?\u201d They have dealt with a few schools previously and City Xi was the most difficult one among all of them.\u201cShe is 7. She was born during the first half of the year and just the right age to start grade school.\u201d Shu Yan shook her head. \u201cThis was my main condition. That\u2019s the reason why I want to buy here.\u201dThere was no reason for her to pick this place if it wasn\u2019t for her kids\u2019 schools. It\u2019s almost $500,000! She could have bought a home in some suburb. The price tag was lower. And, once it was demolished a few years ago, she would become an instant nouveau riche.Manager Wang was hesitant for quite a while before he said, \u201cAlright. Since you, too, had made your decision with such alacrity. Miss Shu, if you have any other friends who are looking, please refer them to our district.\u201dShe could probably have dragged on some more for an even lower price, but money was much less of an issue when compared to her kids\u2019 schooling. She\u2019d just consider the extra money as money spent on getting them into the schools.With regards to matters of schooling, Shu Yan requested a separate agreement to guarantee the children\u2019s quota at the schools.\u201cYou won\u2019t have to worry about that. I will give you an answer tomorrow. We wouldn\u2019t want to delay the kids\u2019 schooling.\u201d Manager Wang saw Shu Yan\u2019s ID and asked, \u201cYou are not a local of City Nan?\u201d\u201cRight. That is my next question. Can I move my household register to City Nan if I purchase a house here? Or that I can\u2019t even buy if I am not a local here?\u201d She didn\u2019t think that limitation was in place just yet.\u201cYes, you can move your household register here through buying a house, but you are responsible for the registration fees,\u201d explained Manager Wang quickly.\u201cWell, naturally.\u201d Shu Yan let out a sigh of relief. She had only briefly heard a friend of hers mentioned once that back in the 90s, one could still move one\u2019s household register through buying a house. This rule was no longer in existence after 2000. For a while, there she was worried that this world was different. She lucked out. Otherwise, their only option was to move to some remote village location.\u201cThen just bring over your household register and ID. We will need to work on your deed and register. We will also need your children\u2019s birth certificates and immunization records. They might ask for that over at the schools.\u201d Manager Wang waited for Shu Yan to sign the contract, then together, they went to the back for the money transfer while he passionately explained everything to her.No matter what one was purchasing, the sales people were always the most passionate when one was paying. Taking this opportunity, Shu Yan asked Manager Wang all sorts of remodeling-related questions.This was an unfinished house so the remodeling was another big issue. She was not familiar with the City Nan during this time period. If she were to look for remodeling company by herself, she wouldn\u2019t even know if she was taken to the cleaner.\u201cOur company has our own remodeling company. Any of our buyers who use our remodeling company will receive a 20% discount. Mainly, our remodeling company is more reliable. If you look for them on your own, they are all gorillas. You won\u2019t be able to find them again if anything goes wrong.\u201d Manager Yang sounded very resigned when he brought this up. Many of their customers would look for cheaper alternatives on their own but still turned to them when anything went wrong.That was good. She didn\u2019t care about a little bit more cost for material, as long as the quality was good. She figured she would be staying here for a very long time, so she\u2019d like everything about it to be as perfect as possible. Now that the remodeling issue has been taking care of, she still needed to figure out a living arrangement before she could move into the house. She couldn\u2019t stay at the hotel this entire time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are there any semi-decent places for rent nearby? The remodeling can easily take up to three months and then another one to two months to air it out. That\u2019s not a short period of time.\u201dShu Yan was definitely asking the right person. Manager Yang was a City Nan native and has a wide network. Sure enough, he happened to know a man who could help with this kind of request.It so happened that Shu Yan had set an appointment with the man in the afternoon to go look at some rental properties after she dropped off the birth certificates and immunization records at the sales office.\u201cThank you so much,\u201d said Shu Yan to Manager Wang as she handed over $500 to him. \u201cPlease see what you can do for us on the school\u2019s end. I know you might have to treat someone to lunch and wouldn\u2019t want you to have to spend any money out of pocket.\u201dThat was, of course, way more than what\u2019s necessary for a few meals, and the rest would be net profit for Manager Yang. If he could have everything taken care of without spending a penny, that\u2019s fine as well. Shu Yan was merely spending money to buy herself the piece of mind.And the money worked wonders for sure. Manager Yang said he\u2019d get back to her by tomorrow and hinted that her child would be able to start going to school in the next few days.After everything was taken care of, it was already early afternoon. Both of her children were still at the hotel, and Shu Yan wanted to go back and check on them. She left quickly after she set a time with Manager Yang. Shu Yan rushed inside the room when she didn\u2019t hear any noises from the outside and saw that both kids were asleep in bed and the crackers on the night table were mostly gone. Shu Yan felt a pang of heartache all of a sudden.Many females said they wanted to be single parents in 2019 and even more of them encouraged those who wanted kids but not get married to follow through with it. But what they didn\u2019t know was the heartaches that came with being a single mother. Raising kids was not the same as having pets. The responsibilities were entirely different. It entailed a lot more than just clothing and feeding them. The amount of energy and resources that went into it was immeasurable.Shu Yan was glad that her two children would be attending grade school and kindergarten; otherwise, she just might lose her mind.She didn\u2019t have time to take a break but went straight to prepping and cooking lunch, then she woke up her kids to have lunch. After she finished doing dishes, she still had to quickly do the laundry from yesterday. It didn\u2019t seem like a lot to do, but 2-3 hours had passed when all was said and done.\u201cYou two continue to stay in the bedroom in the afternoon. Mom needs to go take care of something. After that, I\u2019ll take you guys out to have some fun, alright?\u201d She got to let them out sometime. She couldn\u2019t just leave them cooped up in the room.She handed the birth certificates and immunization records over to Manager Wang, but she wouldn\u2019t feel at ease until they have actually started school. Right now, all she could do was wait on news from Manager Yang.His friend was there as well. He was a chubby, not-too-tall middle-aged man.\u201cHi, I am a friend of Xiao Wang. You can call me Lao Hu. He mentioned that you are looking for a rental. What do you have in mind?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a traditional house, I\u2019d like it to be a single-family unit. If it\u2019s an apartment building, I\u2019d prefer a private kitchen and bathroom. Something newer. That\u2019s about it.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t stay at those community housing, especially for a single woman with two children. Others would ask about their father. If she said they were divorced, they\u2019d ask why. If she didn\u2019t elaborate, they\u2019d think she has issues and all sorts of other speculations. If she did elaborate, others would feel sympathy for her, or to make fun of her behind her back. She didn\u2019t care much about that, but not the two children. All the gossip would have a lot of negative impact on the children.\u201cOh, and preferably somewhere close to City Xi Grade School,\u201d added Shu Yan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s a slightly older district behind the university district, not too far from City Xi Grade School. Two bedroom and one living room, about 30 m2. The landlord\u2019s son got married two years ago and had some remodeling done. The kitchen and bath were also renovated at the same time. Now that they have moved out to a bigger place, they wanted to rent the place out for some extra income.\u201d Having heard Shu Yan\u2019s requirements, Luo Hu immediately thought of a place that he has on hand.It sounded quite good, but it\u2019s all talk until she saw it with her own eyes. Shu Yan happened to live on University Avenue, so the two of them went over there immediately.The house was located about 300-400 meters from the hotel. The remodeling was new and the place was clean along with the kitchen and bath. The landlord had taken with him all the furnishing except for the two beds. If they decided on this location, they\u2019d need to purchase quite a few items. But overall, Shu Yan was quite happy with the place.\u201cHow much is the rent and what are the terms?\u201d asked Shu Yan.\u201cThe landlord is asking $90, but since you are referred by Manager Wang, I can try to barter with them a little. $85 should be fine. The house is really quite good. It was a bit on the pricey side, which is why it is still available. One month rent deposit and three months\u2019 rent upfront. That\u2019s about the same time your house will be ready. Should work out pretty well.\u201d Lao Hu took her to look at the water heater. They weren\u2019t common yet in City Nan. With one of these, they could have instant hot water when they wanted to take a bath.\u201cTell the landlord $70. If he\u2019s okay, I will take it right away.\u201d $90 was a ridiculous amount. She couldn\u2019t believe the landlord dared to ask for such a price.\u201c$70 is impossible,\u201d said Lao Hu as he shook his head. \u201cI can maybe talk him down to $80. It\u2019s not every day you find something that will work, what\u2019s a few dollars?\u201dShu Yan thought about it and felt that would work. She did just throw out $70 out of nowhere. She wanted to barter some more but thinking about the two children. Never mind, setting down soon was more important.\u201cAlright, $80. I can sign the contract and pay right away.\u201d\u201cOkay, let me go talk to the landlord and get back to you. By the way, how do I get hold of you?\u201dTelephones were not yet common back then. Shu Yan gave Lao Hu the name of the hotel and took one last look at the house, then went back to the hotel.Now that she had purchased a house, and the household register and schools were taking care of, all the major issues were more or less resolved. Shu Yan felt relaxed for a change and took the kids out to shop.Ye Tianbao could still get by, but Ye Jingjing truly had no clothes to wear. She was about to start City Xi Grade School. She\u2019d be looked down by others if her outfit were too crummy.One should not think that kids didn\u2019t care about things like that. Precisely because kids were not as good at hiding their emotions, their thinking was only more blatant and cruel.\u201cMom, you are going to buy me clothes?\u201d Ye Jingjing asked in disbelief.Ye Jingjing felt that her mother had changed since they left their old home. She thought she was just dreaming all the time. She never thought her mom would buy new clothes for her. Why was mom so nice to her all of a sudden?\u201cYes, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go get you some clothes,\u201d said Shu Yan as she stroked Ye Jingjing\u2019s fuzzy hair.Back in City Xi, Shu Yan had taken her to a salon and had all her hair cropped off. Ye Jingjing had been wearing a hat since, but it was too hot today, so she had taken it off.\u201cI want some too,\u201d Ye Tianbao acted like a dog off it\u2019s leash once they left the hotel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many girls with ponytails were holding hands, chatting, and laughing on the streets.All these girls were only a decade younger than the original owner\u2019s body, but one was already the mother of two and the others were still in school and would be able to get a good job later on. Life was certainly not fair.\u201cMom, are these all college students?\u201d asked Ye Jingjing as she looked at the girls. Her eyes were sparkling.\u201cYup, if you study hard, you can be a college student in the future too,\u201d said Shu Yan as she stroked Ye Jingjing on her head. Ye Jingjing never had the opportunity to attend college in the original novel; she must really yearn for that opportunity!\u201cI can go to college?\u201d asked Ye Jingjing. Her eyes were filled with anticipation.Back in the village, grandma has always said that girls didn\u2019t need to go to college. They only needed to be hard working. Graduating grade school and being able to read a few words was enough, and her mother had never said anything otherwise. Ye Jingjing had always expected that she would be like just anyone else in the village. She would stay home to help out after grade school, get married when she was the right age, and lived her life like her mother\u2019s. But now, her mother had just told her that she could go to college.\u201cOf course. As long as you can get into a college, mom will send you to college even if we have to sell all of our pots and pans,\u201d said Shu Yan in all seriousness.All of a sudden, Ye Jingjing felt that her mother getting a divorce was a wonderful thing. She didn\u2019t need to slave over housework anymore, or be yelled at, and she would be able to go to college.There were lots of shops on the streets but Shu Yan didn\u2019t see any that sold kids clothes. Perhaps, she hadn\u2019t thought it through. This was a street next to the university town. They sold mainly items geared toward the younger generations. There was a department store nearby, she might be able to find children\u2019s clothing there.When they walked past a food store, Ye Tianbao stopped walking. It was normal for kids to be gluttonous. Shu Yan wouldn\u2019t mistreat the kids when it came to food. This shop sold authentic City Nan snacks, so Shu Yan asked the kids what they\u2019d like to eat. Ye Jingjing only picked one but Ye Tianbao was a whole different story.You gave the kid an inch\u2026. He had noticed that Shu Yan had been more lax in recent days and started to revert a little back to his old self. When Shu Yan freed up her time, she\u2019d really need to spend some time on educating him.She bought two different types for Ye Jingjing and two for Ye Tianbao. It wouldn\u2019t be nice to favor any one of them over the other, regardless of their genders. She wanted to be as fair to the two of them as possible.Ye Tianbao, who only got two items after asking for four or five, wasn\u2019t very happy. But after one bite of the mochi, his eyes lit up and became happy immediately.No kids could resist sweets, smiled Shu Yan to herself.\u201cThis is good,\u201d said Ye Jingjing, showing a few of her tiny teeth. She pushed it over close to Shu Yan\u2019s mouth and said, \u201cHave some too, mom.\u201dShu Yan\u2019s eyes curved and took a small bite. \u201cYes. This is good. You have some more.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you have too much now, you wouldn\u2019t have room then.\u201d Too much mochi was not good for you, especially for younger children who tend to have weaker stomachs and intestines.\u201cI don\u2019t want anything later. I want mochi!\u201d said Ye Tianbao as he flung off Shu Yan\u2019s hand.\u201cAre you being a bad boy again?\u201d Shu Yan\u2019s face darkened and only returned back to normal after she saw fear in him. \u201cYou will have the mooncake. That\u2019s very good too. Give it a try!\u201dYe Tianbao\u2019s eyes lit up again after a bite. \u201cMom, this is good!\u201dIndeed, a kid\u2019s mood could change unpredictably and quickly like weather in June. He was, after all, only 3 years old. Shu Yan couldn\u2019t expect him to be too overly considerate, as long as he wasn\u2019t too overly unreasonable.There was a lot of merchandise in City Nan Department Store. The first floor was all sorts of food and utility items. Ye Tianbao fussed about candies again, but Shu Yan just ignored him. She found out that clothing was on the second floor and just dragged him with her.Following behind Shu Yan and feeling unreconciled, Ye Tianbao said, \u201cI want to go home. I want grandma. I don\u2019t want a bad mom!\u201d\u201cAll you have is a bad mom now. Hurry up, I\u2019ll take you to good food in a bit,\u201d said Shu Yan as she took a look at the pitiful looking Ye Tianbao. She suddenly wanted to burst out into laughter. No, she must stop herself. Otherwise, she would lose all the authority that she had established.There were plenty of people on the second floor, and Shu Yan had noticed a lot of the people purposefully kept a distance from them. She pursed her lips a little and didn\u2019t pay them too much attention. It wouldn\u2019t be necessary.Many people at this era would buy the fabric and sew their own clothes. Shu Yan didn\u2019t have that skill. To be precise, most women in the 21st century had lost that skill. At most, some people knew how to cross stitch.She found a friendly-looking woman and asked about the kids\u2019 clothing section. It\u2019s slightly pricier than making them at home, but they were somewhat fashionable.Perhaps, it was true that fashion tended to recycle. A lot of the clothing that Shu Yan was looking at would not be too outdated even in 2019. In fact, they looked very retro.She bought two sets of stylish outfits for Ye Tianbao and two sets for Ye Jingjing, two dresses, plus a jacket. The kids were growing fast; they\u2019d be growing out of these quickly. Plus, it\u2019s almost fall, they just need a couple of sets to rotate.\u201cBig sister got more than me,\u201d said Ye Tianbao as he pouted.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say you have a lot more clothing than your sister?\u201d said Shu Yan as she pinched him on his cheek. She visited the fabric store with the two children and asked, \u201cCan you please tell me where I can have clothing made?\u201dHer plan was to buy more clothes only after she had lost some weight, but once she had arrived at City Nan, she realized that her outfit was way too outdated. Along with her look, she worried that the kids would be teased when she dropped them off and picked them up in the future. She wanted to buy a couple sets to rotate for the time being, but the stores didn\u2019t even have anything her size.\u201cOh, the street behind the department store. You will see it when you walk over there,\u201d said the store clerk that was around 40-50s. She was particularly friendly with Shu Yan when she saw that Shu Yan had two children with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wanted to have a couple sets of outfits made. Do you have any recommendations on what type of fabrics to use?\u201d Shu Yan had no idea when it came to this area.Shu Yan saw a clean-looking floral pattern fabric. She touched it; it was quite comfortable. She bought some of those as well. She could make a set of pajamas for both herself and Ye Jingjing. Any remaining fabric could be turned into another skirt for Ye Jingjing.They were about to move soon. There was nothing in their new place. They would need to prepare for sheets and comforter covers as well.\u201cWhat do you recommend for bed sheets and comforter covers?\u201dThe woman recommended a couple different types of fabric, and Shu Yan picked a few that she liked in terms of patterns and material. A couple sets to start. Ye Jingjing could sleep on her own and Ye Tianbao was still young and would be sleeping with her.When she walked past the shoe store, Shu Yan looked at their shoes. They were so outdated it wasn\u2019t even funny. She picked a pair of leather shoes and a pair of canvas shoes for herself, and a pair of sandals and a pair of leather shoes for Ye Jingjing. Her original plan was to buy a pair of canvas shoes for Ye Tianbao as his shoe budget was quite high. But, he insisted on a pair of leather shoes and whined about it.Shu Yan finally gave in and bought a pair of leather shoes for him. Looking at how gentlemanly he looked in his new shoes, Shu Yan shook her head, resigned.It was easy finding the tailor shop behind the mall. The tailor was an older man from City Nan. Shu Yan told him what she wanted and he took the measurements of Ye Jingjing and had her come to pick them up in two days\u2019 time.\u201cThank you, Master. How much is the deposit?\u201d\u201c$20. Keep this receipt. Show this when you return to pick up your items.\u201d***\u201cOh mi, you are finally back. The landlord agreed to rent to you for $80 a month and he is waiting for you at the apartment right now. You will be able to move in as soon as you signed the contract today,\u201d said Old Hu as he jogged up to Shu Yan after spotting her from a distance.\u201cOh, I thought we wouldn\u2019t hear back till tomorrow so I took the kids shopping.\u201d Shu Yan smiled. \u201cLet me take them back upstairs first. I will be right back.\u201dAfter telling the two kids to stay inside, Shu Yan went with Old Hu to meet with the landlord at the apartment.One month\u2019s deposit and three months\u2019 rent up front. That came to $320 at $80/month. The contract was simple. Shu Yan skimmed through it and didn\u2019t notice anything out of the ordinary. She signed the contract right away and paid Old Hu another $10 after she had received the house key.There was nothing in the house other than two beds. They\u2019d need a lot more stuff before moving in. It was already getting late today so she\u2019d clean up and move in tomorrow.The three of them have had so much food in the afternoon that none of them were hungry. Shu Yan bathed Ye Tianbao before letting the sister-brother duo go off and play on their own. Shu Yan decided to take a look at how much she has spent in the last couple of days and how much she has remaining.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She spent $150 that afternoon, plus housing rental and agency fees etc. which came out to be $430. She would need to give Manager Wang another $10,000 tomorrow for remodeling. She had spent almost $500,000 in total.The five houses that she sold came out to be $91,000. The cash from Ye Zhiqiang\u2019s company came out to $1.5 million. That plus the original $10,000 saving came out to $2.42 million. Now, she only has $1.92 million.There would be tuition for the two children and after school classes plus other living expenses. She would, of course, have some expenditures herself as well. All said and done, even $1.92 million didn\u2019t seem like a lot of money.That wouldn\u2019t work. She would need to figure out some way to bring in more income. Getting a job was not a realistic option. The original owner only graduated grade school. She wouldn\u2019t be able to get any remotely decent jobs. She didn\u2019t want to go work in a factory. Not to mention she has two children to take care of, she needed her schedule to be flexible. Her best option was to start her own business. It has always been said that back in the 90s, there was gold all over the floor. But one would still need to have the ability to pick them up.Shu Yan\u2019s own parents raised her and her brothers by running a fruit store. A fruit store might not seem much, but its profit was ridiculously high. Even after counting the rotten produce, the profit was still at 50%. But a fruit store was too much work for just one person. Shu Yan didn\u2019t think she would be able to handle that. She had a cousin who had a shoe store; that was a profitable line of business as well. Shu Yan decided to look into the direction of shoes and clothing.That would be a long-term plan. She needed to wait till the kids started school first.\u201cMom, are we going to be staying here permanently?\u201d asked Ye Jingjing after a long hesitation.\u201cYes, and you will be able to start school in a few days. Are you happy about that?\u201d Shu Yan looked at her daughter who had recently gained a little bit of weight. She has a very decent feature. She\u2019d be a pretty girl when she gained a little more weight and her skin tone lightened up another shade or two.\u201cI can start school in a few days?\u201d Ye Jingjing\u2019s eyes lit up.Shu Yan nodded and said, \u201cYes, mom found a good school for you. You should be able to start maybe\u2026. Next week or so.\u201d Today was already Thursday and Manager Wang said he\u2019d let her know by tomorrow. The school might not be as fast plus the weekend. They were probably looking at least until Monday.\u201cMom! I want to go to school too!\u201d said Ye Tianbao. When he saw the excitement in his sister, his own eyes were sparkling as well.\u201cYes, you will be going to school too,\u201d said Shu Yan as she touched the tip of his nose. \u201cYou will need to follow the teacher\u2019s instructions and not fight with other kids, okay? Otherwise, the teacher will scold you and the other kids won\u2019t want to play with you and will you be all alone, alright?\u201d\u201cI promise I won\u2019t fight and will listen to the teachers!\u201d said Ye Tianbao as he pounded on his chest.His promises meant nothing to Shu Yan. She\u2019d find out after for sure after he started school.The next morning, after preparing breakfast for the two children and having a few bites of it herself, Shu Yan still has a lot to take care of \u2013 blankets, propane stove, kitchen stuff, table, chairs, etc. And, she also needed to meet up with Manager Wang and find out about the status of the down payment.There were a few shops right outside the market selling everyday items. Shu Yan bought two blankets, a dining table and chairs set, bowls, plates, utensils, etc. etc. Luckily, cycle rickshaws were very popular back in the days in City Nan. Shu Yan didn\u2019t even have to wave one down before a few stopped in front of her to see if she needed their services. Shu Yan picked a young man to help her move all her stuff onto the cart and then moved them upstairs after they had arrived at their destination. She paid him extra money for his trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The house is still a bit messy.\u201d\u201cNo worries. Little sister came to City Nan for work?\u201d The propane person was a friendly man.With the way she looked and dressed currently, nobody would believe her if she said she was going to start her own business. Shu Yan smiled and said, \u201cExactly. People back in the village always said it\u2019s easy to earn money in City Nan, so I thought I\u2019d come and give it a shot.\u201d\u201cIt is a big city. Anyone who is willing to work hard will be able to make money. In any case, it\u2019s much better than staying in the village and farming. But there aren\u2019t a lot of families using propane gas right now. They are much more expensive than burning coal balls. It\u2019s not worth it. I suggest for you to get a coal stove as well and use coal balls when you are making rice and boiling water and only use the propane gas for stir frying,\u201d said the propane person as he wiped away his sweat and attached the gas to her stove. He started the stove a few times to make sure that it was working properly. \u201cOkay. $50 deposit. $70 total.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a great suggestion. I will go and buy myself a coal stove.\u201d Shu Yan thanked the man.Of course coal balls were more inexpensive, but Shu Yan couldn\u2019t stand the smell. Every time she stood a little too close when she went to buy breakfast, she felt difficulty in breathing and would cough nonstop. Not to mention she has two children at home. That\u2019s not how she wanted to save money.After she had opened up the blanket and hung them up in the sun and finished doing the dishes, Shu Yan locked the door behind her and went to see if her bed sheets and comforter covers were ready.\u201cSir, I came yesterday to have my clothes, bedsheets, and comforter covers. Do you remember me?\u201d Shu Yan scanned around after she\u2019d walked inside the shop. There weren\u2019t a lot of people around. Most people would make all those at home themselves; very rarely would they have them custom made.\u201cI remember you. Your comforter covers are already done. The bedsheets won\u2019t take long. Just have a seat and wait,\u201d said the tailor. Bed Sheets were easy to make. Just have to cut the fabric up and sew up the edges.\u201cLet me go and get something. I will be back in 10 minutes.\u201d Shu Yan planned to go get herself a watch. It was impossible to spend her days without one.Digital watches were already common in City Nan at this time, ranging from $15 \u2013 $100. They were considered very fashionable for their time. Shu Yan, on the other hand, wasn\u2019t wowed by them. In her days, nobody would even look at these when they were being sold for $4 or $5 on the side of the road. She liked analog ones better, especially when the analog ones lasted forever back in these days. She remembered the one her parents bought when they got married. They\u2019ve had it for 30 years, and it was still tracking time accurately.She ended up picking a fairly well-known brand at City Nan that cost her $200. It was perfect for Shu Yan. She had the owner adjusted the time for her and just left it on her wrist. It was almost 11:00 AM. She needed to get back to make lunch for the two kids.\u201cMom,\u201d Ye Jingjing looked like she had let out a big sigh of relief when she saw Shu Yan.Ye Tianbao was fuzzed about going out to play but was stopped by Ye Jingjing. Her face was scratched by her brother. Shu Yan quickly ran up to her and took a look. The two scratch marks were bleeding. Shu Yan\u2019s face dropped. She grabbed Ye Tianbao and gave him two smacks on his bottom.\u201cDo you really think you can get away with everything because I had never spanked you before? Who said you can hit your sister? How dare you?!\u201d\u201cWah!!\u201d Ye Tianbao started to cry.\u201cMom, I am alright,\u201d said Ye Jingjing softly.\u201cDon\u2019t you know how to block when he hits you? What if it leaves a scar?\u201d Shu Yan borrowed some rubbing alcohol from the landlord and disinfected her wound. The landlord also gave Shu Yan some cream and said it was good for scratches. \u201cNext time your brother hits you, you hit him back. Spank him like I just did.\u201dOf course kids fight from time to time, but these two were too worrisome. One was too intimidated, and the other too domineering. Just when she thought he was getting better, she realized that what\u2019s inside wasn\u2019t going to change over the course of a few days.She cooked some noodles for lunch. Ye Jingjing enjoyed it a lot. Ye Tianbao, on the other hand, after he had been taught a lesson, dared not misbehave again. He looked up at Shu Yan from time to time.\u201cYou two come with me this afternoon to help out.\u201d She couldn\u2019t possibly keep them locked up in the hotel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan gave each of them a towel and asked them to wipe down the table and the chairs one more time. She quickly laundered the bed sheets and comforter covers. The sun was strong enough to dry them in an afternoon and they would be able to use them that night.She stretched a little and felt a tug on her arm. Shu Yan looked down and saw Ye Jingjing carrying a glass of water.\u201cMom, have some water.\u201dShu Yan felt comforted at first. Then, frowning, she asked, \u201cWhere did you get the water from?\u201d\u201cFrom the kitchen,\u201d said Ye Jingjing, looking a little frightened from her mother\u2019s look.Shu Yan tried very hard to mellow out and asked, \u201cWere you and your brother drinking tap water at the hotel too?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d said Ye Jingjing as she shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019ve only drank the water out of the tea pot.\u201d\u201cWater from the sink is not clean and can\u2019t be drunk. It will make you sick and you will need to go to the hospital for shots and medicines. You can\u2019t drink out of the tap, okay?\u201d It was natural to drink out of the tap in the villages, especially for someone like Ye Jingjing, who nobody cared about. She probably had that all the time, but it was Shu Yan\u2019s job to teach her to stop doing that.The sun was pretty brutal in September. Shu Yan decided to call a cycle rickshaw and the three of them rode it to the sales center.\u201cMom, this tricycle is awesome. We should buy one too!\u201d The tricycle person chuckled at Ye Tianbao\u2019s words.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to ride this.\u201d\u201cMom can,\u201d Ye Tianbao turned and looked at his mother with excitement.Shu Yan\u2019s mouth twitched. What a good son you were. You wanted your mom to pedal a cycle rickshaw.Xiao Li at the sales center immediately greeted Shu Yan when she spotted her, \u201cManager Wang is waiting for you. He was just about to send me to fetch you.\u201d\u201cMiss Shu, these are your two kids? They are so cute.\u201d Manager Wang had Xiao Li bring the kids some cake before he handed her the application form. \u201cThe school has consented, except that the best class was full right now. You can get into the regular one though.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We are just happy we can get in. Thank you so much for your help, Manager Wang.\u201d Shu Yan took the application forms from Manager Wang. It was just some simple questions on it. Shu Yan was able to complete it quickly with Manager Wang\u2019s help and put it away. \u201cWhen can we go put in our application?\u201d\u201cTomorrow is already Saturday so just wait until Monday.\u201d Manager Wang was very happy. Shu Yan had paid him $500 to take care of this matter and he only spent $20 on two cases of cigarette and had it all ironed out. The remaining $480 all went inside his own pocket. He only wished this would happen more often.Now that all the matters concerning Ye Jingjing was done, getting Ye Tianbao into the kindergarten was much easier. Going to the kindergarten was part of the package. Now that Shu Yan had purchased a house here, Ye Tianbao could start kindergarten whenever. Tuition cost $200 a month, lunch and two snacks were included. That was a lot of one for this time period, but anyone who could afford to buy a house at this location wouldn\u2019t care about that.\u201cThe employee at the remodeling company said he\u2019d like to talk to you in person with regards to your remodeling.\u201d Manager Wang suggested, \u201cOur model homes were designed by City Kong\u2019s best architects. What say we just follow the model home\u2019s design? A lot of people do it that way.\u201d\u201cWe can do that for the kitchen, living room, and bedroom.\u201d Living spaces were even more limited in City Kong, so their designs would fully utilize every inch of space. Their designs would be impeccable. But Shu Yan wanted to remodel the bathroom and the patio according to her own personal taste.\u201cSure, you can communicate your requests to the remodeling staff. They will do a good job.\u201d Manager Wang nodded and asked inquisitively, \u201cDo you have any other relatives or friends who are also looking for a house? If you refer to someone, we can give you a 0.1% kickback.\u201d\u201cNot right now. I will for sure refer this place to them if it comes up.\u201d Shu Yan smiled. This was the first time the two kids had cake and they were thoroughly enjoying it. Shu Yan left them there to enjoy the cake when she went to share some of her thoughts with the remodeling employee.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Ye Jingjing was mature enough to help out wherever she could; the biggest help Ye Tianbao could offer was not to pull their legs.\u201cMom, can I really start school on Monday?\u201d Ye Jingjing had been excited ever since she had learned that she could start school in two days that afternoon.\u201cYes, you will be starting school very soon.

Please stop supporting theft.The new house has a built-in closet, buying another one would be very wasteful. Suddenly, Shu Yan missed Taobao dearly. It has everything and would deliver it to your house. A simple cloth closet would cost less than $100; it wouldn\u2019t even matter if she had to throw it away afterward.But, she\u2019d need to store their clothes somehow in the next few months. Shu Yan had asked for a couple of cardboard boxes from a shop owner when she was buying stuff. She placed one of them at the end of the bed for clean clothes and cut off the tabs on the other ones and put it across from the bed for dirty clothes.She ran downstairs and purchased a cable and a few nails. On her way back, she purposefully picked up a piece of rock. She \u201chammered\u201d the two nails on each side of the wall and pulled the cable across the room. When she was done, she tugged on it gently. It was somewhat sturdy. She then transferred all the clothes hanging at the end of the bed onto the cable. That\u2019d have to do for now.Neither one of the children were hungry for dinner after all the cakes that they had earlier at the sales center. Shu Yan just had a tomato for dinner.Ye Jingjing was sleeping in the other room. She was used to sleeping by herself at her old place, so she wasn\u2019t afraid. Ye Tianbao would be sharing a bed with Shu Yan. He was jumping up and down the bed when he first got on, making the wooden bed creak with a \u201cthud\u201d, \u201cthud\u201d noise.\u201cTianbao, go to bed. I\u2019ll take you to see the new house tomorrow,\u201d said Shu Yan gently as she tried to control her temper after she had returned from collecting the clothes from the patio.Now, she fully understood why so many women had bad temper after they had gotten married and had children. It wasn\u2019t that they wanted to lose their temper, but life was just tiring. At least she has money now; she couldn\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019d be like if she didn\u2019t even have money.\u201cStop jumping. Mom is going to get mad at you if you don\u2019t stop now.\u201d Shu Yan recalled some child-rearing expert saying how one shouldn\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to a child, nor threaten them. One must patiently reason with them. She\u2019d like to have that expert come to reason with an unruly child. She\u2019d love to see how he could convince an unruly child to sit down and listen to his reasoning.Looking at Shu Yan\u2019s darkened look, Ye Tianbao finally stopped jumping and laid down, \u201cMom, I am thirsty.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shu Yan got up and poured him a glass of water. She waited for him to finish drinking and put the glass down before she went back to lay down on the bed.\u201cMom. I want to go pee. Got to go pee.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shu Yan carried him to the bathroom to pee before she returned and laid down.\u201cMom, I can\u2019t sleep.\u201dShu Yan\u2026.. just turned the lights off and shoved Ye Tianbao into the bed, \u201cSleep. Otherwise I am going to leave you home by yourself tomorrow and only take your sister out to play.\u201dAfter a long while, he finally fell asleep. Shu Yan let out a sigh of relief. As the saying goes, one would only know the sacrifice of a parent after one has their own children. That was so true. She never knew how tiring it could be to raise kids. She thought about her old schoolmates and colleagues. They had to work and take care of the kids, along with cooking and cleaning. She had made the right decision to not get married in the past.In the morning, while the two kids were still sleeping, Shu Yan brushed her teeth and went to get breakfast. The sun had just risen when she returned home. She woke both children up. She wanted to go check the new place today. She wouldn\u2019t feel right not checking in on it at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When they arrived, the workers were already there. The foreman ran out to greet Shu Yan when he spotted her.\u201cMiss Shu, you are here to check on your house?\u201d\u201cYeah. Taking the two kids to go check out the kindergarten and thought I\u2019d swing by here and take a look.\u201d Shu Yan smiled. After checking out the master bedroom, she led the two kids to go check out their rooms.\u201cJingjing, this is going to be your room in the future. Mom is going to get you pink curtains and beddings, unless you want some other colors? Just let me know. This is the closet. We will get a new desk and bookshelves after the remodeling is completed. Is there anything else that you want?\u201dYe Jingjing looked at her room happily. She never imagined that she\u2019d one day have her own room. Plus, mom just said she\u2019d buy her all new stuff, and the room would be in pink.\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Ye Jingjing summoned her courage and asked, \u201cCan I have a doll?\u201dAt her aunt\u2019s home, she had seen a doll on her cousin\u2019s bed. She loved it, but she never dared to say that out loud.\u201cOf course,\u201d Shu Yan would agree to any reasonable requests from the kids.There was not much to be seen at this stage of the remodeling, but Shu Yan still brought Ye Tianbao to check out his room. She told him that that\u2019d be his room and asked what color he would like. Not surprisingly, he picked blue.The two children had lived in a new house at City Xi previously so they didn\u2019t understand the happiness of having a new house, nor would they share Shu Yan\u2019s excitement about buying a new house in City Nan.Aye! Casting pearls before swine.After the house, she took them to the food market and the two children became excited immediately.When they walked past the fish stall, Ye Tianbao refused to walk and fuzzed about buying a fish. Shu Yan figured they haven\u2019t had a lot of meat lately, so she bought a fish like he asked. Then, he refused to walk again when they got to the duck and chicken shop.\u201cMom! Mom! Chicken! Can we get a little chicken?\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019ve got a fish already. We are not buying anything else.\u201d If she was to buy everything that he asked for, he\u2019d probably want one of everything that\u2019s alive in the market, with the exception of humans.***Ye Tianbao bawled his eyes out over lunch when he saw the fish, \u201cMom is a bad person!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Shu Yan thought he wanted to eat fish, but he wanted one as a pet?\u201cWhat should we do? Mom has already cooked it? You don\u2019t want any? It\u2019s very tasty! If you don\u2019t want any then mom and big sister will have it all.\u201dYe Tianbao finally had some fish soup as he continued to sob. Shu Yan worried about the bones in the fish and didn\u2019t give him any of the meat.They were only going to be there for a few months, so Shu Yan didn\u2019t plan on cleaning up more around the house. She stayed home on Sunday and rested with the kids. Early in the evening, when the sun wasn\u2019t as strong, Shu Yan took the kids out to get their book bag and stationery.\u201cI want that one!\u201d said Ye Tianbao as he pointed at a blue one.\u201cJingjing, which one do you want?\u201d Shu Yan thought she\u2019d pick the pink one, instead, she picked a black one.\u201cYou like black?\u201d If that was the case, they might want to change up the decoration for her new room a little.Ye Jingjing shook her head, \u201cNo, black hides dirt better.\u201dShu Yan was speechless for a brief moment before she squatted down and asked Ye Jingjing again. \u201cNever mind that. Which one do you like?\u201d\u201cThat one,\u201d said Ye Jingjing as she pointed at a pink one shyly.Shu Yan patted her on her head. \u201cThen that\u2019s the one we will get. You are just a child, just focus on studying hard, eating and sleeping lots. Don\u2019t worry too much about other things.\u201dShe suddenly thought about Ye Jingjing\u2019s hair. She\u2019d most likely be teased because of her super short hair. Shu Yan bought her a red and a pink hat, \u201cIf anyone asked, just tell them you had bad hair before so your mom cut them all off for them to grow back out, okay?\u201dIf Ye Jingjing told the other kids that her hair was cropped off because of head lice, the kids might not know what that was at first, but they\u2019d no doubt ask their parents after they\u2019ve gone home. The parents for sure wouldn\u2019t let them play with Ye Jingjing again, even if she no longer has hair lice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She informed the guard of the purpose of their visit, but the guard wouldn\u2019t let them through until he could see the application form.\u201cOkay, go on in,\u201d said the guard finally after he had looked at their application form.\u201cCan you please tell me where to go to register?\u201d This was Shu Yan\u2019s first time there. She had no idea which direction the office was.\u201cWalk all the way down that way. When you see a flower bed, make a left and go up the stairs. The office was the second room on the third floor.\u201d\u201cThank you. Say \u2018bye bye\u2019 to grandpa.\u201d Ye Jingjing and Ye Tianbao waved and said goodbye to the guard obediently.City Xi Grade School has 9 classes per level and Ye Jingjing was assigned to Class #5, right smack in the middle. Shu Yan didn\u2019t say much about that. If Ye Jingjing was good at school, she\u2019d naturally be moved to a better class. Contrarily, if her grades were bad, she\u2019d be moved to a worse one. Shu Yan didn\u2019t plan on putting too much pressure on the kids.\u201cJingjing\u2019s mom, this is the receipt for the tuition for you. In addition, she\u2019d need specific uniforms and shoes for school. Do you know her size? We suggest buying the next size up, so they will last one more year. Or even two sizes larger. Many parents do that too.\u201d The teacher was a very gentle woman. She was very soft spoken to Shu Yan.\u201cMy kid has always been skinny. Even the smallest size is probably big on her.\u201d Shu Yan had heard of uniforms before. This was, however, the first time she has heard of uniform shoes.Before long, the teacher came back with two sets of uniforms. Ye Jingjing tried on the jacket and, sure enough, it was too big for her.\u201cJingjing is too skinny. Jingjing\u2019s mom, you need to give her more nutrients. If you don\u2019t do that now, it just might be too late.\u201d The teacher took a look at the white and chubby little boy behind Shu Yan and was a little bit displeased, \u201cWe are in a new age now. Both sons and daughters will be nice to their parents when they are successful in life.\u201dShu Yan understood what she was saying but didn\u2019t bother to explain herself. \u201cYou are right. I will get her some nutritious foods on my way back.\u201dIt was, after all, someone else\u2019s family business and the teacher couldn\u2019t say much more, \u201cSchool is about to start. Let me take Jingjing to her class now.\u201dShu Yan squatted down and adjusted the collar for her daughter, \u201cListen to your teachers and be nice to your classmates, okay?\u201d\u201cMm. I will be a good girl and listen to the teachers.\u201d Ye Jingjing left with the teacher as she turned around and looked back frequently.Shu Yan was worried, so she sneaked to Class #5 and peeked behind the door. She left with Ye Tianbao only after she saw Ye Jingjing sitting at her seat and talking to the kid next to her.The process of registering for the kindergarten was much simpler. All she needed to do was to pay and register. Plus, the little brat was heartless. He had forgotten all about his mother as soon as he saw other kids.Now that both kids were in school, Shu Yan suddenly felt some emptiness in her heart. Something seemed to be missing in the house.After the kids had gone to school, she needed to start making her own plans. First she needed to lose weight, followed by taking care of her skin. Finally, she\u2019d need to start her own business. Everything needed to move up the schedule.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For example, some of the locations that were not yet developed in Shu Yan\u2019s world had already been developed; other locations that have already been developed in her world had no signs of being developed. Shu Yan took it all in stride. City Nan, being one of the biggest cities of the country, would be developed fully in the future. There was not enough land for the developers; it was all a matter of time.Nobody is stupid. The country needed development and City Nan needed development. All the locals were waiting to strike rich when the developers purchased the land from them. Everybody was holding onto their houses, and nobody would sell right now.It was best to buy a few old houses in the countryside where nobody lived and wait for it to be bought after 1999. Then one would really strike it rich.After walking around the entire morning, Shu Yan had a much better idea about the surrounding areas. She wouldn\u2019t be able to cover the slightly farther areas today. It was time to go home and cook for her kids.Ye Tianbao\u2019s kindergarten would provide lunch, but Ye Jingjing\u2019s school did not have a cafeteria. Many of the parents would prepare ahead of time and put the food in thermos for the kids to bring to school with them. Shu Yan didn\u2019t realize that before. She, too, should buy a thermos for Jingjing to bring with her. That way she wouldn\u2019t need to go back and forth in the hot summer days.\u201cMom, where\u2019s little brother?\u201d It\u2019s natural for a kid to be close to their mothers. It had only been a few days and Jingjing was already quite close with Shu Yan.\u201cTianbo will be eating at school. Do a lot of your schoolmates go home for lunch?\u201d Shu Yan saw the pouring sweat on her daughter and quickly handed her a wet towel. \u201cWipe your face with this. When you go back in the afternoon, bring an umbrella with you. Too much sun can be bad for you.\u201dShu Yan wasn\u2019t sure about the original owner, but Ye Zhiqiang was pretty light-skinned. When Ye Jingjing was born, she was a lot like Ye Zhiqiang and was quite light-skinned. She had become much darker from being exposed to the sun a lot back in the village. She should be able to go back to being light-skinned after a while.Ye Tianbao, on the other hand, looked more like Shu Yan. His features were quite elegant and also light-skinned. Shu Yan hoped that his skin tone was also liked hers; that\u2019d mean that her skin tone was also lighter by nature. She might still have a shot of becoming lighter colored. But no point in worrying about that right now. First and foremost, she needed to lose some weight.\u201cOther than the few who lived right next to the school, most of the other kids bring lunch to school. I\u2019d like to do that too,\u201d said Ye Jingjing as she carefully looked at Shu Yan. She had never been with so many kids before. The boys back in the village were very naughty and always picked on the girls. As for girls, most of them had to stay home to help out with housework. Those with younger brothers needed to take care of their younger brothers. Very few of the village girls had time to play outside.Plus, the girl sitting next to her in class was very nice and said she wanted to have lunch with her.\u201cSure. That has been my plan anyway. The sun is too strong these few days. It\u2019s too much for you to go back and forth.\u201dIt was too hot in the afternoon, so Shu Yan didn\u2019t cook rice but bought a few steam buns instead. In addition, she made some potato and spareribs with the pressure cooker. For ingredients, she had added corn, taro, and mushrooms. It made a big pot of food. So there was both soup and vegetables. Ye Jingjing had two large steam buns and two full bowls of sparerib soup that were full of vegetables.\u201cMom, this is so tasty,\u201d said Ye Jingjing as she burped.\u201cIf you like it so much, I will make it for you again next time.\u201d Shu Yan learned this lazy way of cooking from her own mother. Shu Yan\u2019s mother was always busy with manning the fruit store, so during summer, she\u2019d make a big pot of sparerib soup in the afternoon with different ingredients. It\u2019d be potatoes one day, taros the next, and corn on another day. According to her mother, the dishes were different every day. Then, she\u2019d buy a big bag of steamed buns. It fed the entire family plus there would be left over for soup at night.Shu Yan did that a lot when she was living alone. She had ran around all morning long. And, as it was too hot out, she decided to go with the lazy man method today.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many parents felt that kids need to focus only on school work and not be bothered by housework at all. More importantly, they also worried that the kids\u2019 \u201chelp\u201d would end up creating more work for them. That was how Shu Yan\u2019s family was like. No matter how busy or tired her parents were, they would never let herself or her brother help out with housework. They\u2019d be scolded for preparing dinner. Over time, Shu Yan and her brother had got into the habit of not doing housework.The experience that Shu Yan learned from herself and her brother was not to assume that the kids wouldn\u2019t be able to do a good job. How\u2019d one even know if they wouldn\u2019t even let the kids do them at all? Of course, she wasn\u2019t suggesting to let the kids take care of all the housework either, but to let them do what they could and help where they could. That way, the kids would learn that it wasn\u2019t easy to be parents and also not be lazy and ignorant about housework and cooking after they\u2019ve grown up.\u201cAlright, why don\u2019t you go take an hour nap? Mom will wake you up when it\u2019s time to go back to school.\u201d Shu Yan dried her hands and lit up the incense to repel mosquitos. City Nan had a ridiculous amount of mosquitos, even worse in this older small district. The two kids have delicate skin and each insect bite would end up to be a big lump. It was impossible for them to sleep without incense.The sun was right smack in the middle of the sky in the afternoon and Shu Yan dared not go outside. She decided to go take a nap herself as well, but worrying about oversleeping and making Ye Jingjing be late for school, she woke up about every ten minutes or so and felt even worse than not napping at all. She should probably get an alarm clock; it was too difficult without one.After Ye Jingjing had gone back to school, Shu Yan was the only one left at home. She put a straw mat on the ground and started doing burpees on it. It slipped after a couple sets, so she decided to do it on the ground directly. She had done this for a while in the past, so she knew the proper way of doing it. She rested for a few seconds between each set. Her thighs started to get sore after five sets, and she started thinking about giving up.She already has kids, a house, and money. Was it really necessary to go through the pain of losing weight? She should give up. What\u2019s wrong with laying down? What\u2019s wrong with enjoying yummy food? As long as she gave up on the idea of losing weight, her life could be so much easier.No! Shu Yan shook off those dangerous thoughts. She started thinking about all sorts of pretty dresses. She wanted to become so pretty and beautiful that those back at City Xi would go blind from just looking at her. She must change herself and look like a real 25 year old, so she could have a real life.She did burpees for five minutes and wanted to just lay down on the ground and not get up again. She sipped a little bit of water, took a two minute break, and resumed exercising.\u201cI must prevail. Victory is mine. I want to wear dresses. I want to wear cheongsam. I want good-for-nothing men to go blind from looking at how much I shine. I want compliments when I go pick up the kids \u2013 \u2018oh mi, you don\u2019t look like you have kids\u2026\u2019\u201dAfter ten minutes, Shu Yan\u2019s legs were trembling, and sweat soaked through her clothes. Okay, ten minutes was good enough for today. One couldn\u2019t push too hard when one first started out. It could injure the muscles. She needed to increase the intensity gradually.Having rested a little, it was already 3 PM in the afternoon and the sun wasn\u2019t as deadly as before. Shu Yan decided to go look for Lao Hu.She had a preliminary idea of her future business. Of the four major areas \u2013 food, clothing, living, and transportation \u2013 living and transportation required too much capital, she didn\u2019t have what it would take. Food and clothing had a lower barrier to entry with high return. Selling food out of a stall was easy, but she has no skills, so clothing was the only option left.A direction by itself wasn\u2019t enough. One would need connections and that\u2019s where a local like Lao Hu came in.Last time, before Lao Hu took off, he gave her an address that wasn\u2019t far from the sales office. That area has not yet been developed and were mostly old houses. One of the courtyard\u2019s doors was wide open, so Shu Yan knew that must be Lao Hu\u2019s place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come in, come in.\u201d Lao Hu was resting under the shade of a large tree in the courtyard and quickly got up to greet Shu Yan when he spotted her.\u201cI am here for some help.\u201d Shu Yan followed him inside and looked around. The living room had been converted into an office and on the left side, there hung a lot of maps of City Nan. \u201cBoss Hu, you must be quite familiar with City Nan?\u201d\u201cNo need to ask. I know everything in City Nan like the back of my hand.\u201dShu Yan smiled at his response. Only time would tell if he was telling the truth.\u201cI want to know whether there are a lot of clothing and shoe stores over on South City Nan Road and how busy is that area?\u201d\u201cYup, that entire street has clothing and shoes stores. They have been getting progressively busier in the last couple of years. Why? Are you thinking about going into the clothing business yourself?\u201d asked Lao Hu as he looked suspiciously at Shu Yan. One needed to be pretty to be in the clothing business. If the clothes didn\u2019t look good on you, why would anyone else buy them from you?Ah, so South City Nan Road was still around. Shu Yan was pleased to hear that. In her own world, South City Nan Road was the place to go for middle to high end clothing, shoes, and jewelries for many white-collar workers. Shu Yan used to go there whenever she had time and would buy a set or two pretty clothes to reward herself.She had gone there with a colleague once, and her colleague had told her that the rent there cost upward of several millions, tens of millions to purchase, and over a billion on the golden strip. And, that\u2019s if that was any available for sale. Which was why when Shu Yan decided to move into the clothing market, she immediately thought of South City Nan Road. Preferably, she could purchase her own shop. She could use it as a shop now and should she decide on quitting later, she could also rent it out. Several millions a year would be enough for her to live off of.\u201cYou are looking to buy?\u201d asked Lao Hu happily.Buying and renting are very different. How much would he be able to get for a percentage of the rent?\u201cExactly. If the location is good and the building was decent, I\u2019d just buy it,\u201d nodded Shu Yan.\u201cYou are exactly right. It\u2019s always better to own than to rent. You can remodel it however you want and can stay in business for as long as you want without having to worry about the landlord taking it back. Plus, the area on South City Nan Road was quite good. I am sure it will appreciate.\u201d Luo Hu had just listed out all the pros of owning one\u2019s own house.\u201cAppreciation not so much. Mainly, I want to start my own business, and it\u2019s much easier to buy my own storefront.\u201d Shu Yan smiled. The house prices would remain mostly the same in the next few years, but the cost of storefront would increase exponentially.The task of looking for a storefront would be handled by Lao Hu. Next on her agenda, Shu Yan planned to go get a couple mosquito net curtains and also picked up her newly-made clothes from the tailor.There were some clothes that would work for Shu Yan at the department store as well, but most of them were ugly and very outdated in style. Which was why Shu Yan had purchased some fabric and took them to the tailors for some custom outfits. When she was there earlier, Shu Yan had purposefully asked the tailor to make the clothes in high-rise style and the pants not too loose. She looked much better in the clothes that made her look skinnier.\u201cSir, your technique is very good. I will be back for more.\u201d Now that her stomach, butt, and thighs were covered up, she had instantaneously gone from obese to just a bit overweight. She\u2019d look much younger once she had her hair taken care of.She didn\u2019t have much time left today. Ye Tianbao was about to get out of school. Shu Yan would look for a salon tomorrow for a new hairstyle.When Ye Tianbao saw his mother today, he rubbed his eyes and asked, \u201cMom?\u201d\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t recognize your own mother any more because I have a new outfit on?\u201d Shu Yan couldn\u2019t help but pat him on his little head as she held him hand to go pick up Ye Jingjing from the grade school.\u201cMom.\u201d Ye Jingjing walked out from the school with her backpack, held Shu Yan\u2019s hand as she turned and waved goodbye to her classmates, \u201cMom, you look pretty today.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two kids were still growing, so Shu Yan made them two dishes plus a soup and made herself boiled cabbage and carrots with just a little bit of oil and salt. The green cabbage and orange carrots looked really pretty and tasty, but Ye Tianbao had just one piece of carrot and didn\u2019t want anything to do with it anymore.\u201cWhy is mom eating that?\u201d Ye Jingjing was much more thoughtful. She thought that they had run out of money and that\u2019s all mom could eat while she saved the rest for them.Shu Yan smiled at her and said, \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Mom is not eating rice so she can lose weight. You guys hurry up and eat.\u201dWeight loss by portion control was truly painful, especially when the two piggies were slurping down their dinner next to her. Shu Yan had to imagine that she was eating the most amazingly delectable meal in order to eat her food one small bite at a time.The original owner had a very good appetite. She had always had two big bowls of rice along with fatty meats. After she had transmigrated over, Shu Yan had controlled herself to eating only until 80% full and no pork for dinner. She had finally lost a little bit of weight since. Tonight she had only eaten till 60% full and mostly soup and vegetables. She was hungry by 9 PM.She worried about waking the kids, so she turned to her side to put some pressure on her stomach. She felt so hungry that it was like a fire burning inside her stomach and she kept on salivating. Shu Yan closed her eyes uncomfortably, hoping that once she fell asleep she wouldn\u2019t feel the hunger anymore. Except that she realized she was so hungry she couldn\u2019t fall asleep at all.No wonder they said the worst kind of death was starving to death. Shu Yan could truly understand that now. She let out a long sigh and wanted to get up and go get some water. She felt that all her limbs were shaking, but of course, that was just her imagination. She drank some hot water and the discomfort in her stomach alleviated a little. She saw the leftover food out of the corners of her eyes and gulped but quickly went back into bed.Shu Yan continued her inner struggle. What\u2019s wrong with being fat? You can eat whatever you want. How happy is that? No, must lose weight, must persist. When I walk outside with Jingjing and Tianbo, people think I am their grandmother. How hurtful was that? Must lose weight. Goal is to be pretty, pretty, pretty.She fell asleep at some point in time. When it was morning, perhaps she had been hungry for too long, she didn\u2019t even feel hunger anymore. She went out to buy breakfast and got the kids milk, buns, and eggs and just a glass of soy milk and an egg for herself.Breakfast is essential. Health was also important even during a diet. Shu Yan ate her breakfast on her way back, and her face was filled with happiness.\u201cEat quickly then we\u2019ll head to school, okay?\u201d Shu Yan peeled the eggs for the two kids and walked inside the kitchen to prepare lunch for Ye Jingjing.She rinsed the rice and cooked it. She even purposefully cooked a little extra so she could make herself fried rice or rice with water during lunch. Braised pork belly would take a while to make. Shu Yan stir fried it in the pan before putting them inside the pressure cooker. She peeled and added two more hard boiled eggs inside and it took only ten minutes before it was ready. She minced less fatty portion of the meat that she saved from early and sliced up the string beans for a simple dish of minced pork with string beans. Ye Jingjing\u2019s lunch now has two dishes plus two eggs.\u201cMom gave you quite a bit of food. Don\u2019t forget to share with your classmates. There is also milk; don\u2019t forget to drink that. Don\u2019t forget to have your fruit after lunch. I put a banana in this side pocket. Be careful not to squish it.\u201d Shu Yan gave her detailed instructions as she packed her lunch box.\u201cOkay. Thank you, mom,\u201d said Ye Jingjing as she nodded obediently.Ye Tianbao could have lunch at school, but Shu Yan gave him some crackers that he could also share with his classmates.From where they were staying, they\u2019d walk past City Xi Grade School on their way to the kindergarten, so the three of them headed out together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Little kids sure could make friends quickly. Ye Jingjing already has close friends that she could go to the bathroom together after just one day.Contrarily to her daughter, Shu Yan was more worried about Ye Tianbao. She carefully told him not to fight with other kids in school. He had to get along with everyone else.\u201cWhat if someone else hit me?\u201d pouted Ye Tianbao, feeling unreconciled.Shuyan: Stunned silent. How should she answer that one? He was waiting\u2026 This was urgent\u2026.Shu Yan hesitated for a long while as Ye Tianbao continued to stare at her and finally said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to hit someone, so Tianbo should never get into a fight. But if someone else tries to hit you, you should fight back and protect yourself. Or ask a teacher for help.\u201dThat was a good answer, right? Shu Yan was a little bit worried. Raising kids was no easy feat.\u201cRemember to share your crackers with the other kids. Now go inside!\u201d said Shu Yan as she patted him on his head.\u201cWait, Tianbo\u2019s mom.\u201d Teacher Liu, Ye Tianbao\u2019s teacher, stopped Shu Yan on her way.\u201cHi, Teacher Liu.\u201d Shu Yan looked at her with uncertainty. Did Tianbo get into trouble in just one day?\u201cAs it goes, we are a dual language kindergarten. The best way to learn a language is with lot of practice so ideally the parents will also help with teaching the kids at home as well. This is an outside institution that is run by our principal. We hope that you will go visit it with your child when you have time and learn with your child,\u201d said Teacher Liu as she handed a flyer to Shu Yan.So all this was just a big propaganda on their foreign language institution.\u201cSure. I\u2019ll go take a look when I have a chance,\u201d said Shu Yan with a smile.After the teacher was gone and while Shu Yan was debating whether she wanted to go check it out, she was stopped by another kid\u2019s parent.\u201cThe teacher gave you a flyer too? Isn\u2019t this kindergarten already dual language? Why do we need to sign them up to another institution? What difference would it make for kids this age?\u201d\u201cExactly. And it cost $200 a month with just lunch. And now they are asking us to sign up for some institution? I say they just want to make more money off of us. No way. I am going to go check with the property management company,\u201d said an older woman looking displeased.It looked like many of them were quite unhappy about this institution. Shu Yan didn\u2019t express her opinion on it. She wanted to see how the principal responded after the parents voiced their opinions.Speaking of institutions, Ye Jingjing wasn\u2019t young anymore. She should remember to ask her what kind of interest she has when she has a chance. It won\u2019t hurt to have some extracurricular activities.She had already arrived at Nanfu Mansion so Shu Yan decided to go check on the remodeling progress of the new house. She worried that the workers would skim on her job if she didn\u2019t check on them periodically.\u201cOh hi, Miss Shu. Perfect timing. We just finished laying down the things for the water and electricity and placed the sockets per your specifications. Please do take a look and see if we have missed anything.\u201d After spotting her, the foreman walked Shu Yan over to check on all the socket locations.People back then didn\u2019t have a lot of requirements for sockets. One bedroom would have maybe up to two outlets. Shu Yan felt that that was way less than enough. For example, the air conditioner would require one, and the tea pot. They didn\u2019t have all these yet, but they would in the future. If she were to have these added later, they\u2019d need to knock down the entire wall to do so. What a hassle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan took a peek from the patio and noticed that the owner planned to close off the patio. It so happened that the owner was there as well and smiled at Shu Yan when she saw her. \u201cYou are the owner next door? I didn\u2019t see you here yesterday when I was over.\u201d\u201cYes. Hi. I wasn\u2019t able to make it here yesterday. Why are you closing off your patio?\u201d That was the patio for the second bedroom. It would kill off the light source after she had closed it off.\u201cYeah, we have a lot of people in our household so we plan to close off the patio to add another room,\u201d said the woman next door as she walked closer to Shu Yan. \u201cMy last name is Zhang, and I\u2019m probably a few years older than you. If you don\u2019t mind, you can call me Zhang-jie. How should I call you?\u201d\u201cMy name is Shu Yan; you can call me Xiao Yan.\u201d Shu Yan was baffled. \u201cIf you wanted one more room, why not buy the 90 m2 unit?\u201d It came with four rooms and no need to close off the patio.\u201cI have four kids, three daughters and a son. The son would take the second bedroom and we are going to convert this large room into three separate rooms for my three daughters. When all of my daughters are married off, we can knock out this room and turn it into a 3-bedroom apartment with living and dining rooms. It would make a good house for my son when he gets married.\u201d Zhang-jie was smiling brightly as though she could already see the day that her son got married.Shu Yan was speechless for a while. She had three daughters in a row and still insisted on going till she has a son. She was obviously the type who was crazy for sons. She wouldn\u2019t be able to reason with someone like that. Plus, it was her personal business, so it wasn\u2019t her place to comment.\u201cHow many kids do you have, Xiao Yan?\u201d Zhang-jie recollected herself and asked.\u201cI have two. Older one is a daughter and the younger one is a son.\u201d Shu Yan smiled lightly.\u201cOh, one of each. How perfect is that?\u201d said Zhang-jie enviously.\u201cYou are lucky too. You will have four kids helping you out later.\u201d Shu Yan didn\u2019t want to go on to talk about her husband and kids, so she looked for an excuse to go back inside the house.All in all, Zhang-jie seemed pretty friendly. It\u2019s better to have friendly neighbors than not-so-friendly neighbors. Shu Yan walked around one more time and went over to the salon.Her hair was a bit curly naturally, so no matter what she did, it always seemed messy. Loose strands were all over her face, much like herself. It was sad to even look at them.She found a decent-looking salon and went inside. \u201cDo you do perming here?\u201d\u201cYes, what kind of perm?\u201d asked the salon worker.\u201cI also want to cut my hair, to like here.\u201d Shu Yan gestured with her hand and asked again, \u201cCan you straighten them also?\u201d\u201cSure, but right now wavy hair is in. Look at all the actresses in movies from Hong Kong. All of them had big, wavy hair. It\u2019s so pretty,\u201d suggested the hair stylist as he took Shu Yan to the hair wash station.\u201cNot with my hair. Straightening would suffice.\u201d Shu Yan knew her own hair quite well. Wavy hair was pretty. Problem was once she washed them at home, she\u2019d look like she was struck by lightning after her hair dried. She wouldn\u2019t even be able to tie them up into a ponytail.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as the wrong kind of hair, only hair stylists with poor techniques. Have you tried it before? Don\u2019t worry. I will make you look pretty. I have been doing this for years. I guarantee it\u2019d look good.\u201d The hairstylist kept on going.Shu Yan frowned. This was the reason she didn\u2019t like going to a salon. She said in a point-blank way, \u201cI just want my hair straightened. If you can\u2019t do that, I can always go somewhere else.\u201dThe stylist went quiet all of a sudden. But about a minute later, he started chatting Shu Yan up about other subjects like Where are you from? Are you married? What are you doing at City Nan?Shu Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA few up and down with the scissors and the original owner\u2019s hair that she had spent years keeping were cropped down to just below shoulder\u2019s length, a medium short length. After they have been straightened along with Shu Yan\u2019s current wide face, ummmmmm, it was quite ugly.The hairstylist looked at Shu Yan sadly with a I-told-you-so-and-this-really-looked-bad look.\u201cThank you. I am happy with it.\u201d She was happy with the result of her hair being straightened. Her hair was now straight like steel.She tied her hair up into a ponytail, and she looked much cleaner and her whole person appeared much livelier. Shu Yan paid and left.Her hair was truly atrocious to straighten. What would take a normal person three hours took her at least five. She had missed lunch completely, so she just went home and had some rice with water. Half an hour later, she did burpees for 10 minutes before she showered, changed, and went to buy groceries. Then, it was about time to go pick up the kids.Nothing happened with Ye Tianbao, but when she went to pick up Ye Jingjing, Shu Yan was asked to stay behind by a teacher.Shu Yan had always expected this to happen one day, but she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be over Ye Jingjing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She wasn\u2019t the type who\u2019d cause trouble; she was the type who wouldn\u2019t even say anything when she was bullied. As opposed to Ye Tianbao, Shu Yan was more worried that her daughter was being bullied.\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry just yet. Just some misunderstandings between the kids was all,\u201d said the teacher as she smiled gently.Shu Yan let out a sigh of relief. When she walked into the office, she saw an elegantly-dressed woman who was comforting a crying little girl. Two other kids were standing in front of the teacher\u2019s desk \u2013 one of them looked like a very naughty kind of little boy, and the other one was her daughter.\u201cHi, you are Jinging\u2019s mom, right?\u201d The woman subtly examined Shu Yan. Shu Yan was average looking and a bit on the chubby side. She looked like a village woman, but her outfit was very fitting and of fairly decent quality, and it was paired with leather kitten heels. Her hair was neatly drawn to the back of her head, and her eyes clear and pure. The way she dressed and her makings didn\u2019t reverberate that of a village woman. All in all, she exudes the vibe of contradiction.\u201cYes, I am Jingjing\u2019s mother, and you are?\u201d Shu Yan took a look at the little girl next to her. It was the girl who walked into the school holding hands with Jingjing in the morning.\u201cI am Wong Yitong\u2019s mother. My last name is Lin, and my first name is Hui. You can call me Lin Hui. How should I refer to you?\u201d Lin Hui had heard about Ye Jingjing from her daughter several times already. She wasn\u2019t going to interfere with who she befriended.Of course, it\u2019d be best if she could make good friends.\u201cMy name is Shu Yan,\u201d said Shu Yan as she turned and looked at Ye Jingjing. She squatted down in front of her and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dYe Jingjing took a look at her mother, intimidated. Noticing that her mother wasn\u2019t upset, her eyes reddened.\u201cMom,\u201d was all she said. Shu Yan was about to die from anxiety.Right then, Teacher Zhang walked in with another woman, obviously the mother of the little boy.\u201cLet me introduce you, this is Wang Yitong\u2019s mother and this is Ye Jingjing\u2019s mother. And this one, next to me, is Zhang Chenghan\u2019s mother. It wasn\u2019t a big deal, really. This afternoon, Zhang Chenghan wanted to have some of the braised pork in Ye Jingjing\u2019s bowl, and since Wang Yitong didn\u2019t want to have lunch with a boy, there was a squabble between them. Then, during their PE (physical education) class in the afternoon, Zhang Chenghan took away Ye Jingjing\u2019s hat, and Wang Yitong argued with him over that. The PE teacher stopped them quickly, and I have already chastised Classmate Zhang Chenghan. He already admitted that he was wrong and apologized to Classmate Ye Jingjing. I just wanted to have you all here and explained the situation to you.\u201d Teacher Zhang recounted the events that day to the three mothers.Shu Yan turned and looked at the kids. The little boy seemed to be aware that he was wrong and kept his head lowered. Ye Jingjing just held onto Shu Yan\u2019s hand without making a sound. Wang Yitong, the little girl who had been crying this entire time, had opened Shu Yan\u2019s eyes. She would never had thought that such a delicate and fragile little girl would stand up for Ye Jingjing.\u201cTongtong, you are all classmates, plus the dish belonged to Classmate Jingjing, how could you not let others have any? Didn\u2019t mom say you have to be nice to all your classmates?\u201d Lin Hui was the first to talk to her own child.\u201cBut he\u2019s a boy. Daddy said we shouldn\u2019t eat lunch with boys.\u201d Wang Yitong felt wronged. \u201cPlus, he ripped off Jingjing\u2019s hat and made fun of her that she has no hair and looked like a boy. He even threw her hat away. He\u2019s not a nice boy, and I don\u2019t want to be friends with him!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He has always been a handful. I\u2019ll teach him a lesson later.\u201dTeacher Zhang was the first to let out a sigh of relief. It was lucky that all three parents were very reasonable. It\u2019s worse when they run into those completely unreasonable parents.\u201cClassmate Zhang Chenghan, that\u2019s not what you told the teacher earlier. Do you remember what you said earlier?\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t bully other girls in school. I am sorry, teacher. And Classmate Ye Jingjing, I am sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have taken your hat and made fun of you. I won\u2019t do that again.\u201d The way Zhang Chenghan apologized was very sincere.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s okay,\u201d said Ye Jingjing as she summoned up her courage and gave Shu Yan a look.\u201cAnd what do you say, Classmate Wang Yitong?\u201d asked Teacher Zhang as she looked at Wang Yitong.\u201cWell, Zhang Chenghan had already apologized and Jingjing had accepted his apology. So I will forgive him as well and be friends with him,\u201d said Wang Yitong with a pout.Shu Yan couldn\u2019t tell what was on the kids\u2019 minds, but at least they seemed friendly on the outside. After the issue has been resolved, the three parents left with their respective child. The three mothers started chatting with each other. Hearing that Shu Yan now lived in the older district behind the University Avenue, Wu Xiuyue, Zhang Chenghan\u2019s mother, smiled immediately and said, \u201cWhat a coincidence? I live around that area as well. Which building are you in?\u201d\u201cReally? I live in apartment #301 in building #5. We should get together more often then.\u201d\u201cSuch a coincidence. I live in apartment #202 in building #7, just a few steps\u2019 distance from you. C\u2019mon over to my place. This is your son? How old is he? Which kindergarten is he going to?\u201d asked Wu Xiuyue when she saw the little boy behind Shu Yan with a backpack.\u201cThree and half years old. He just got into Nanfu Mansion\u2019s kindergarten. He\u2019s a pretty naughty one too. He just hasn\u2019t warmed up yet. Tianbo, come and greet aunty,\u201d said Shu Yan as she dragged Tianbo out from behind her.Ye Tianbao called her a couple times softly and started to warm up and ran up over to where Ye Jingjing was. Little kids always liked to play with older kids. Now that there\u2019s also a Zhang Chenghan-gege, Ye Tianbao was even happier.\u201cYou bought a house at Nanfu Mansion?\u201d said Lin Hui as she looked happily at Shu Yan. \u201cThen we are neighbors too then!\u201d\u201cYou, too, are at Nanfu Mansion? Which block?\u201d That was such a coincidence! Shu Yan hadn\u2019t expected to have met two neighbors the one time she was called into the teacher\u2019s office.Truth be told, Shu Yan knew nobody in City Nan. She didn\u2019t even have anyone to talk to after her kids went to school and would, occasionally, feel lonely and empty. She could be a stay-at-home nerd in the past because she has a cellphone. Now she has no entertainment at all. It was important that she met someone that she could talk to. More important, they both look like very friendly people so it should be pleasant getting along with them.\u201cI am on the 12th floor of Block 2. What about you?\u201d Lin Hui was actually quite surprised. She didn\u2019t think Shu Yan would be able to afford an unit in Nanfu Mansion. Their smallest 60 m2 unit still cost $200,000, more than many dual income families could afford.\u201cI am on 12th floor of Block 2 as well. I am 1201.\u201d Shu Yan felt goosebumps all of a sudden. How could there be such a coincidence?There were only 4 units on their floor. Shu Yan was in 1201; next to her was 1203. Which meant Lin Hui was either across from her or the kitty corner to her.\u201cI\u2019m 1208. Well, we are neighbors now. What a coincidence.\u201d Lin Hui was quite happy. She had always felt that her daughter was too lonely. She hadn\u2019t expected her to meet a neighbor classmate all of a sudden that she could go to school with and play together with on the weekends in the future.Lin Hui bought her apartment before Shu Yan did and the remodeling was already completed. They were just waiting for the apartment to air out before they could move in. Hearing that Shu Yan was still in her remodeling phase, she offered her a lot of suggestions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I had wanted to get a 60 m2 unit, but my husband wouldn\u2019t agree to it. We wanted to wait for the house prices to drop a bit before we buy.\u201dMany in the country would always be on the lookout and wanted to wait to buy when the house prices dropped some. Shu Yan felt that that would be alright if it was for investment purposes, but if it was for themselves, they might as well just do it. The district that they were staying in right now was small and old. Wu Xiuyue had also mentioned that they were living with her in-laws. Exactly how crammed was that?But the house prices would be plenty stable for the next few years until it drop quite a bit by 1997, which was why Shu Yan wouldn\u2019t try to talk her into buying. She didn\u2019t want her to blame her when that happened.Lin Hui didn\u2019t say much either. Buying a house is a big decision and they have just met. It wasn\u2019t her place to comment on that.Of the three of them, Shu Yan was the only one with two children. The other two women have one each. Both Lin Hui and her husband worked in the government assigned units, and there were rules that they couldn\u2019t have more than one child. Lin Xiuyue, on the other hand, had a boy already and the rule said she couldn\u2019t have another one.\u201cYou had it the best, a boy and a girl.\u201d They were both envious of Shu Yan.\u201cOne is good too. Less stress.\u201d If Shu Yan was having her own children, one would be enough. Luckily, she didn\u2019t need to be pregnant or give birth; she was already an instant mother.After making plans to go shopping together over the weekend, Shu Yan went home with her kids. Shu Yan waited till they got home before she said to Ye Jingjing, \u201cYou child, don\u2019t you know how to fight back when someone bully you? If it wasn\u2019t Wang Yitong helping you out together, were you just going to stand there and take it?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be mad, mom,\u201d said Ye Jingjing with her head lowered. \u201cI won\u2019t cause trouble next time.\u201dLooking at her timid child, Shu Yan felt horrible all of a sudden. \u201cWhat are you talking about? Mom isn\u2019t mad at you for causing trouble. Not to mention that you weren\u2019t the one at fault here. Mom is upset that you don\u2019t know how to protect yourself. Jingjing, mom can\u2019t be with you all the time and there will be time when I am not there. You will need to take care of yourself; otherwise, mom will be sad when you are bullied. You must tell mom what happens at school. As long as you weren\u2019t in the wrong, mom will also be on your side, okay?\u201dYe Jingjing busted out smiling and nodded heavily.\u201cMom, I will be a good kid too. Don\u2019t be sad,\u201d said Ye Tianbao all of a sudden from next to them.Shu Yan couldn\u2019t help but rub him on his head, \u201cYou are both mom\u2019s good kids. You must be hungry. Let me go start dinner.\u201dShe wondered if rice cooker was available yet. She should buy one if it was. That way she could just start the rice before she went to pick up the kids, and all she had to do after she had gotten back was to fry up the dishes. It was very difficult making rice in a pressure cooker. The rice always came out either too hard or too soft.Again, dinner was divided into two different shares. She was having seaweed soup herself. She had always liked seaweed soup, but seaweed soup with less oil and less sodium wasn\u2019t good at all. The feeling of hunger was awful, and one could always say it\u2019s a torture.

Dieting was painful; working out was even more painful. So why was she trying to lose weight? No, she couldn\u2019t keep up like this. She would go and buy a mirror in a little bit. Watching her progress would motivate her.After seeing her kid walk inside the kindergarten, Shu Yan purposefully stayed behind a little bit to chat with the other parents of Ye Tianbao\u2019s schoolmates about the after-school program.\u201cOh, that? I went to check it out. It was all taught by foreigners. They\u2019d teach through playing games and the kids liked it a lot. Even I can say a few words already. More importantly, it was located right next to the kindergarten and the teachers here can just bring the children over after school and we just have to come and pick them up after work. And the kids can go there on the weekend too. What else are they doing at home anyway? Might as well just play at school and learn at the same time. Perfect!\u201d The one who spoke was the same grandmother who said she\u2019d go talk to management yesterday.Shu Yan: Boy, your tune sure changed quickly.She asked a few others and most of them had registered. There were a few others who were in the wait-and-see-how-things-pan-out boat with Shu Yan. Shu Yan went to check out the after-school program. The atmosphere was quite good, and she also heard that they didn\u2019t require the students to memorize everything by rote learning. And the kids also seemed to be happy learning there.\u201cThe teachers only have the kids\u2019 best interest in mind, and we shouldn\u2019t hinder them as parents. You should sign up too and spend some time learning with the kids on the weekend and grow with them,\u201d another parent said with a smile.She had already signed her child up to the kindergarten, so she should follow the other parents\u2019 lead. She shouldn\u2019t let her child be singled out; that\u2019s not a good thing for a child.The after-school program cost $100 a month. That was fairly high for the standard back then. The four-legged, gold-eating monster certainly lived up to its reputation.***As usual, Shu Yan swung by the new apartment to check on the progress of the remodeling before going home. In the afternoon, she went over to Lao Hu\u2019s to find out what he has for on the store front\u2019s end. Lao Hu\u2019s door was closed. Shu Yan knocked, but nobody was home. She figured he was out and about. Lie was so inconvenient without cellphones. Otherwise, all these things could be taken care of with simple phone calls.Shu Yan brought home groceries for dinner on her way back and also picked up a full-length mirror while she was at it. She had a simple lunch, took a nap, then began her daily burpee exercise routine. It felt much more difficult today than the last couple of days, especially when her thighs and stomach were sore. Shu Yan gritted her teeth and followed through with it. She was heaving in 10 minutes\u2019 time before she switched to cooling down.Looking at herself in the mirror, she had already lost quite a bit of weight since the first day. Shu Yan turned around. She wasn\u2019t quite there yet. She must persevere and prevail.She cleaned up around the house, did the laundry, washed and chopped up the vegetables. It was already 4 PM. Shu Yan had one hand on her waist as she lamented about the difficulties of being a housewife. She must find a store front quickly and launch her own business. She needed to be relieved from these trivial chores. Such a golden period of time with golden opportunities. Wasting her time on these household chores was like wasting away her life.She was going to pick up her kid from the kindergarten at 4 PM originally; but now that the kid had signed up for the after-school program, she could go at 5 PM. That was a great help for the parents.\u201cMom, the teacher praised me today!\u201d said Ye Tianbao proudly.\u201cOh, yeah? And why did the teacher praise you?\u201d Shu Yan saw the little red flower on Ye Tianbao\u2019s forehead and smiled lightly.\u201cThe teacher said I had already memorized all the vocabulary words from yesterday!\u201d said Ye Tianbao as he thrusted his little chest out. He couldn\u2019t be prouder of himself.\u201cOur Tianbao is so smart. Here, you\u2019ve earned yourself a large chicken leg!\u201d Shu Yan squatted down in front of him and studied his little red flower closely. \u201cThe little red flower is so pretty. You should work on earning more of them in the future!\u201d\u201cI shall!\u201d said Ye Tianbao as he lifted his little face, full of self-confidence.Sometimes it\u2019s easy to raise a child. This was why a good environment was very important. Shu Yan felt that this kindergarten was quite good. Ye Tianbao has been much more polite and tidier than before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had only been to 6 months of kindergarten back at her old place and hadn\u2019t learned anything. The teacher had only gone over basic mathematics and pinyin and Ye Jingjing\u2019s progress was behind all the other kids\u2019 in City Nan. Luckily, she was only in first grade and could easily catch back up.\u201cYour little brother has an after-school English tutorial section on the weekends. Jingjing, mom is thinking about signing you up to an English tutorial section as well. And maybe a Chinese and mathematics too, at least for a while. Once you catch up with the other kids, school won\u2019t be as difficult.\u201d Having three classes outside of school would be tiring, but it\u2019s better to do it sooner rather than later. It\u2019d get more and more difficult to catch up.\u201cMom is going to sign me up to an English tutorial section?\u201d Ye Jingjing looked at Shu Yan happily. \u201cTongtong also has mathematics and English tutorial sections. She asked me this afternoon if I want to go with her. Can I go to the same one as her?\u201d\u201cOf course. When I see Wang Yitong\u2019s mother tomorrow, I will ask her which tutorial section she attends and I will take you to register for that one. That aside, is there anything else you wanted to learn? Something like singing or dancing? Is Classmate Wang Yitong taking any of those?\u201d Shu Yan felt that it\u2019d be good for the kids to take some talent classes, like singing. One would get a lot of brownie points when they network.Talent classes? Ye Jingjing\u2019s eyes lit up again. So many girls in their classes were attending talent classes, especially the art committee member. Not only was the art committee member pretty, she could sign, dance, play the piano and even draw. Other girls also have signed up to classes, including Wang Yitong. Ye Jingjing was very envious every time they chatted about it.\u201cTongtong is taking dance lessons,\u201c said Ye Jingjing as she shook her head. \u201cLet me start with the tutorial sections first; the talent lessons can wait.\u201d\u201cBaby steps, of course. We will sign you up for talent lessons after you are caught up with at least one of the three subjects. You seemed happy talking about it earlier. Why did you change your mind?\u201d\u201cMom has to raise both little brother and I. I don\u2019t want things to be too difficult for you.\u201dShu Yan hadn\u2019t expected that to be her reason for declining. She felt a little astringent in her heart and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Mom can afford both you and your little brother. You let me know what you want to learn, okay? But mom has to make one thing clear. Once you made a decision on what to learn, you must follow it through and not give up halfway, alright?\u201d\u201cI shall keep it up for sure!\u201d said Ye Jingjing as her little mouth cracked open. \u201cI want to take dance lessons too.\u201d\u201cOkay, we will sign you up as soon you catch up with your school work.\u201d Shu Yan remembered that she had taken a few days of dance lessons when she was a kid. It was very painful and she whined about quitting after just a few days. She wondered how long Ye Jingjing could carry on for.The two kids had, by now, gotten used to their mother eating a different meal than them. Ye Tianbao was thoroughly enjoying his food and would take a look at Shu Yan from time to time, \u201cMom, this meat is so good. Would you like some?\u201dShu Yan gritted her teeth. Oh, so this is the time when you decided to think about me huh? But she still needed to put up a smile and said, \u201cThank you, Tianbo, but mom won\u2019t have any. You can have them yourself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hunger was making her entire body shook, her heart palpitated, and she felt weak. The only thing that she could think of was to give up. She would walk into the kitchen from the living room tens of times.Finally, looking at the excess fat around her belly, she told herself, \u201cMust persist. Persistence is victory. Then I will be able to wear pretty dresses, and be everyone\u2019s object of envy. Persist\u2026.\u201dFor some odd reasons, she wasn\u2019t able to fall asleep that night. By the time she finally felt sleepy, the sky had already started to light up. Shu Yan washed her face with cold water and went out to buy breakfast. When she arrived at the breakfast shop, she had a glass of soy milk and started sipping on it. She was so hungry all night long that she couldn\u2019t even sleep. She felt so lightheaded when she walked over there, she might as well have flown over.She felt more alive after she had breakfast. She prepared the lunchbox, took the two kids to school, and happened to run into Lin Hui.\u201cHey, just the one that I am looking for,\u201d said Shu Yan to Lin Hui with a smile. \u201cMy daughter has always been living in the village with her grandmother and she was behind in her class. I am thinking about signing her up for after school academic programs and she mentioned that Tongtong are in some of them. Where are they located? I would like to go check them out.\u201d\u201cNot too far from here. Just that little district behind the school. It is run by a few retired professors of City Nan University and their teaching methods work pretty well with the kids. Lots of people sign their kids up with them. I need to go to work right now. Why don\u2019t we do this? I will take you over there after we pick up the kids in the afternoon.\u201d Lin Hui needed to go to work so she couldn\u2019t stay and chat with Shu Yan for too long. She took off after she finished saying that.Shu Yan hadn\u2019t expected them to be run by retired professors of City Nan University. If all checked out tonight, she could sign her daughter up right away.After she had dropped off Ye Tianbao, Shu Yan skipped checking on the re-modeling of the new house and went straight to visit Lao Hu.\u201cHey! Ms. Shu! I was just about to go look for you.\u201d Lao Hu quickly welcomed Shu Yan into his place after he had spotted her.\u201cSo? Were you able to find any storefront for sale?\u201d If there were something suitable, she planned on buying a couple of them so she could start her new business carefree. Once she had made some money, she\u2019d buy a couple old and decrepit old houses in the remote area. When the development happened, she\u2019d divide them up between the two children and that\u2019s the best she would be able to do for them.\u201cRight now it\u2019s pretty easy to rent something there. Rent is over $1,000 a month. That\u2019s like a chicken that can lay gold eggs. Nobody is selling.\u201d Lao Hu had run up and down West City Xi Road the last couple of days and contacted every person that he could but nobody was selling. Everybody said that the one store could feed three generations; nobody was stupid enough to sell their storefront. \u201cBut I did find a boutique who\u2019s looking for someone to take over. Are you interested in going to take a look at it?\u201dShu Yan wasn\u2019t particularly disappointed. She didn\u2019t have high hopes to begin with. It was never easy to buy a place; even if someone was selling, she would have to go take a good look first.\u201cOh? How\u2019s the location? What kind of terms are they talking about?\u201d Most businesses rent the storefront. Shu Yan felt that as long as the location was decent and the landlord was reasonable, it wasn\u2019t half bad to rent a storefront for now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just 2-3 minute-walk from the start of the block. There were two compartments, adding up to around 100 m2. The clothing on the inside, however, made her a little speechless. Well, to say the least, they looked very cheap.West City Nan Road was mainly mid- to high-end merchandise. Most of those who shopped here were either well-off families or that the women have their own jobs. The location of this shop was problematic. If they wanted to go the cheap but pretty route, they shouldn\u2019t have their store right on this block. There were lots of other boutiques in the cross streets that would suit their purpose better.\u201cThe business here at my store is great. I wouldn\u2019t transfer it if I didn\u2019t need to go back home to take care of some matters,\u201d said the boss lady with wavy hair. She had on a red one-piece dress, some light makeup, looking quite westernized.Yan Shuyu didn\u2019t really believe her. Nobody would look for a change of ownership if business was swell. Forget about anything else, just looking at their employee it was problematic. A store this size only has the boss lady plus one employee, not to mention the employee looked sluggish. They didn\u2019t even turn the lights on. Lights must always be on and bright inside a shop so customers would walk inside. If it looked dark, it just looked cold and empty. Even if the clothing were pretty nobody would walk inside, let alone that they weren\u2019t even pretty.\u201cHey, boss lady, I was here yesterday and this is my friend that I mentioned who was looking for a storefront. We can skip the pleasantries; just tell us how you want to transfer the ownership. How much are you asking?\u201d Lao Hu had stepped in.\u201cWe can do it one of two ways. Empty store for $3,000, or the entire place for $10,000. I still have so much merchandise in here. I am losing so much money!\u201d said the boss lady with a painful look on her.\u201cOh, c\u2019mon now, boss lady. Your merchandise here isn\u2019t worth $7,000,\u201d said Lao Hu with a smile.He wasn\u2019t in the clothing industry but he wasn\u2019t blind. These clothing aren\u2019t of high quality. He\u2019d give them $3,000 at the most.\u201cThe merchandise might not be worth that much, but there\u2019s also the cash register, cloth racks, couches. These are valuable. You had no idea how much I spent when I acquired them,\u201d retorted the boss lady.Shu Yan had already toured the entire place and returned by now. When she heard the boss lady\u2019s word, she just smiled. She didn\u2019t want any of these items in here. She was sure she\u2019d remodel the entire place; at least she didn\u2019t care for the way it looked right now.\u201cI don\u2019t want any of these items. If we are going to go through with it, I\u2019ll take the empty store.\u201d Shu Yan made her decision. \u201cHow much longer is the contract? And what did the landlord say about it?\u201dTo her, the biggest obstacle is the rent. They wouldn\u2019t get anywhere if the landlord wasn\u2019t onboard with it.\u201cThere\u2019s still a few months left on the contract and the landlord is pretty easy going. You have nothing to worry about. If the empty store is what you want, I\u2019ll have this place emptied out.\u201d The boss lady smiled.\u201cDo you have the contract? I\u2019d like to take a look at it. Plus, I\u2019d like to meet the landlord first.\u201dYou must be kidding. Shu Yan wasn\u2019t just going to go with what she was told. She must meet the landlord first and have a direct discussion with them before she takes it over. Where the heck was she going to find this person once she had given her the money?Stunned a little, the boss lady smiled and said, \u201cYou are too careful. Do I look like a scammer?\u201dOn the contract, it clearly listed that the term was up in a month and three days. She had twisted it around to a few months. That in and of itself was a big scam. Shu Yan casted her a glance and insisted on meeting with the landlord first.Today wasn\u2019t a good day, the landlord was out of town and wouldn\u2019t be back for another two days, so there was nothing Shu Yan could do but to wait.\u201cMs. Shu, are you only interested in storefront on West City Nan Road? The couple streets nearby weren\u2019t half bad. I have been observing them and the businesses on those streets weren\u2019t that much worse than that on West City Nan Road. There is a storefront for sale. Are you interested?\u201d asked Lao Hu as he carefully studied Shu Yan\u2019s reaction.\u201cSure!\u201d It didn\u2019t have to go West City Nan Road. As long as it was a suitable storefront, everything in this area would appreciate 100 folds in the future. It was a sure win situation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The location of the storefront that he had mentioned wasn\u2019t bad. When they asked about it, the asking price was $1 million, worse than highway robbery.\u201cI didn\u2019t think the owner would ask for such a high amount,\u201d said Lao Hu apologetically.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. Can you please keep searching for a storefront for me? It doesn\u2019t have to be West City Nan Road; other locations will be fine as well. And that boutique on West City Nan Road, please keep an eye out on it as well. If all is well, I will take it over. And then there\u2019s the question about clothing factories. Can you do some research for me as to which are the good ones? I will check them out myself later.\u201dShu Yan had already bought a house and the kids had started school. Lately, she had been spending a lot of money with zero income. It\u2019s time to start her own business to open up a stream of income.There were factories local to City Nan, but most of them were located in City Hang. Many of the stores get their merchandise from there. It was a little on the far side. Shu Yan\u2019s plan was to get her merchandise there at the beginning and eventually work with local factories to produce her own clothing.Lao Hu had other matters to tend to so he took off first, leaving Shu Yan to walk around by herself in the area. Most of the place was the same as how she remembered it with minor differences here and there. Overall, there are not a whole lot of changes. Ideally, a jewelry store would also be nice too, but there were no other storefront available. The businesses on this street was really quite good.West City Nan Road was 7~8 bus stops away from University Ave. On a day as hot as today, Shu Yan wasn\u2019t going to go all the way home. She had a bowl of noodles at a small shop nearby and that took care of her lunch.She walked around all the peripheral areas in the afternoon. Many of the places were still chalked full of short and old houses. All these would be turned into apartment buildings in the future. It was very unfortunate that she didn\u2019t have the capital; otherwise it\u2019s best to buy some land for development.She went to pick up Ye Tianbao first. When City Xi Grade School let out, Lin Hui came on her bicycle. She smiled at Shu Yan when she saw her and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019ll take you to the after school programme place.\u201dThe place wasn\u2019t a formal after school tutorial center but a room inside a house as the classroom. Many came here, and the little room was chalked full of little kids.Wang Yitong\u2019s language subject was quite good so she didn\u2019t need a tutorial for that, just English and Mathematics. Ye Jingjing, on the other hand, was much weaker in all three of the main areas and needed tutorials on all of them. Fees were $30 per month per subject, so a total of $90 a month. Not too expensive, but not cheap either. Shu Yan paid the fees, and Ye Jingjing would start tomorrow.The next day, when Shu Yan went home, Lao Hu came looking for her. He told her that the landlord for the storefront on West City Xi Road had returned early. They definitely wanted to rent the place out but they refused to sign a longer contract. The term was for the year, renewed annually. Plus the new rate would be adjusted depending on the market rate in the area at the time.How was she going to do business like that? Once a year contract? What if the landlord refused to renew after she had already remodeled the place and the business was going well? She\u2019d lose out of her nose. That wasn\u2019t going to work at all.\u201cI want a minimum 3-year contract and 10% increase annually. First right of refusal when the contract is up. Plus the right to change ownership.\u201d Shu Yan laid out her terms and conditions with Lao Hu; he could take care of the rest.Shu Yan didn\u2019t hear back from Lao Hu till three days later. The landlord had agreed to the terms but wanted to discuss the details in person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it\u2019s any other business line, it will require my approval first. My place is so new. I wouldn\u2019t want a restaurant put in there. In addition, the rent will increase by 15% every year.\u201d The landlord was a bespectacled man in his 40s who looked very intelligent.Shu Yan pondered a little bit and said, \u201cAlright, but we are also going to add another clause that the side who breach the contract has to pay a penalty that equals to ten times the rent.\u201d\u201cHow about double?\u201d said the landlord, frowning.After Lao Hu\u2019s mediation, they finally agreed on three times.The boutique\u2019s contract was up in a month and the current only still insisted on $3,000 transfer fees. It was a little on the high end; naturally, Shu Yan wasn\u2019t going to be that sucker.Finally, Lao Hu was able to talk her down to $1,500 plus throwing in the cash register.\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want this couch? I only just bought it a year ago. It was barely used, like 90% new. If you want, I will give it to you for $50. And these cloth racks were all new. I will let them go for $100 total,\u201d said the boss lady passionately.The red couch did look pretty new, and she would need cloth racks. But it\u2019s not a good habit to not negotiate.\u201cAll of them for $100. You have no use of them anyway and will have to pay people to have them moved.\u201dThe boss lady wasn\u2019t happy about it, but finally agreed to leaving them all behind for Shu Yan for $100.\u201cWhat about the clothes? You can have them all for $1,000.\u201d She had spent several thousands of dollars on her merchandise. It pained her just thinking about it.Shu Yan shook her head. She wasn\u2019t going to take the clothes. She would be remodeling the place and filling the racks all over again. She might not have the best eye for clothes, but her taste would at least be better than the others of that time period.The boss lady didn\u2019t have any makeup on today and looked a little languish. After she had walked out of the front door, she turned and looked at the boutique a few times before she sighed and said, \u201cThis place had already gone through a few different owners. Everybody said the fengshui was bad. I wish you luck.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of bullsh*t was that? We are a modern society now. Nobody is that superstitious anymore.\u201d The landlord gave Shu Yan a careful look, worried that she\u2019d take her words seriously. \u201cMy place is fine. She was bad at running a business and tried to blame it on the storefront.\u201dShu Yan didn\u2019t look too well. She didn\u2019t used to believe in superstition, but now that she had transmigrated, she had an added respect for the paranormal. Of course, deep down inside she understood that the owner\u2019s management style was the real culprit, but that didn\u2019t make her feel any better.\u201cThere is nothing wrong with my place. I am going to call the cops if you don\u2019t stop talking,\u201d said the landlord as he gave the boss lady a death stare.\u201cOh, I\u2019m just rambling,\u201d smiled the boss lady, a bit embarrassed. She was just in a bad mood having just lost a bunch of money.The rent for the storefront was $800 a month. $800 back in \u201992 and throwing in water, electricity, and all sorts of other expenses. One would lose through their noses without any sort of business.Lao Hu nodded on one side and leaned in and said to Shu Yan softly, \u201cThis is a pretty fair price.\u201dShu Yan had already done some research yesterday and knew that the price was pretty fair. \u201cYou sure we can\u2019t have a longer contract?\u201dThe landlord said, \u201cThree years is pretty long already. Everybody else around here only renew annually. Plus, my annual raises are so low.\u201d Over the last two years, the rent had been going up and up. He had no idea what the rent would be like a year from now. He was already feeling like he had the shorter end of the stick.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it.\u201d Shu Yan was an efficient person and would move forward immediately with her decisions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were lots that still needed taking care of.There\u2019s a lot that needed to be done to get the shop ready, and she still has the two children to take care of: picking up the kids, buying groceries, cooking, bathing her younger child. By the time the two children were in bed, it was already 8 PM. Then, she still needed to clean the house, do the laundry, bring inside the clothes that were hung up to dry and fold them. By the time she was done bathing, it was usually already 10 PM at night. She\u2019d plop on the chair and was too tired to even complain.Could she really start her own business with two children? Shu Yan started to question herself before she even got started.Being distressed plus not being able to eat a lot at night, she was hungry all the time. Anything could be irritable to her. But she couldn\u2019t take it out on the kids, so she\u2019d just have to keep those feelings to herself. Every moment like that, she wanted to cry. Her life was great in the past. She didn\u2019t have to lose weight; she didn\u2019t have to take care of children; she definitely didn\u2019t need to work so hard to make money. Why did she have to transmigrate over here and take over the original owner\u2019s life?She took a deep breath. Life must go on. She couldn\u2019t be so negative about everything. She was five years younger after the transmigration and she had two children, without having to go through the pain of carrying them for 10 months and giving birth. The worst first three years of the kids\u2019 lives were also over. Plus, she had a lot of money to start her own business in the era when there were opportunities all over. She just has to suck it up for a few more years.Once Ye Jingjing started junior high school and Tianbao was in third grade, things would be better. She just has to buy a few more houses and should be able to retire at 35 with plenty of money.Sniffling, she went to bed with her stomach grumbling. She got up in the morning again to go buy breakfast, prepare lunch for Ye Jingjing, and take the children to school.\u201cHave you lost some weight, Shu Yan?\u201d asked Lin Hui with a smile when she saw Shu Yan.\u201cYeah, my weight has never gone down since I had Tianbao, so I wanted to lose some weight lately. Can you tell?\u201d Shu Yan could feel it herself as well. The original owner\u2019s clothes were now much looser on her.\u201cYou were never that fat. You take good care of your body.\u201d This was not like ten years ago when skinny was the standard for beauty. During this time, people found those who were a little filled out to be attractive.Shu Yan shook her head. Emaciated was not pretty, but she was still too filled-out. With her height, 100 pounds would be a good weight.\u201cNever mind that for now. I seem to recall you\u2019ve mentioned that you work at a textile factory? Do you know anyone in the clothing industry then?\u201d Shu Yan held onto Lin Hui. She needed to utilize any connections that she has right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She even knew the addresses of their factories. Hearing that Shu Yan wanted to open up her own clothing store, Lin Hui said enviously, \u201cIt\u2019s great to have a business of your own. You make more money that way and have more freedom. I have been wanting to do that for a while now, but my family wouldn\u2019t agree to it. Sigh!\u201dThe common viewpoint of those in the country was that the iron bowl was the best, especially the ones from the older generation. In their eyes, a stable job was the most important thing of all. Naturally, they\u2019d not agree to Lin Hui quitting her job.\u201cThere\u2019s a few factories that work closely with us. I remember their addresses; let me write them down for you.\u201d Lin Hui grabbed a piece of paper from Wang Yitong\u2019s notebook and wrote down three addresses for her with a pencil. \u201cThere are a few more, but these three bosses were quite nice. Why don\u2019t you go and check them out first?\u201d\u201cThank you so much. If I have to go look for these myself, it\u2019d be so much more work,\u201d said Shu Yan appreciatively.Tomorrow was Saturday, but both children needed to go to the tutorial center. Tianbao\u2019s place provided lunch as well, almost like kindergarten on the weekend. Ye Jingjing\u2019s place didn\u2019t include lunch. Shu Yan talked to one of her teachers and offered to pay them $10 a month for lunches for her children. It\u2019s a fair price for lunches for 8 days.After hearing Shu Yan\u2019s request, a few of the other parents who had to work overtime also made the same request, to her surprise. Partly because they were very busy, partly also because the weather was so hot, going back and forth was tiring for them and for the children. Better to let the kids have their meals at the tutorial center and also take their naps there. They could just come and pick them up after work.Naturally, the teachers were okay with that. It wasn\u2019t much different cooking for one or for more, just a matter of cooking a little more rice and a couple more dishes. It wasn\u2019t even a lot of work for 8 days out of a month, and that\u2019s an additional $100 income. They accepted the request happily.In this case, Shu Yan didn\u2019t have to worry too much about her children on the weekend and have more time to herself. Even so, Shu Yan still felt that she just didn\u2019t have enough time.Take today for example, after taking the kids to the tutorial center, she needed to go check out the new house. The foreman said to have her go and sign off on it. Shu Yan also wanted the kitchen and patio to be half opened, so she needed to check on that in person. All in all, she needed to sign off on a lot of things before they could start work. She thought that would only take an hour or two, but it took her all the way to after 11 AM.In the afternoon, she needed to go visit the addresses that Lin Hui had given to her the day before. She wanted to check out their clothing. If they were acceptable, she\u2019d take some of them. All of the clothing factories were in the outskirts. Taxies already existed then, but they were also outrageously expensive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan walked around in a circle but wasn\u2019t able to locate them. It was so hot that day, so Shu Yan walked into a convenient store, bought a popsicle, and asked the boss about the locations of the factories.\u201cOh, this factory is right over there. From the bathroom walk toward your left side. When you see a Risheng Clothing shop, turn right and walk all the way down.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Shu Yan finished her popsicle, rinsed her mouth, and made sure everything was alright before she started walking toward the clothing factory again.During this period of time, the factory district was very dirty. This was the middle of summer, and lots of flies could be seen hovering over piles of garbage. Shu Yan could even pick up the foul smell of piss. She tried to breath in as little as possible and finally, she was able to find the factory that Lin Hui had told her about.\u201cHi, is this Hongsheng Clothing Factory?\u201d asked Shu Yan politely at the old man guarding the door.\u201cYes, what do you need?\u201d The old man looked up at her and asked.\u201cI\u2019d like to get some merchandise. Who do I need to talk to?\u201d She learned from Lin Hui that this factory was privately-owned. She didn\u2019t think they\u2019d turn her away.And they didn\u2019t. As soon as the guard heard that she was there for merchandise, he took her straight to the factory owner with the utmost passion. That\u2019s right, the factory owner. It wasn\u2019t a very big factory after all and not a whole lot of different departments. Most of the stuff was done by themselves.And, just like Lin Hui said, the owner looked very friendly and ardently gestured to Shu Yan to have a seat when he saw her.\u201cSo you are looking for merchandise? You are opening your own clothing store?\u201d The owner\u2019s last name was He. He handed Shu Yan a cup of tea and dived into the subject.\u201cYes, I am getting ready to open up my own shop and wanted to check out some of the local factories. If the merchandise is good, I would buy directly from City Nan.\u201d Shu Yan didn\u2019t beat around the bush either.Factory Owner He did not brag about how good his clothes were. Instead, he just took Shu Yan to his sample room. They have a lot, but not very many that Shu Yan liked. All she could say was there\u2019s a difference in taste. After all, Shu Yan\u2019s taste belonged to that of 20 years later. Everything from the 90s naturally looked very outdated to her. That being said, she couldn\u2019t buy merchandise based on what people would like 20 years from now either. Different time periods have different standards of what was considered pretty. Being too far ahead of one\u2019s time would just make one look odd in the eyes of the others. Shu Yan understood that well, so she didn\u2019t pick according to her own preference.She found out which were the most stylish ones from Factory Owner He, and they were exactly the ones that she had her eyes on. It\u2019d appear that her taste was fine even in this time period.Particularly the few wind breakers that Factory Owner He had pointed out, there were totally \u201990s style. No wonder people always said fashion made comebacks from time to time; Shu Yan had finally experienced it firsthand.\u201cI am still remodeling the shop right now. It will take at least another month. Fall and winter clothes would be perfect timing then. Are these all your latest designs?\u201d Shu Yan had already checked the box for the windbreaker, but that alone wouldn\u2019t be enough. She would need more clothes that go under the windbreaker.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have 20 ~ 30 new designs. I can honestly tell you that we have the most out of all the factories in the area. But we have not yet made our final decisions yet. Maybe in another week or so. What say you come back in a week\u2019s time?\u201d Owner He smiled.\u201cThat works.\u201d Shu Yan nodded and gave Owner He the address of her shop. \u201cSwing on by when you have a chance next time. You can let me know if you see any room for improvements.\u201dShe left her address with him so he\u2019d know that she truly was the owner of a shop. She didn\u2019t want him to think that she was a spy from another factory.Sure enough, Owner He was much more genuine after he had her shop address in hand. He walked Shu Yan to the front door and set a date with her to come back to check out more samples.To someone like Owner He, 20~30 different designs were a lot already. But Shu Yan was going to open up a shop. She\u2019d need at least 100 different designs.It was getting late so she\u2019d check out the other two factories the next day. When the remodeling was about to be completed, she\u2019d need to visit the wholesale market in City Hang. It\u2019d be more tiring at the beginning, but it\u2019d get better.When she finally got back to the tutorial center, Tianbao was the only one left. Shu Yan apologized to the teacher, embarrassed.\u201cThere was traffic on the road. I am so sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. These things happen. Hurry up and go home. Tianbao must be hungry,\u201d said the teacher gently as he walked them out.If Shu Yan was late to pick up Ye Tianbao, she was for sure late picking up Ye Jingjing as well. Shu Yan apologized to that teacher as well. She was a bit quiet on her way home. She has learned her lesson. She couldn\u2019t cut it so close going forward. It\u2019s difficult to predict how long she would be stuck in traffic.\u201cMom, I can pick Tianbao up in the future. We can go home by ourselves,\u201d said Ye Jingjing to her mother. She knew that her mother had been very busy lately and still had to take care of the two of them. She wanted to help her out where she could.\u201cI\u2019ll be good too.\u201d Perhaps he, too, had seen Shu Yan being very busy lately, Ye Tianbao had been much more mature as of late.When the children were naughty, they were a headache, and she had wished they\u2019d grow up quickly. Now that they were so mature, Shu Yan felt sad. One was seven and the other one three. When they were too mature for their age, it was the fault of the adult.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Mom misjudged the time today. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d If this was still back in the village, it would have been fine. But in a big city like City Nan and the two kids were still so young, Shu Yan wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable to have them going to and from school by themselves. This was not where one should take any chances. It\u2019d be too late to cry if something really happened to them.Ye Jingjing helped with preparing the vegetables and even Ye Tianbao was helping on one side. Shu Yan smiled and quickly cooked the rice and dishes. It was already past 6 PM, and both of them have been starving.Shu Yan didn\u2019t eat her diet amount tonight. It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t persist anymore but that she had been too busy lately. She needed some food to go on. If she fell ill, who\u2019d take care of the two kids?It had been a week since she had stopped eating dinner. Shu Yan felt that even the rice was sweet. But she still exercised her self-control and only had half a bowl of rice and some vegetables. Definitely couldn\u2019t have any meat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It took Shu Yan a little bit of time to find it. Their designs were similar to the ones over at Owner He\u2019s, but their materials weren\u2019t as good. Granted, that was also reflected in their prices. As Shu Yan\u2019s plan was to have mid- to high-end products, she couldn\u2019t look for bargain deals.Shu Yan had tentatively decided on Owner He\u2019s factory. Further, she\u2019d check with Lao Hu and see if he has any other recommendation. One couldn\u2019t put all eggs in one basket.\u201cBoss Shu,\u201d said Lao Hu as he walked inside her shop with two men, laughing heartily. \u201cThis is Boss Zhang that I had mentioned before. He had remodeled many of the store fronts in City Nan. His work quality is good and pricing reasonable.\u201dShu Yan had been too busy lately so she also had Lao Hu help her with looking for a remodeling company.\u201cHi,\u201d said Shu Yan as she shook hands with Boss Shu. \u201cI have already talked to the landlord and gotten their approval to remove this wall and convert it into glass. And I want pendant lamps, eight on each side. I want the cash register moved over to that side. The back room can remain unchanged. And add two changing rooms on the right side. That good?\u201d Shu Yan communicated her ideas with Boss Zhang. She was looking at quite a bit of changes.The man behind Boss Zhang jotted down all of Shu Yan\u2019s requests and drafted a sketch. \u201cIs this in line with what you have in mind?\u201d\u201cYes, just like that.\u201d Anything that Shu Yan had not previously thought about had been touched up in the draft. No wonder Lao Hu said that many of the store fronts here were done by them. This architect alone was amazing.\u201cAny other requests?\u201d asked the man as he quickly scribbled down all sorts of data about the store front.\u201cThis is all I have for now. Unless you have other suggestions?\u201d She had never owned her own clothing shop before. All her ideas came from what she had seen in her original world.The man paused for a second and said, \u201cI\u2019ll redesign according to your requests. I should have something for you to look at in two days. You can decide once you look over it.\u201dAfter walking Boss Zhang and his architect out, Shu Yan stayed behind to ask Lao Hu about the matters regarding clothing factories.\u201cI have talked to a couple friends about this. Most of the designs you are going to find in City Nan will be very similar. Most of the clothing store owners get their merchandise from the wholesale market in City Hang. It\u2019s impractical to supply your entire store\u2019s need just from City Nan alone.\u201d Lao Hu had a pretty good idea about Shu Yan\u2019s situation. She has two children; it was impractical for her to go to City Hang all the time.\u201cI understand that as well. I just want to explore both options.\u201d Shu Yan was quite ambitious, actually. She wanted her shop to have something that stood out, maybe even her own brand one day. It may or may not happen, but she could set the goal for the time being. Nothing wrong with aiming high. She had, after all, transmigrated into a novel, and to this time period. Plus she has the capital, so why not give it a shot?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan had come up with a few names, actually, but none of them she was too happy about. Finally she had decided to go with Yanni. Why? Because that was her nickname.In her own world, both her paternal and maternal grandparents along with her parents had always called her that. It was a nickname filled with their love for her. After she had written those characters down on a piece of paper, her eyes had reddened. Nobody would call her by that name ever again. Perhaps, they\u2019d think about her nickname in the middle of the night and be quietly sad. Shu Yan took a deep breath and decided on the name. She worried that after being here for a while, she\u2019d forgotten who she was.She went to a shop to have the sign made, and she\u2019d go trademark the name on Monday. Nobody really cared about trademarks at this time, but Shu Yan knew it full well that many of the large name brands failed to protect their brands at the beginning and had to buy them back for globs of money later on.***It was 4 PM, and time to pick up her children. She saw Lin Hui and Wu Xiuyue standing there chatting from afar.\u201cLin Hui mentioned that you are going to open up your own clothing store. Where is it going to be at? We\u2019ll go and support you when the time comes.\u201d After finding out that both Wang Yitong and Ye Jingjing were attending the after school tutorial center, Wu Xiuyue, too, registered her son for Language and English classes.\u201cOn West City Nan Road. We are still remodeling right now. Just don\u2019t go running away after my grand opening when I invite you to come visit,\u201d joked Shu Yan.Lin Hui lived in the opposite direction as the two of them. After they parted their ways, Wu Xiuyue suddenly fell silent, as though there was something on her mind.If she wasn\u2019t going to share, Shu Yan didn\u2019t plan on prying. They have only met a few times when they were picking up their children. They weren\u2019t really even friends yet. If she was to ask, Shu Yan would help if it was within her ability. If she couldn\u2019t, she would just be honest about it. But if she wasn\u2019t going to say it out loud, Shu Yan wasn\u2019t going to ask about it either. She had enough on her plate right now.\u201cI have been so busy lately and haven\u2019t even bought groceries for dinner yet. I am going to head to the market with my kids then,\u201d said Shu Yan as she bid Wu Xiuyue farewell.In the end, Wu Xiuyue still wasn\u2019t able to bring herself to say what she had intended to say. When she saw her husband lounging around on the couch when she got home, she was so angry that she threw her purse on him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201d asked Zhang Huafeng as he sat up from the couch. \u201cThe son got a poor grade at school or something?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Wu Xiuyue paused a little and said, \u201cRemember that Shu Yan that I had mentioned in the past? She is going to open up her own clothing shop on West City Nan Road. I am thinking that now that Hanhan is attending a tutorial center on the weekends, and I am not that busy at home, I would like to go work at her shop.\u201d\u201cWork?\u201d Questioned Zheng Huafeng, \u201cTo sell clothes?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I am thinking about, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to ask.\u201d Wu Xiuyue hadn\u2019t worked since she had given birth to her son. She was a little intimidated about going out to work again, plus she couldn\u2019t bring herself to even ask.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019d have been so shameful. Our son is classmate with her daughter. If your son\u2019s classmates and teachers find out that you work for your son\u2019s classmate\u2019s mother, imagine how shameful that\u2019d be for him.\u201d Zhang Huafeng gave his wife an unpleasant look. Did she still have a brain? To go sell clothes for her son\u2019s classmate\u2019s mother? That\u2019d put their son at a lower status than his other classmates.Wu Xiuyue replied unhappily, \u201cThen what if I don\u2019t go get a job? With just your income, when will we be able to have our own place? So me working for someone else is shameful, but us living here is not? Looking at that Lin Hui and Shu Yan, they had both bought houses at Nanfu Mansion, and the 120 m2 ones no less. Look at our house? We cram six people into 40 m2. Hanhan, at his age, is still sleeping in our room. Is it not shameful that he won\u2019t even be able to have his own room when he gets older? And then there\u2019s that sister of yours. She is still single at 28. How\u2019s that not shameful?\u201d\u201cHey, we are talking about me here. Why do you have to drag my sister in all this?\u201d Zhang Huafeng looked over at the door and lowered his voice. \u201cOkay, so I don\u2019t make a lot. Don\u2019t drag Xiuxiu into this.\u201dWu Xiuyue sighed and didn\u2019t say anything else. She realized that she did cross the line a little with what she had just said. She sat down on the other end of the couch and sighed. Then, suddenly, she had another idea. \u201cOkay, so if it\u2019s shameful for our son if I go and get a job, then what about Xiuxiu?\u201d\u201cXiuxiu is doing just fine at the factory. You want her to quit her job to sell clothes?\u201d Zhang Huafeng felt that his parents would never buy into that.\u201cThe factory that Xiuxiu is working at has stopped producing a long time ago. She hasn\u2019t even been paid for six months. What is the point of staying there? She might as well quit the job and take her final pay. I know this sounds bad, but she is 28 after all. If she wanted to look for a good family to marry into at her age, it won\u2019t hurt to have a bigger dowry. I don\u2019t want any of the money from her final pay. She can save all those up for herself. That and all the money that she had saved up over the years. We can also chip in a little and help her get her own house, that would put her in a much better position when she gets married.\u201dWu Xiuyue wasn\u2019t a bad person after all. It was just that all the neighbors had been gossiping about her single sister-in-law over the years and that had gotten to her a little.Zhang Huafeng looked at his wife, a little touched. \u201cWife, I\u2026. I\u2019ll bring it up to Xiuxiu in a little bit. We need dad and mom to sign off on that as well. Why don\u2019t you ask Shu Yan tomorrow first? Maybe she had already found someone too?\u201d***On the other hand, Shu Yan was stressing over hiring a store clerk. There had been a few who interviewed for the position after she had put up the hiring sign, but either they were not pretty or that they were not articulate. This was a clothing shop after all. Never mind that she wasn\u2019t pretty herself, if the store clerk wasn\u2019t pretty either, who\u2019d go in and buy their clothes.Which was why Shu Yan did not decline when Wu Xiuyue asked her if she was still hiring.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Aye! I will be honest with you. She\u2019s not that young anymore. Are you only looking for young girls? If so, then just pretend that I have never asked.\u201d Wu Xiuyue took a look at Shu Yan and carried on, \u201cThat being said, my sister-in-law really is a pretty girl. She is tall and her skin is light colored. She\u2019d look good in anything.\u201d\u201cYou are so young yourself, how old could your sister-in-law be?\u201d Shu Yan would need to meet her to see if she is pretty. \u201cHow old is she now? And she\u2019s not working right now?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s 28 this year.\u201d Talking about her sister-in-law gave Wu Xiuyue a headache. \u201cMy sister-in-law graduated from a technical institution and then started working in a factory. She\u2019s pretty and fairly articulate as well. But she was prideful. There had been many who wanted to marry her in the past, but she didn\u2019t like any of them. Next thing you know she\u2019s that age already. And the factory that she is working at? They haven\u2019t paid any wages for six months already. My thought is for her to resign, take the final pay, and look for a different job outside. What is the point of dragging on like that, right?\u201d\u201c28 is not that old. She\u2019ll get married when the right person comes along.\u201d Shu Yan could relate to that. Her original self was still single at 30 and also was the subject of gossip. Especially around new year time, all the aunties would keep on nagging as though she had committed some sort of heinous crime. And that was 20~30 years from now. She could only imagine the kind of pressure at this time and age. If Wu Xiuyue\u2019s sister-in-law was decent, she would be quite happy to hire her on as a sales clerk. At least she knew she was good with handling pressures.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this then? Have her come to my shop tomorrow and take a look. It\u2019s not just me picking someone; she, too, is also picking her new job.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will let her know.\u201d Wu Xiuyue was very happy with Shu Yan\u2019s reply.The clothing shop was about 100 m2. Shu Yan\u2019s plan was to hire one manager and two store clerks. Even if Wu Xiuyue\u2019s sister-in-law worked out, she would still need to hire two more. It was no easy feat to hire a manager with experience. Welp, still a little over a month till the grand opening. She still has some time.She went and trademarked her logo and also hired someone to design a very pretty \u201cYan\u201d character with a colorful butterfly on top of it. She had also registered the name of the store; it didn\u2019t cost much anyway. Shu Yan even registered all sorts of names related to Yanni, including anything ranging from eateries to living establishments.The architect finished even earlier than the timeline that he had provided for Shu Yan. He had finished the drawing by that afternoon.\u201cYou are fantastic. This is exactly what I have in mind. Let\u2019s move forward with what you have.\u201d But, if they are going to go with his design, the original couch no longer goes with anything else. \u201cWould it be difficult to find these lights and couch?\u201dThe architect looked embarrassed for a second there. He was too happy when designing it and some of his designs were not too realistic. Mainly because it wasn\u2019t every day that he would run into a customer with good taste and appreciated his design concepts. \u201cI have only seen these in magazines from overseas. We might not be able to get them here just yet, so we would either have to order them from overseas or have them custom made locally. I have some connections and having them custom made here would be a lot cheaper.\u201d He was quite worried that Shu Yan would decide against them because of the cost.\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go with your friends.\u201d Shu Yan liked the design a lot, and she\u2019d be okay spending a little bit more on them. This was going to be her first shop; she wanted everything to be as perfect as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No! That\u2019s an iron rice bowl job. Do you know how difficult it is to look for a job right now? What are you going to do after you quit?\u201d Zhang Huafeng\u2019s mother was strongly against that idea. \u201cBesides, why would you want to quit your job as a laborer to go and work for a capitalist? All of your friends and family would make fun of you. Did someone say something? The factory is hitting a bump right now. I am sure the country will figure it out and you will be paid after a while. Mom and dad can support you.\u201d(T/N: An iron rice bowl job refers to an occupation with guaranteed job security as well as steady income and benefits.)Wu Xiuyue, who was insinuated in the speech was infuriated. She was too nice. She never should have said anything; Xiuxiu wasn\u2019t her sister after all.\u201cMom, don\u2019t say that. We only have Xiuxiu\u2019s best interest in mind. Xiuyue even offered to chip in and help Xiuxiu buy a house as her dowry.\u201d Zheng Huafeng quickly stood up for his wife.Mother Zhang went quiet. Her daughter, being still single at 28, had also brought upon her a lot of pressure, which caused her to be a little oversensitive on things.\u201cGo check out the job first. If it\u2019s desirable, then just resign.\u201d Father Zhang could see the big picture better than Mother Zhang could. Many of the country-ran factories had closed down and all the workers were still waiting at home for \u201carrangements\u201d. Has anyone of them been arranged so far? No, they were still waiting.\u201cBut that\u2019s an iron rice bowl job.\u201d Mother Zhang was still struggling with the idea.Zhang Huaxiu, who hadn\u2019t said a word this entire time, suddenly chimed in decisively and said, \u201cI have decided on resigning. Better to do it now when they could still give me my final pay. If we wait any longer, I might not even be able to get that. I have saved up some over the last few years as well. I can take out a loan and get a small place for myself. I have been thinking about this for a while now. I\u2019ve just been worried about talking to you about it. I want to thank my sister-in-law for referring me to a job; otherwise, I\u2019d have no idea where to even start.\u201dWu Xiuyue lowered her head. She had her own ulterior motive as well. She felt a little shameful after hearing her sister-in-law\u2019s words.Zhang Mother still resented the idea. Who quit their iron rice bowl job to go work for capitalists?\u201cMom, have you seen how many people have been laid off recently? Our factory has not been doing well. I worry that\u2026 it won\u2019t be around for much longer.\u201d Zhang Huaxiu had thought about resigning for quite a while now. She only worried that her mom and dad would object, so she was taking this opportunity to share her thoughts.***Zhang Huaxiu arrived at West City Nan Road West City Nan Road at 8 AM. She purposefully arrived a little earlier to leave a better impression with Shu Yan. There was only one storefront on the entire West City Nan Road with its sign removed. She figured that must be the one that her sister-in-law had mentioned. Not long thereafter, a man in his thirties carrying a black suitcase had arrived as well. He was a little bit surprised when he saw Zhang Huaxiu, but he nodded at her a little and stood to one side.When Shu Yan arrived, she saw the two of them each standing to one side and the atmosphere was a little bit awkward. She looked from one to the other then. Smiling, she said, \u201cAre you Zhang Chenghan\u2019s aunt?\u201d\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Zhang Huaxiu shook hands with Shu Yan, a little bit reserved.Shu Yan opened up the door as she said to her, \u201cWe are still remodeling right now and the place is a little bit messy. Please take a seat on the couch for now. I have something else to take care of right now, then we can talk?\u201d\u201cYes, that is fine. I took the day off today. I have time.\u201d Zhang Huaxiu didn\u2019t get too close to the two of them. In fact, she stood quite a bit away; she wasn\u2019t a nosy person.\u201cI have shown the design of the light and couch to the designers. This is their price list.\u201d The man who came after her was obviously Chen Fei, the architect. He needed to confirm some details with Shu Yan.The pricing was a little bit higher than buying finished product from the market, but not by much. Shu Yan felt that the price tag was acceptable. She signed off on a few more details and everything was ready to get started that afternoon.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I will head back to my office now.\u201d When he walked past Zhang Huaxiu, Chen Fei slowed a little, smiled, and nodded at her before he walked on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chen Fei was there as well. He walked through the store inside and out as though he was looking for something.\u201cYes? Something\u2019s the matter?\u201d Shu Yan thought that the discussion that they\u2019ve had covered all the details. She wasn\u2019t expecting any issues with it.\u201cOh, no. I just came with them to go over some details with them, just in case.\u201d Chen Fei asked in a seemingly casual manner, \u201cBoss Lady, the person I ran into this morning was here for a job interview?\u201d\u201cYes, she\u2019s the aunt of my daughter\u2019s classmate.\u201d Shu Yan\u2019s eyes rolled and she smiled. \u201cThe factory she was working at wasn\u2019t doing too well, so she planned to resign and get a job outside. She happened to find out that I was hiring so she came and took a look. She is two years older than me but looks about ten years younger. That\u2019s the difference between a single woman and a married woman.\u201dChen Fei already looked somewhat disappointed when Shu Yan said Zhang Huaxiu was two years older than her but his eyes lit up again when he heard the part that she was still single. \u201cShe\u2019s still single.\u201d\u201cYeah, she never found that right person. I think that\u2019s a good way of looking at it. Marriage is no simple matter. You don\u2019t just get married because you are at the right age.\u201d Shu Yan glanced over at Chen Fei and asked, \u201cI seemed to remember that Architect Chen is also single? Well, are you interested in Xiuxiu?\u201dChen Fei blushed right away and said, \u201cNo, no such thing. I\u2019m just\u2026. Just asking was all. I still have something else to take care of back at the office. I will be back.\u201d Chen Fei was almost out the door before he came back and asked, \u201cWill she be working here?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s the plan. But she needed to take care of matters at the factory first. I am not sure exactly which day she will be starting.\u201d Shu Yan raised her brows. And he still said he wasn\u2019t interested in her? Yeah, right.After Chen Fei had taken off, Shu Yan couldn\u2019t help but went to find out more about him from the foreman.\u201cHow old is your Architect Chen? He looks much younger than me?\u201d Even though the female being the older one in a relationship wasn\u2019t too much of a problem, those of the older generations would gossip about it. So it\u2019s always better if the female was younger.\u201cHe\u2019s 29 years old. They are white-collared workers. All he does is sit in the office and draft plans all day long so naturally he looked much younger than us.\u201d The foreman was quite envious of him. \u201cPlus he has part ownership. Just his bonus is higher than our salaries combined.\u201d\u201cOh, so he is one of your bosses?\u201d That was unexpected.\u201cYeah. He was recruited over from a big company by our boss. Other than his high income, we\u2019ve heard that he even has 10% ownership of the company.\u201d\u201cMore than that. I heard 20 %,\u201d said the concrete man next to the foreman.\u201cWhat? I\u2019ve heard 30%,\u201d said the electrician.Yup. Women were not the only ones who loved to gossip; men, too, enjoyed it as well.Well, no matter the actual percentage, one thing for sure was that Chen Fei has ownership of the company. His income wouldn\u2019t be bad at all. He has a pretty good appearance and mild temperament. Seemed like he\u2019d be a good catch.\u201cWhere is he from? So mighty.\u201d Shu Yan looked gossipy.\u201cProvince Chuan. Architect Chen doesn\u2019t talk much normally. We don\u2019t know much more beyond that.\u201d The foreman turned and chatted with the others about how much of the company did Chen Fei own.Shu Yan listened to them for a while. Not gleaming any more new information, she bid the foreman farewell and went to pick up her kids.\u201cMom, I got a little red flower again.\u201d Tianbao lifted his head up high and showed Shu Yan the little red flower on his head.\u201cOur Tianbao is so awesome! Earning his little red flower again! Mommy will go buy a new notebook today just for your little red flowers.\u201d In order to encourage Ye Tianbao to be more proactive, Shu Yan figured she\u2019d adopt the little red flower system at home as well. Hmm, maybe one for Ye Jingjing as well. That\u2019s right, she could have a spot at home dedicated to measure their heights and also a wall for all their awards. These would all become the milestones of the kids growing. It might not look like much right now, but they\u2019d all become good memories once they were grown.She made a mental note to go tell the master at Nanfu Mansion tomorrow to make some modifications to the wall in the living room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan spent a day with her and learned that she was a workaholic. She cleaned the storage out in the morning, went over to the market, and bought a tool in between, then she came back and got all the clothing racks ready.\u201cTake a break and have some lunch,\u201d Shu Yan called out to Zhang Huaxiu and gave her the seat directly in front of the electric fan. It was almost October, but the days were still very hot.\u201cOkay,\u201d replied Zhang Huaxiu as she wiped her hands clean and walked over. There were two dishes plus a soup: cabbage stir fry, braised pork, and an egg drop and tomato soup. The workers didn\u2019t eat with them, so that was enough food for the two of them.Noticing that Zhang Huaxiu was eating only the cabbage, Shu Yan took a pair of clean chopsticks and put half of the pork into her bowl. \u201cHave more. We will get more if we need to.\u201d\u201cThank you. That\u2019s enough, really. I can\u2019t eat that much.\u201d Zhang Huaxiu looked at her bowl, now filled with meat, and gulped.Even though the overall condition had improved, and meat wasn\u2019t as difficult to come by as they used to be, the Zhang\u2019s income still wasn\u2019t great lately. The factories that her parents worked at had only been able to pay them half of their salaries; her sister-in-law stayed home with the child and has no income; she hadn\u2019t brought home a penny in six months; and her brother didn\u2019t make that much. How well could they be eating? Having meat once a week would be a luxury. And, when it did happen, they\u2019d try to let her nephew have the lion share of it.It wasn\u2019t just her family that were like that. That was the life of most of those who worked at the factories. They may call it the \u201ciron bowl job\u201d, but in reality, they were stretched very thin these days.\u201cI forgot to mention the time off policy to you last time. You have two days off a month, and you can pick which days to take off, but you will need to let me know ahead of time,unless it\u2019s an emergency. If you don\u2019t take any time off, I\u2019ll pay you an extra stipend. If you get here on time every day, never leave early, and don\u2019t call in sick, I will pay you an additional $30 as a full attendance reward. I think that pretty much covers it all.\u201d That was what had occurred to Shu Yan a couple of nights ago. It was her first time as a boss, so she hasn\u2019t been very comprehensive.Zhang Huaxiu hadn\u2019t expected something so nice. A $30 reward for full-attendance and an extra stipend for not taking her two days\u2019 time off. That\u2019s extra tens of dollars a month. Plus her $450 salary, that added up to quite a bit.Shu Yan needed to leave early to pick up her kids, so she left Zhang Huaxiu there to watch the store by herself. She suddenly thought about Zhang Huaxiu\u2019s meals. There were no fast food restaurants available just yet and eating out was expensive. Their afternoon meal cost her $10, an average $5 per person. Calculating it out, Zhang Huaxiu would have to spend $10 a day on food, that\u2019s $300 a month? That was higher than many City Nan\u2019s residents\u2019 monthly income. That\u2019d not be sustainable. Even thirty years from now, a regular company\u2019s meal subsidy was $450.She had already told Zhang Huaxiu that food would be covered, and she couldn\u2019t go back on her words now. Shu Yan thought about it for a little and said, \u201cOne more thing. About your meals. I need to pick up my kids at night and may not always have lunch here in the afternoon. How about this? I will pay you a $60 subsidy, and you take care of your own meals, does that work?\u201dZhang Huaxiu\u2019s eyes beamed. $60 in subsidy was a lot. She used to only give her sister-in-law $50 a month for household expenditures.\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She would bring lunch starting tomorrow and just have something light at night to tie her over until she got home. $60! That was enough to feed her entire family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shu Yan went to check on the progress of the new house\u2019s remodeling. The patio and the bathrooms were done, and the closets were close to completion. The foreman told her that at the current rate, they would be able to move in after the new year.That might be what he said, but Shu Yan didn\u2019t plan on moving in so quickly. The house needed to be aired out for at least over three months, maybe even six. There\u2019s no rush; safety is more important.\u201cBoss Lady, you want to keep this wall as is, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. I am going to make a photo wall out of it and mark my kids\u2019 height on the corner. Let\u2019s just forego the original design,\u201d said Shu Yan as she nodded.There were three rooms in the house. Shu Yan, naturally, would take the master bedroom. The second bedroom with the patio would be her daughter\u2019s, and the smallest room would be her son\u2019s. Girls have a lot of stuff and need a bigger room. She could also plant some flowers or whatnot on the patio. A boy only needed a place to sleep.The remodeling for her house was not the same as it was for her shop. She was going to live here. She picked the best material and was very detailed every step of the way. The shop was a rental and mediocre materials would be fine. The glass wall and the two fitting rooms, which were the most complicated parts of the project, have already commenced.Now that she had Zhang Huaxiu\u2019s help in watching over the shop, she\u2019d need to start looking into bringing in merchandise. Tomorrow was the weekend. Shu Yan took the day off from the tutorial center for the two children, bought some food for the house, and told Ye Jingjing to take good care of her brother. She needed to go to City Han for merchandising at 10 PM.She was going to go in a private car along with a few other owners from the other boutiques on West City Nan Road. Shu Yan was surprised when the owner next door to her extended the invitation to her. They were, after all, competitors. She hadn\u2019t expected that she\u2019d come and ask her.It was more a timing thing. They had always been going with the original boss lady, and they have been having a hard time finding a fourth person to fill her spot. With just the three of them, the car would be costly. It wasn\u2019t like they could stop Shu Yan from bringing in merchandise, so they might as well go together to save on the cost of the car.\u201cShu Yan, what do you plan on selling out of your store? I think kids\u2019 clothing are great, or maybe something for school kids. I am sure demand for those are high,\u201d said Le, the boss lady next door to Shu Yan as soon as they got inside the car.\u201cExactly, there\u2019s no stores on your street gearing toward students, right? I am sure you will make a lot of money doing that,\u201d said Zhu Hong, an owner of a kid\u2019s clothing shop over on Jiufang Alley. She wasn\u2019t a competitor of theirs, so she came across as being very sincere.\u201cI agree.\u201d Fan Xiaomei chimed in. Her main business line was male clothing, so she was also not a competitor if Shu Yan followed her advice.Shu Yan smiled and said, \u201cI am not sure yet. Perhaps I will take a look once we get there before I decide.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Students\u2019 clothing? Sure enough, everyone in the same field was your enemy. Students now were not like students 20~30 years from now. They\u2019d be lucky to have $1~$2 extra money to spend. No way they would be able to shop at West City Nan Road.Shu Yan suddenly recalled the old boss lady. Her main business line was clothing geared toward those in their 40s and 50s. Could she have listened to these people? Hot dang. It\u2019s just a clothing business, not an imperial-harem struggling drama.\u201cEh! She didn\u2019t want to share that with us. Hey, we only have your best interest in mind. Your storefront had gone through quite a few owners already and business was just okay. That\u2019s why I am suggesting for you to do something unique. Otherwise, it\u2019d be difficult to survive on West City Nan Road,\u201d said Le with a chuckle.Oh yeah? The last owner selling clothing for the older population in the middle of a street mainly focused on modern female clothes was quite unique. She went out of business too, didn\u2019t she? Shu Yan cursed silently in disagreement.Shu Yan had never purchased merchandise from a clothing market before. The only thing that she had brought with her was cash. She noticed that all three women brought with them a big leather bag. She had no idea what was inside of them nor was she going to ask. She didn\u2019t think they\u2019d share with her even if she had.They arrived at the wholesale market by 1 AM and sat on the stairs outside of the front door. Slowly, people coming from all directions started to gather. Shu Yan said she needed to use the bathroom and walked over to a spot where she couldn\u2019t be seen by Le and the others so she could ask around.Anyone who wasn\u2019t from the same area was not a competitor. Shu Yan specifically looked for an older looking woman. The woman was from Province Wen, hundreds of kilometers from City Nan. She was much friendlier toward Shu Yan after finding out that Shu Yan\u2019s store was located in City Nan. The woman opened up her store some 3-4 years ago. She was one of the pioneers who started their own businesses. She was in her thirties and has a ten-year-old son.\u201cBig sister started doing business 3-4 years ago? That was some courage,\u201d complimented Shu Yan.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t courage; I didn\u2019t have a choice. I have been a housewife my whole life, all the way until my son\u2019s dad started sleeping around on me.\u201d Perhaps, the woman didn\u2019t have a lot of people to talk to normally, so she was quite chatty with Shu Yan. \u201cI really wanted to die at the time, but I have a son to raise. So, I figured, if I am not even afraid of dying, why should I be afraid to do business? One way or another, I need to raise my son.\u201dShu Yan could relate to that immediately. \u201cExactly. All men are like that. Same with the father of my two children. It got to his head as soon as he had made some money. He found himself a girl who just graduated college and started looking down on his wife who had given him two children and been taking care of the household the whole time. He insisted on getting a divorce.\u201d\u201cThe same happened to you too? Did you end up getting a divorce?\u201d Learning that Shu Yan had the same experience as her, the woman felt a closeness to Shu Yan all of a sudden.\u201cYeah.\u201d Shu Yan smiled bitterly. \u201cHe had tried almost everything he could think of to get a divorce, so he could marry that wench. If I don\u2019t get a divorce, I\u2019d worry for my life. I am better off taking care of my children by myself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At least my ex still had a shred of kindness left in him and left me with the house and his money; otherwise, I won\u2019t even be able to open up my own clothing store.\u201dShu Yan blinked. She didn\u2019t tell her that she forced her man to hand over everything to her before the divorce. She would just let her keep that misconception.\u201cI am not very educated and couldn\u2019t get a good job. It cost a lot to raise two children, so I plan to start my own business. This is my first time merchandising and I ran into someone nice like you.\u201d Slowly, Shu Yan shared more about herself.\u201cThis is your first time here?\u201d The older woman looked Shu Yan up and down. \u201cThis is not going to work. You need to bring with you a leather bag and a pair of scissors. Don\u2019t let these smiling people fool you. They will be very vicious when you start fighting over the merchandise.\u201d\u201cFight over the merchandise?\u201d Shu Yan honestly had no idea what that was all about.\u201cYou need to fight over the good stuff. Whoever that wins over them will get to make money.\u201d The older woman took Shu Yan to one side and taught her the tricks. \u201cDo this. Follow me when we get inside. When I say \u2018hurry\u2019, you just grab. Grab as much as you can. Once they are in your hands, hang onto them as tightly as you can. Anyone who tried to take them from you, you stab them with your scissors. But also watch out for others\u2019 scissors. Many people will try to stab you while you are grabbing the merchandise. Look at this scar on my hand, that\u2019s from someone else\u2019s scissors. Once you get inside, it\u2019d be so chaotic that you\u2019d have no idea who cut you. So you won\u2019t be able to hold anyone accountable.\u201dShu Yan was stunned. Was buying merchandise such a scary event?Once it was 4 AM, the clothing market opened up. The crowd rushed inside immediately. Shu Yan, her entire person, was pushed inside by others. Her feet didn\u2019t even touch the ground.\u201cThe red dresses are mine! I want them all!\u201d\u201cThey are mine! I was here first!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t just stand around. Hurry up and grab what you like,\u201d said the older woman as she gave Shu Yan a shove.It was only now that Shu Yan understood the craze of buying merchandise. Anything that looked somewhat decent was gone right away, as if they were free.Shu Yan grabbed two bundles with the older woman. When she took a look at them, she noticed that the older woman has fairly good taste. Both designs were quite fashionable.\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work. You need to act even faster next time. Otherwise, all the pretty ones will be gone,\u201d said the older woman to Shu Yan after she had finished paying for hers.All Shu Yan could say was that all the boutique boss ladies have good tastes. They all liked the same ones that she also had her eyes on, which created some sort of a frenzy. Shu Yan was almost cut by others\u2019 scissors. Had the older woman not warned her earlier, she would probably have sustained injuries by now.After a round of buying merchandise frenzy, the sun was starting to come up, and all the boutique owners began to regain their rationality. They started looking for shops that they were familiar with and picked out merchandise carefully.\u201cThis being your first time, you must not know much.\u201d The older woman took Shu Yan to have her merchandise stored away before they headed toward the inside portion. \u201cDon\u2019t let how busy the outside fool you. After a while, you\u2019ll learn that some of the good shops are not over here. What level of a boutique store do you have in mind?\u201d\u201cMid to high end,\u201d replied Shu Yan honestly.\u201cThen come with me to the shop that I visit often. Their merchandise is of good quality and they are also stylish. More importantly, if we go together, we can ask for a steeper discount.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their quality was very high, and of course, their prices were higher as well. The difference in cost was within Shu Yan\u2019s acceptable range. Her own shop would be a mid- to high-end shop, so naturally, the quality would have to be better than that of the average shops.Their varieties were quite good as well. She picked some summer clothes, fall clothes, and even some for late fall. Many of the ones she picked overlapped with the older woman\u2019s, but as they were not based out of the same city, that was not a problem at all. Then what remained was the matter of the cost.\u201cWe are buying so much this time. You are going to lower the cost some more, right?\u201d That was the main reason why the older woman was so passionate about Shu Yan going with her.\u201cExactly, my shop is just opening up and I need a lot of merchandise. If you give us a better discount, I will come back here next time for my merchandise.\u201d Shu Yan helped out from one side. She had spent a lot of money recently, anything that she could save will be helpful. She needed to be frugal.\u201cHow much do you plan on getting?\u201d asked the boss lady.Shu Yan was new to this, so she wasn\u2019t sure either. She took a few of small and medium sizes but just one large one. Most people at this day and age were skinny; there weren\u2019t a lot of chubby people. But she needed to carry all sizes just in case someone came in and asked for a large. When push came to shove, she could always just wear it herself. Or she\u2019d do some sort of a promotion. She grew up in the era when she was constantly bombarded with all sorts of promotional activities. She knew she\u2019d be able to sell it one way or another.\u201cWhen is your store\u2019s grand opening ?\u201d asked the older woman after taking a look at the clothes that Shu Yan had picked out.\u201cProbably around the 20th of next month. I\u2019ll have someone pick a good date when I go back.\u201d Shu Yan didn\u2019t feel that she was being superstitious. She was going to start her own business; it couldn\u2019t hurt to be a little bit superstitious.\u201cLose the summer clothes and get some fall ones. Focus on winter clothes. These knitwear are too thin; they are not practical enough,\u201d said the older woman to Shu Yan softly.Not practical? Shu Yan took a look at the knitted sweaters. She felt that they were quite practical. Once they got into fall, they\u2019d need to add a coat on top. These knitwear would be perfect to go with either skirts or pants. Come winter, they would turn into the under layer and add a jacket or a coat above it.\u201cAnd don\u2019t pick too many of these colors,\u201d said the older woman as she pointed at some bright colored ones. \u201cThey may be popular this year, but that may not be the case the year after. If you don\u2019t sell them all, you\u2019d have to eat it up yourself.\u201dDon\u2019t think that women in the 90s didn\u2019t care about being fashionable. Everybody liked to look pretty and it\u2019s women\u2019s nature to pursue fashion. Especially for a city like City Nan, it had always been on the frontline of what was fashionable. What was popular now might not be popular next year. She\u2019d end up losing money.Shu Yan nodded at her advice. But, she\u2019d still need to pick some bright colored ones. She couldn\u2019t just be selling only black, white, and red clothes.Shu Yan didn\u2019t think merchandising would cost too much at first. She quickly learned that she was being too overly na\u00efve. Each style has five different colors and each color has different sizes. Each style would make up 5-20 different pieces of clothing. Shu Yan felt that she had only picked out a handful of styles, but when it came time to pay, she already had several hundreds of items.Shu Yan had bought so much that the boss would have them delivered to her, providing that she paid for the delivery fee herself. And, she couldn\u2019t delay paying for the merchandise. All she could say was that wholesalers at this day and age were much more aggressive.\u201cThank you so much for everything today, big sister. You must let me buy you lunch.\u201d Shu Yan followed the older lady around to a few other shops. She didn\u2019t buy anything, but just to learn their whereabouts so she would know where to go next time.\u201cNah, I can\u2019t. I must catch my ride back to Wen Province. If I missed it, the next one will be tomorrow. Maybe next time. We will have the opportunity,\u201d said the older woman as she waved her hand in a friendly manner.It was such a hassle in the pre-cellphone days. Shu Yan considered at least getting a pager. At least, they would have some means of getting hold of each other that way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The driver was a nice guy. He walked over and helped Shu Yan put her clothes into the trunk when he spotted her.\u201cLe and the others aren\u2019t back yet?\u201d If they were only picking the newest styles, they should be done before her.\u201cNot yet, but they should be back soon.\u201dShu Yan handed a bottle of beverage to the driver and asked him, \u201cHow often do you do a trip like this? Do you have a phone number? How do I get hold of you next time?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t get too close with Le and the others. Who knew what they\u2019d do behind her back for their businesses? Shu Yan hoped to find someone whose shop was not on West City Nan Road to share a ride.\u201cI have a home phone. You can call me directly when you need a car next time. Here\u2019s my business card and it also has my pager number on there. You can page me if it\u2019s urgent. I usually do a run every three days or so; sometimes every day. I am only responsible for providing the car, you will need to find the others to split the ride with.\u201d The driver immediately killed off Shu Yan\u2019s idea.Made sense though. It made no difference to the driver whether there were one or four riders. He charged the same amount. In fact, if there were less people, he could even save on gas.Ah well. Drivers were in high demand back then. She\u2019d just have to go ask around shops that were farther from her. It was quite a bit of distance between City Nan and City Hang; everyone would need a ride.\u201cOkay. Thank you,\u201d said Shu Yan with a smile.They chitchatted a little more before Le and her lot returned. When she saw Shu Yan, Le said unhappily, \u201cWhere did you go? We have been looking for you all over.\u201d\u201cExactly. You said you were going to the bathroom and then you were gone. We were worried about you and went looking for you. We even went looking in the bathroom and waited for you outside. We didn\u2019t even get our clothes.\u201d Zhu Hung was equally upset.Shu Yan raised her brows and said, \u201cI was standing next to the bathroom the entire time. I didn\u2019t see you guys?\u201d\u201cReally? How come we didn\u2019t see you?\u201d Le was less aggressive now.\u201cWe must have just missed each other. Sorry. I ran into someone from my hometown and started chatting. We did go and look for you guys outside the door but didn\u2019t see you.\u201d Shu Yan scanned back and forth from one of them to the next and said, \u201cI did run into Le inside the market. You were grabbing some merchandise at the time. I called out to you, but you didn\u2019t hear me. I turned around and you were gone again. What a mess. So sorry. Mainly this was my first time and I had no idea what was going on.\u201dLe and the rest didn\u2019t seem embarrassed at all. Hearing Shu Yan\u2019s answer, they smiled immediately and said, \u201cHow unfortunate that we missed each other earlier. Oh, right, where\u2019s that person from your hometown?\u201d\u201cShe needed to catch her ride. So lucky I ran into her today. I didn\u2019t think there was so much to know about merchandising.\u201d Shu Yan scanned over them again. Honestly, they didn\u2019t know each other that well, and it wasn\u2019t their obligation to give her any tips and tricks. But then, they wanted to feign being friendly while not sharing anything, that was kind of silly, at least put up a front or something.\u201cYou guys did well!\u201d Shu Yan looked at the clothes in their arms and smiled.\u201cThey were mostly Zhu Hung\u2019s and Fan Xiaomei\u2019s. All they needed were men\u2019s clothing and children\u2019s clothing. There was no need to fight at all. By the way, have you decided what kind of clothing you are going to sell yet?\u201d asked Le, concerned.\u201cWomen\u2019s clothing. The lady I ran into said women\u2019s clothing is better and I agree with her. But my style is slightly different than yours. Yours are sexier and I went with more plain-looking ones. I don\u2019t think there will be any conflicts.\u201d Shu Yan could tell that Le wanted to check out her style of clothing in her bag. She made sure the bags were tied up tightly and didn\u2019t pay her any attention.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, they were all exhausted. Nobody said anything but slept all the way back to City Nan.The good thing about splitting a car was that the driver would drop them off at the front of their shop. It was now 10 AM, and the workers and foreman were working on the remodeling. Zhang Huaxiu wasn\u2019t at the shop. The foreman told Shu Yan that she went to get some stuff from the market.Shu Yan was worried about her kids at home, so she didn\u2019t wait around for Zhang Huaxiu but left a word with the foreman and headed home.The two kids were very well behaved. Jingjing was doing her homework and Tianbo was sitting in bed playing with his toy car.\u201cMom.\u201d Jingjing\u2019s eyes beamed when she saw her mother.Their mother had left the night before for merchandising and didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d be back. She even bought them food ahead of time. Ye Jingjing didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be back so soon.\u201cHave you had breakfast yet?\u201d Shu Yan glanced over at the kitchen. She worried about them using the stove and wouldn\u2019t let them go inside the kitchen. She bought them a lot of biscuits and other dried goods.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dThe two kids replied at the same time.Jingjing was the one who said they had eaten and Tianbo was the one who said they hadn\u2019t. Shu Yan could see biscuit crumbs around Tianbo\u2019s mouth. She poked him on his forehead and said, \u201cA little puppy ate the biscuits then.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no puppy in the house,\u201d said Tianbo, looking at Shu Yan dumbfounded.\u201cYes, it\u2019s right here.\u201d Shu Yan laughed and pinched his nose.\u201cI am not a puppy.\u201d Ye Tianbao giggled.\u201cMom will go and make you lunch. It won\u2019t be long.\u201d It\u2019s already past 11 AM. The two kids must be starving.She quickly cooked some noodles, fried up a few eggs, mixed a cold dish, and a simple lunch was done. Shu Yan drank a few spoonful of hot soup and her stomach felt much better right away. In the past, she had always thought that those in the clothing industry always got to dress up nicely, put on nice makeup, and just sit around the shop to collect money. Now that she had her own shop, she finally learned that being in the clothing industry was no small feat.She really didn\u2019t want to do the dishes. Shu Yan had Jingjing take Tianbo to play in her room. Once Shu Yan got back to her own room, she didn\u2019t even change before she plopped down in bed. Her entire brain felt dull right now, and she fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.When the alarm went off, Shu Yan really wanted to toss it across the room. But, thinking about the two kids, she must get up to make them dinner. No wonder everybody says that mothers are superhumans. They were all forced into it.Spareribs and corn soup, a plate of fried vegetables, and a cold dish, that was the dinner for the three of them.\u201cI want more, Mom.\u201d Tianbo could eat on his own now and was very good at it too.That was mainly the credit of the teachers. The teachers at the kindergarten and tutorial center didn\u2019t care if you had eaten enough. If students didn\u2019t want to eat, then they would go hungry in the afternoon. After two or three times, Tianbo became very proactive when it came to eating. He even stopped being picky about what he ate at home as well.\u201cMom, I want to bring lunch like big sister too.\u201d Tianbo was very envious that his sister got to bring the lunch that their mother made for her to bring to school every day. There were eggs and meat. He only got a couple slices of meat at the kindergarten.\u201cYou don\u2019t like the meals at the kindergarten?\u201d They charged $200 a month. That was definitely high end as far as kindergartens were concerned. They weren\u2019t skimming on the kids\u2019 food, were they?\u201cIt was all carrots, potatoes, and leafy vegetables. We only get one to two slices of meat. Mom\u2019s cooking is way better,\u201d said Tianbo while looking at his mother like a little puppy.\u201cMom will go and check it out at the kindergarten tomorrow.\u201d Shu Yan suddenly remembered news that she had heard in the past when parents found out that the kitchens of some kindergartens were very dirty, and they only fed the kids with potatoes and leafy vegetables. She suddenly felt worried and decided that she\u2019d have to personally go check it out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All the families that were able to send their children here were well off, and all the kids were little princes and little princesses at home.Shu Yan spoke with a few of the other parents about what she had heard from Tianbo and suggested to pay the school a sudden visit during lunch time.\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Shu Yan\u2019s words had piqued the interest of Grandma Wu, the one who fought fiercely over the issue of the tutorial center. \u201cNo wonder my precious baby enjoys dinner so thoroughly; he was being starved at school.\u201d\u201cMy kid as well. He always says he\u2019s hungry and would eat a lot over dinner. I just assumed he was hungry so often because he has been playing hard at school. You mean to say that he wasn\u2019t well fed? No way. I need to go and talk to his teachers about it.\u201d\u201cWait, we don\u2019t have any evidence right now. The teachers won\u2019t admit to it just because you asked. We will need proof. The kids are still young, and they don\u2019t know anything. Let\u2019s just free up our mornings and wait for the kindergarten\u2019s lunch hour. That way we can see for ourselves what they are feeding our kids and check out the hygiene of the kitchen. What do you say?\u201d Shu Yan stopped the others. No way they\u2019d just admit to it if they march over there right now. They would need evidence. Otherwise, they would just seem like an unreasonable bunch.The few parents hesitated for a little and agreed with Shu Yan.\u201cI need to go to work. I can try to rush over here during lunch time?\u201dA few of the mothers needed to go in to work; their schedules were not as flexible as the stay-at-home mothers and the grandmothers.\u201cThere\u2019s a few of us already. A few more or less won\u2019t make too much difference. Just try to hurry over when you can.\u201d Grandma Wu was the first to speak.She was a nice lady as long as her precious grandson was not concerned.All of the parents were property owners in the district, and Grandma Wu was one of the first to move into the area. She had invited everyone over to her place today.Shu Yan didn\u2019t know that Grandma Wu\u2019s unit was also in Building #2 before today. Her apartment was on the ground floor. She said her son thought it\u2019s better for her and her husband to be on the ground floor considering their ages.\u201cMainly that the ground floor also came with a yard and my husband enjoyed gardening a lot,\u201d said Grandma Wu as she had the guests take their seats and brought out some sliced-up watermelons. \u201cCome. Come. Help yourself. It will cool you down.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d said Shu Yan as she took the watermelon and smiled. \u201cWhat a coincidence? I\u2019ve bought a unit in Building #2 as well. I am the owner of #1201. We are actually neighbors.\u201d\u201cOh, mi. We are, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Grandpa Wu gave Shu Yan a surprised look. She\u2019d think Shu Yan would have gotten a smaller unit, but she got a large unit on the 12th floor. That was unexpected.Before long, Grandpa Wu came home with his hoe over his shoulder and some vegetables in his hands. He gave Grandma Wu a curious look when he saw a houseful of people.After hearing the reason, Grandpa Wu\u2019s face dropped. \u201cYou are right. We need to keep an eye out on that. Great if everything is fine; otherwise, we must get to the bottom of it.\u201dKindergarten\u2019s lunch time starts at 11 AM. Shu Yan and the rest of them arrived at 10:30 and asked to be let into the kindergarten but were blocked by the guard.\u201cWe are the kids\u2019 parents. Why can\u2019t we go inside to see our kids?\u201d asked one of the mothers.\u201cThe kids are in class right now. I trust that you wouldn\u2019t want to distract them in the middle of their class, right?\u201d explained the guard nicely.\u201cWe are not going to distract the kids in class. We just want to look around the kindergarten. Why can\u2019t we?\u201d said Grandma Wu.The guard was speechless for a second there, and Grandma Wu waved her hand in a domineering way. She said, \u201cWe just want to take a look and make sure the kids are behaving and be on our way.\u201dThe group got inside the kindergarten successfully. The kids were not playing outside, presumably they were back in the classroom waiting for their lunches. The group of them headed straight toward the kitchen. A teacher saw them and stopped them.\u201cAre you parents? The classrooms are over that way. You are heading the wrong direction.\u201d\u201cWe are not heading the wrong direction. We have some free time today and wanted to see what our kids are having for lunch. Why? Is there a problem with that?\u201d said one of the grandmothers with a smile.The parents all talked at the same time, and the teacher wasn\u2019t able to stop them from going into the kitchen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all experts in housework. As soon as they walked inside of the kitchen, they noticed right away that something was wrong. There was a large workstation in the middle of the kitchen. On top of it, there were three large tubs with potatoes, carrots, and lettuces inside of them, respectively. None of them were covered up, and there were quite a few flies crawling all over them.All of their faces turned black. And when they saw the food that was still in the pot, they looked even worse.When they signed up to the school, they were promised a meat dish and vegetable dish for every meal. What they saw was a fried potatoes with carrots dish, a lettuce dish, and a tomato and egg drop soup that one could barely see any eggs inside.Someone immediately discovered there was meat on top of the cutting board. It was half chopped already. She picked it up and looked. It was pork neck.Anyone who cooked would know that pork neck was the worst of all meat. Recently, there were even studies that stated that having too much of that could be detrimental to one\u2019s health. And that\u2019s what they were feeding to the kids?The parents were so upset they were about to pass out right then and there. All of their precious babies at home were fed these at their kindergarten? Their hearts ache so much they almost have a hard time breathing.\u201cGo, go get your principal. We bought the house here because we liked this kindergarten. We were told that this was supposed to be an international school, and there were foreigner teachers that will be teaching the kids bilingually. Never mind that there were only two foreigner teachers here. We didn\u2019t have high hopes that the children would learn a lot at this age. But we pay so much money every month and that\u2019s what you are feeding our kids? No wonder my kid said she was hungry right after school. No way this was enough food to fill her up!\u201d\u201cThis is just awful. You feed pork neck to the kids? And there was no hygiene to speak of here. We are not done here.\u201dThe ten or so parents all erupted there and all scolded them angrily. The principal, hearing about the ruckus, came running over. He wiped away his sweat on his forehead and tried to sound as calm as possible. \u201cLet\u2019s all remain calm. We can take our time and talk this through.\u201d\u201cTake our time? No, we can\u2019t take our time. I am afraid that you will kill my child. This wasn\u2019t what was shown to us way back when. So it was all a scam because the kids don\u2019t know any better. Thunder will strike greedy people like you. This is costing us $200 a month! $300 if you add in the tutorial center fee! That\u2019s a regular person\u2019s monthly salary. And that\u2019s what you are feeding our kids? You better give us an answer today.\u201d\u201cAnswer? We are going to talk to property management directly. This was supposed to be the best district and best kindergarten in City Nan. And the best kindergarten was feeding pork neck to the kids?\u201d\u201cYes, we are going to talk to property management. We have spent so much money on our houses and so much money on the tuitions. And they wouldn\u2019t even feed our children property. They better step up and take the responsibilities.\u201d\u201cI say we call the cops directly. This was like homicide.\u201d Grandma Wu was so angry that her face was flustered.Their children were all precious babies at home. They only wish the kids would eat even one more bite at home. And they have just found out that the kids were being abused at the kindergarten. That was like a stab to all the mothers and grandmothers\u2019 hearts.Shu Yan opened her mouth, but realized that she didn\u2019t get a chance to get in a word at all. The angry parents had already squeezed her out of the immediate circle. Now, the bulk of their fire power were the grandmothers.The group of them went over to property management and angrily demanded to talk to the property manager. It was quite intimidating for those who had no idea what was going on.The property manager was a very friendly-looking woman. But one couldn\u2019t be more wrong if they truly thought she was a friendly person. After all, anyone who could hold the position of a property manager would not be any kind of a pushover at this day and age.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There are so many of you and all trying to talk at the same time, I don\u2019t understand what is the problem here. Let me find out what is going on first, that way I can look for a solution.\u201dOnce she had learned of the issue, she casted the kindergarten principal a glance then smiled and said in a fawning manner, \u201cIt\u2019s so hot outside today, why don\u2019t you come with me and have a seat in the lobby?\u201d The manager\u2019s gentle tone calmed a lot of the grandmothers in the front. She took them into the lobby and brought out water, tea, and a lot of fruits. When all was said and done, the angry parents began to calm down.Seeing that the time was about right, the property manager smiled and said, \u201cOkay, I think I understand what is going on now. I think the principal wasn\u2019t too clear when she explained it. The school has hired a professional nutritionist to advise on their meals. We were told that kids their age don\u2019t have very good GI, so we need to give them more vegetables over meat. I trust that the kids aren\u2019t too keen about eating vegetables at home, right?\u201dSeeing that neither the mothers nor the grandmothers said anything, the manager smiled and carried on, \u201cWe hired a very well-known nutritionist from HK and he told us that kids need to have a lot of vegetables to maintain their vitamins. He\u2019d plan out a whole week\u2019s worth of menu for the kids and the items change daily. Today happened to be potatoes and carrots, lettuce, a small meat dish, plus a tomato and egg drop soup \u2013 a meat, two vegetables, and a soup. After lunch, the kids will each get half an apple. I guarantee you that the vegetables, meat, and fruit combo is the best among all the kindergartens in City Nan.\u201d\u201cAre we talking about the menu right now? We are talking about hygiene. We are talking about the kind of meat that you give to our kids.\u201d Shu Yan walked out from the back. \u201cYes, it is important that the kids have vegetables, but if they are not hygienic, I rather him not have any. After the vegetables were washed out, they weren\u2019t even covered and there were flies crawling all over them. Never mind that there wasn\u2019t a lot of meat, but feeding pork neck to the kids? Where is this nutritionist from HK that you speak of? I want to go ask him myself whether that\u2019s the most nutritious part. If he\u2019d say it to our faces that that\u2019s good for the kids, then we are being unreasonable and we will apologize.\u201d\u201cExactly. We are not talking about the combination of the meals. We are talking about food hygiene and ingredients. Is $200 a month not enough? If so, you can say so. There\u2019s no need to skim on the kids\u2019 meals.\u201d Grandma Wu came around right away and added immediately.\u201cExactly, the kids are so young. We sent them to your kindergarten because we trusted you. And that\u2019s what you are feeding our kids? And now you are telling me that there is nothing wrong? You go get that nutritionist. Let\u2019s ask him if he eats pork neck himself.\u201dThe parents started all over again.The property manager gave Principal Lin a stare. She\u2019s here trying all she could to resolve the issues and he hid from her the most serious of all issues. Never mind that he was skimming from the meal budget for the kids, but he was feeding them pork neck and couldn\u2019t even maintain basic hygiene? After today, she must reflect this to upper management.\u201cFellow parents. Please calm down for a little bit and listen to me. It is summer, so it\u2019s inevitable that there will be a few flies in the kitchen. The teachers had already informed me of the situation, and I have already sent someone to get some fly stickers. As for the pork neck and hygiene condition, I had assigned the kitchen under the vice principal\u2019s management. I can\u2019t believe something like this has happened. I had overlooked this and will definitely look into it and take care of it.\u201d Principal Lin finally stood up and said to everyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Especially when it came to something as important as the affairs of the kitchen. All in all, none of the parents believed him.\u201cPlease let us know if you have some suggestions. We are not happy to find out about this kind of issue either. The most important thing right now is not to point fingers but to figure out a solution so the children will be able to have clean and healthy meals,\u201d said the manager as if she could really relate.\u201cWe will need some time to talk it over first,\u201d said Grandma Wu, seemingly now the leader of the group.This was the only kindergarten within the district. The other ones were all sort of far. Besides, if the one under their nose could let this happen, who was to say that nothing similar would happen at another kindergarten? But the principal and the kitchen workers needed to be swapped out. And the vice principal as well.\u201cWhat say we talk it through when the other parents show up to pick up the kids in the evening?\u201d said Shu Yan out of the blue from where she was standing. She purposefully did not lower her voice. When the manager and principal heard her, they both turned pale.Tens of parents were already a handful. The issue would only escalate if there were 50 ~ 60 parents. It might even attract media attention and for sure would become a black mark for the top properties of City Nan. By then, not only the principal, even the property management would be in trouble.\u201cI think you can represent the rest of the parents in this matter. We should resolve this issue as soon as possible. We wouldn\u2019t want to wait on matters with the kids, right?\u201d The property manager smiled and poured tea for all the parents. A young girl walked over to her and whispered something in her ears. The property manager smiled and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet, right? I\u2019ll have someone order lunch for us. Why don\u2019t we have some food and then talk this through?\u201d\u201cWe have no appetite right now.\u201d What lunch? Their kids at the kindergarten haven\u2019t even eaten yet.The parents were anxious. They didn\u2019t care about being a little bit hungry. They were more worried that their babies were hungry.\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry. I have already arranged for them to prepare a different meal at the kindergarten. All the ingredients were bought fresh from the market. There was pork belly plus a spareribs and seaweed soup. If you are still worried, you are welcome to go take a look right now,\u201d said the property manager right away.There was, of course, no need to go back to look right now. It has been a while since they have taken off from the kindergarten. They probably had already sent people over to take care of the situation over there. There was no way they would see any signs of the sliced potatoes or sliced carrots, not to mention the pork neck. All the flies were probably all dead by now. It wasn\u2019t that the school employees couldn\u2019t help it before; they just never tried before. As long as they had paid it some attention, none of those issues that the parents and grandparents had witnessed earlier should exist.\u201cWhat is the point of arranging that now? We don\u2019t even know how long our kids have been having these unhygienic meals. These were all issues with the management. Things like these never should have happened in the first place. Aiyo. My head hurt from being so angry,\u201d complained one of the grandmothers.They then spent 1 ~ 2 hours discussing the issues. The parents demanded the principal and vice principal be replaced, as well as the cooks in the kitchen. The new cook would be interviewed by them and the school must hire two more kitchen helpers. Grandma Wu suggested that they hire someone that they knew, so they could also double as supervisors.Principal Lin got progressively more upset as they were talking. Right when he was about to jump up and say something, he was pulled back by the property manager, who smiled and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have enough authority to make these decisions, but I will for sure reflect them quickly to my superiors and give you an answer as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear \u2018as soon as possible\u2019, just give me an exact time.\u201d Shu Yan frowned and wouldn\u2019t let them keep pushing this issue out. That wasn\u2019t what she wanted to see. \u201cI am going to inform the other parents later. If you don\u2019t provide us with a solution by tomorrow, we will come again together.\u201d\u201cExactly. If that\u2019s not do-able, we all have our relatives. We won\u2019t let you off the hook easily,\u201d said Grandma Wu.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Same time tomorrow. For sure I will provide you with a solution that you will be happy about.\u201d The property manager was worried. She definitely believed that these parents would do all sorts of crazy things for their children, so the sooner she could have this resolved the better.\u201cNow that we are here. Why don\u2019t we settle the issue with the afterclass tutorial center as well?\u201d said one of the mothers.Everybody turned to look at her, including Shu Yan.At the beginning, the tutorial center boasted staffing with only foreigner instructors as the kindergarten\u2019s principal and teachers said this was the best time for kids to start learning languages. Mainly, they have seen that all the other parents had signed up and were worried that if they didn\u2019t sign their kids up, they would be ostracized, or worse, the teacher at the kindergarten would single them out. $100 a month fee was not cheap, but many of the parents gritted their teeth and shelled it out for their children.The first week was, indeed, taught by all foreigner instructors. A week later, more and more parents noticed that the time the foreigner instructors were there had been dwindling, and it was the same kindergarten teachers that were teaching their children. The parents had talked about this previously, but they worried that the teachers would mistreat the children and chose to remain quiet.\u201cThe tutorial center was an obvious bait and switch scheme. I suggest canceling the tutorial center altogether. As it was run by the same teachers as the kindergarten, we will just decide for ourselves which teacher we want taking care of our children. We will pay that teacher directly to compensate for their time. Same for the weekends, those who can take care of the children themselves can keep their children at home; the rest will drop their kids off at school and pay extra as they see fit. $100 is a bit on the high end.\u201dMany others agreed with her, especially some of the grandmothers.\u201cExactly. I have retired to take care of my grandchild at home. I have plenty of free time over the weekend. The kid\u2019s parents would like to spend more time with him on the weekends as well. But the school came up with this tutorial center idea. It just seemed like some scheme to make more money.\u201d Thinking about her grandson who had lost a lot of weight recently, Grandma Wu\u2019s heart was bleeding.Principal Lin was just about to say something when he was, again, dragged back by the property manager. She gave him a stare and said with a smile, \u201cI will definitely reflect all of your opinions to my supervisors and provide you with a satisfactory response.\u201dThe property manager needed to report up to replace the management of the kindergarten, but all the cooks and workers responsible for maintaining the hygiene of the kindergarten were let go right away, as a means to quell the anger of the parents. Judging from the way the property manager looked, Principal Lin would most likely be let go as well. The parents finally felt a little bit better.When they returned to the kindergarten, the kids were about to be let out. Seeing Shu Yan and the group returning together, a lot of the other parents wondered about what was going on. Finding out from them about the incident angered many of them.\u201cSo what was the property management going to do about it?\u201d The other parents walked over right away.\u201cWe had a discussion with them today. We have demanded the kindergarten management be replaced and look for new workers in the kitchen. In addition, they must be someone that passed our interview. We also wanted to use someone that we trust for the helpers in the kitchen.\u201dThe parents were all very cautious when it came to matters about the children. This was a reminder for many of them. The children at the kindergarten right now ranged from a little over 2 years old to the oldest ones that were 5 ~ 6 years old, all of them still at their formative age.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With the crowd outside, even the property management who had always considered herself as a very calm person was a little worried.\u201cHi everyone. Please remain quiet. This is Boss Huang from our company and he has made a special trip here today to take care of the issues that have been brought to our attention. I am sure he will be able to provide you with a satisfactory response.\u201dBoss Huang was in his forties. He was skinny and had on a gold rim spectacle. He looked very cultured and one would think he was a scholar if they didn\u2019t know better.The matters were taken care of smoothly. Principal Lin along with a few of the upper management personnel were let go. The tutorial center was done away with. If the mothers couldn\u2019t come and pick up their children afterward, they could have individual teachers watch over them and negotiate the cost with the teacher directly without the property management as the go-between. If the kindergarten was to remain open on the weekends, it would be an additional $30 fee.These were all good news for single-income families and families that had elders helping out at home. After all, they could save a lot of money and also spend more time with the children.***Weather was still very nice in November this year. Having been in City Nan for most of the month, Shu Yan had yet to take the kids out.\u201cWhat do you think about going to the zoo today?\u201d asked Shu Yan with a smile as she helped Tianbao get dressed.The zoo? Both Ye Jingjing and Tianbao\u2019s eyes lit up. Wang Yitong had been to the zoo and had taken a lot of pictures ,and she had even brought them to school to show to Jingjing. \u201cThe zoo where we can see lions and tigers?\u201dShe had been wanting to go since she had seen the pictures. But Ye Jingjing was a mature little kid. Knowing how difficult it was for Shu Yan to take care of them, she would never express any ideas that would impact her mother negatively.\u201cYes, the zoo. On top of lions and tigers, there are also peacocks, pandas, and other smaller animals. If you want to go then quickly go wash your faces and brush your teeth. We need to head out early; otherwise, we will have to stand in line for a long time,\u201d said Shu Yan as she patted the two kids on their heads.\u201cYou are the bestest, mom! I will go wash my face right away!\u201d Tianbao bounced into the bathroom like a bunny and voluntarily brushed his teeth and washed his face. Then, he brought a stool over to a spot closest to the front door and waited there, worried that Shu Yan would leave him behind.Shu Yan put hats on both children and took them to the zoo.\u201cMom, there are so many people here!\u201d Looking at the long line in front of them, Ye Jingjing was a little anxious. What if they couldn\u2019t get any tickets? Then they wouldn\u2019t be able to see the tigers and pandas.Tianbao, on the other hand, looked all around him and wanted to shake loose of Shu Yan\u2019s hand to run off to play. He finally quieted down with a pout after Shu Yan gave him a stare.About half an hour later, it was finally their turn. \u201cYou must follow mommy once we get inside, okay? Do you still remember what mommy told you before we left the house?\u201d\u201cYes. No talking to strangers. No taking food from strangers. No leaving with strangers.\u201d Ye Jingjing immediately recited the three \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d.\u201cWhat about you, Tianbao? Do you remember?\u201d Shu Yan wasn\u2019t worried about Jingjing. Tianbao she wasn\u2019t so sure about. That fool very well would leave with someone else if they offer him candies.\u201cYes, must always follow Mom. If I can\u2019t see Mom, I will need to go look for Mr. Cop.\u201d As he was saying that, Tianbao\u2019s mind had already gone inside the zoo.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Do you see those uncles and aunties in azure clothes? You go look for them if you lose mommy. Nobody else, alright?\u201d said Shu Yan once again, not feeling too confident about it.\u201cOkay, we will!\u201d replied the two kids loudly.They may know it now, but once they saw these animals they\u2019d probably forget all about it. Shu Yan shook her head in resignation. She must keep a good eye out on them in a bit.And just as she had expected, as soon as she saw the first animal, Tianbao shook free of Shu Yan\u2019s hand and ran over.This was both children\u2019s first time at the zoo, so Shu Yan didn\u2019t want to be too strict with them. She could only stare at them intently and not let them out of her sight even for a quick moment. Luckily, Ye Jingjing was only excited for a little while before she returned to Shu Yan. She didn\u2019t run about madly like Ye Tianbao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s a tiger!\u201d Looking at the tiger inside the cage, he lamented. \u201cThe tiger is so huge! Does he eat humans?\u201d\u201cOf course, especially bad little kids,\u201d said Shu Yan as she bobbed him on the tip of his nose.\u201cHi, comrade, would you like to have your picture taken?\u201d asked a worker of the zoo as he approached them.Tianbao had no idea what a picture was just yet. Ye Jingjing, on the other hand, had seen the ones that Wang Yitong has. She turned shy and finally said, \u201cMom, I would like to have one.\u201dAnd that was the first time Jingjing had asked her for anything. Feeling touched, Shu Yan reached out and patted her on her head.\u201cHow much for one?\u201d\u201c$10 each. We take the picture now and you will be able to pick it up when you are on your way out.\u201d His pad in hand, the worker was prepared to write out the invoice.$10 each was not cheap, but it was a special occasion, so Shu Yan decided to just go for it. The three of them took a picture with the tiger and that was the first picture with the three of them together.\u201cMom, I want a picture with the lions!\u201d Now that he had figured out what a picture was, Ye Tianbao pointed at a lion and shouted.\u201cOkay.\u201d Shu Yan nodded with alacrity. She then turned to Jingjing and said, \u201cYou can pick an animal that you like to take a picture with too.\u201d\u201cCan I pick the panda then?\u201d asked Ye Jingjing, her eyes lit up.\u201cOf course,\u201d said Shu Yan with a smile.After they had walked around the zoo once, they started getting a little tired. Shu Yan took the kids over to the resting area and bought three ice-creams.\u201cThis is so tasty, Mom,\u201d said Tianbao as he blinked at Shu Yan.\u201cEven so, you can only have one. If you have more, you will get an upset stomach.\u201d Shu Yan knew what he meant by that. When he said it was tasty, he meant he wanted another one.Tianbao lowered his head in disappointment. He had learned by now that when his Mom said no, there was no use rolling on the ground throwing a fit.\u201cAlright! Mom will take you to KFC later.\u201d Shu Yan saw KFC when she first walked inside of the zoo. She was very surprised to have seen such a familiar name here.Perhaps, because the author was from the same world as her, there were many things in this world that were very similar to that of hers, including some commonly seen brands. The author had borrowed their names and background directly from the real world. Since they weren\u2019t mentioned a lot, readers didn\u2019t always notice them. But now this was no longer a book to her, but the world that she was living in. One that has flesh, blood, and souls. Many things that weren\u2019t mentioned by the author had also evolved here organically, such as KFC. It might have only been mentioned once or twice, and now they truly exist in this world.\u201cMom, what is KFC?\u201d\u201cThey have lots of tasty food. You will like it.\u201d Shu Yan liked it a lot when she was a kid. After she had graduated college and has had all sorts of take outs, she actually enjoyed regular home cooked meals more.The kids liked KFC just like Shu Yan had expected, especially chicken wings and burgers. Both of them were stuffed. This being their first time, Shu Yan didn\u2019t try to restrain them.\u201cMom, will we come here again?\u201d asked Ye Tianbao with anticipation on their way back. Ye Jingjing didn\u2019t say it out loud, but she also looked at Shu Yan with anticipation.\u201cIf you both are good, Mom will take you here again.\u201dAfter returning home happily, the two kids were still talking about what the animals were doing when they saw them in the zoo and even bickering about some silly details from time to time. Shu Yan\u2019s lips curved upward. Looking at the pictures in her hand, she felt quite content with her current life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Take a look and see what you think of them. I will have someone deliver the couch shortly and I will help you place them then.\u201d As Chen Fei was talking to Shu Yan, he glanced over at Zhang Huaxiu occasionally.Shu Yan glanced over at Zhang Huaxiu, who had been busying herself. She curved her lips upward a little and said, \u201cThank you so much for your help this entire time. If it wasn\u2019t for you, Xiuxiu probably couldn\u2019t handle it all on her own. Why don\u2019t I treat you to lunch in the afternoon to thank you for your help?\u201dDuring the holidays over the National Day of People\u2019s Republic of China, Shu Yan spent most of the time home with her kids and most of the store affairs were taken care of by Zhang Huaxiu. During that period of time, Chen Fei had been visiting her shop every day. One day he had left his drawing at the shop, the next day was to come and check on the effects of the lights, the day after he wanted to double check the measurements of the couch\u2026His excuses were so awful that Shu Yan felt back for him. Finally, when she couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, she stepped up to help and expressed that as it was only women at the shop, she\u2019d like him to come by and help with some physical labor.The workers: Are we not men?\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d said Chen Fei, a little shy, as he looked over at Zhang Huaxiu.During lunch, Shu Yan asked him casually, \u201cWhere are you from? Your accent seems to suggest that you are not a native of City Nan.\u201d\u201cI am from Province Chuan. I am 29 years old. I was assigned to work in a factory in my hometown after I graduated from polytechnic. The unit wasn\u2019t doing well and I felt that my future was very limited there. My uncle was working in City Nan and it seemed nice here so I followed him here. I have already been here for 8 years, practically a City Nan native.\u201dEven though Chen Fei was answering Shu Yan\u2019s question, he glanced over occasionally at Zhang Huaxiu, who was eating with her head lowered.Shu Yan couldn\u2019t help but laugh to herself. All she asked was where he was from, where did all the other information come from? \u201cOh, so you are most self-taught then? Here I thought you studied design in college. I heard from Master Zhang that you are the top designer at your company and a part owner with stocks. That\u2019s quite impressive for someone who\u2019s only 29.\u201dShu Yan wasn\u2019t exaggerating. Chen Fei was quite impressive.Chen Fei smiled shyly. \u201cNot exactly self-taught. My uncle had introduced me to several masters and I trained under them for 4 ~ 5 years before I became independent. And I was lucky enough to run into a nice boss who was willing to give me an opportunity.\u201d\u201cDesigner Chen is so humble.\u201d He was just shy, not reticent. That\u2019s good. Shu Yan looked over at Zhang Huaxiu. She seemed really focused on eating her meal, if only her ears were not reddened.Shu Yan smiled and asked again, \u201cAre you folks still back home? What are your future plans? Will you be staying here in City Nan or going back home?\u201dHearing that question, Zhang Huaxiu\u2019s hand tightened over the chopsticks and her ears perked up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My mom passed away when I was very young and I have been living with my grandparents ever since my dad remarried. Two years ago, my grandparents passed away in succession. I don\u2019t have much ties with my hometown anymore and haven\u2019t been back in almost three years. I plan to settle down here in City Nan. I have already saved up enough money to buy a house, just haven\u2019t decided on where exactly. I figured I\u2019ll let my future wife decide. We can buy wherever she wants.\u201d\u201cDesigner Chen is such a nice man. Sounds like you have everything ready except for a wife! How come you don\u2019t have a girlfriend yet with your qualifications?\u201d\u201cI spent most of my time learning since I have come to City Nan. And I have been busy with work the last few years. I guess I am kind of a boring person and not the type that girls like.\u201d Chen Fei glanced over at Zhang Huaxiu again.\u201cNo, I think that\u2019s good. Men don\u2019t need to be very articulate. One should look for a man who\u2019s responsible to marry. Since Designer Chen doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend yet, why don\u2019t I set you up with someone?\u201d Shu Yan looked over at Zhang Huaxiu deliberately and her meaning was obvious.\u201cBoss lady.\u201d Zhang Huaxiu stood up abruptly and said, \u201cI am not done with the clothes over in the backroom yet. I\u2026 I am going to get back to work.\u201dAiya, she had forgotten that girls back then were still very shy. Shu Yan stuck her tongue out to herself and smiled at Chen Fei. \u201cXiuxiu is the girl I have in mind for you. What do you think? She\u2019s a local of City Nan. Both of her parents are still working. She has an older brother and her family constituent is very simple. Mainly, Xiuxiu is pretty and hardworking. Good temperament too. She\u2019d make a good wife.\u201d\u201cI agree that Xiuxiu is great. I am just not sure how she feels.\u201d Chen Fei\u2019s hands, resting over his thighs, balled into fists. His palms were sweaty.\u201cThat\u2019s why you need to work harder on pursuing her. It\u2019s a new society now. You need to be a little more proactive when you meet someone you like. You don\u2019t want to regret later on.\u201d Shu Yan stopped there. She truly felt that Zhang Huaxiu was a good woman and Chen Fei a good man. And both of them were interested in each other. It\u2019d be a shame if they let the opportunity slip by. That being said, she couldn\u2019t be too overly aggressive either. Being a matchmaker wasn\u2019t easy.After Chen Fei had left and Shu Yan was tidying up the inventory with Zhang Huaxiu, she asked about her opinion.\u201cI think he is nice,\u201d said Zhang Huaxiu with some shyness.\u201cNice\u201d meant \u201cvery good\u201d! Shu Yan smiled and said, \u201cI think so too. You can try to get to know him better and give both of you a chance.\u201dAnd she stopped right there. They would have to pick up from there.As the clothes started to come in, Shu Yan, Zhang Huaxiu and Yingying worked together at organizing them.Yingying was a new salesperson that Shu Yan hired last week. She has yet to find herself a store manager. There had been a few candidates, but Shu Yan wasn\u2019t quite happy with them. A salesperson just needed to have a nice body and be somewhat articulate, but that couldn\u2019t be the only requirements for a store manager. The store manager would need to possess both experience and managerial ability. If she couldn\u2019t find someone who fit the bills, she\u2019d rather just leave the position vacant for the time being.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She even put makeup and wigs on them. With the clothes on them and under the canned lights, the two dummies appeared to be sparkle and the entire shop looked much classier.\u201cThe clothes here look pretty good. That dress is so pretty. And that suit looks nice too.\u201d One of the two women walking down the streets holding hands pointed at the set on the dummy and said in a low voice.\u201cIt does look nice. Let\u2019s go inside and check it out,\u201d said the other slightly chubbier girl.The two saw them hanging up clothes on the inside and asked Shu Yan, who was standing to one side, \u201cYou are not open yet?\u201d\u201cWe will have a grand opening day after tomorrow. We will have a lot of promotions then. Here\u2019s a flyer. Take a look.\u201d Shu Yan put down the clothes in her hands and handed them two flyers. \u201cEven though the grand opening is the day after tomorrow, if you like anything today, I will give you the promotional discount as well.\u201d\u201cYou will give us a discount today?\u201d\u201cOf course,\u201d said Shu Yan as she took them over to where the clothes were already hung up. \u201cAre you looking for tops or dresses? I can help you mix and match.\u201dShu Yan had been doing her burpees, eating less during dinner, and no food after dinner and had already lost 5 kg. She had looked for a place to specifically weight herself a couple of days ago and she now weighs 66 kg. At her height of 158 cm, she was still fat but much less than when she had first transmigrated. Now she could put on a large size dress from her shop and not seem ugly and out of style. With some light makeup and the confidence radiating from her, the two girls didn\u2019t mind her.\u201cI want to look for a dress for the fall. Something a little thicker that I can also wear in the winter with just a jacket,\u201d said the girl with light colored skin.\u201cI want to buy something a little more formal that is good for gatherings or dinners,\u201d said the girl who was just a little skinnier than Shu Yan. \u201cAnd this one that you have on. Can I try it on as well?\u201dThe light skinned girl has a good body and it was easy to find clothes for her. Shu Yan showed her a light-colored knitted dress and said, \u201cWhat do you think of this one? Your skin is very light colored. With this plus your skin color, all you need to do is to add a red or black jacket in the winter time. When you are home and take the jacket off, the inside is pretty also.\u201d\u201cWill this be a bit warm for the weather right now?\u201d The light skinned woman was a bit hesitant.\u201cIt\u2019s already almost October and the weather will be cooling down soon. You will be able to wear this probably next month. Any colder, you can just add a light jacket. A thicker one for the winter. It\u2019s easy to mix and match.\u201d Shu Yan pulled over a windbreaker and placed it over the dress. \u201cLook. Doesn\u2019t it look good with this beige windbreaker? Or you can go with a jean jacket to look more Western. As for the winter\u2026\u201d Shu Yan pulled over a white padded jacket. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this look classy?\u201dThe light-skinned woman\u2019s eyes beamed at all of them. \u201cCan I try them all on?\u201d\u201cOf course. Xuixiu, can you show her the changing room?\u201d Shu Yan hollered at Xiuxiu to take the customer over to try the clothes on.\u201cUm, I like those that you\u2019ve just shown her too,\u201d said the chubbier girl after her friend had walked away.\u201cIf you two go out together a lot, you wouldn\u2019t want to accidentally have on the same set.\u201d What Shu Yan didn\u2019t say was that a knitted dress would not look good on a chubbier girl like her. It\u2019d only accentuate all her bad sides. Shu Yan pulled over a suit jacket set. \u201cGive this one a try. You can wear it to work or to dinner. For gatherings, you can try this set that I have on right now. I\u2019ll go get you a new one.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her body was very shapely, big bosoms and round bottom. She looked a little s*xy even with the knitted dress.\u201cIs this bad?\u201d She liked it a lot, but she also worried that it was too bold.\u201cWhy is it bad? So many people wear fitness pants with suspenders nowadays. This is much more conservative in comparison.\u201d Shu Yan circled her and said, \u201cIf I have your body, I\u2019d dress like that every day.\u201dOf course, the girl was happy with the compliments. Plus, she liked it a lot after she had put it on. After adding the windbreaker, she looked much more competent right away. She then tried on the jean jacket and suddenly looked very modern. The white padded jacket made her look docile immediately. Three different jackets gave three different styles, and she liked all of them. The girl holding onto all of them felt that she\u2019d regret regardless of which one she decided against.\u201cHow much are they?\u201d She thought she\u2019d ask for the cost first. If they aren\u2019t too overly expensive, she\u2019d just buy them all.\u201c$20 for the knitted dress, $35 for the jean jacket, $58 for the windbreaker, $68 for the cotton padded jacket. We have a buy 5 get one free promotion. Meaning if you buy a total of 5 pieces, the cheapest one will be free. You have four here already; one more and one of them will be free.

You can take advantage of multiple promotions.\u201d\u201cYou mean there will be another discount even with the one free one?\u201d The woman did the mathematics in her head quickly. The four items added up to 181 yuan. That\u2019s 10 yuan less with the promotion. That seemed silly. One more and she would go over 200 yuan and she could have 20 yuan off. No, wait. 200 yuan would be over her budget for the day.The woman was still mulling when her friend came out. The suit jacket made her look skinnier. Shu Yan helped her tie her hair up, and she looked very competent all of a sudden.\u201cYour features are very pretty. You will look even prettier with some light makeup,\u201d said Shu Yan with a light smile.\u201cYuanyuan, you are so pretty,\u201d exclaimed the light-skinned woman from next to her.\u201cYou are pretty too,\u201d said Yuanyuan, feeling a little shy. \u201cBoss lady, how much is this set?\u201d\u201c$60.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will take this set. Let me go try on the dress.\u201d Yuanyuan excitedly returned to the changing room.\u201cBoss, me too. Can you help me pick out a skirt that I can wear now and a pair of pants for the fall?\u201dBoth of them paid for their goods with alacrity. As the first customers of Shu Yan\u2019s official opening, Shu Yan gave the two of them a small gift each plus a membership card.\u201cThe membership card is only for those who had spent over $288. But it\u2019s fate that you two came in today, so here\u2019s your membership card. You can have 5% off in the future with this card and also will receive points for money that you\u2019ve spent here. And you will be able to exchange the points for gifts. I don\u2019t know what the gifts will be yet, but they will be good. And you will also receive gifts on your birthdays. And, you can bring the receipt back for drawings the day after tomorrow when we have our grand opening. There will be some grand prizes.\u201d Shu Yan listed out all the benefits and both girls\u2019 eyes beamed.\u201cI will for sure be back the day after tomorrow.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
