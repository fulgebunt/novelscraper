It was perfect for becoming a Pushover Free Pass.Of course, our Pushover Free Pass, no, our main character is also human, so he gradually deteriorate as he goes through all kinds of hardships in every episode.His tendency for good, which was firm from the beginning, leans toward neutral due to the loss and betrayal of trusted colleagues, respected superiors, people saved by the protagonist, and family members who he met again.Then, after being stabbed in the back three times in a row by the Female Lead, who he loved and trusted more than anyone else, he began to be stained with evil.I'm reading episode 77 right now, and it's a bomb of frustration after another.'If anyone asks me which episode is the least frustrating, I'd like to pick episode 17 without doubt.And that's because.\"As soon as the main character returns, he was killed by the final boss that passed by!\"Episode 18 started right after the main character died without even feeding the reader angst.

Please choose a high round!'The message has been updated.[ After the tutorial, the original run will begin at episode 17.]Is this the crime of recklessly saying that the 17th episode was less vexing? Or is it the price of deception, seeing that I called for God's help being an atheist myself?It's a round in which the main character dies like an insect, from the very beginning, to the final boss who is the strongest in the world!Of all things why this one?!There are only a few episodes in which the final boss appears in front of the protagonist, but I can't believe it has to be the 17th episode!I grabbed my head and screamed in despair.\"Awwww!!\"Originally, the sound of argh was supposed to come out with desperation, but I had a soft pitch and a cute sound came out.Our Pushover Free Pass becomes usable only after the 70th round, so at the 17th round, he was like a little kid.There was no way I could use him against the last boss, who is described as a new level of transcendental.But I soon realized something.'Let's assume there is no protagonist.

It was Count Gillette who scouted such a person and hired him cheaply while cunningly using the fact that he was a single dad with two children to feed.Dad... well, it's still embarrassing to call him that. The alchemist was unaware how things really worked in the world and because of that he continued to renew his slave like contract and dedicate himself to the Count.The accompanying family members, Frintz and Ellet, naturally grew up as servants of the Count.idiot Young Master, and Ellet became a maid for chores.In the original, only the Alchemist and Frintz appeared briefly in minor roles.Returning to the County after training as a knight, the Young Master neglected the protagonist, who was his lifesaver.At this time, it was Frintz who took care of the main character's necessities such as bedding and food, and it was the alchemist who took care of the potions giving to him on the morning of the main character's departure, while saying he was sorry.The part that caught my attention was the scene where Frintz and the main character appeared.It was the youngest daughter room that Frintz guided the protagonist while saying that it was the cleanest room.The main character, who found Ellet's items there, was bewildered by the question of whether it was a woman's room, and Frintz laughed and explained to relieve the faithful paladin.-It's my sister's keepsake. She mistakenly went into the dungeon that was sealed deep in the Count's Castle and...Sigh. That was the future of Ellet Lo Dellaine.This damned house was build a top a very bad place.It was not enough to have a dungeon outbreak to happen right near the manor, the Count's residence was even build atop one itself.After thinking deeply, I looked at the Frintz again.Even if he was an older brother, he was a boy who looked only about twelve years old.I was a little choked up when I thought that there would be no day that his hands and calves would be left untouched because of the dumb Young Master.Frintz, who came after washing his hands thoroughly, kicked me out of the seat and started spinning the butter churn.I was very concerned about Frinz's hand.\"How about applying the ointment first? Go to Dad.\"He freaked out and panicked.\"No! Then dad will be worried.\"\"Dad doesn't know?\"\"Yes. If he knows, he won't let me do it. Me, I don't care if I'm beaten. Even like this, I want to take the class...\"\"Still.......\"\"But Let, why are you suddenly pretending not to know? You promised to keep a secret from dad if I let you eat all my pudding...\"Seems like there was already something in my stomach, so I can't say anything about it.He said again with a bright face.\"Oh, Dad has an urgent business and went out. He said there's a problem with the herbs he's dealing with the Count's merchant guild.\"\"Then let's go to the lab together later and find some medicine. I'll apply it for you, brother.\"I said that because I felt sorry for his red hands and was grateful for his help. At the end of the day, I called him brother, it seemed something natural to do for the body who ljust transmigrated into.It seems that my memories from my brother in my previous life stopped around the same age as Frintz. But suddenly, his eyes became moist.\"Let.......\"\"Wh-what?\"\"Kitchen work was really hard. It's the first time you've called me brother... since you were four yearsold.\"\"Huh?\"\"In the past, you said you didn't want to be with me or talk to me because I was stupid and tactless...\"Apparently, the personality of this body was not good. My heart swelled up a bit. I hesitated a little and then opened my mouth.\"Oh, well, that's right. I think I grew up after having a hard time in the kitchen today. I'll call you well from now on. Forget about the past.\"Now that I'm Ellet Lo Dellaine, I will take responsibly over this body's kind older brother.\"Really? There is no turning back!\"\"Yes, yes, brother.\"\"Wow, it really feels like I have a real little sister now. Oh, no, that doesn't mean I used to feel you were a fake sister! I just like it very much.\"'If you think so, I'm grateful.to do is wash the wooden barrel of the churn.\"Come on, let's finish work and have a snack.\" (maid)I liked the kitchen because it had this kind of caring mood.\"Brother, let's clean up quickly and eat snacks.\"\"M-me too?\"\"Of course, you helped. If they don't give you some, I'll give you my share.\"\"Let.......\"Is it that touching?When I was embarrassed for no reason because of the sudden growth of sibling love, another person came to the kitchen.\"I guess kitchen work is doable\".I turned my head to follow the twisted tone. A brunette girl was standing in the same pose as the head maid.\"Nelly.\"Nelly glanced at me from top to bottom. As soon as she found something to nitpick about, her small lips rose sarcastically.\"Oh, are you in charge of washing the dishes? Poor you. I am preparing tea and snacks for the madam.\"\"Okay, good job.\"\"If I do the dishes like that, my hands will soon crack. It's too bad.\"Her complaining tone was a bit rude.It was around the time I finished all my work while ignoring Nelly, who was babbling non-stop.[ You have completed the 'Make Butter and Clean Up' mission.

There were words in the message that caught my eye.\"Hmm, making tea?'My eyes shone with slyness.Meanwhile, Nelly continued to chatter.\"Well, if you don't have talent, your body has no choice but to suffer, isn't it? These chores are perfect for you ignorant siblings.\"\"Hey, are you listening to me? Why are you looking at the air like a fool... Argh!\"Whoa! As I jumped up because of the new skill I had, I hit Nelly's chin with my head.\"Hey! What are you doing!\"\"Woo, I'm sick too.\"\"Funny! How can a blockhead like you fell pain!?\"Nelly screamed as Frintz touched the bump in my head with concern.The commotion drew attention.\"Nelly, don't be frivolous. How can a child who will serve the madam not be calm and collected?\"\"Mrs. Isela......\"The stern middle-aged maid who was measuring tealeaves, rebuked Nelly solemnly. It seemed that she was in charge of the Countess refreshments.I thought it was a great opportunity and I smiled at Nelly.\"Wh-what? Why are you laughing so much?\"After all, animals are good at detecting danger. I asked a question to Nelly, who had shrunk a lot.\"You said your dream was to be a maid serving tea, right?\"\"Huh?\"\"Watch from there.\"I strode away from Nelly, who had a stupid expression on her face. For her, it might have looked like empty bravado since I was a little kid.\"Ellet Lo Dellaine?\"The chef, who was giving orders among the maids, turned to me. Feeling everyone's attention, resolutely opened my mouth.\"Chief, can I make tea for snack time?\"\"You can make it?\"\"Yes. I want to make tea for those who have worked hard with me.\"The Maid sisters caught on what I was trying to do.\"Oh my, Ellet is brewing the tea?\"\"Shall we taste the tea made by her?\"\"Yes! I will make delicious tea for you, sisters. Please leave it to me.\"The chef gave permission with a nonchalant face.I measured the black tea leaves for use while boiling water in a large kettle. While stepping on a wooden stool and wriggling my hands on the shelf, I felt a prickly gaze on one cheek.Nelly must have been glaring at her.As I turned my head to look at her, I was surprised, because Maid Isela was also looking at me.Finally, the maple black tea was completed. I whined victoriously and poured everyone a cup of tea.\"Oh my, it smells so good.\"\"Is this the tea we usually drink?\"\"I can not believe it. The tea leaves didn't change,right?\"At a glance, the chef was also savoring the scent of tea with a kind smile. Of course, no one could see it because she quickly returned to her hard face. Then Isela went all the way to the chef. The two woman of the same age had a vague conversation.\"Hey, Peisha. I want to taste some tea too.\"\"This is ours.\"\"I just want to taste it, okay?\"\"Get permission from Ellet.\"Isela turned to me.Recognizing the need of social experience and connections in life through my previous one, immediately filled the tea and offered it to her.Slurp, Isela took a sip of tea in an elegant position that would serve as an example for others, and after a while, she glanced at me and roared.\"You!\"\".......Yes?\"\"You did something stupid!\"'D-Did I do something wrong?I was a little terrified of Isela's changed attitude. Unknowingly my shoulders crouched and someone blocked my front'It was the Chef Peisha.\"Isela! Why are you talking like that to her? Did you drink tea well? If that's the case, get out of my kitchen!\"\"I'm absolutely out of my mind, Peisha. I have to say that she's stupid because her hands are getting damaged in the kitchen!\"Oh, was it a positive expression?I was relieved, but the people around me were surprised. In particular, Nelly's reaction was worth seeing.Nelly, who was looking forward to how Isela would scold me earlier, was so dumbfounded she was opening her mouth as if her jaw would fall out.\"I'm also learning to serve tea!\"\"Nelly, you have no talent!\"Nelly, who was unintentionally sentenced to death for her talent, trembled. But Isela and Peisha were not interested in her.They held my left and right arms one by one from each side and continued the conversation.\"You said Ellet Lo Dellaine, right? Come to my place at this hour from tomorrow on. I'll teach you how to serve tea.\"\"No. Ellet is going to learn to cook in the kitchen. This child is born with the talent to become a great chef. I'm going to raise her to be big!\"\"Then, let her do both!\"My future has been decided,\"Good luck in the future, Nelly.\"\"Ugh!!\"I smiled brightly at Nelly in front of me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter a rewarding day in the kitchen, I went with Frintz to the Alchemist's lab.The Alchemist had yet to return, perhaps because the problem with the herbs at the Guild have not been solved.In the Serentra Continent, healers were rare.Since the level of difficulty for awakening Holy Powers was higher than that of Aurors and Magic, the number of people with that skill was small, and since the denomination monopolizes human resources, private employment was impossible.If there was a dungeon subjugation team belonging to a family, the church will send a healer, but this is not applicable to the Gillette family, which has long since stopped subjugating due to the lack of swordsmanship skills.No matter how wealthy Count Gillette was, he had to go to the cathedral in person to receive treatment from a Healer.However, when a noble is injured or sick, they cannot endure the waiting line to receive treatment.Fortunately, it was somewhat sub-quality to a healer's healing technique, but there was something that could work as a substitute. They were healing potions made by alchemists.Wealthy noble families used to hire alchemists along with doctors.Leonard Lo Dellaine was such a case.He was a fairly skilled alchemistIt was certain information, giving that around the 10th round of regression, the protagonist came back to life from almost dying after consuming one potion he had made.\"It looks like ointment for wound has run out.\"Frintz looked through the shelves instead of me, who did not know what the ointment looked like.I thought it was strange because it seemed like something that could be made by bulks, and that question was soon answered by Frintz.\"The maids often steals. What was the reason for that?..... Skin... moisturizing? I think?\"\"What? Didn't you tell the butler?\"\"They are all together. The butler, the head maid, the doctor...\"It's a difficult situation.Will I have no choice but to ask for a favor after the Alchemist returns?However, Frintz noticed that and the tail of his eyes drooped, so I was concerned.\"Are you in a lot of pain?\"\"Oh, no. just......\"\"Just?\"\"It's being a while since you said you would treat me.\"Ugh. If that's the reason why you're sad, then there's nothing I can do about it.I looked around the lab. It seemed that all the materials and tools were present.[ Purchased the 'Job Change Package (Non Combat)'.][ Select \"The Great Alchemist of Softness\" to awaken Alchemy Lv.1. From now on, you can use \"Alchemy Material insight,\" \"Softening Cosmetics that makes skin moist and smooth\" and \"Soft, fragrant natural soap with softening abilities.\"]\"Yep. I have to level up.\"\"Huh? What?\"\"It's nothing, brother.\"The only items unlocked at level 1 were cosmetics and soap. I guess I will be able to make an ointment or a potion only at level 2.\"But this is actually quite good.'There seemed to be an abundance of ingredients, and cosmetics and soaps were often used.I pretended to roll up both sleeves.\"Let's get started.\"\"Baby? Frintz?\"Leonard, who had managed to finish his work and returned to the lab, was surprised.Ellet and Frinz were asleep, sharing a blanket, and the lab was a mess, unlike when he left. But the desk was different. Dozens of glass jars with jelly-like contents were neatly arranged.Leonard looked carefully at the pretty ribbons tied up to the glasses. Letters written on the tail of the ribbon caught his eyes.'Water soap that foams well', 'moisturizing cream', 'whitening cream', 'moisturizing lip balm'.He was startled.\"Did you do alchemy?\"There were also small paper notes.\"Beauty creams as gift! I never even thought of this!\"Leonard was rather naive compared to his skills.As a scholar who reads only books, he only focuses on research of standard potions. He didn't even know that research on beauty items was in the spotlight in the alchemy industry because of its commercial value.He had no way of knowing how to win the favor of his employer, the Countess.It was only natural that Ellet, who had been exposed to all kinds of cosmetic advertisements in her previous life and had a social life in which she needed them, knew better about that.\"I think my daughter is a genius...! Hm-mm! No, shouldn't make the mistake many dads make. Let's be calm. Trials and attempts are great, but the quality may not be as good as because it was made by a child...'Leonard tried to test the quality by reining in the selfabsorbed child bragging that was trying to run wild. He opened the glass bottle of moisturizing cream with a pounding heart, and then he tried to apply it to the skin.\"Unbelievable!\"The effect was huge.Even he, who was not acquainted with beauty, could clearly see that his skin had regained elasticity and had a watery luster.'My daughter is a genius!He made up his mind and decided to let the bragging run free to his heart's content.Now that I look at it, the desk had not only beauty creams but also ointment.She was already creating items with healing proprieties, so he had no doubts any more.\"My child is going to be a great alchemist. I have to start teaching her alchemy in earnest from tomorrow.'Leonard held Ellet, who was sleeping soundly, in his arms to carried her to the bed. His face was full of laughter as he looked at his daughter.It was a dad's proud smile.I had a gloomy dream.It was when I was ten years old before I took possession. At that time, I was already separated from my family forever.It was right after I lost my father and brother in a car accident, so I was depressed as if a dark cloud hovered only above my head, never leaving.But before I could understand my feelings, I had to learn to look at others first.It was the house of my father's older sister that decided to take care of me, who almost went to a childcare facility.As soon as they decided to raise me, they got a lease on a three-room apartment and moved there.It was a much larger and better house than the previous one-room studio where they lived.However, my Uncle and Aunt, who often fought with each other, decided to share a room, and my cousin sister who was two years younger said that she must have her own space and refused to share her room with me.So I had to spend most of my life in the living room.I didn't really have any complaints.Rather, I was just sorry and thankful.Because, despite my poor circumstances, they did not send me to a childcare facility and accepted me as a family member.Of course, it was an idea of the innocent days.At that time, I didn't know that the apartment's deposit was the money that was raised from the sale of the house where I lived with my father and brother.Because I didn't know, I tried to do well in my Aunt's house. Since my mother hasn't been there since I was little, my older brother did a lot of housework while my father went to work.Recalling what my brother did, I started to find and do housework little by little.When I did the dishes, laundry, and cleaning by myself even if I didn't have to, my Aunt, a former housewife, seemed happy. Without a mother figure, I was weak for compliments from a female adult, so I tried to work harder, and house chores naturally became my duty.Then one weekend when I woke up around noon, no one was home.I washed the dishes accumulated the previous day and cleaned the house, waiting with the intention of eating together when Aunt's family returned.I was worried because they didn't come home until the afternoon, but I didn't think of calling them.I didn't have a phone at home and I didn't have a cell phone.They returned only after the sun went down.I rushed out with joy when I heard the sound of the front door opening with laugher.The first thing I saw was my cousin, wearing a rocking headband, with star-studded springs.When I stuttered a greeting and asked if they had eaten, the family members said they had no intention of eating with a disheartened face, and then went into their respective rooms.It seemed so. Because the smell of pork belly wafted from the bodies of the family members who came home long after dinnertime.Weekends with no one around when I woke up became a daily routine.At some point, I started eating alone without waiting. understood we were not of the same family. However, there was one question. Was it okay to eat out every week when the situation was not good?I later found out that what went into their stomachs was my father and brother's car accident insurance and settlement money.It was in the second year of high school that I learned that they had stolen all of my father's property, insurance money, and settlement money and spent it until the last penny.However, it was only a few days after I first asked to be sent to one academy_that I heard a complaint.I was even more embarrassed and sad when I compared myself to the five academies that my cousin was attending but did not want to go.Since I didn't have a room, I went to the playground next door and cried.When the truth they were hiding was revealed, they criticized me for being ungrateful, saying that I was only calculating money despite their grace of raising me.In the beginning, I was desperate. However, because they were not people one could communicate with, decided to live with the mindset of holding on until became an adult.It would have been very comfortable for me not to rebel from the standpoint of my Aunt's house.I didn't even go through puberty. I couldn't go through it. Foolishness is something that can only be done when there is someone who accepts it.After living in that house for another year and a half, I thought I was getting along just fine. But that was just an illusion. I must have grunted often at night as if I was frozen by sleep paralysis.There were many times when my cousin, who just woke up, came out to the living room and threw a pillow shouting if I was mentally ill. But it wasn't something that could be actively corrected.Even until now.\"Mom... Dad... Don't leave me alone......\"\"......Baby?\"\"Don't go too... Brother... I won't steal your sweets anymore... I'll give you half my chocolate milk too. Bro....brother...\"Then my hands were covered with warmth. It was my first time feeling this, so I think I was a bit puzzled even though I was moaning in my sleep.A caring and soft voice like a lullaby was heard.\"Shhhh, baby. You must have had a nightmare. It's okay. Dad is here.\"\"Dad......?\" \"Yes, Dad.\"\"Are you really my dad? Weird. My dad...\"The rest of the words got stuck in my neck and didn't come out.Fortunately, 'Dad' said.\"It's really dad. I'll stay here until my baby sleeps again.\"\"It's a promise...promise.\"\"Yes, I promise.\"It felt like the warmth I had received through his hands was transferred to my chest.I fell asleep again with a sense of relief that I felt for the first time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I couldn't waste time like this and since I couldn't sleep, I decided to read the Novel.So, my impressions came out at dawn, after reading the novel until the end...'Even after reading it again, the ending is crazy.'Excuse me, writer. Is there a need for a character's life to be this long? Really?I sincerely wanted to argue with the writer, but unfortunately, there was no way. Above all else, after reading the original, I had to decide on the career path I had put off.'After all, a healer is the answer.'As explained before, in this world setting, healers who have awakened the divine power are on the rare side, and they have fast and high healing power.Combat healers with different heal speeds were even more rare.At the very least, the good-hearted main lead had various scenes where he often lamented and wished he had a healer around.I couldn't eat sweet potatoes made of frustration like the main character. If you want to feel refreshed with good results you have to do so yourself!I decided that my dream from now on was to be a 'Healer'.I used the 'Job Change Package (Combat)' that I purchased in advance yesterday.[<System> A conditional quest 'Legendary Saint's Soul' to awaken the divine power is required.]What? Is there a quest? As expected, it doesn't seem to be easy.[<Quest> A Thousand Days of Prayer. Between 5 and 7 am, pray to God with sincerity and devotion in places such as cathedrals, churches, and temples every day (0/1,000)][Note: It is limited to once a day, and if you skip 3 days in a row, start over from the beginning.]'Ugh!'It was a quest that took nearly three years even if I didn't miss a single day.Blessings for high-speed growth did not help because the quest had a condition based on number of times. I had no choice but to do it the honest way.Fine.Fortunately, there is a chapel in Count Gillette's manor.Well, it happens to be six o'clock now. I thought I could go to the chapel, pray for today, and go to work in the kitchen.I followed the path indicated by the map. The chapel was located in the corner of the first floor of the manor's main building.The former countess, that is, the Elder Madam, had a deep religious faith, so the main building was renovated for her, but after a generational change, it was left behind to be neglected.\"Woo, dust.\"It looked like a place that was almost abandoned, and it didn't seem like it was cleaned properly. Since it is a space that I'll continue to use in the future, I decided to clean it for my precious respiratory system.I hurriedly opened the window and pulled out cleaning tools from the next room.Being a child, the chapel was so large that it felt like the work would have to be split over several days. Roughly having cleaned one side, I put my hands together in prayer.\"......\"Hmm... What do you usually pray for?Among the quest contents, I stared at the part of 'Pray with sincerity and devotion' for a long time.In the first place, I was an atheist.I didn't even believe in the gods of reality, but when asked to believe in the gods inside a novel, I had no way of doing it. So, before considering sincerity and devotion, let's start with the fundamental belief in the existence of God...'No, wait. After experiencing the afterlife, it's not like it's impossible. There are gods that I know.'And a lot of them, too. I immediately called the gods.\"Gods of the Transmigration Bureau! Please, give me some divine power!\"Tiling![<System> 'Morning Prayer' in progress.

I was an ordinary, humble-citizen who was living well...Oh, I didn't live well.\"Naturally, memories from my previous life came to mind.\"I still get upset when I think of the money my relatives took from me. From selling my house to usurping my dad's and my brother's car accident insurance settlement money. You think that's all? Even after I finally became independent, those damned relatives came to haunt me. After spending all that stolen money, they call me every week to ask if I have money, and if I don't answer the phone, they come to my former semi-basement studio.\"[<System> 'Morning Prayer' in progress. Current progress 20%.]Despite the growing complaints, the progress rate was steadily rising.Let's keep going.\"You know what happened after that? My uncle called from an unknown number, so I picked it up. Hearing his voice, I called him 'Uncle'...\"Gods of Transmigration, prepare to eat sweet potatoes of frustration.\"Do you know what he said? He shamelessly asked me to call him 'Daddy'! There's not even a speck of affection between us to at the very least call him 'Father', much less a cute name like 'Daddy'! Ha ha, I was speechless. When I asked about his business, guess what he said? His daughter was taking a leave of absence from school and preparing for her transfer exam, but since she has to go to the academy that is in the same direction of my house, he wants me to let her live with me. Since she's my only 'sister' I have to take good care of her as an 'older sister', what should I do at that point?\"It's not over.\"What else did he say? Oh, right. He was worried that his child would starve because she was studying so hard, so he told me to make sure she eats breakfast before I go to work. Even worse, he said 'You know that she can't eat food without soup, right? Don't spare the beef in the soup, put in a lot to boil well'. After that, all I could feel was anger, so I bought 1kg of Australian beef sirloin that day and grilled it all by myself. It was very tasty.\"[<System> 'Morning Prayer' in progress. Current progress 65%.]I sucked back the saliva that almost spilled on the thought of chewing beef.All of a sudden, the posture of putting my hands together was disturbed, and I was resting my chin on the armrest of the worship chair.\"Probably, if I was alive for a little longer, my cousin would have just packed up her shit and stormed into my studio. Oh, that's terrible just to think about. I might be glad that I died before seeing that.\"I gradually tried to find a positive side of the story to close the prayer.\"Honestly, I have no regrets about my past life. Is that why the test with the transmigration aptitude test came out high? Well, in any case... It turns out that the transmigration support system is really well done. Hopefully, with the life insurance package, I will be able to live well in this world.\"At this point, I blushed slightly.\"...More than anything else, I like having a family. The Alchemist and Frintz from this world really resemble my dad and brother.\"I know that no one is listening, but I got shy for nothing. I wiggled my feet on the high worship chair. After a while, I checked the morning prayer progress and found that it was 80%. Looks like we still need to do more.\"But there is one problem!\"I opened my eyes wide.\"Since I'm dead, the deposit for my studio room is going to go to my Uncle!! Oh, I'm really mad!\"Until the very end, I only gave good things for the family. Why is someone's life a resource for someone else's exploitation?

No, could you let me complete the Thousand Days Prayer quest as part of your responsibilities?\"['The world-building God' says that quest has not been approved yet, and even if it is updated in the future, it says that it will cost an astronomical amount of cash.]The negative answers were expected, but the other parts stuck in my ears.Apparently, this transmigration support system is also being updated periodically.['The world-building God' adds to say that originally, the divine power giving in Thousand Days Prayer quest was something which was only barely attainable by praying with utmost sincerity for half a day for nearly 10 years.]Well, God's attitude is tough.

In any case, it was a good choice not to fight with God.With a foreboding that there will be more gifts to come in the future, I clasped my hands and shouted.\"Amen, God!\"As soon as I left the chapel, I went to work in the kitchen.According to the instructions of Chef Peisha, the cooking proficiency increased sharply while preparing breakfast for the picky count's family.During the time between preparing breakfast and preparing lunch, I took a tea ceremony class with Nelly.Since my tea-making skills belong to a sub-category of cooking, it was good to see that my skills were already perfect.So, Ms. Isela said that she would mainly teach me maid's manners and the manners of nobles rather than preparing tea.As part of that training, I practiced sipping tea gracefully while sitting in a chair. It would have been boring if I had done only that, but an interesting spectacle was unfolding in front of me.\"Nelly, this is already the eighth time you made a mistake in weighing your tea leaves. Just in case, can you read the numbers on the scales? Should I teach numbers first?\"\"N-No.\"\"Then why can't you match it? Ellet is younger than you are and is doing well. Just taking care of your hands does not mean that you can become a maid specializing in tea. This is a servant role too close to the nobles, so if you are not meticulous and smart, you cannot do this. If you keep this up, give up right now.\"\"......I'm sorry.\"Nelly's eyes widened as Isela poured out her savagery in a sullen tone. However, I felt no sympathy. The little girl's face, who glanced at me without the maid knowing, was overflowing with poison.When I saw her, it was close to an expression of 'I'm going to tell my mom!'Well, what to do, I'm not scared at all.After class, it was a repetition of kitchen chores to prepare lunch. After cleaning up, I stayed in the kitchen even after the servants went to rest. It was to make a \"sweet fruit dish\" with the remaining ingredients under Chef Peisha's permission.'If I make this, I will definitely level up.'The food to be made was apple soup.After thinly slicing the red apple, boil it in white wine and salted water and drizzle with olive oil to complete the soup with a red color and apple flavor.It was a simple dish, so it was completed in no time. Translucent red soup was served on a white plate.It was time to find Chef Peisha for test tasting, as this was a hierarchy where it had to start with the seniors first.The figure of the Alchemist was seen beyond the kitchen threshold.The Alchemist... No, he can't be called an Alchemist forever.It seems that my Dad came to see me, but Chef Peisha and Maid Isela caught him.The conversation was in full swing. When I approached all three of them with the intention of offering a tasting at once, I spontaneously listened to their conversation.To my surprise, the subject was my future.\"You came just in time, Mr. Rodellaine. Thank you for the good soap. I have something to discuss with you about the Ellet. She has a talent for cooking, so I want to raise her to be a big shot in the future.\"\"What? But my child is an alchemist prodigy! Speaking of which, the soap was actually made by my daughter. Isn't it amazing? So I thought I'd teach her well...\"\"What are you talking about, you two! In order to find a good marriage, she has to serve the nobles closely while serving tea. Leave Ellet to me, as I will somehow push her into a Duchy later.\"Well, a Tea Maid recommended to a Duke.... If the genre was Ropan, it would have been that route, but it was really disappointing.'By the way, even Dad?'As I listened more, it seems that the reason my Dad came here was to persuade me to learn alchemy.Of course, it was a welcome thing. Since it was a long tutorial period, it was necessary to actively learn anything that could be learned.Gradually, the conversation between the three of them was over, so I thought I could intervene.\"Chef Peisha, Ms. Isela, Dad. This is a dish I made, have a taste.\"\"Hmm? Soup made from apples.\"\"Yes, Chef Peisha.\"The three of them took spoons and savored each bite.Although I'm using the system, I was good at other household chores all my life, and cooking was my turf.After savoring the soup for a long time, Chef Peisha swallowed a gulp and looked back at Dad in battle mode.\"Did you see, Mr. Rodellaine! Ellet has a talent for cooking!\"\"Yes, but my child is an alchemy......\"\"Wrong, you two. Ellet made a dessert to accompany the tea. She destined to work on a Duchy.\"A heartwarming message appeared while the three of them were chatting.[<System> Congratulations! Achieve the skill required to level up and awaken the cooking Lv.3. From now on, you will be able to use the following abilities: 'Discover Food', 'Bake all kinds of meat without burning', 'Bread that makes you happy when you eat', 'Make all kinds of fresh salads', and 'Boil nutritious stews and soups'.]When I reached level 3, I felt like I could make food in earnest.It wasn't just that. My apple soup, which received favorable reviews, was decided as a dessert for the Countess that day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCountess Gillette, Sandra Gillette, was famous for being a difficult boss among the servants.Sandra was originally a commoner, but she got into the eyes of the Count, and her status was elevated, but in terms of taste and personality, she was as demanding as if she had been a lady of a great aristocratic family from birth.Her personality was nervous and capricious, she hides a lot of things, and it was not easy for users to please her because she always looked for the highest quality that could meet her standards.All of the Gillette family members were like that.A narrow-minded Count who can't stand the mistakes of his subordinates, the Countess who is obsessed with high class and luxury, the Young Master, who is an ignorant man, and the Count's daughter, who is hard to classify, but is a target of avoidance by employees...In fact, County Gillette wasn't exactly a good place to work.But today, the demanding and capricious Countess was in a very good mood. She patted her cheek with the back of her hand and smiled sweetly.'My skin looks good today.'In the morning, she applied the beauty potion that the alchemist gave her, and her skin was glowing, she felt like she rejuvenated full 5 years.Until now, I only thought that he was an incompetent man because no matter how much I poured the health potion he made into my son's stomach, it had no effect on his swordsmanship. But looking again, it seems like it was not a lie that he was from the Golden Ivory Tower.'You could have made this earlier. What have you been doing so far? Humph.'It was then that the Countess felt a little resentful.\"Mother, should I bring you a hand mirror? You've been paying attention to your face for a while, so you're not paying attention to what I'm saying.\"\"Ugh! Oh no, Bia! Mother was all ears!\"Even the haughty Countess had a hard time with someone.It was her ten-year-old daughter, Bianca Gillette.The young girl, with bluish-black hair, was sitting in front of the Countess, in a dignified position not fit for her age.\"Hm-mm! Where were we, my daughter?\"\"We were discussing the survival of the Gillette family.\"\"Huh?\"\"I think it should be accepted that the generations of swords masters in our family were cut off on grandfather's generation. In this state, entrusting the next head of the household to my incompetent and foolish brother would be a shortcut to ruin. What does mother think?\"\"......\"The Countess was silent for a moment.Is this really what should be coming out of the mouth of a ten-year-old child?'She's my daughter, but she's lovely and scary!'Bianca was completely different in constitution from the Count and Countess. Neither one of them could make such a cold and rational judgment in this way, they did not know how such a daughter was born.The Countess, who had been absent-minded, came to her senses before Bianca's severe rebuke returned.With an awkward laugh, she persuaded her daughter.\"Isn't your brother still twelve years old? Let's wait a little longer.\"\"Hm.\"Frightened by her daughter's blatant dissatisfaction with her answer, the Countess decided to change the subject.\"He, more than that, Bia, I heard you kicked out your playmate again this morning? How many times has it already been... If there's a problem, won't you tell mom?\"\"The problem would be that I don't have a child who is at my level.\"\"Re-Really? Mom is going to pick with more care for the next one.\"\"Well, I think you'd better get me a book than a friend right now. I've read almost all the books in the library.\"\"Al-all those?\"\"Honestly, there aren't many books in our family library.\"\"Ah, I got it. I'll tell the butler.\"Just then, Isela, the tea attendant, came in with a knock.\"Madam, miss, I brought you a snack.\"The refreshments prepared today were sweet fruit tea, white lemon sugar balls, tangy orange jelly, and delicious red apple soup.\"Oh, there's a unique dessert today.\"\"Seems interesting, Mother.\"Mother and daughter picked up the apple soup first as if they had promised. As soon as they took a mouthful, mother and daughter's eyes widened.\"Oh my, a soup with such a noble flavor. It's just my taste.\"Isela, who had been smiling from the beginning of the conversion, sneaked a comment.\"This is a dessert made by Rodellaine's daughter. She's good at making refreshments. I will teach her well.\"\"The Alchemist's daughter? Anyway, I was in a good mood today because the alchemist made me a whitening potion and a moisturizing lotion, but even the daughter did a wonderful job. Tell her to go to the kitchen and get a bunch of snacks.\"\"Yes, madam.\"Bianca, who was always indifferent, pricked her ears and asked.\"A beauty potion?\"\"Yes. Until now, I only thought of potions as medicine, but things like lotion can also be made.\"The functional effect of the cosmetics was very good. Although the price would be expensive, the only thing left to Count Gillette was money.Bianca fell deep in her thoughts for a moment.'Isn't Leonard Rodellaine a knowledgeable alchemist who could only conduct standard research? He suddenly had the idea of \u200b\u200bmaking potions for beauty?'He even differentiates between whitening and moisturizing. No matter how much I thought about it, it could not have been the idea of \u200bthat Alchemist. So who was it?At the same time, Isela gave a clue that would solve Bianca's question.\"Mr. Rodellaine distributed high-quality soap to the residents of the mansion. He bragged a lot that it was made by his daughter.\"\"Isela.\"\"Yes, lady.\"Bianca's red eyes gleamed.\"Where is the Alchemist's daughter now?\"\"Hey, Frintz little sister.\"As I was picking tomatoes from the greenhouse, I heard a taunting voice. I turned around to see a boy about Frintz's age looking at me with his arms crossed.With bluish-black hair, luxurious attire, and a grumpy face, I could easily guess his identity.'The count's crazy fool!'I greeted him politely, hiding my feelings of having stepped on poop.\"Hehe. Hello, Young Master Romdio.\"\"Enough with the greetings give me that tomato basket.\"\"Oh!\"The rascal hands stole the basket from me. Soon after, an opportunity to confirm his lunatic personality unfolded before my eyes.\"Giggle! Eat this!\"The crazy fool started throwing tomatoes at the servants who were passing by.Puck! Puck! Punk!Tomatoes burst out with a fresh sound. The apprentice servants who were assaulted while carrying goat's milk screamed.\"Ihihi! Bull's eyes!...... Uh, what is it? I've already run out of tomatoes. Damn it. You, what are you doing not picking more?! Go get more tomatoes.\"\"......\"\"Hey, hurry up and get it!\"In my mind, I wanted to mash the tomatoes on his face, but...\"Yes, Young Master!\"I was nothing more than a helpless little apprentice maid who became an accomplice to the all-powerful crazy fool.I hurried into the greenhouse and picked a full apron of tomatoes. I gave them, one by one according to the throwing speed of the crazy fool. His hand and forearm were getting stronger, and his throwing power and accuracy were increasing.The excited jerk looked back at me.\"Hey, that's really fun! Why don't you try throwing it.....\"It was then.Squishy!\".......Uh?\"It was the sound of a crushing tomato in the crazy fool's grasp.\"Oh my, what should I do?\"As I fussily covered my mouth with my hand, the rotten, faded tomato mucus dripped down from the hands of the fool.And in-between, flimsy bugs were revealed. The face of the crazy fool was frozen in thought.\"Ugh, ahhh! what's this! W-worm! It's a bug! Aww!\"Heh, who told you to play with food?It was quite nice to see him running around, but it seemed like I had to slowly clean the scene.\"Oh my, Young Master! I'm really sorry! I made a mistake because I was picking tomatoes in a hurry! For now, please calm down.\"\"How can I calm down? You can do that?! Aghh!\"\"If you scream while swinging your hands like that, you might get maggots in your mouth!\"\"Huck!\"The fool became quiet.In the meantime, I took off my apron and wiped his hands. Perhaps he really hated seeing the worms, so he closed his eyes tightly and surrendered his hand, it was quite the ridiculous sight.\"Okay, it's done, Young Master. Then shall we play tomato toss again?\"\"Oh no!\"\"Yes, too bad.\"Traumatized by the rotten tomato, the bastard roared away. Just before he turned around, the corners of his eyes seemed to be slightly moist, so it's mostly certain a childhood trauma core memory.['The world-building God' clicks its tongue and says that he is just like the villain who made readers eat sweet potatoes for a long time in the original work, he wasn't any different be it as an adult or a child.]I was a little surprised.\"Uh, were you watching, God?\"['The world-building God' shrugs and says that you are its first believer and will look into your affairs whenever time permits.]It wasn't even just the 'The world-building God'.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' comes to the director for approval and finds you.]['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' silently observes your actions.]Isn't this the literal version of the preach, 'God is always with you.' ? It felt like I was one step closer to being a religious person.I went into the greenhouse.The empty basket had to be refilled to complete the kitchen errand, but I felt a shadow cast over me as I squatted.What I saw when I looked up was another unwelcomed person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you come all the way here to quarrel with me?\"\"I asked first! What did you talk about with the Young Master! What did you say something, so that the master pretended he didn't see me and just passed by?!\"I don't know why this idiot is obsessed with that jerk, but my answer has been decided.\"I won't tell you.\"\"Hey! You are really-!\"Nelly, distraught, raised one of her hands. I flinched for a slap, but she grabbed my collar.['The world-building God' cannot directly intervene in the crisis of its followers, so it can only glare with his fiery eyes.]In the meantime, Nelly snarled, pushing her face to the point of burden.\"Somehow, I knew from the moment you suddenly said that you were going to learn how to serve tea! Your purpose is also the Young Master, isn't it?\"\"What?\"\"Don't even dream! Being the ugly girl you are!\"\"......\"I guessed why she was making such an absurd remark.'Does this idiot like that asshole?'However, the materialistic and combative light in Nelly's eyes was too dark to be understood as words of pure liking.It was then.['The world-building God' relaxes its eyes and smiles with anticipation.]['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' made half-moon-shaped eyes and turned the chair over to see better.]Huh? All of a sudden?Perhaps the reaction of the gods, who were watching from an omniscient point of view, was somewhat interesting.Something was caught in my eyes, just as I was looking over Nelly's shoulder.'Oh, indeed.'It was understood why the two gods laughed.\"Hey, why aren't you answering? What are you laughing about?\"\"Oh, sorry, Nelly. So, what you want to say is, do you want me not to disturb you because your purpose is to seduce the Young Master?\"\"Yes! You are an idiot, but you finally understood something of what I said.\"At that moment, the feet of the two people approaching this way stopped. I pretended not to know and continued my conversation with Nelly.\"But Nelly, wouldn't that be a bit difficult? Young Master is a nobleman, and we are commoners.\"\"Hey, what does that matter! The current madam was also a commoner, so there's a way for me to become the next countess, right?\"A small sigh was heard from somewhere, but it was still a bit lacking. I scratched the muzzle of the wicked once again for the last time.\"Oh, does that make sense? Who said that? You?\"\"My mother did, why!\"Nelly's triumphant and roaring voice reverberated throughout the greenhouse garden.All right. This is enough.Seeing me smiling, Nelly flinched.\"What? Why are you laughing so sneakily?\"\"Look behind you.\"\"Hick! Ma-Ma-Madam! Yo-Yo-Young Lady!\"Behind her was the Countess, who was exuding violent energy like a demoness, and her expressionless daughter who came holding her hand.A bleak voice was heard.\"Ah, yes.... the Countess position seemed to be an easy place...? Because I was a commoner...?\"\"Ma-Ma-Madam, that's not what I meant...!\"\"Well, yes...children at that age can say very immature things... But... it was your mother who taught you that, right.......?\"\"Oh, that's...!\"Realizing that there was no way out, Nelly trembled in trance.The Countess shouted loud enough for a blood vein to jump from her neck.\"Both can pack up and get out of this County right now!\"Nelly flopped down on her seat in her raging roar.\"Ma-Madam...... huh, huh! Whuaaa!\"\"You are all grown up it's not even a cute cry! Butler!\"Eventually, she called the butler and pulled Nelly out. Judging by her stubborn attitude, it seemed unlikely that the Countess would overturn her order of expulsion.With this, the maid mother and daughter pair were neatly settled at once. I'm proud of myself.['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' sees you who easily defeated the rookie villain and admits that you deserve the S-class rank.]No, really. I don't want that rank, but I have to somehow survive in this world now, right?The Countess and her daughter had not yet left the greenhouse.It was a time when I was contemplating whether to hand over some consolation tomatoes to the Countess, who was still furious.The Countess's daughter... named Bianca Gillette, said with a look and voice that this was an indifference happening to her.\"Ignore them and consider it in a good light, mother.\"\"Huff, Bia. I don't know if this mother has something good to think about this.\"\"That maid has been a person who has had many problems with hiring irregularities and embezzlement. She got kicked out this time, so it's a good thing for our house.\"\"Oh, was the mother of the girl I just kicked out a maid?\"\"...I guess you didn't seem to know. She was a maid of honor, so it was hard to handle her at once, but I never knew we would have such a good excuse to organize it.\"Bianca glanced sideways at me as she finished speaking. I pretended not to know and hugged the tomato basket.\"Okay then, Madam, Miss. I will go back to the kitchen.\"\"Yes, go on.\"\"No, wait.\"The Countess and Bianca were at odds.\"Why are you like this, Bia?\"\"I have something to tell you about the treatment of that child, Ellet Rodellaine.\"Huh? I didn't do anything wrong, why?The Countess tilted her head to see if she was of the same opinion as me.Then Bianca came closer to me and smiled.I was momentarily startled by the look on her face, which had been completely indifferent until a moment ago. It was an unexpected look for the always cool-headed Young Lady of the Count.And a shocking remark echoed in my ear.\"I want this kid to be my playmate.\"The Count's Young Lady playmate. According to the stories that went from mouth to mouth of the workers, it was an extreme job.Bianca Gillette had a quiet disposition, neither being particularly picky, nor harming others.However, due to her indifferent expression and cold attitude, they were not able to understand her insides, and Bianca was known as a scary and difficult Miss to serve.In front of Bianca, the Count and his wife were often embarrassed, and even the foolish crazy young master was sneakily avoiding her.Up to now, several girls from noble acquaintances had been mobilized as Bianca's playmates, but after three days they all ran away crying. It is said that when Bianca sent them off, the playmate fled, horrified by her face, it was a reaction akin to seeing a ghost.No one knew what the hell was going on in the 10-year-old Young Lady's room.But I'm going to have to check it out myself.From the afternoon of the next day, instead of being exempted from kitchen work, I was given the task of being Bianca's playmate.'Wow, behind this lies the hidden power of the Count.'I took a deep breath in front of the beautifully embossed wooden arch door. For a second, it felt like entering a dungeon.I asked for permission and opened the door.\"Are you here, Miss Ellet?\"Bianca, who was reading a book alone, greeted me first. She had no expression and her voice was cold.\"Hello, miss.\"\"Yes.\"Having said hello, now it's time to start working. What will a 10-year-old noble girl in a medieval fantasy world do and play?I hesitated because I didn't know, but fortunately, Bianca spoke up first.\"You can read a book.\"She beckoned to the books piled up on the table, like asking me to pick something up.Can I just read a book?As I put on an anguished expression on my face, Bianca asked with a look of disappointment.\"Do you not know how to read?\"\"No. I know.\"With the help of the transmigrator's support system, I was able to speak the official language perfectly.Bianca was convinced that it would be because I had an intellectual as my father.I looked at the title of the book in earnest. The books covered various fields such as literature, history, society, politics, business, and theology.'Isn't the level too high for a 10-year-old to read?'Maybe this is the secret that drove all her playmates away?With suspicion, I glanced at the book Bianca was reading.Well...... Seeing that the title was 'Prospects of high value-added business using new dungeon materials', it didn't seem like she was trying to harass me.I chose literature. I was also a fan of web novels in my previous life, and the title ' That one time, I, the hero, seduced the Demon King' was a bit interesting.\"Go to the couch and read. You can just lay back and keep reading.\"\"Wow, thank you very much.\"Since I was not a nobleman anyway, I quickly accepted Bianca's consideration. I laid down on my stomach like I often did on my bed and opened a book.It was about thirty minutes after I started to turn the pages. I felt a problem.\"Hm. Well, I'm sorry to disturb you while you read, miss.\"\"Why?\"\"May I change the book?\"\"Yes.\"Contrary to her cold answer, I felt the gaze of careful observation clinging to my cheek. This time I picked up the top representative in theological books, the Bible.Bianca asked.\"Bible? Why did you choose it?\"\"I don't think I can understand literature without understanding the Bible.\"Religious culture provides the material basis for art.How many works of art, music, and literature have been created on the basis of religion and have penetrated the public consciousness.This was the case even in my previous life, where the controversy over the existence of God was acute. Not to mention, the Serentra continent has a setting in which the divine power, the proof of God, exists.The influence of religious culture on the world was bound to be much greater than in my previous life.For that reason, I put aside literature for a while and picked up the Bible.It seems to be a mixture of the major religions of my past life, but I thought I should know it properly.Then I saw Bianca with a slightly blank face.\"It's hard to figure out what you need to learn on your own...\"\"Miss?\"\"Oh, nothing.\"Bianca mumbled to herself and buried her face in the book.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The reason for the delay by a few days was that the corruption and embezzlement she made in the manor in the past has been revealed. The butler and doctors involved were also replaced altogether. It would be difficult for these people to find a new job. Instead of getting a letter of recommendation, rumors will spread around the aristocratic families, so it should be seen as a departure from the industry.\"The progress rate steadily rose even while telling on this or other crimes the maid committed. Then I thought of something to say, and turned the topic.\"Coming back to the story of playmates.... To be honest, it's not bad to just keep reading books. Because I can know about this world. Besides, books are the property of nobles, so I should read them carefully when I have the opportunity to read them. So, to say the least, the function of the integrated library was a bit disappointing. Only the books I read or bought during my lifetime are saved, can't you make it so that the books I read after transmigrating are also saved?\"God's answer was heard.['The world-building God' replies that they will seriously consider the update.]['The world-building God' throws new jobs to the new gods.]\"Wow, thank you.\"As soon as I said my thanks, a system message popped up.[<System> 'The morning prayer' has been completed.][<Quest> A Thousand Days of Dawn Prayer (5/1,000).

Healer job change quest, cooking level up, alchemy level up, tea serving study and finally reading club with the Count's Young Lady.I think I'm living a really hard life.Today, I finished my daily routine until lunch and went to Bianca's room.\"Come on, Miss Ellet. What book would you like to read today?\"\"Today, too?\"I didn't have any complaints, but I did ask once.I heard that her former playmates always ran away on the third day, but I'm already on the fourth day.\"......Are you tired of books?\"\"Hmm, how about you, Miss?\"\".......\"\".......\"Bianca rolled her rabbit-like red eyes to the side.It was a little strange to see the Count's Young Lady, who was firmly assertive in her opinions, worriedly looking into the air.Bianca was the one who seemed to do another thing other than reading.\"Shall we do something else?\"\"Then...would you like to play dolls with me?\"\"Playing with dolls? That would be great.\"I sincerely nodded my head with enthusiasm.The memories of playing dolls with my older brother when we were young came to mind.It was a space-themed doll play in which a doll and a robot appeared together, it was a theme made to compromise both our tastes.I miss it even thinking about it again.Bianca seemed happy with my ambitious appearance. For some reason, the child who was always indifferent was slightly blushing and her eyes were shining.Then she went directly to the next room without asking me to do so and brought the dolls into the basket.\"Wow!\"Indeed, the Count Young Lady class was different. What was in the basket were four pretty elaborate jointed dolls and various delicate props. Just looking at it made me excited.The doll consisted of three female and one male. Bianca picked the two female dolls first.\"I'll play the terrifying Duchess and the loyal maidservant.\"Then she gave me the other male doll and one female doll and assigned me a role.\"You play the cheating Duke and a young, hopeless mistress.\"Huh? The setting is kind of...\"Let's get started,\"Bianca lifted the Duchess doll.A stern shout rang out.\"I have finally found the foxy girl who played with my husband! I'm going to get what I'm owned today, so take her to the basement torture chamber right now!\"...... The genre of doll play was strange.Bianca didn't really hate having friends. No, she really wanted to make friends.You can read a book alone, but playing with a doll is no fun alone.Bianca's criteria for choosing friends were very generous compared to those of her brother.'Personality, intelligence, and taste. I only look at those three.'Despite her low threshold, none of her peers met the criteria. Bianca was already ten years old. At this rate, her precious childhood would pass without a single memory of playing with dolls.Even though she eventually gave up the personality and intelligence criteria, it was no use.Then, like fate, the presence of Ellet Rodellaine stood out.Bianca knew everything about the Count's servants. Of course, she also knew about the daughter of a major human resource like The Alchemist.She was amazed when a child she had previously thought was just an ordinary girl suddenly came into her sight.Bianca was surprisingly an activist. As soon as she was interested, she immediately went to see Ellet with the Countess.And Ellet's personality that she saw in the garden exceeded her expectations.'You're sending the maid mother-daughter pair away at once.'The smirk on her innocent and harmless face did not deceive Bianca's eyes.Bianca, who knew at a glance the extraordinariness of Ellet, felt a great interest in other people for the first time in a long time.After she confirmed her personality, the next one was about intelligence.On the first day that Ellet came as her playmate, Bianca choose easy and fun books in her own way, considering that Ellet was a commoner. She was a little disappointed when Ellet passed by the classic purist literature, praised for its excellent writing skills, and picked a narrative.But the next book that Ellet picked up was the Bible.When asked why she chose it, the answer received was truly shocking.\u2015I don't think I can understand literature without understanding the Bible.The Bible, the realm of faith, is only treated as knowledge, and attention is paid to it by necessity.Bianca was momentarily but deeply excited by Ellet's indifferent and intellectual behavior.'If it's this kind of person...'Even though she had already been disappointed several times, expectations arose.However, the last criterion, taste, was something that no one had ever passed. Perhaps her taste was so strange that it made all her playmates leave the room crying after three days.They were even terrified when she tried to say goodbye, it was lonely and disappointing.To be honest, Bianca was deeply hurt.She also didn't seem to be able to make friends with such children no matter how low she set her standards.Friends should be able to embrace each other's tastes.Ellet Rodellaine was a ray of light, and she was afraid she might end up like her former playmates. But, on the fourth day, she made up her mind and took out her dolls.And Ellet did not disappoint Bianca.\"Ah! It's unfair, Madam! It was the Duke who just came up to the capital and seduced the innocent me who knew nothing! Rather, I was the victim of a marriage fraud scam! And above all, there is nothing between me and the Duke. There was no deed, for the Duke was not standing!\"\"Wi-Wife, look at that. It's limpy, so it can't work. I can't do anything even if I want to, so put down your whip and loosen the rope. Cries!\"Holding a mistress doll in her left hand and the Duke's doll in her right hand, Ellet performed with passion.Bianca's face, watching the play in front of her, was a little dazed.Then her mistress doll knelt in front of the Duchess doll.\"Madam! I repent of my sins and want to serve the Madam for the rest of my life. As proof of my loyalty, I want to torture the Duke myself!\"In the end, she leads the doll play to a climax by showing off her knowledge of various torture tools that she has never heard of in her life. With such a rich setting and a description that stimulates the imagination, Bianca could not help but admire it.Before she knew it, the real-like and lively scream of the Duke ceased.\"Phew. The Duke has fainted. Madam, do you like it?\"\"......\"\"Madam?\"The dolls fell from Bianca's hands.It was at that moment when Ellet, who was engrossed in her passionate performance, was slightly embarrassed and tried to look at Bianca.Bianca grabbed Ellet's hand and pressed her face closer.Her red eyes shone like a rabbit. It was the first time in her life that she had so much fun playing with dolls.\"Can I call you Eli?\"\"What?\"\"Well, Eli. You call me Bia, too. It's okay to speak informally when there's only the two of us.\"It was truly an extraordinary privilege. Bianca continued, while Ellet was puzzled.\"And you know what? Can you tell me more about those torture tools you said earlier...?At the shy request, Ellet nodded her head.She thought it would be good to read through 'The History of Medieval Torture' in the integrated library.\"Ah, yes. Miss.\"\"Call me Bia, okay?\"In this way, Ellet became friends with the Count's hidden power.Chapter 4. What Happens When You Are Favored by God and Has PrivilegesThe closer I got to Bianca, the more I had a question.\"If this continues, the Gillete family will not be able to produce a second-generation Aura Master, which is a shame because of our reputation as master swordsmen. There is only one way to save the family that is still in decline. I have to become the head of the household and bring in a skilled knight as a son-in-law.\"\"Wow. That's a wise thing to say, miss.\"\"Name, informal speech.\"\"Yes, Bia. It's a perfect plan.\"\"Eli, I knew you would think like that.\"Why did the Gillete family become like that in the original when there was such a smart young lady to save it?And it wasn't long before I found out why.[<System> You have entered an A-level dungeon 'The Cemetery buried under Count Gillette'.]Because Bianca Gillette was doomed to die with Ellet Rodellaine!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayToday is also a sunny spring day.Having to worry no more with pollution and fine dust flying in the air, three weeks have passed since I fell into a fantasy world by transmigrating into this novel.In order to survive in a world where the difficulty of survival turns bat-crazy at the same time as the original start, I spent a good amount of time in the tutorial.I achieved 22 of 1000 days of praying for my Jog Changing Quest into a Healer. It's a far-fetched goal, but I don't miss a day and I'm working on it steadily.Cooking achieved 'Level 4' and I obtained 'Recipe Insight' and 'Greatly Increased Cooking Taste Lv.1 (Passive)'.In fact, I felt like I had learned enough to cook almost anything.From level 4 and up, the skill level rises slowly, and through 'Recipe Insight', I can cook anything I have tasted once.Even if I continue to level up, it was speculated that only the level of passive skills would go up.Alchemy was at level 3, one level lower than cooking.Now, it is possible to make healing potions for adventurers who go to dungeon subjugation, not just ointment, prescription drugs, and supplements.My diligent self-improvement activities did not end there. I read many books as Bianca's playmate. Thanks to various knowledge, I now had enough common sense to live on the Serentra Continent.With this, no one will ever suspect that I am a foolish outworlder.Knock. Knock.\"Bia, it's me.\"\"Come on, Eli. I was waiting for you.\"Today, I went to Bianca's room to do my duty as a playmate. We shared a homemade chocolate madeleine and set the schedule for the day.\"Oh, I heard there's a new book in the library today. I didn't go alone because I wanted to go with you.\"\"Wow, really? Let's go.\"Slightly moved by the loyalty of the young miss, I got up immediately. We ran upstairs and opened the door, I playfully said.\"You take the lead, madam.\"Bianca lifted her chin instead of scolding me to speak informally.\"Trust me and follow.\"We laughed and hurried our steps.The spacious library of the Countess is a place with an antique style, so I never got tired of going there.\"I don't see the librarian. Did he leave his seat for a while?\"\"Shall I go and look for him?\"\"No, Eli. I have been to the library often, so I know it well.\"Despite taking the lead with plenty of confidence, Bianca expressed reluctance and stopped her steps.\"What's the matter, Bia?\"\"The structure of the library is......\"\"Huh?\"\"Oh, nothing. First, let's go pick a book for Eli to read. Did you say you wanted to read dungeon-related books last time? I will recommend it.\"I followed Bianca, thinking it must have been just a small mistake.But even so, why this is happening? As we walked between the bookshelves, I felt the light rapidly disappearing, it was like entering a tunnel.Our steps stopped.\"Let's see... Ah, here it is.\"Bianca pulled out a book titled <Dungeon, a rift leading to territories in the demon world>. That was the moment.GUGUGUGUGU!A black hole appeared from the empty spot where the book was pulled out. It opened wide like the jaws of a giant monster.Ghuoomp!\"......!\"\"......!\"At the moment the intuition of what is about to happen came rushing, both Bianca and I held each other's hands instead of screaming.The darkness that swallowed us flew away in an instant, and the distorted space caught our eyes as if someone had kneaded it. It was only just before the motion sickness started that the space spread out, revealing the appearance of a place.\"This is......\"Countless tombstones were placed under the red full moon. The scenery unfolding before our eyes was a cemetery on a dark and humid night.\"Hey, what is going on?...\"I could feel Bianca's trembling through our clasped hands.A cemetery that could not exist in the Count's Castle. A night sky that distorts time, and a mysterious red moon.A message appeared to clarify this unrealistic situation.[<System> You have entered an A-level dungeon 'The Cemetery buried under Count Gillette'.]......Ah, figures.At the same time, I remembered the fate of Ellet, which Frintz told me in the original work.\u2015it t's my little sister's keepsake. She stepped into the dungeon that was sealed deep in the Count's castle by mistake, so...Today must have been the day my poor transmigrated body passed away. That too with Bianca, the Count's Young Lady.This unraveled the mystery of how the crazed fool became heir to the family in the original work and was able to run wild. However, it was not pleasing to know it now.\"Wow, it's crazy.\"In a serious situation, my hands automatically turned to my head. Of course, I didn't mean to rip it off, but as I pulled my pink ponytails on both sides, I was deep in thought.When entering a dungeon, there are two ways to exit.Explore every nook and cranny of the dungeon to find an exit gate that you don't know where it is, or subdue the owner of the dungeon you will inevitably meet.Of course, neither were options that two ordinary 10-year-olds could do.'Yes. You want me to die.'It was then.['The world-building God' rushed over in the middle of overtime and ask what's going on.]Doesn't it seem that the survival difficulty of the original has been activated? Why did you give me a body of a child that's bound to die soon...Ah, now is not the time to argue.I hurriedly spoke from my heart.The system was user-friendly, so it was possible to deliver a message only with the intention.'God, God! You mentioned that survival difficulty is adjusted to F during the tutorial period. Why there's an A-grade dungeon here right now? Is this another bug?'['The world-building God' is startled, and he shakes his head saying that there is no way it can happen in the world he has created.]'As a follower of the World-building God, I'm really sorry to say this but, it's out of a common sense for people to die in the tutorial area, right? It's hard to think that this isn't a bug...'['The world-building God' says with extreme denial that it can't happen.]'Ah! So, are you saying it was designed like this from the beginning? Oh, that's too much It's already a shame that I was forcibly transmigrated by death, but in the world that I came anew, I had to die like this again...'['The world-building God' is at a loss for what to do with its first devotees who is favored and loved.]I strongly argued with all my might.'Make the dungeon weak or make me stronger! Please do something!'Give me a bug reward!The gist was this.After a while, a message appeared.['The world-building God' says after deliberation that they will temporarily grant you use of the Holy Power.]'Temporary is a bit...'You're going to give it to me and take it away? That's a bad hobby.['The world-building God' is bewildered, and they change their words to provide powerful items to help conquer the dungeon.]'Of course, I believe that it is not a consumable item.'I sent a deep smile of trust.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' screams that it's impossible to send it down.]['The world-building God' sheds tears of blood.]They seemed to be telling the truth with honesty. From then on, I waited patiently without rushing.['The world-building God' is thinking hard.]['The world-building God' is thinking hard.]['The world-building God' is thinking hard.]Around that time, the cemetery began to prepare to welcome the invaders.Skeletons that came out of the tomb moved their jaw and joints, and white ghosts protruding from the tombstone wandered around the night sky in a chaotic movement.There was no better horror attraction than this. Bianca's pale face turned to look at me.\"E- Eli.\"\"It's okay, Bia. God will protect us.\"\"I am an atheist.\"I realized that even in a world with divine powers, there are atheists.\"......Shhh, let's believe in God.\"It was at that time when I was conscious of God's gaze and unintentionally preached.['The world-building God' makes a desperate choice.][<System> 'The world-building God' gifts to you the 'Descent of Divinity' skill.]Divine Descent?['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance', severely scolds back, saying that no matter how hard it is, the manager should not do this kind of thing, and demands a written apology.]['The world-building God' is dragged out to write his apology.]On behalf of the God who was leaving, the system popped up an explanation window, and I could not believe what was written in it.'Isn't this quite the huge deal?'Even the slightest worry was gone and now my heart was pounding with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It's said that we couldn't get out of a dungeon without subjugating the owner.\"\"It's okay. I'll protect you, Bia.\"\"Eli.......\"Her rabbit-like eyes were filled with emotion, but there was no trust. It was a mournful look, like hearing a promise to die together as if I was her real blooded sister.I emphasized.\"It's true.\"\"Yes.......\"\"Really.\"\"Yes. I'll protect you too, Eli.\"It seems that the truth will not go through.\"How long has it been since I've had guests! I, Ardiman, have personally come to meet you!\"[<System> The owner of the dungeon, 2039th place in the demon world, 'Necromancer Baron Ardiman' has appeared.]He came out of nowhere. The owner of the dungeon was a typical warlock wearing a black robe.The evil energy rising from the whole body, his bright red eyes, and the horns of the goat in the head that pierced through the hood made it clear that he was not a human, but a Demon.\"Huk.\"Bianca let out a small gasp.Human fear was nothing short of a sweet scent to the devil. The demonic baron Ardiman, who smelled it, revealed a creepy smile.\"You are too young to be an adventurer! Is this the pure soul of a child sent by humans to win my favor?\"\"If I make a sacrifice... will you let me live?\"Bianca let go of my tight grip and stepped forward.\"My name is Bianca Gillette, and as the next head of Count Gillette, I promise you. I will offer a hundred children, so send me and Ellet back.\"\"Ho? Would you like to make a deal with me?\"\"Yes!\"Ardiman pretended to touch his chin with his bony fingertips. It looked like he was playing a trick.\"It's trustworthy that it's a promise of the next head of state. Not bad.\"\"Then.......\"\"Leave the kid next to you instead.\"\"What?\"\"Isn't it enough of a price to go back alive? It looks like she's just a maid, just leave her behind and give the other 99 after\"Bianca didn't even bother to think about his offer.\"No way! She's not just a maid. She's my...\"\"My what?\"\"Anyway, this is not an option! I'll give you 200 people, so send me and the Eli back.\"Even with a face that looked like she was about to faint from tension, Bianca tried to be confident. However, it was as if the demon who had smelled the fragrant smell of fear had already found out her intentions.\"No, there is no need. I must receive one on the spot, so one of you two remains. You decide who will be the sacrifice.\"\"......!\"He was a demon, after all. A human's desperate heart was just a joke to him.Bianca's eyes trembled as she looked back at me and my mood sank to the bottom.Oh, I hate this, it's better to just smash it as soon as possible.\"Hey, ugly graveyard sh-...huh?\"I was about to go in front of Ardiman with a full course of swearing, but suddenly my wrist was grabbed. It was Bianca.\"Don't go, Eli.\"\"Bia?\"\"I will stay.\"Bianca's face was quite grim. It seemed that she misunderstood my actions when I went in front of her.\"No, Bia. This is not like that...\"\"As the next head of the household, it is natural to protect the estate. And... you are my friend.\"\"......\"Bianca whispered softly while I was at a loss for words, she had a slightly watery voice.\"Eli, you're smart, so you know what to do when you get out? I will wait until you come to rescue me.\"A voice that caught our attention rang aloud.\"Boring kids! Do you think that I teased you to film a melodrama like this? Enough. You all are going to die!\"A blood-red orb was summoned from Ardiman's hand. The black energy emanating from it was unusual.\"That's not what you promised!\"\"Hahahaha! Foolish, human child! I never said I would agree to your offer in the first place! Kuhahaha!\"\"This, this, this demon...!\"\"Pu ha ha! Did you just curse? Didn't you intend to do the same? You, too, offered 100 children or 200 children, why tell me that after selling a pure lie without any intention of giving them to me, at least you must have thought to send the corpses of dead children.\"\"How do you...\"\"Kukkuk. Still young, you are still wet behind the ears. It was a pretty good joke, little Next Lord.\"\"Ugh......\"This time, I gabbed the trembling Bianca and pulled her back. Now it was my turn to face Ardiman.\"Now you are revealing your true nature, ugly grave keeper.\"\"Seems like you are not surprised! It seems you have accepted the fate of being ripped off from your bones, flesh, and soul! Know it's an honor for the likes of you! Your white bones will join my army of skeletons loyal to this Ardiman, your flesh will become manure for my beautiful signature garden, and your souls will become an instrument that plays the screams of pain for eternity!\"After listening to all the chattering, I replied.\"Are you done?

No way! G-God would have abandoned this world and left! The divine power was also steadily weakening, wasn't it? O-obviously God threw this world away so that we could eat it all as we liked!\"I threw a word to Ardiman, who was confused.\"A successor is here.\"\"What?! What does that mean...!\"\"No more small talk, let's fight now.\"\"Wait a minute......!\"\"Omniscience.\"I immediately used the God skill.\"Wh- what kind of twisted trick are you trying to play here!\"Ardiman, who felt an unusual omen only just from the energy emanating from me, was terrified. But when I saw a new screen pop up, I was a little perplexed.'What is this?'[<System> Starting the new world-building knowledge search engine.

I put my embarrassment aside and followed the guide.'Holy skills in order of highest strength.'[<System> 'Serentra Continent's Holy Skill Rank TOP 50' has been searched.]I checked the list in descending order.

Save me, please...\"\"You want to live?\"\"Ye-yes... please, have mercy...\"The tattered Ardiman submissively begged.I took a close look at him. I didn't know as I was looking from afar, but his body, hidden in a robe, was a skeleton.Was this guy an undead too? Then.......I smiled and held out my hand.\"Okay. I'll treat you now.\"\"Tr-treatment?

Ellet's body was enveloped in white light, and her two feet floated in the air.Her cherry blossom-colored hair was changed to luscious silver, and her peridot-like eyes gleamed in gold.The appearance of Ellet, covered with divinity powerful enough to shake her whole body, was as foreign as myths and legends.In that form, Ellet faced a fearsome necromancer undead demon.\"Mercury's Barrier.\"\"Nonsense!\"\"Divine Punishment.\"\"Arghhh!\"\"Heal.\"\"Kueeeek!\"The owner of the dungeon instantly turned into ashes and disappeared.'Wow, did you defeat him?'Bianca's question was answered by the environmental change in the dungeon. The red moon melted and disappeared like ice cream, and the darkness lifted to reveal a clear sky.With the sky without a single cloud in the background, Ellet looked back at Bianca.'Ellet.....'Bianca looked up at her, feeling overwhelmed. The miraculous savior before her eyes seemed to be the second coming of God itself.At that time, Ellet released the divinity with a sigh. Her body, which had been floating, settled on the ground and returned to its original form.\"Let's see.....the reward is one passive skill and one special item. The notoriety that resonates in the underworld? A Tomb Raider's treasure bag? I'll have to check it out later.\"Ellet, who had roughly picked up an old book and satchel bag, turned to Bianca.\"Done. Let's go back for-\"\"Eli!\"\"Bia?\"Bianca grabbed Elliet's hand and pushed her face, her rabbit-like red eyes were filled with emotion.Ellet was a precious friend she barely made. On top of that, after going through adversity and hardships, friendship had no choice but to strengthen.Besides, emotion was not the only thing Bianca felt.\"Eli is an apostle of God! Right? Right?\"\"Huh?\"\"You defeated the Demon Baron by yourself. To have such tremendous divine power at your age, you must be an apostle of God. Isn't it?\"\"Uh... that's right.\"Since I was the first believer in 'The world-building God', it could be said that it was perfect reasoning.As I nodded my head, a little dew formed on the corners of Bianca's eyes.\"Ah...God did not forsake this world, but sent Eli.\"Then, suddenly, a message shown only to Ellet appeared.[<System> Converted an atheist to a believer. As the first believer of the 'The world-building God', the people you preach automatically become believers of the 'The world-building God'.

Maybe it will be like that... sniff.\"Bianca's question prompted Ellet to seriously consider her career path.Even after transmigrating in this S-Rank novel with a ridiculous survival difficulty, it seemed that she could not escape that fateAs the main character was not able to properly play his role, there was a high possibility that salvation would have to be done by herself.Meanwhile, Bianca lit up her eyes as if she was too excited.\"I want to help too!\"\"What?\"\"I can't fight, but I can do other things. Do you need a guild headquarters to conduct subjugation activities around the Serentra Continent? I will fully support Eli as the next Head of Gillette. Leave the subjugation guild's manpower management, money management, and various administrative tasks to me.\"\"Uh... Really?\"\"Yes! Use me as Eli's aide. I am sure I will do well.\"\"Th-thank you, Bia.\"\"I am more grateful.\"Bianca smiled shyly with a blushing face.\"Eli is my lifesaver.

We're finally friends, I can't let you go like this!\"\"I'm not going to die...\"Flop!Ellet collapsed in Bianca's arms and blacked out.\u2720That day, there was a riot in the Holy Country of Elpenheim.\"He! He has come!\"\"Oh oh oh!\"In the depths of the Holy City, there was a great turmoil in a certain Hall.It was not a special holiday, but the cardinals were gathered in one place. They shed tears of joy as they gazed at the auspicious white light shining on the oracle altar.In the center of them, the elderly pope also had tears in his eyes and reverently drew the holy sign in the air.\"Alas, the altar of the oracle is reacting strongly! This...this is definitely a Descent!\"The cardinals exclaimed with joy.\"A few weeks ago, I felt extraordinary divinity! God has answered our earnest prayers!\"\"After all, the merciful one, will not allow creation to perish!\"\"The only reason for an oracle to not be given for a hundred years was to test our faith!\"\"Amen! Hail to order and the goodwill of all things!\"As a perishing world setting, there were signs that the gods had abandoned the Serentra Continent.The representative example of that was the gradually weakening divine power and the end of long-established oracles.But now, a divine descent, which has never been seen in history, has occurred. This was a tremendous grace that could not be compared with an oracle.In a world that is perishing, salvation is more desperately needed. It was natural to feel a sense of helplessness, but even then, there were cardinals pouring cold water on the ones in a joyful atmosphere and making remarks about their beliefs.\"You can't be happy yet. Because it is presumed that the place where the Descent took place is not in this Holy Country of Elpenheim, but in the Kingdom of Vinchester.\"\"That's right. It is painful to know that the vessel of grace was born outside the Church.\"It was a very nationalistic remark, but everyone could relate to it.\"It's strange that there could be such a worthy vessel in the Kingdom of Vinchester.\"\"Isn't this a man of strong political influence hiding his power from the church in the countryside?\"\"In any case, it is impossible for such a precious person to be in a land full of unbelievers!\"\"That's right. They must be brought to Sanctuary as soon as possible and be appointed as a Saint.\"\"Let's set up a search party right now!\"Cardinals actively exchanged opinions with each other.Suddenly, the Grand Chapel became a meeting place for those in power who were responsible for the Holy Country.On the other hand, there were more people spying on the divine light from the balcony on the 4th floor of the Grand Chapel.They were young boys in white robe uniforms, indicating that they belong to the Vatican. They were some of the special children the denomination has been working hard to raise in the name of saving the world.Looking at their bodies one by one, something in common could be seen. They were engraved with a stigmata that forcibly opened the divine power.Now, those children were very uncomfortable with the news.\"They used to say every time that we were the hope to save the world.\"\"That's great. Saving the world didn't fit my aptitude. I'm going to take this opportunity to go away.\"\"You're talking nonsense. Do you think the denomination will let us go?\"\"Yes. No?\"\"Yes, they won't. Even if world peace comes, they will use us for the rest of our lives to keep the powers of Vinchester Kingdom and the Ragneif Magic Republic in check. To that end, they purposely picked up orphans and even transplanted stigmata.\"\"Hm, now that you say it like that, it makes sense. You are quite smart, aren't you?\"\"You are not enough are you?\"\"What, do you want to fight?\"\"No, don't bully the weak supporter.\"As the black-haired child quickly changed his stance, the blonde-haired child walked away with a smile.After the quarrel, the two children looked around as if they suddenly remembered.\"But why is he so quiet... Hey, hey, look at his eyes.\"There was one more child on the side of the railing where the two of them looked.\".....\"He was a boy who looked like an angel in a painting hanging in a noble's castle, with beautiful silver hair and eyes the color of the sea.The child looked at the light pouring down on the altar of the oracle as if he had lost not only his gaze but also his soul.The other two children whispered as if to make him listen.\"His eyes are very fierce.\"\"I wonder if he thinks someone who monopolizes the love of God has come. The railing is old, so be careful, all right?\"The silver-haired child did not reply, as if he could not hear. The two children, feeling sorry for this, took the same side in the gossip.\"Hey, aren't those eyes of jealousy?\"\"Right? Is it because the light is proof that God has someone it loves more than him?\"Then the silver-haired child turned to them.\"Jealousy is one of the Seven Deadly Sins. It's not good to joke about that.\"\"......Ah, tsk. Every time he's like that I get annoyed. You always sound like an old cardinal or a grandmother.\"\"Huh, that should be enough to be favored by, 'order and goodwill, isn't it?\"\"This guy. He won't even talk to this Tanker nor that Healer even if they beg.\"\"Are you still hanging out with Olna?\"\"......Ha, I'll just go away.\"As the two of them clashed, the silver-haired child swiped the scar on his left wrist and secretly swallowed a sigh.'I'm really in trouble.'...But the problem is that I can't even explain the situation.Anyway, that wasn't the point now.Again, eyes that had the heavenly color of the sea flew toward the altar and narrowed.'Is it just me? It seems a little different from the feeling of 'order and goodwill'.\"It didn't make sense even thinking about it.A Saint or a Heretic.The boy, who quickly disposed of the profane suspicion, looked at the light again with reverent eyes.'Who is it?'Curiosity arose as strong as a thirst.Desire lingered in the eyes of the young protagonist, Thesilid Argent, as he followed the light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since when have you been here?'['The world-building God' answers that it came back a little while ago.]I was thankful to God in many ways. Wasn't it possible to safely attack the dungeon thanks to his determination to even write a formal letter of apology?I bashfully laughed.'It's was only for a short time, but it was great because it was really strong. Seeing that an A-level boss was fried in an instant, I thought I could hit and destroy an S-class dungeon alone. Wouldn't it be roughly equivalent to the main character in episode 20?'['The world-building God' says that the power of Descent may become stronger in proportion to your potential.]['The world-building God' gave advice, but told you not to overuse it.]'Yes. I have to get strong by myself.'['The world-building God' says you had good thoughts and encourages you to faithfully engage in prayer, training, offering (paying money), and preaching in the future.]Even though we were on the same mind on prayer and training, I laughed a little at the offering and preaching.'That's right. As expected, the shortcut to level up is offering and preaching. A cash shop dedicated to transmigrators where you can buy abilities and skills. A pyramid scheme that strengthens the buff effect as you increase the number of believers. Wow, that's just great.'['The world-building God' let out an hm-uhm cof, and suggest that you use the line 'multi-level marketing' rather than 'pyramid scheme.']'Yes Yes. I will.'As I was talking about the sacred pyramid scheme, I suddenly realized something new.'The faith of the people here is affecting God.'In fact, so far, I had a rather shallow mindset that I only transmigrated in a stressful novel. However, seeing an actual God build up its faith in this place, makes me think that the world I transmigrated to has the same set of values as the earth in my previous life.One real world.Being destroying.Perhaps the souls of the people living here are also real.The only god who had dominated faith in this world was the one who abandoned everything.If the 'The world-building God' expands its reach, it might be good for this world as well.\u2720\"Eli! Are you feeling better now?\"\"Yes, I'm fine now.\"\"I'm really happy. I was very worried.\"When the news spread that I had gotten up after two days, Bianca came running to greet me.I deliberately showed off my health and clenched both of my fists.Actually, I was in good shape. After the penalty was over, my body was not as bad as a person who had suffered from a fever until recently.It seems that Bianca did not disclose what had happened in the dungeon to anyone.It was difficult to reveal to others because 'Descent of Divinity' was costly, and technically, it was a borrowed power.So I was going to tell her to keep it a secret, but Bianca had good judgment as the next head of state ought to be, quick-witted and clever.Therefore, the fact that two of us got inside a dungeon and came out after overthrowing the owner was quietly buried, and the cause of my sickness was attributed to overwork, which greatly reduced my work.Taking this opportunity, I decided to spend less time learning to cook and make tea, because I had learned enough.It seems that alchemy is the best fit for me rather than cooking and tea ceremony. At the place where Dad, Peisha, and Isela gathered, I made a cautious remark about my choices.Daddy's face was red from emotion but he made a serious face not to show that he was in a good mood. Chef Peisha and Maid Isela showed a sign that they wouldn't give up on me, saying that there was still time.To be honest, before speaking, I was a little worried that both would be disappointed in me, but it was quite the twist.They seemed to be the type that burns more brightly over things that are not easily obtainable.But my intentions were clear. Because selling healing potions for adventurers makes the most money. In order to survive in this rough world, ability alone was not enough. I had to have money, too.At this point, it would be good to re-read the original work to organize the dungeons frequented by adventurers and the strategy information for each dungeon.'Oh, come to think of it.'Speaking of dungeons, I also had to make a decision about the disposition of the dungeon that belonged to me.The fate of the dungeon where the owner was subjugated is largely separated into two choices.The first is to keep it open to adventurers. The difficulty of dungeons without an owner is significantly lowered, and valuable new material resources such as beasts and by-products of monsters, special plants, and minerals can be obtained within the dungeon, so many dungeons usually take this route.The second is closing, as in, closing and destroying it. This decision is made when there are no valuable resources or the dungeon is too dangerous.I had to say that the dungeon I dealt with this time met this condition.It is a cemetery with only common bone-type monsters and no special plants or minerals, after it was swept away with divine power, now it has become a wasteland with no value.In addition, the location is not good because it has a parasitic status in someone else's house, which should be a safe area.So, if you think simply, it's right to close it. But...It was my first land, and I felt a little bit sad.I decided to pause the disposition for a while and talked to Bianca.\"It puts a lot of strain on your body to use that power, right? You were fine just before passing out.\"\"Yes.\"\"It's best to hide and not use your power as much as possible.\"\"Come to think of it, I think Bia must have been in trouble because I collapsed in the dungeon at that time. You had a hard time bringing me to the exit, didn't you?\"It was when I felt sorry to think that young Bianca had arduously carried me around.\"No. I was fine because I got help.\"\"Help?\"\"Yes. The skeleton demons helped move you.\"\"What?\"It's an amazing new fact. Were there any surviving skeletons? Besides, they helped us?\"Really. I asked them to help me instead of just looking at me, so they did.\"It was easy to imagine that it would have been a dignified command in line with the Count's successor.On the contrary, I was convinced.\"Hm, they were deep underground, so they seem to have survived, but they seem to have a habit of obeying orders because they are a corps of slaves used by Ardiman... Oh, yes! That's right!\"\"Eli?\"A thought suddenly popped into my mind.I immediately took out the passive skill book I received as a dungeon subjugation reward.[<Skill> 'Notoriety that resonates in the underworld (Passive)'\\nThe undead who sees you falls into 'fear' abnormal status.Note: The weaker the undead, the better.]'Evil reputation! Gives Fear! Good!'My eyes shone with that piece of information, I opened a cash shop dedicated to the transmigrators and paid for familiar products.[<System> I purchased the 'Exchange Package (Non Combat)'.][<System> Selected 'Druid-like Farmer Hands' to awaken cultivation Lv.1]The healing potion business was in need of a constant supply of medicinal herbs. I smiled with joy.\"Ufufu.\"\"Eli......?\"I grabbed Bianca's hand, which had a suspicious look in her eyes.\"Bia, get up! I have a place to go!\"\u2720Skull Soldier No. 1004, that was the name given to him.Of course, it wasn't like that from the beginning.However, like his bones and joints that wear out over time, the name in the memory was worn out and forgotten, so, only the number remains.It was when the place name Gillete was not yet engraved on the map of the continent.Skull Soldier No. 1004 went on a training trip according to the long tradition of the family.He traveled all over the continent to sincerely complete his various missions, and now there was only one thing left to do, that is the return to his castle and succeed the family.So, while rushing to return, he passed by the vicinity of the present-day Gillette estate ......- Prince, avoid!!- Ugh!A dungeon burst occurred on the way, and they fell into an A-class dungeon.- Kuhahahaha, welcome!!Shortly after being warmly welcomed by the necromancer Ardiman, he and his party became Skull Soldiers 1004, 1005, 1006, and 1007.It was then that the cruel life as a slave of the demons began.Hard shoveling work to expand the cemetery was basic duty, and on days of watch duty, he had to stand guard to see if adventurers invaded or not. On days of subjugation, they had to be beaten at the forefront as Ardiman's skeleton shield.He couldn't even count how many times the bones of his body were divided into tens or hundreds of pieces and repeatedly attached back.'Ah, I can't do this anymore! Someone, please save me!'Clattering!His inner scream only resounded as a sad boney-friction-like sound.One day while longing for the end of his hellish slavery, Ardiman was finally subjugated. Skull Soldier No. 1004 was moved by the thought that he could finally face the Rest of Death.'Even though there are no graves to lay down the body nor a tombstone with names engraved on it, but still, this is finally...'But then.\"From now on, I will turn this land into an herb garden. Therefore, from here to there, should be completely cleared out. Start!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Let's end this quickly, okay?\"Crackling!Even though the farmer was talking normally, a strong sense of intimidation came out. For some reason, it felt more frightening than Ardmina, an evil demon.Fear stimulated the spirit of servitude imprinted in the bones. Skull soldiers, no, Skull serfs began to move diligently.It was hard work that was no different from before.After clearing the wasteland from the eastern horizon to the western horizon, it was necessary to dig a huge well in search of water veins.It felt like my backbone was about to break with the non-stop shoveling and pickaxing.'Prince, don't overdo it! We can do this!''Oh, no. I'm fine......'\"You there. Don't cheat and work as you should.\"With just a little criticism, the Skull serfs were astonished as if they had been whipped. While the wicked farmer mixed up the seedlings and fertilizes them, she hinted.\"Not just one or two adventurers were killed, right? Work hard with the mindset of atonement.\"At that, Skull Serf No. 1004 grabbed the pickaxe.That was correct. It was inevitable because he became part of Ardiman's enslaved Skull soldiers, but it was true that his white hands were stained with the blood of adventurers.'After all, it was a luxury to receive rest without atonement.'His pickaxe quickly dug the well.On the lead of Skull Serf No. 1004, his men and three other surviving skeletons worked hard.After a long time, a well was finally built.\"Great job. Now, for the final job, dig seven places here. We have to build a grave.\"Crackling?I wondered if there were any corpses to bury, but the farmer indifferently said.\"You guys can go to the grave and rest. Since there are seven people, we should dig that much.\"'Really?'The Sull serfs were delighted.It was always overcrowded, so everyone slept with at let's five others in one tomb, but the wicked farmer guaranteed a comfortable living environment!It's a universal law, that when a tyrant does something good, it has double the effect of looking nice.They expressed their emotions with their intense clatter, but it wasn't over yet.\"If you keep working hard, I will erect a monument and sometimes give you flowers. You too must have been human once.\"'......!'For a moment, the Skull serfs forgot to rattle and crack their bones.A tombstone with their names on it. That was the only wish they had after becoming skeletons.No. 1004's skeleton hand swept through his two black eye holes. For some reason, I felt as if tears were flowing out of his empty eyelids.\u27203 weeks have passed.In the meantime, the administrative gods of the Transmigration Bureau have hardly appeared. They said there was a system update coming soon, and everyone seems to be busy with that.It's been a month and a half since I transmigrated. I was still faithful to the tutorial and living a daily life that sucked in experience points.In accordance with the plan to have financial resources as well as ability, I was investing intensively in alchemist.Alchemy has reached Lv.7 and I have learned 'Significantly Increase Alchemy Efficacy Lv.4 (Passive)'.When my father checked the effect of the healing potions I made, he was very surprised.\"Unbelievable. It has the same efficacy as the healing potion I made when I was ten years old!\"I was surprised by that too.I was someone receiving help from a support system, including the blessings for high-speed growth, but my father did his with pure talent.After all, my father was from the Golden Ivory Tower, where only genius alchemists gather.Now, if we were to judge the level of my father's ability, it was speculated that he would have to exceed level 20.Tap, Tap!A drop of water fell into the flask containing the potion. When I turned around, my father suddenly had tears in his eyes.\"D-Dad? Why are you crying all of a sudden?\"Were you so moved by my potion?...Of course, I didn't think it was such a big thing.\"I'm sorry, Eli. You have to go to the Golden Ivory Tower to make your talents blossom... This dad is...\"\"Ah.......\"Dad has a sad past.He was a promising talent in the Golden Ivory Tower, but he was unfairly kicked out of the eyes of an elder alchemist.The elder alchemist was also my dad's teacher, and it was a terrible relationship right from the beginning when he started as an apprentice.This is because, having recognized his brilliant talent, the Master made him in a disciple to exploit the results of his research.It can be said that this is the long-standing evil inside the apprenticeship system.Another senior alchemist who recognized Dad as a rival replicated the Master's shameless criminal behavior.But waiting at the end of his troubles was not the satisfaction of payback, but a large sweet potato of angst.The quick-witted Master framed Dad and made him permanently expelled from the tower.A powerless and helpless commoner young alchemist was a very convenient sacrifice for concealing the truth.'Shesh, I guess a good and innocent person has no choice but to eat sweet potatoes.'In my industry, incompetent people were bound to be good at politics, and so was the unscrupulous Master.As long as that bad guy is serving as an Elder Alchemist, the entry of our Rodellaine family into the Golden Ivory Tower was blocked.\"Because of this dad... I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Eli.\"The guilt of being a stumbling block to his daughter's future made Dad even sadder. I put my little hand on my Dad's big one.\"Dad, it's okay. It is enough for me to learn from my Dad.\"There is also help from the system. Besides, I have neither the intention nor the time to dig deep into alchemy.\"So, don't be upset. I wasn't interested in anything like the Golden Ivory Tower. I have to go away from my dad and brother, so why am I going to such a place?\"\"Eli......!\"Dad burst into tears and hugged me.Hold on, why are you crying when I comforted you?He calmed down while I was squirming around because it was awkward to be held in his arms.\"I'll teach you alchemy to the best of your ability.\"\"Thank you. So, shall we start class soon?\"\"Yes, my child is also sincere. Let's keep working hard. At this rate, it seems that sooner or later you will reach the level of creating your own recipes.\"\"Yes!\"Until then, I had no idea that I was planning to make money by simply selling effective mass-production potions. Because there was no way for me to foresee at this point that this ability would create synergy with other fields I learned.\u2720After alchemy class, I decided to tour the farm dungeon with Bianca.The time in the dungeons often passed faster than the time in reality. The dungeon I subjugated was the same, so the ratio of real-time to dungeon time was 1:3.Therefore, three weeks have passed since the field was cleared and the seedlings were planted, but the dungeon was 9 weeks old.Even after two months were full, the dungeon farm has changed a lot as the remaining time has passed.\"It's prettier than when we came before.\"As Bianca said.The wide field was plowed neatly in rows, and various medicinal herbs boasted green freshness.A brook flowing from the reservoir rippled around the field, and on one side there was a poor but well-made pergola and bench set.The tombs of the seven Skull serfs were beautiful, had thick convex outlines, and were neatly finished with stones of unknown origin. It was all the work of the skeletons.The skeletons seemed to feel quite attached to the farm dungeon.They worked hard to take care of the herbs, and every time a new leaf appeared or a flower bloomed, everyone gathered nearby and rattled their jaws.They also took care of the landscaping from time to time and paid special attention to their graves. Even now, there were some who planted moss mounds, flowers buds and were delighted with decorating carved stones around them.\"Guys, I'm here.\"Katcha!The skeletons all stopped working all at once and looked at Bianca.They rushed out, stood in a line, and greeted each other with the sound of intense bone friction.Because of the passive effect of the 'Notoriety that resonates in the underworld', discipline was well established.\"Your teeth are going to be damaged. That's enough.\"Crackling!I and Bianca went to the shabby wooden pergola and sat down. Then, the roundest and prettiest skull among the skeletons served tea made with herbal leaves.The skeleton watched over Bianca as she gracefully lifted up her teacup and sipped.Bianca glanced back at it and the skeleton jaw moved a little.Crackling...?\"Is it delicious?\"Clatter.\"Yes. It's great.\"I don't know why, but Bianca communicated well with the skeletons.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe skeleton was very fond of Bianca's favorable reviews and bowed politely.I've been thinking about this for a while, but this pretty skull guy had a subtly elegant in his behavior.Perhaps he had a precious status in his lifetime.When I told them to go to work, the skeletons went back to their respective jobs. Water the fields, dry herbs, build fences, decorate graves...It was a quiet landscape of a peaceful skull village.\"At first, I was a little worried if Eli's plan would go well, but it turned out to be such a wonderful farm.\"\"Thanks to the skeletons for their hard work. I have already harvested two kinds of herbs.\"In the shade of the pergola were baskets of harvested medicinal herbs.Namibi and Little Gem, whose leaves were plump like fruits, are the main ingredients for healing potions.\"I'll have to take it to my Dad and ask him to check the quality.\"I put a basket of herbs in the satchel I was carrying. Bianca was surprised to see the basket, much larger than the bag, disappearing as if sucked in.\"How did you do it?\"\"Ah, this. It's an item called a Tomb Raider's treasure bag that I got after defeating Ardiman the other day.\"[<Item> Tomb Raider's treasure bagInventory. A subspace of about 50m\u00b3 that can be used as a warehouse.\\nNote: Live people and animals cannot be included.]When I explained it as it is, Bianca immediately used the power of application in her head and suggested it.\"If you put things in the subspace, you won't feel the weight, will you?\"\"Yes.\"\"Great. With that, we can move the tombstones of the skeletons.\"The skulls raised their heads at the word tombstone. It was probably not only in my head that makes their empty eyeholes feel somewhat sparkling.I made an announcement while everyone was paying attention.\"Okay, guys. I'm going to place an order for the tombstone, so let me know what shape you want, name, date of birth, date of death, epitaph... Why are you getting so solemn all of a sudden?\"I stopped talking because it was suspicious that I couldn't hear the usual silly rattle. Bianca, who had excellent communication skills, explained.\"Maybe they don't remember.\"\"Ah, I see.\"Their brain must have been rotten for a long time.... Well, sounds like a bad insult.The skeletons nodded their heads violently.\"All right, you have been waiting long enough. Then, just pick an epitaph. I'll give you a name. Are you fine with this?\"It seemed to be a positive reaction, seeing that they were dancing with a shovel. After the headstone problem was settled, Bianca brought up another topic.\"Looking at the speed at which things are progressing, I will have to set up a commercial guild to distribute potions soon. Leave it to me.\"\"What? You are going to make it yourself without bidding from an existing guild?\"\"Seeing the merchants that do business with the Count, I think it would be better for me to do it.\"Indeed, even Dad had many problems with the herbal medicine store, so he was often called out. This is a convincing point.\"And I think it would be good to build a network to get information at this point.\"She's such a capable Young Lady, I'm so touched.\"I'm glad Bia is helping me. Thank you so much.\"\"What...\"Bianca first told me of her plans to find stores in the Gillette estate and deliver to them on a trial basis.From what I heard, it seemed like all I had to do was make potions.While discussing the issue of material supply and demand, the story shifted towards the merits of the dungeon farm. Bianca said with a renewed admiration.\"I think it's amazing that time passes quickly by making a farm in a dungeon, so you can harvest quickly. The soil is fertile, and herbs seem to grow well.\"\"I know. I really like the soil. How is it that the whole land is so shiny?\"\"Well, it used to be a cemetery, right?\"\"Huh? Ah, the corpses turned into manure and became fertile.\"\"......\"\"......\"At the same time, we were drinking tea brewed with medicinal herbs grown here and it felt a little awkward.\"Well, what about it? There are always going to be a few dead things on farms, right Eli.\"\"Yes, Bia. Besides, I think the last corpse was buried in this dungeon over a hundred years ago, now it's already like complete soil.\"We decided to change the subject after we had rationalized our feelings.\"The time in the dungeon goes by quickly, so there are downsides too. I have to look around often.\"Skeletons do the hard work, but I had to get my hands on the technical part.Even if we visit once a day, it was a little cumbersome as you would only visit once every three days in dungeon time.Although the skeletons were learning hard, they were still immature, so to leave all farm work to them was not very reliable.'It would have been better if I had a skeleton who was a farmer before he died.'It was time to sigh in regret. The first system message appeared after a while.[<System> From now on, maintenance for the update of the 'Transmigrator Support System' is in progress.]Oh, it's today.As soon as the countdown ended, the update started immediately and was over in less than 5 minutes.\"Bia, wait a minute.\"I pretended to write something in my notebook and checked the update history.[<Notice> 'Integrated Library Update'The integrated library has been upgraded, and from now on, it is possible to store books read or purchased after transmigrating.]'God is the best!'My previous suggestions were immediately reflected and my desire to read the rest of the notice flared up.Other than that, it was all new product updates, and the product in the first line caught my eye.[<Product> 'Genre Change Ticket']'Hold on, is this!!'Is it time to realize my dream of child-rearing ropan?However, that dream was immediately thwarted in the product description that followed.[<Product> 'Genre Change Ticket'The ultimate product that can change the genre of the Transmigrated work.Note: However, the changed genre is random among fantasy, romance, 19+ romance, GL/BL, etc.\\nPrice: 10,000,000,000 Cash]What?

This is pretty good, isn't it?'Isn't this the same as opening the way for the awakening of Aura, Magic, and Holy Power?I raised my head and looked ahead.\"Eli?\"Bianca tilted her head at my intense gaze, but I dropped my shoulders.'Wow, it looks like the basic potential required is quite high.'Nothing floated above Bianca's head. If it was Bianca, the cash would not be wasted, but it was a pity. In fact, most of the former packages were combat and labor-related abilities, but Bianca was a brainy type rather than a physical one.\"Yes, Bia. You are perfect the way you are now. It's okay because you're going to be a great Head of the House.\"\".......Why all of a sudden?\"It was all of a sudden, but Bianca smiled softly as if she couldn't help but like it.'Huh?'At that time, a light blue icon came into my eyes from an unexpected direction.

Rattle! Rattle! Rattle!With a strong nod, he ran out and started making herb seedlings, which was originally my work.Bianca blinked her rabbit-like eyes.\"He's suddenly doing a good job.\"\"I guess it's good that you erected the monument.\"With this, the dungeon farm will roll on its own. From now on, I can come only when I want to come, and even if I come, I don't have to put dirt on my hands.In addition, the skulls, including the skull beauty, obey me due to the notoriety effect, and they are fundamentally beings who cannot escape from within the dungeon. There was no fear of my 3 million cash investment fleeing.\"Bia, have you finished your tea? Let's go now.\"\"What are you going to do now? Do you want to go to the library?\"\"Good idea!\"My lovely Bia, how do you know I want to check the integrated library update?After we got out of the dungeon, we spent a lot of time in the library.The upgraded integrated library function was the best. All the contents of the book were stored in the library just by turning the pages slowly without having to read it.'There is no better scan function than this.'Even though books are precious in this setting, isn't it easy to build a great library in my head?I can read anytime, so I'll have to focus on scanning whenever Bianca takes me to the library.I picked up a book for camouflage and walked out of the library with it in my arms. We walked down the hallway on the second floor to return to Bianca's room.My gaze was drawn through the windowpane where the warm afternoon sun was shining. I turned my head and stood still with my eyes wide open.\"That's......\"\"What's the matter, Eli? ......Ah, it looks like Brother Romdio, is taking swordsmanship lessons. It's kind of ugly, right? What kind of training would you call that?\"\"Oh, well, that's true, but...\"There was something else that caught my attention.A shiny light blue inverted triangle icon, and the message that pops up next to it...[<Target> '???'Has swordsmanship potential to awaken the Aura.

Next come, next!\"\"Hiing, it's finally over...\"The young servants did their best to pretend to be dying, got up, and ran away.He gave wooden swords to the boys under the pretext of a training party, but how dare a servant raise the sword and attack a young noble.They just realistically played the loser, raised the spirits of the young master, and quickly finished their turn.Romdio gasped and looked for something to drink. Instead of water, all kinds of potions were placed on a simple table.\"Gup, gup, puha, aah!\"Romdio wanted to relieve stress again.\"Next... what, is it you?\"\"Yo-Young Master. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\"Frintz Rodellaine. The moment he saw the timid pink-haired pretty boy, Romdio's wooden sword gained strength.Romdio has long been unhappy with Frintz.He was always been beaten, but he was smarter and better-looking than himself. Even the name was Frintz! It seemed more luxurious than his, the Count's heir.\"Take that!\"\"Yo-Young Master! Oh!\"Romdio, full of malice, swung his wooden sword with all his might. But Frintz instinctively avoided it.Kwajik!It was immediately after drinking the potion, so the destructive power was enormous.'Ha, if he gets hit by something like that, he'll be in big trouble!'The plan to hit moderately as he did for other servants was withdrawn. However, since Frintz could not attack, he only passively blocked or avoided it.Romdio, who was angry, swung his wooden sword more menacingly, without even thinking about his weak arm muscles.The servants who were watching swallowed dry saliva. The responsible, the new teacher, should stop it there, but he was neglecting his duty and doing something else.Romdio got more irritated as he groaned.\"You bastard! You only know how to avoid it!\"\"What? That, but, I can't attack the Young Master...\"\"Hey! Who told you to attack me? Get hit! Why aren't you getting hit? It's going to end when you get hit!\"Judging by the murdering light in his eyes, Frintz thought that if he got hit, he might die.\"This bastard...that's your true nature. Is it not?\"\"Yo-Young Master.\"At that moment, Romdio's meanness shone.\"Hey! Your little sister over there on the railing!\"\"What? Where......!\"\"Kihehehe! Got you!\"\"Ugh!\"Puck puck! Whoops! Puck puck peck!In the face of low-level schemes, innocent Frintz collapsed.Once he started to get hit, the vicious cycle of being paralyzed by pain and not being able to avoid it was repeated.\"Uh, uh...!\"Despite being beaten at random, Frintz held onto his sword and did not let go. The servants were restless and tried to get the teacher's attention. But the master was still not interested.Instead, another person appeared.\"Kihihihi! Die! Die! Die...!\"\"What rude behavior is this, brother!\"\"Gasp! Bi-Bianca!\"His wooden sword, which slid from Romdio's hand flew off and was nailed to the ground.Right next to Ellet's foot. She carefully placed her hand on Frintz, who was barely breathing with his back curled up.\"Brother, are you okay?\"\"......Oh, Eli?\"\"I'm sorry I'm late.\"\"......\"He was about to ask why she was sorry, but Frintz missed the timing as he was startled by his little sister's voice that seemed to hold back her tearful heart.Around that time, Bianca defended the Rodellaine siblings and faced Romdio together with his swordsmanship master.\"How long are you going to act like a child that knows nothing but being senseless?\"\"W-What I did wrong!? This is swordsmanship training!\"\"Training? Then let's talk with the new swordsmanship master. Is it your educational policy to force the servants in here to suffer violence unilaterally when the hierarchy is already clear?\"\"Ah, Young Lady. Th-This is... to give the young master an interest in swordsmanship...!\"\"It is better not to be interested in swordsmanship that harms people. I will tell my mother about this.\"\"Hey, Bianca!\"\"Ah, Miss!\"Romdio and his swordsmanship teacher grabbed the hem of Bianca's dress.\"Eli, first take Frintz and treat him.\"\"Yes, miss....Brother, can you walk?\"\"Uh huh.\"Frintz's legs trembled but somehow moved. Ellet glared fiercely at Romdio as she passed by him helping Frintz. Romdio, who met her eyes, panicked and then roared.\"Wh-what! It was a fair match! What did I do wrong?!\"\"......\"\"Hey, why did you just leave without saying a word! Hey! Sheeesh, I was going to make you my subordinate, but it's cancelled!\"Ellet ignored his bullshit and walked away from the place with Frintz.\u2720I was angry. It was a level of violence that went beyond what could be called a children's fight.As expected, a crazy fool was a harm to society.\"Ah, Eli.\"\"What?\"\"I, I think I can walk on my own now. I'm very strong, so it doesn't hurt that much... Ouch.\"\"Let's just walk like this, brother.\"\"Yes.......\"\"......\"\"A-aren't you mad at me?\"\"What?\"\"You have been quiet for a while...\"\"... I'm not mad at you.\"So don't bother talking because I think I'm going to cry again while answering.I supported and took Frintz to Dad's lab. It was closer, and the alchemist was considered a healthcare professional no less than any other doctor.But.'Where are you going when brother's sick!'I later found out that my Dad was working outside because the Count's incompetent herbal shop caused another problem.\"Isn't Dad there? I'm glad I didn't have to worry him. Hehe.\"\"......\"Seeing him smiling brightly with an injured face made my stomach boil.\"Wait a minute.\"I immediately started the alchemy on a fury trance. It was not enough to prescribe an effective ointment for Frintz with a completely bruised body.There were also herbs harvested from the dungeon farm, so materials for the potion were sufficient.\"Are you making medicine? I don't like it because it's bitter...\"\"Take medicine and get well soon. Let's not complain, brother.\"\"Yes.......\"With my skills, I can make a regular healing potion as simply as boiling ramen. The flask was filled with liquid at the end of stir-frying, steaming, and squeezing the ingredients without sparing any.[<System> 'Highly concentrated healing potion bitter enough to paralyze the tongue' has been completed.]Refining with too many ingredients had a slight adverse effect.[<System> Congratulations! Awaken Alchemy Lv.8 by achieving the proficiency required for leveling up.

What else is this?'I'll have to feed him the potion first and then take a look at it slowly... No, wait a minute.'Suddenly, the candy glass bottle on Dad's desk caught my eye.I wanted to make him drink after taking some measures instead of just giving the potion to Frintz, who can't eat bitter things.I took out a few candies at an idea that came to my mind in the spur of the moment, and also brought dried herbs that were like weeds rolling around in the lab.The potion was mixed with the purple liquid made by repeatedly distilling in a bath.Pop!\"Eli! Are you okay?!\"\"Cough, cough, it's okay. More than that, it's complete.\"\"Hey, is this medicine? I-It looks a little strange.......\"\"It's the result of my hard work, so don't hesitate to drink.\"\"Awgh!\"The spout of the flask and the weeping Frintz lips touched. I could see that he was holding his breath and chugging it down on one shot for fear of the bitter taste.However, by the time the potion was half-swallowed, the situation changed.\"Huh? This is delicious!\"\"Really?\"\"Yes! It tastes like grapes! It's like juice!\"The original function of the potion was also excellent, as the bruises and swelling disappeared and the wound healed\"Wow, this is a delicious potion, if you sell it, it will sell very well!\"\"Really? With this, I can pay for brother's military academy tuition.\"\"What?\"I grabbed Frintz's hand as he tilted his head.\"Brother, while I was making potions, I thought about it.\"\"Uh, huh?\"\"I think revenge should be done on your own.\"\"......Revenge?\"Frintz glanced at me, startled at the bleak words.But I wasn't looking at his face. More precisely, I was looking at the inverted triangle icon floating above Frintz's head.[<Grand Prize> 'Frintz Rodellaine'Has swordsmanship potential to awaken the Aura.

Something had changed since that day. It was Romdio who felt it most clearly with his body.\"Hey, this punk! Ha-Ha-! Why are you getting better and better at dodging? Ha-Ha-!\"\"Uh, I think I'm the same... Maybe the young master is tired?\"\"Damn it! Don't talk back to me in a relaxed tone! Ha-Ha-!\"The swordsmanship teacher decided to stick to the educational policy but with the condition of strengthening safety measures. The wooden sword battles were carried out continuously.However, Romdio could not be drunk on the illusion of being the strongest knight on the continent as before.It was because, somehow, the teacher always pointed only to Frintz as his opponent.Romdio, full of anger, rushed to Frintz and slashed his wooden sword vertically.As before, Frintz raised his wooden sword lightly and tried to defend himself, and as a result.Whoops!A wooden sword flew out of Romdio's hand, and the pain in his wrist exploded.\"Aww!\"\"Yo-Young Master!\"\"You, you bastard, me, you dare attack me? Uh, how! How can you...!\"\"Sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't attack you, but I didn't expect the sword to bounce off by itself...\"\"What, you punk! What are you saying that now?!\"Romdio's was about to explode when he heard that Frintz just blocked it but it became a counterattack as a result.However, there was not a single lie in Frintz's words.In fact, a message that no one could see came up a while ago.[<System> Congratulations! Achieved Rigid Body Lv.5. Now, clumsy attacks are automatically counterattacked.][<System> Congratulations! You have achieved Wood Swordsmanship Lv.4. Now, you can knock down the Count's asshole like dirty laundry.]'Is it just me? I feel like something has changed in my body.'Even Frintz could feel it slowly.\"Okay, that's it for today!\"The swordsman teacher with short golden hair and a catfish mustache approached and kindly pointed out today's lesson.However, the target was not Romdio.\"Well, young Frintz! You are really improving day by day! I just want you to focus on bending your knees slightly and using your arms rather than your wrists and neck when blocking an attack!\"\"Thanks for the advice, Viscount.\"\"Fufu, I'm the one grateful for. Watching young Frintz grow is my pleasure these days!\"Romdio roared at the heartwarming sight.\"Hey, Viscount Carmel! Whose teacher are you?\"\"Haha, I'm sorry, Young Master. I can't stop looking at a good student who may become a genius of the century and has a good attitude in class.\"The swordsmanship teacher, Viscount Carmel, treated Frintz with kindness, not like the person who had aided in the previous beatings.In fact, he had his own excuses.At that time, he was filled with dissatisfaction as he was forced to take on the education of Romdio Gillette, an inferior student that everyone avoided. Moreover, that was just because he was a vassal of the family.As a result of neglecting it to be done as it should be, something happened.However, thanks to the discovery of a pearl in the mud of the following incident, the soul of a real teacher was now on fire.'I could raise an Aura knight in here! 'As much as he was sorry, Viscount Carmel wanted to do better for Frintz. He whispered to Frintz so that Romdio couldn't hear him.\"Young Frintz, if you get stuck while practicing, you are welcome to come by anytime. My residence is on the 3rd floor of the West Annex. You know?\"\"Viscount, how could I, a servant...\"\"Ah, you're so cold-hearted. When it's just the two of you, you can call me Master.\"With such a talented student, he had to form a priestly bond and get close before another sneaky fellow could take him.Frintz responded politely, blushing the tip of his ears to the kindness pouring out towards him.\"T-T-thank you for your words.\"\"Ho-Ho, it's not empty words.\"Since his young days, Viscount Carmel has been doing well.A time when Gillette made a name for itself as a master swordsman. Viscount Carmel, who was an elite member of the 1st Army of the former Dungeon subjugation unit belonging to County, was famous as a young genius swordsman.Wouldn't it be a great honor to be taught by such a person?'Can I be a knight too?'Frintz pictured himself being appointed as a knight at the Knights Academy, a famous public institution on the continent and took an oath of the sword by himself.For some reason, he felt like he had a dream in his hands.\u2720\"Eli!\"\"Are you here, brother?\"I ground a piece of steak until it became mochi, and greeted him brightly. These days, I was focusing on making herbal medicines.The process of applying food flavors such as steak, pasta, smoked salmon, and blueberry muffins to the highly concentrated potions went smoothly.The first tasting of the experiment was always done by Frintz.Just like taking all kinds of elixirs to increase strength in martial arts, alchemy supplements were essential in this world.Even the untalented Count's crazy fool drank potions as a substitute for water, there's no way she will let Frintz drink nothing.'Thanks to the dungeon farm, herbs were also supplied in big quantitates, so it was good.'For reference, I also drank the herbal medicine whose taste was verified by Frintz test-tasting. I need to take care of myself too, ahem.Today, I presented an experimental piece to him. Frintz reaction as he drank it was as good as usual.\"Wow, this is so delicious!\"\"Really?\"It tastes like tuna kimbap. This is quite a surprise, seems like Korean food is quite acceptable to people in this world.I waited for his cheeks, which had swollen like a squirrel, to subside, and then slid out the pills that I had kept aside.\"Brother, would you like to try this too?\"\"Yes!\"Frintz took it, defenselessly ate it and at the moment he took a bite.\"Woah, woo, gulsp!\"He threw up.\"...Huh, is it that bad?\"\"Ugh! So-sorry, Eli! You made it and I...! I'm really sorry. Sorry......!\"\"Successful.\"\"......What?\"I laughed wickedly.\"Whoa, whoops, I made it to give you that jerk. I especially made it with sparrow dung flavor! It's such a huge success that you can vomit in just one bite!\"\"......\"\"Brother?\"When I turned around, Frintz had eyes full of resentment.\"You're so mean to feed me that.\"\"Ah, brother. Are you upset? But it's good for the body.\"\"......\"\"Brother? Are you there, brother?\"\"......\"Frintz sat back and turned away from me.Oh, my. I guess he's upset.\"I was just joking around. Are you mad, brother?\"\"......\"\"Brother.\"\"......\"It seemed that an apology required not only sincerity but also honesty.\"Ah, I'll give you half of my chocolate milk for the next week! Don't be angry! Huh?\"\"......What?\"Then Frintz glanced at me. The eyes that widened as if surprised were very uncomfortable.I flinched. I was impatient, so I did what I did to my brother when I was young, but I guess I thought it was suspicious because I was doing something that I had originally never done.There was nothing good about being observed so I pretended to be casual.\"What's wrong with you?\"\"Uh, um, that's... I just felt like something came to mind.\"\".......Huh?\"The answer to the question posed to escape the situation was strange.\"No, nothing.\"Since Frintz glossed over it first, I decided not to dig in any further.\"Are you still angry?\"\"I was never angry from the beginning. I was joking too.\"I was relieved by that bright smile. Minor incidents were quickly forgotten, and Frintz and I started chattering losing track of the time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What should I do, honey? I can't believe that mother-in-law is coming all of a sudden! After turning to religion, she had no interest in family affairs.\"That, well, I also don't know why wife.\"\"Maybe it's because of the succession issue? Ah! Then I'm sure she'll be asking me how I raised my kids!\"\"Come on, wife. It went too far. My mother is not like that...\"\"Are you going to take your mom's side in front of me?!\"The Countess was shaking with tension at the announcement of Cattleya Gillette's visit, the terrifying and stern matron of the family.The Vatican.A sanctuary in which the pope, the ruler of the Church, resides, and the supreme political body responsible for the legislative, administrative, and judicial affairs of the Holy Country of ElpenheimHowever, in the depths of this Vatican, there is a slightly distinctive facility.It was an orphanage.The orphans there were specially selected from orphanages all over the country. This is because all of them received stigmata at a young age and awakened their divine power.In the denomination, these children were collectively called 'Sacred Sheep.At first glance, they seemed to be nurtured and raised like flowers in a greenhouse, but in reality, they were undergoing intense combat training.For example, when the children became adults, the place they would belong to was scheduled to be the Heresy Bureau of the Prosecutor's Ministry, the most vicious ministry in the Vatican.From the point of view of pious parents, the Sacred Sheep was like a gifted education institution affiliated with the Vatican.Failing to resist the excitement of parents to test their child's potential, the Vatican even held an event to openly recruit children on certain holidays every year.And a week later that holiday would be held, the 'Sacrifice Day'.\"It's already crowded with people.\"\"Well, how many of them are going to get in? I don't think there's anyone with divine power.\"\"It's weird to awaken it at our age. In the first place, we didn't awaken the normal way... Hey, take this away. Aren't you going to take it away?\"A fuss started as Ephael had his arm on Hestio's head.Thesilid, ignoring the commotion of his roommates, put his right fist to his chest and closed his eyes.Ephael and Hestio stood still.\"What, are you praying?\"\"You want all of them to pass?\"As always, Thesilid brought Hestio and Ephael's attention to him. Hestio said first while wiping his black hair angrily.\"Hey, Thesilid, there's nothing more pointless than praying for a blessing to the public. Not everyone can win the lottery.\"\"Leave it alone. It's all self-satisfaction. How can you pretend to be good with cheap prayers, God is the one who loves it, how happy must it feel?\"Hestio's harsh criticism and sarcastic remark were familiar, but today's Thesilid had an uncharacteristic urge while seeing the children holding their parents' hands.A reply came out without realizing it.\"It's the opposite.\"\"What?\"\"Because I prayed that they would all go away so that they could go back home.\"\"......\"For a moment, there was a somber atmosphere between the three children. Soon Ephael and Hestio were embarrassed and corrected their words.\"What. You. Aren't you a little annoying today?\"\"I know. Did he hit his head hard?\"It was a moment when there was a slight positive change in Thesilid's friendship.But he had to pay the price right away.The stigmata engraved on Thesilid's left wrist warmed up, and a voice that only he could hear rang out.['We evaluate your unclean words and actions according to the discipline of the Seven Virtues and the Seven Sins. It is judged that there are elements corresponding to 'pride' and 'envy' among the Seven Deadly Sins, and the divine power of 'Order and Goodwill' is slightly reduced.]'Hah.....I can't even speak anymore.'It was at the age of twenty that Thesilid awakened his regression ability. But he also had a special ability even when he was but a ten-year-old.The unique ability of Thesilid Argent in this world, 'The Commandments of the Seven Good Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins.'Thanks to this, he was given superior divine power among the stigmata, but there were restrictions that made his life tiring.If he practices humility, benevolence, kindness, patience, purity, temperance, and diligence, the divine power will be strengthened.'Order and Goodwill' was worthy of its name, so it evaluated Thesilid's words and deeds in a cold way.Therefore, he was forced to live a faithful and good life, and as he grew older, he became a pushover free pass who was treated like a doormat.'Until the Aura is awakened... No, even after awakening the Aura...''The Commandments of the Seven Good Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins' was something too powerful, it was almost fraudulent, so he had to give up on living a comfortable life.Moreover, the main enemy of the current Serentra Continent was demons who want to invade using the dungeons as a bridgehead. Divine power is a must-have counter in the war against demonic energy.\"Ha.......\"Unless he throws out his sense of duty, he has no choice.Next to him, Hestio and Ephael had a conversation while looking out the window with their necks stretched long.The tone was more subdued than before.\"How can such weak children come in and help? They would want to go home, scream they miss their mom and whine loudly.\"\"Yes, Hestio, without a home a mom or a dad, we are stuck living in a place like this. Man, this is sad.\"\"But when are we going to go outside the Holy City? Only when we become an adult?\"\"We may not be able to go out forever. One day, there might be a dungeon burst in the Vatican! When it explodes, what would matter?\"\"Hey, Ephael! Are you calling that a joke?\"\"Huh, dear supporter, are you scared?\"Watching the roommates' foolish pranks, Thesilid smiled a little. He did not foresee the fate that would befall them.\u2720As always, the start of the day's work was an early morning prayer.The gods of the Transmigration Bureau, who had been out of contact for a while, were reconnected as soon as they finished the system update safely.After communication, there was a lot to say, so the 53rd quest completion message appeared, but the story continued.\"So, alchemy has reached level 9, and more than 20 kinds of potions and food pills that can be sold right away have been developed. If the business is successful, I will do a lot of good for the cash shop.\"['The world-building God' smiles warmly saying it's a fortunate thing.]\"On the other hand, I wonder if there is any need to work so hard in business. There's an easier way. As it turns out, the best way for people who know the future is to make money from those events.

I couldn't find any herbs used to treat it.\"The main ingredient in the treatment of plague is the roots of Elephantipes.In the original story, it was said to be a weed that grows in the Vatican, but it is not currently distributed.It seems that all sprouts have been pulled out to beautify the scenery, but it is unfortunate that it takes at least three years for Elephantipes to take shape properly.\"I think the best way would be to go there and do it myself with my cultivation ability, but now I have a limited range of action.\"During the tutorial, I can only work inside Count Gillette as a balancing of having the survival difficulty adjusted to F. I tried to leave the area once, but I returned to my original position again.['The world-building God' pondered for a moment and said that it would be enough to save people after the original work started.]\"Yes. There is quite a bit of time before the plague occurs. I can ask for it later when I meet the main character.\"If I show our pushover free pass a little kindness first, it will be easy to request to remove weeds from the Vatican by type.Then, suddenly, an idea popped into my head.\"As for the main character, what is he doing now while I am working so hard?\"This is the tutorial period. This is the point before the start of the original, a terrible infinite regression. In other words, the protagonist has not yet awakened to infinite regression and is only an ordinary child who has no idea that he is destined to have such power.What is the daily life of a young little doormat? I hope he's not the only one who's filming a childcare ropan, right? I'm curious.['The world-building God' implicitly asks if you want to meet the main character.]\"We can't meet anyway. I'm in the middle of a tutorial, so I can't leave here, and he's been locked up in the Vatican, receiving education for the gifted.\"I gave up and started stretching when I heard an unexpected answer.['The world-building God' says that there is a way to get out and come back for a while if you use the power of this god.]I was sober at once.\"Really? Is it okay for the gods to intervene recklessly?\"['The world-building God' says that the principle is true, but there are tricks]\"I see.\"['The world-building God' says that this is not something that just any god can do, but a god who is as good as himself.]I held out my thumbs with both hands.\"Wonderful God, please tell me quickly and in detail.\"['The world-building God' says that you can generate quests by using probabilities.]I listened to the explanation that followed.In a nutshell, it meant that if there was a sufficient probability that I had to go to a place, God could wield public power in private affairs.However, the problem was that it was difficult with normal probability to go to a great place like the Vatican.['The world-building God' says that if you bring any cardinal you know, he will take care of it.]\"...Well, God. You do realize that I transmigrated in a powerless commoner little maid, right?\"How do I make a connection with a cardinal all of a sudden? That's too much.Fine. I'm done.

I'm sorry to startle you, child.\"A middle-aged woman with gray hair showing the years falling like frost, entered the chapel.She wore a long scarlet robe over her shoulders above her white priest's robe, and at a glance anyone could tell that it was a cardinal's attire.In fact, Ellet felt a considerable amount of divine power.Whoa, a real cardinal? It's literally the perfect timing.\"Were you praying in the morning?\"\"Ah yes. I come every morning.\"\"You are a rare and faithful child. And........\"The cardinal's gaze, which stretched out, rested on my head.\"Quite a special one, too.\"For a moment, I instinctively felt a little startled at the feeling that something was being read.Who the hell is this person? Why is she on the Count's manor?\"You seem to be wondering who I am. Since this is the Count's manor, you may call me Matron Gillete.\"\"Ah!\"Matron Gillette. So she is the Countess' mother-in-law and Bianca's grandmother.As an employee of Count Gillette, she has no choice but to hear a lot of stories. The Count's servants remembered Matron Gillette as a strict and faithful master.Strict. Faithful.Those who are described by these heavy words usually had conservative inclinations, so it seems that she was not able to become the mother-in-law to a commoner-born Countess.Still, there were no actual problems.A few years after Bianca's birth, the Matron declared that she would devote herself to religious life and moved to Elpenheim.'I heard she was a devout person, I didn't expect her to be a cardinal.'It seemed that this kind of family relationship became possible because the church allowed marriage.Putting her thoughts aside, she decided to say hello first.\"Greetings to Matron Gillette. I am.......\"\"Ellet Rodellaine.

The direction in which the old eyes were facing was above the head, not straight at the face.It was also a peculiar height that made a gaze feel uncomfortable.At that time, God hinted as far as he could intervene.['The world-building God' observers ' Cattleya Gillette ' with interest.]What? Cattleya Gillette?Cardinal Cattleya?'...Ah, then.'I remembered the name and at the same time, what is the unique ability that she was born with, independent of her divine power.\u2720Religious people who regard hard work and temperance as virtues eat breakfast at dawn.In keeping with Cardinal Cattleya's life pattern, the count's family stumbled upon a breakfast they would not normally eat.Bianca sighed quietly as she returned to her room after the family meal was over.

What happened at breakfast?\"\"No, I'm just having a hard time with my grandma.\"\"Hard time?\"I wonder if this is the top of the food chain because Bianca, who is evaluated as giving people a hard time, is having a hard time with someone else.Come to think of it, Cardinal Cattleya and Bianca have a bit of a similar vibe. Is it a biological inheritance?\"Because Grandma hates me.\"\"Huh?\"I decided to listen quietly for now.\"Because she didn't like mother, who was a commoner, I guess she doesn't like me either. Mother said that when I was a baby, my grandmother wouldn't even look at me. Then she suddenly moved over to the Church.\"\"......\"\"But it's kind of weird. When Brother Romdio was born, he was baptized by grandmother herself, and I had heard that the relationship with mother wasn't all that bad. But why am I...\"\"......\"Bianca tried her best to hide her disappointment and brought out her positive story.\"Still, the family meal today was better than it was three years ago. In the old days, she didn't even look at me, and she didn't talk to me.\"\"Did you talk this time?\"\"Yes. First, she asked what's my relationship with you. First of all, I only replied that we were playmates...\"Bianca's complexion, which she had wanted to brighten for a moment, darkened again. She was worried about whether her grandmother would harm her commoner friend.\"...it will be fine. She's not the kind of person to bother her subordinates, even if she looks cold.\"Albeit Bianca thought she was hated by her grandmother, her blunt remarks defended the person in question.Gosh, she has a lot of complex affections.Then I'll step forward.I placed my hands on Bianca's somber shoulder.\"You know, Bia. Everything you think about the Matron, maybe it's all a misunderstanding.\"\"What do you mean, misunderstanding?\"Then a knock was heard and the butler entered.\"Excuse me, Miss Bianca. The Matron wants to see Ellet Rodellaine.\"\"...Grandma wants to see Eli?\"Bianca's eyes fluttered slightly.\"I will go with you.\"\"I'm sorry. The Matron said that she wants to meet Ellet alone.\"\"......\"By now, the possibility of harm and discrimination must have been blooming in Bianca's mind.I grabbed Bianca's hand.\"Bia, don't worry. And.......\"whisper whisper.Bianca widened her eyes at my whisper. Seeing her rabbit-like red eyes, I smiled.It was a sly smile.\u2720In the Count's manor, the Matron was like a special guest. The Countess and the servants were all on edge to treat her with the utmost respect.This is the case even if the meeting was arranged for a private talk.In the quaint garden, the Countess has set a splendidly handcrafted tea table herself. It's wan unbelievable to think it was all prepared for tea time with a commoner's little maid.'There are a lot of desserts.'In the church, food cravings would be considered a sin, but the table was full of accessories-like pretty desserts. So is it all for me?\"Eat as much as you want.\"\"Oh, yes.\"It was time to take a bite without hesitation.Cardinal Cattleya asked, taking a sip of chamomile tea.\"What is your relationship with Bianca?\"Hmm, quick entry to the point. Not bad.I changed my mind while trying to express our business relationship while being only a playmate.\"It's my friend. A very close one.\"Seeing Cardinal Cattleya's one eyebrow twitch, I brightened up my look like the shining sun itself.\"Bia is the best. Pretty, smart, sweet, and kind! There are no books she hasn't read at the Count, she can memorize all the faces and names of the servants, and it's much better at counting numbers than adults.\"\"......Really?\"\"It's not just that. She saved my older brother while he was being beaten...\"Cardinal Cattleya listened to me with great concentration.When I looked in front of me after my full blast of words, her eyes were full of joy. After all, the truth is hard to hide, and a person like Cardinal Cattleya was even more so.I nudged it.\"I think Bia resembles the Cardinal a lot.\"\"Yes, I've been thinking like that for a long time... Hmmm.\"Cardinal Cattleya, who was unintentionally affirming her true feelings, covered her mouth with a teacup.She came back with a cold expression on her face, but I didn't give in.\"Did you come to see Bia when you visited the Count's Castle this time?\"\"......\"This is the silence of positivity.\"I don't know if I'm being rude, but wouldn't it be better to spend time with Bia rather than me?\"\"Bianca was...I saw that she was unharmed and well.\"It was a meaningful word. Of course, it would sound different to anyone who knew her ability.Let's slowly stab the Matron to the climax.\"Now, there must be no reason to stop being attached to Bia anymore, can't you be nice to her now?\"\"What?\"\"You've seen that Bia's lifespan has changed.\"\"You.......\"Eyes that can see the lifespan that has been lived and the remaining lifespan, Eyesight of Vitality.That's Cattleya Gillette's unique ability, so she habitually looks over her opponent's head, not her opponent's eyes.The reason she said I was special was probably because she knew that the lifespan I had lived was not that of a ten-year-old girl.\"I wondered why you remembered the name of a mere maid. Perhaps it was because Bia and I had the same life expectancy. It must have been that the news of her scheduled death had not been heard, so you made a sudden visit to the Count.\"Cardinal Cattleya did not let it go unnoticed.\"You are really out of the ordinary. So, what is your identity?\"\"If you look over my head, I know you can get a rough guess.\"It's either regression, transmigration, or reincarnation.\"Are you really one of those who came back? So, knowing the future, you were able to twist Bia's fate.\"Of the three possibilities, Cardinal Cattleya took the first.She would have known me as a helpless, ordinary child, and would have thought that to avoid fate, I had to exactly know about the future.She was wrong, but I had no intention of correcting it.It was enough that she understood the situation and lifted her suspicions towards me, and above all, explaining the transmigration was like a rebellion against this world's setting.Sharing secrets is an activity that makes each other closer, so Cardinal Cattleya showed a remorseful expression in front of me.\"I really regret it. If I had known that this would be the case, I would have done the best I could to treat her nicely. I did a terrible thing to my granddaughter.\"Her ability only foretells the time of death.It is not known when, where, or how death will come nor can she intervene in the exchange of life or death.As a bystander, she merely silently accepts the scheduled death.What was the magnitude of the despair she must have felt as soon as she confirmed that a short-lived future hung over her newborn granddaughter's head?She repeatedly tried her best not to give her affection, but it must have been very painful. For a granddaughter that resembles her is very lovely.So she must have been more aloof on purpose, and eventually even left the house.\"Bia now has a normal lifespan. Thank you very much.\"After thinking about it for a moment, she took out the necklace she was wearing and handed it to me. The cross pendant necklace looked like pure gold.\"Take it.\"\"What is this?\"\"It is a keepsake of my close friend. I am giving it as a request to remain good friends with Bia, so please do not refuse.\"\"Oh, yes. thank you!\"As I took it, Cardinal Cattleya bent her eyebrows slightly.\"As a courtesy, I thought you would say no.\"\"Hehehe, you gave it while making a request like that, if I don't get it right away, I think Bia will get hurt.\"\"Hmm?\"It was when Cardinal Cattleya, who felt suspicious, stopped moving while tilting the teacup to her mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since when did you......\"From the beginning. HeheIt wasn't just the quaint scenery that made the Countess choose the outdoors as the teatime location. Her daughter, who had chosen a place that naturally had a lot of cover to provide as a hiding place, recommended it.From now on, it was talk time for the granddaughter and grandmother.\"I didn't know Grandma had such an ability.\"\"...Death-related abilities are not often disclosed because people tend to avoid it.\"\"Is it true that you treated me like that because I was destined to die soon? It's not that you didn't like me?\"\"I'm really sorry. If I got attached to you, I fear I would not be able to stand it later....I couldn't say a word of kindness as a grandmother should nor I could hug you..........I was afraid of the wounds I would receive, so I wounded your young self.\"\"Grandma....\"Watching the misunderstandings clear up, I smiled happily.\"If it's okay, why don't you and this grandmother have tea together?\"\"Yes......!\"Now it really felt like I had to get out of the way. It was the time when I was about to sensibly get up after swallowing the macaron.\"Ellet, thank you very much. I owe you a lot. I don't know how to thank you back.\"\"Ah, you already gave me the necklace earlier as a thank you.\"\"That's a payment for a favor, so it's a separate thing.\"\"It's all right......\"No, wait! This is not the time to reflexively refuse something!'God! 'The world-building God'! Are you here, World-God?!'['The world-building God' rushes over and asked what was going on.]Great. We are set for the private use of public power.\"Well......Then I would like to ask you a small favor.\"\"What is it?\"\"I want to see the Vatican!\"Will it work? Will it? It'll work, right?Cardinal Cattleya answered without hesitation.\"You are a very faithful child. Now is just around the time when children flock to the Vatican to have their sacred test done. It's not a difficult request.\"A message popped up.['The world-building God' admires your skill.][<System> 'The world-building God' consumes the probability and makes a quest for you.][<Quest> A high-grade herb that is misunderstood as a weed (Difficulty: F)\\nGather the herb 'Elephantipes' that grows by eating plenty of divine power in the Vatican.Success Reward: Fresh Elephantipes' Seedlings\\nFailure Penalty: None][<System> Do you want to accept the quest?

I thought she'd tell me how she enjoyed a cozy time with her grandmother.\"This isn't your first time in life, is it?\"Instead, I was openly questioned about my secrets.It was something meant to happen one day because Bianca was a quick-witted friend. Besides, at the tea-table, we talked a lot about this and that.['The Spoiler Inspector' was dispatched after receiving a report of a spoiler alert.]['The Spoiler Inspector' opens his eyes towards you.]A new one appeared.Huff, what should I do? What should I say? As long as I don't rebel against the setting....Then Bianca put her index finger to my lips.\"Shh, don't say anything.\"\"Huh......??\"\"People can't usually say things like this because it's taboo. Just listen comfortably, Eli.\"\".......\"\"I didn't ask my grandmother, but I thought about the conversation between the two of you during the day. Grandmother said Eli was special. She probably said it based on the life span of your life and the remaining life span. Those who have death-related abilities cannot recklessly comment on the future.\"\".......\"\"I guess the length of time Eli has lived is different from your physical age. Somehow, you didn't feel like my age.\"......I'm sorry, Bianca, but it might be a little unique to base it on your mental age.\"Eli is not a disguised demon, you're definitely a human. I looked up books, I found that there were several cases of people with unique lifetime expectancy.\"The meticulousness of going all the way to the library.\"Grandma said that you were 'the one who came back', which means regression, right? But I think differently.\"I gulped down dry saliva.\"It's not about regression, it's about reincarnation. If you had come back and knew the future, your personality wouldn't have let me get involved in the dungeon.\"\"Oh...\"You're really sharp.It's basically transmigration, but it's also true that I was reincarnated.['The Spoiler Inspector' argues that if you make an admiring expression here, it's basically affirming it.]That's none of my business, right? Anyway, I didn't say anything. It's not my fault that Bianca is smart. Ahem.While I was proud that I had a good friend, Bianca grabbed my hand.\"I think I'm very lucky to have a friend who is both an apostle of God and a reincarnate.\"\"Bia...\"\"I'll keep Eli's secret to myself. Don't worry.\"\"Yes, thank you.\"I have a friend who shares many of my secrets except for transmigration. It feels like our friendship was getting stronger.....\"Then how old is Eli?\"\"......That's a secret.\"\"Age doesn't matter between friends.\"\"Well, maybe later.\"\"All right.\"One day, I will tell you from my side, or Bianca will notice first.Either way, it will be a complete secret.Chapter 7. It's Dangerous Outside the House\"Huff, this will be enough luggage for me.\"\"......Eli, are you thinking about not coming back forever?\"\"No, why?\"Currently, I was arranging and checking my luggage for the trip before putting it on my inventory.Basic clothes and toiletries. An over-the-counter medicine and sleeping pills to help when I have trouble adjusting to a foreign place.And lastly, lots of healing potions and plenty of emergency food just in case. It was a great selection.However, it seems that Bianca had a slightly different opinion.\"Aren't you packing potions and emergency food enough to fill a wagon?\"\"You never know what life will be like, Bia.\"The survival difficulty inside the Count's castle was F grade, but the outside world was S grade. What's wrong with being thoroughly prepared?......Of course, there is no possibility of getting caught up in a dungeon burst while on the road, as we will immediately transfer space from the Count's Castle to the Vatican.\"Actually, I wanted to have a bit of a traveling feeling.\"I've never been on a trip like that in my previous life....Only then did Bianca understood my honest reason and took my side.\"If you put it in the satchel bag, it doesn't feel heavy and doesn't rot, right? While you are packing put this in and take it with you.\"\"Oh, macaroons?\"\"Yes. I specially asked Chef Peisha to cook it. They say that the meal given by the Vatican doesn't taste that good, so eat it secretly.\"\"Thank you so much, Bia. I'll make sure to get you a present when I come.\"\"There's no need for a gift, please take care and come back soon.\"Bianca seemed to be disappointed that she would be separated from me for three days.She could have gone together, but starting today, Bianca began to receive training for her successor duties, it was unfortunate timing that she could not leave.This was a change that came after spending a cozy grandmother-granddaughter time.Bianca seemed to have announced in front of Cardinal Cattleya her ambitions to succeed the house and revive the swordsmanship in the family by bringing in a swordmaster as a son-in-law.Excited, Cardinal Cattleya immediately summoned the Count and his wife and gave instructions to attach all kinds of masters and teachers to Bianca.Thanks to this, Romdio, who had never doubted that the next count was to be him, was shocked and shaking.\"It's done.\"I finished the preparations by putting my luggage in the bag, changing into a comfortable dress, and hanging the necklace I received from Cardinal Cattleya. I went out to the main gate with Bianca.\"Eli, you have to be careful. Listen carefully to the Matron.\"\"Don't worry, Dad.\"\"Are you okay with the way back? I don't want you to get lost.\"\"Ah, Brother. We are going to warp all the way, why would I get lost?\"The experience of being seen off by my family was as new as the trip itself.\"Then goodbye everyone! I will be back!\"After having received enough farewells, I approached Cardinal Cattleya.\"Are you ready?\"\"Yes!\"\"Then let's go.\"The light powder that was created as the space transition stone broke, wrapped around the two of us.A white light engulfed my vision. And.[<System> You have entered the Pan-El region, the capital of Elpenheim.

It was because the water droplets splashed from all sides reflected sunlight.I covered my eyes with my hand and looked around.\"Wow!\"A whole new landscape unfolded in front of me.Elegant arches and columns made of snow-white marble, clear fountains that flow like waterfalls along waterways spread everywhere, and dynamic statues of angels and saints.It was an unrealistically beautiful place as if I had fallen into a new world.['The world-building God' is proud that he put effort into the graphics.]To the extent that even the Creator was proud.The sacredness filled itself with the added chant of the pipe organ that was being played somewhere.I raised my head steadily, unable to keep my mouth shut.In front of me was a huge arch carved like an entrance to heaven, waiting for me with dignity and majesty.\"This is......\"\"Yes. It is the sanctuary of the Holy Country of God, the Vatican.\"We finally arrived at the natural habitat of our little doormat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWe quickly entered the Vatican with the authority of Cardinal Cattleya leaving the long queue behind.I thought the line of children who held their parents' hands was long outside, but I could even see children on the inside.This was all due to the educational enthusiasm of the parents of this country to somehow have their children awaken holy power.Because this holiday also serves as the public selection of 'the Sacred Sheep'.It was a pretty deceptive event. In the first place, stigmata did not awaken the divine power in a normal way.How could a child with the same potential as the children who were awakened by transplanting stigmata be naturally born?If that had been the case, the Vatican would have taken notice of them earlier and kidnapped such children.The public selection was nothing more than a show-off holiday event. Promoting the Sacred Sheep while receiving donations from parents at the same time.['The world-building God' sets the mood by saying the stronger the light, the darker the shadows.]Even in this sacred Vatican, the dark circumstances of adults were hidden between walls and doors.As I walked along the corridor with Cardinal Cattleya, I saw children moving in orderly lines.The destination might be either a chapel or a restaurant.Children have to stay for three days and finish a monotonous and boring religious retreat consisting of prayer, food, and worship to get a chance to test their potential.At that time, a young priest from the other side approached me.\"It's Cardinal Cattleya! You are back!\"\"Ah, Brother Pavel.\"\"But the child next to you......Is this the child that your Grace would personally recommend to the Sacred Sheep?\"\"No. I just brought her here because she wanted to see the Vatican. Of course, you can take the test if you want.\"At Cardinal Cattleya's subtle gaze, I desperately shook my head.\"No, no! I'll just take a look and go home.\"I don't want to live while being locked up in this place, forced to lead a puritan life, and treated as a public good to save the world.I was a secular person.Cardinal Cattleya laughed and moved on half-jokingly. The young priest brought up the main point.\"I'm sorry to say this right after you returned home, but I think you should go to the State Council right away. The budget execution meeting for this quarter has been moved forward.\"\"Oh, dear. Child, I'm sorry, but I think I'll have to leave for a long time.\"\"It's all right. Go ahead.\"\"Brother Pavel, I need to ask you a favor. Instead of me, show this child around the Vatican.\"\"Yes! Don't worry and go, your Grace!\"Pavel's answer was truly credible. But when Cardinal Cattleya's back disappeared from view.\"Do you see those kids walking in a row in the hallway? Follow them. I'm busy, so I'm off.\"\".......\"I was left alone dangling in the corridor.Well, maybe he hates taking care of children.After thinking about what to do for a while, I decided to quietly join the children and experience a religious retreat.The line arrived at the restaurant because it was lunchtime.So I sat down in front of the wooden table and looked down at the food I was served.....['The world-building God' is angry over whether a growing child can eat this.]I couldn't agree with you more.A diet consisting of raisin bread, chicken bean soup and blanched vegetables was beyond the poor to the realm of poverty.\"What's this. There is no ham or sausage.\"\"Wow, it doesn't taste good. It's so bland.\"\"So little......I'm hungry.......\"The children grumbled.\"Now, now! We don't talk when we eat, young devotees!\"The nursery priest who was supervising stopped the spread of complaints in the name of teaching table manners. It was really cheap.At that time, the noise in the restaurant suddenly died down.The appearance of a special group of children effectively created a quieter and more refined atmosphere than the shouts of the nursery priest.The newly joined children seemed to be quite distinguished.Unlike ordinary children, who freely wore comfortable clothes, they were wearing white robe-like priestly uniforms. They were all my age, but a considerable amount of divine power emanated from each of them.The identity of the children was clear.'Sacred Sheep.'Elite children who were painstakingly nurtured by the country.'I'm sure he's in there too.'To find the pushover free pass, I thought of the original description.Shining silver hair that symbolizes God's blessings, and eyes that look like a glass bottle containing the light of the heavenly waters.And....Absolutely, very, very handsome! The most handsome man in the setting that can be recognized at a glance!'Yes, he's not here.'First of all, there was no silver hair.Just in case I looked again but the child sitting next to me whispered lowly while eating.\"Don't make eye contact with them. Their personality wasn't very good....\"It was great advice, thanks. And just as they said, the gaze of a black-haired kid staring at me was very fierce.\"Thank you. Eat this.\"I took a lemon madeleine from the satchel and handed it to the child. It was nice to see their brightly blooming face.\"Come on, when you're done eating, go to the chapel. It is time for worship.\"Hearing the loud voice of the nursery priest, I decided.'Let's bail.'I turned on the map, figured out the way, and sneaked out through the back door. Like a scene from a spy movie, I succeeded in escaping out of the restaurant building by clinging to the wall.At the back of the building, there was a flower bed that was relatively neglected.'It's the best place to do a quest.'I walked through the trees, looking for weeds. Thanks to the cultivation package I bought at the Cash Shop the other day, I was able to know the name through 'Plant Insight' just by putting my hand on it.\"This is a simple weed, and that one daisy....Where the hell is it hiding...Ah! found!\"[<Target> 'Elephantipes'Category: HerbsAlthough it is misunderstood as a weed, the tuberous roots that have been grown for about three years can be used as a medicine. It grows in a place with sufficient divine power.]There were several more nearby. I had to breed them, so I dug up all of them and put them in my inventory.I felt like a farmer who finished work. It was at that time that I proudly stretched my back and wiped the sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand.\"Did you come to a treasure hunt by yourself?\"\"Oh my god!\"An unfamiliar voice rang out from nearby. The moment I turned my head in surprise.\"......Huck.\"I was at a loss for words at the sight of my opponent's face.Brilliant silver hair. Eyes that go back and forth between blue and cyan depending on the angle of light. Above all, a handsome face that seems to enlighten the viewer.A handkerchief was held out in front of me, who had lost my mind.\"You wiped your face with your dirty hands.\"\".......\"That was my first meeting with the Pushover Free Pass.'I can't believe the child protagonist that has yet to pass by a time regression is right in front of me....'['The world-building God' urges you to be extra careful with remarks that may affect the original work because you are in front of the original protagonist.]['The Spoiler Inspector' opens his eyes and watches you for spoilers.]My mind was blown.Meanwhile, the sea-blue eyes looking at me narrowed. It was when I thought that he seemed like he was suspecting something.\"What?\"\"Don't be surprised. I have a duty to be kind.\"The Pushover Free Pass, no, Thesilid wiped the dirt from my forehead by hand. It was an expressionless face and a rough hand that really only showed a sense of duty.Of course, I know why.Thesilid's main character buff doubled as a pushover debuff, 'The Seven Good Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins'.He had a lot of restrictions and obligations because his divine powers increased only by getting good points. To put it bluntly, could it be said that the reason for using respectful words to everyone in the original work was because of the 'humility' item of the Seven Virtues?Thesilid, who was not yet humble, muttered a little to himself.\"Why am I the only one who has to take on this duty?\"Why? It's because you have to spread kindness all over the place, regardless of age or gender, so there's room for a harem.By the way, hearing his complaints made me a little confused.'If it's a compulsory thing, won't he get deducted points again?'Because of the lack of sincerity, it becomes like a taboo word, I wonder if it's okay to spill it twice in a roll.Thesilid, who took his handkerchief, said.\"I came here because I felt the energy of the relic, but I didn't know that a child like you could be the owner.\"\"You're a child, too. But what do you mean, holy relics?\"\"You didn't know? Your necklace, that's a relic of Saint Agnes. She is one of the dungeon closing heroes that this Holiday of Sacrifice honors.\"\"Saint, hero?\"......Cardinal Cattleya, what did you say again? You said it was a keepsake of your best friend, but you didn't say that your best friend was a hero-class saint.It wasn't until then that Thesilid's tone became a little questionable.\"Didn't it belong to Cardinal Cattleya?\"\"Don't get me wrong. Because the cardinal gave it to me.\"\"Her relic?\"As soon as he asked back, Thesilid's face narrowed the distance from mine.\"You don't seem to have any divine powers at all....\"As expected, he was indeed the main character, the force of his gaze that looked at me was as if he could see through anything. It was only for a moment, but I was scared and almost flinched...Grumble!......What? I think I just heard a big sound.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I'll have to check with Cardinal Cattleya later. My friends are waiting for me so,.......\"For a moment, a dubious word stuck to my mind.\"Huh?

But, obviously, in the original work, the setting for the childhood friends of the protagonist were....- Among the stigmata caught in the dungeon burst, I was the only survivor. It seems to have started on that day. Every year from then on, The Day of Sacrifice began to take something away from me.Friends. Dungeon Burst. The Sacrifice Day.What do these keywords mean?\"No way......\"\"What's wrong?\"At the moment when a curious question rang in my ears, it came.Thud-!\"......!\"\"......!\"A huge, heavy wave hits the heart directly and at the same time, the feet shake, and the ground cracks.No, that was not it. It's the separation of space itself. I couldn't help but know what this was about.\"Dungeon Burst...!\"The puzzles fit perfectly.The dungeon burst that devastated Thesilid's childhood takes place today, right here!['The world-building God' is puzzled as to why the disaster event is triggered now.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' criticizes the Creator for saying such things.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' shakes his head lightly saying that the S-Rank follower has bad timing.]The accident increased the number of spectators.It was only within the County that the survival difficulty is calibrated to F.Furthermore, it was a dungeon that exterminated everyone to give Thesilid an unhappy childhood setting. I have to be prepared for the level of difficulty.On the other hand, it seems that the scope of the dungeon burst was the entire restaurant building. The interior, visible through the windows near the flowerbed, was a mess.\"Wh-what! Earthquake?\"\"Aww! The floor...!\"\"Whoa! Mom, help me......!\"An unstoppable gravitational force came out of the dark subspace and pulled the children's bodies.And my body too.Whoophhssss!Suddenly, my wrist was held tightly.

Is it possible to clear it?\"Are you okay?\"\"I'm fine. How about you?\"\"Me too.\"I and Thesilid exchanged greetings and looked around. We, along with the other children, were dropped in a reception hall that had a Christmas atmosphere.When nothing happened for a long time, children began to relax their guard.\"Hey, where are we?\"\"It's pretty. It's full of toys.\"\"It's moving. Amazing.\"\"Huh? I wanted that doll!\"When they saw a toy that their parents didn't buy them for Christmas last year, the children's eyes widened.When some children started holding toys as if they belonged to them, even the hesitant children could not overcome their desire.Except for me and Thesilid, the children were busy digging through toys and opening gift boxes.\"Don't touch it! This is inside a dungeon!\"Thesilid cried out.\"Wow! This is fun!\"\"I guess we can take what's here!\"\"Give it up! I picked this doll first!...... Tsk, you tore the arm off!\"If they listened to his words, they were not normal children, and if he was able to solve this with words, he was not our frustrating pushover free pass.In the first place, our pushover is trying to save everyone even in this situation.I stopped Thesilid.\"It's no use. They will understand it's a dungeon only if demons and monsters come out.\"\"I know. I did it out of duty.\"\".......\"Right. Good deeds are business for him, but he keeps saying it's something mandatory.Thesilid asked abruptly.\"Why don't you rush to gifts like they do?\"\"My mental age is much higher than it looks. You can call me sister.\"\"It's weird that you're calm when we're inside this dungeon.\"\"It's not my first time. But it seems your first time in a dungeon since you only lived inside the Vatican. Are you okay?\"\"I am....\"At that moment, the air in the reception hall shook, and at the same time, there was tension on Thesilid's face.It was a white-haired young man who opened a rip in the space and appeared.\"Welcome, children! Welcome to the mansion of Count Orsche!\"Just by looking at the fact that he was wearing a tailcoat, he was a demon in the position of a butler.'Not yet.'The use of Descent should be carefully timed.['The world-building God' advises that the butler will escape by moving through space if you show the power right now.]It means that this dungeon had opponents where I had no choice but to push them into a closed boss room to kill them.The boss room is a realm cut off from any type of interference, even for demons. It's impossible to come in or leave while the battle is in progress.At the appearance of a stranger, the children who had been playing like thunderbolts stopped their actions and focused their attention.\"Haha! Don't be so nervous. You don't have to put the dolls and toys back. Because....\"Pop! Bump!Fireworks exploded behind the butler demon's back.\"You are a very, very special chosen gests! The toys, dolls, sweets, and cakes here, as well as everything in the mansion, were prepared for you.\"\"R-Really? Really?\"\"Then it's okay to have all of these, right?\"Innocent children asked the question with positive feelings.\"Of course. They were prepared according to the master's command to serve you with the utmost respect. I'm Rodrigo, as a butler, I will do everything in my power to treat the special guests with utmost care. In that sense, we have prepared a lot of fun games. Let's have fun with me!\"\"Wow!\"Cute stuffed animals approached and started handing out colorfully painted eggs one by one.\"Easter Egg!\"\"I was hungry!\"Following Christmas, this time it was an imitation of Easter. It was demonic as in having bad taste.\"Did everyone get an egg? So, before we eat, shall we thank the Count for inviting you to his wonderful mansion? Follow along, 'Thank you, Count Orsche'!\"\"Thank you, Count Orsche!\"The hungry children broke the eggshells in an instant.\"Don't eat it!\"Of course, again this time, the eggs were swallowed up in the children's mouths, regardless of Thesilid's dutiful words of advice.The happy butler Rodrigo's eyes bent unusually.\"Count Orsche is a wonderful man. He loves good and innocent children like you. To be more exact...... The soul of a good, pure child!\"\"Kaaaaaaaa!\"Some of the children who ate the eggs fell by grabbing their necks. They vomited white bubbles while convulsing their bodies that quickly exploded and turned into a doll.\"He-hey?!\"While the kids were startled, I checked the debuff in the system status window.[<Status> 'Dollification']A black magic debuff created by Rodrigo to keep human souls in a fresh state while extracting it. When life reaches a critical point in Count Orsche's mansion, they turn into dolls, delaying death. Instead, the body neither dies nor lives until all its soul is removed.Note: Where did all the toys and dolls that were around you come from? Think about it.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Ah, how long has it been since I had this many souls! Well, shall we have a taste?\"Little by little, the souls trickled out from the children who had become dolls. Rodrigo filled the wine glass he was holding and savored the aroma.\"It is sweet. The master will be pleased.\"\"Hu-uh!\"The children feel in confusion, dropping their toys and dolls. Rodrigo declared with a wicked grin.\"Come on! With this, the first game, 'Easter Egg of Random Death' is over. Congratulations to all the children who survived!\"\"Aww! I-It's a demon! Demon!\"\"Th-then, uh, th-this is the dungeon...!\"\"It's sad to see with such frightened eyes. I really like children. Let's have fun together. Yes?\"R-R-Run, run away......!\"\"He-Hey! Th-There is a door!\"The children gathered at the front door leading out of the reception hall. But the door didn't budge. Rodrigo shuddered as he twirled the bundle of keys with his index finger.\"Access to this mansion is under my control as the butler. The entrance was closed long ago, and finding the exit is in vain. Count Orsche's mansion is different from other dungeons.\"What? A dungeon that doesn't generate exits and entrance gates even if you haven't encountered the boss?Is it real or fake? I can't believe this Demon's words.['The world-building God' says it's true.]['The Spoiler Inspector' is startled and takes out a yellow card.]Unlike before, the inspector reacted violently.'Thank you for letting me know, World God.'The fact that the exit and entrance gates do not open, hope is blocked inside and outside. Not only is it impossible to escape from the inside, but it also means that rescue forces cannot come from the outside.In this case, the only way out of the dungeon is to subdue the boss, Count Orsche.\"Th-then we can't we get out of here? Are we all going to die?\"\"M-Mom......Aww!\"As the despairing children began to cry loudly, Rodrigo exclaimed with a blushed face of excitement.\"Then let's start the second game right away! The next game is...... Voila! Hide and seek of death!\"A three-headed clown doll appeared in the air.\"This is an easy game where you just need to run away and hide well from these guys...... what. No one is listening to me. That's why brats that cry so hard are......Oh my! That was a slip of tongue. You are all wonderful! I absolutely love children! It's absolutely tasty!\"\"Whuaaa! He said delicious! I don't want to be eaten!\"\"Mom! Dad!\"\"Help me! Buaaa!\"The noise was terrific as the children raised their voices and wept. Rodrigo covered his ears and took a step back.\"Okay, okay! I'll make you a way back home. Stop it!\"\"Re-really?\"\"Yes, yes. I just have to ask my merciful master. So, let's stop crying and get motivated to play with gusto.\"Rodrigo signed a contract.For demons, contracts are absolute, it was binding under the rules of this world, and for me, it was guaranteed in the form of a quest.[<System> A quest has arrived.][<Quest> Count Orsche's Grace (Difficulty: S)The demonic and merciful owner of the mansion, Count Orsche has opened up another way to escape the dungeon other than defeating the boss, so bow his head and thank him!Requirement: Be the only survivor of the dungeonSuccess Reward: Survival\\nFailure penalty: Death][<System> A quest has been forcibly accepted.]......The sole survivor.\"Let's be the last one to survive! So don't give up hope!\"I see, this was how Little Thesilid was able to survive alone in an S-class dungeon.\"Then we start counting to 20. One, two, twenty!\"\"Kyaaaa!\"\"Ho-How can you count numbers like that!\"Countless Clown dolls approached the children and swung their arms. It was a slow movement and a dull attack. But bloodshed unfolded nonetheless.[<System>] Violation of the Violence Standards for the tutorial has been detected. Reduces mental shock.]Thanks to that, I calmed down and came to my senses. Otherwise, I might have used Descent already.\"Aww! no!\"\"Mo-Mom......hic... ... .\"Some children ran into the hallways or wielded something that could be used as weapons, while others were confused and hardened on the spot.\"Hiccup!\"Puck!\"Calm down, run away or stop it from attacking!\" (Eli)The clown, who was about to attack a girl, was hit by a gift box I had thrown and froze. The girl ran outside the reception hall in a hurry.\"She heard you well and yet ignored everything I said.\"Thesilid with a toy wand as a weapon said bitterly. It seemed that he had rescued some of the children in crisis and returned to my side.I was grateful that a child with power came to me on his own.As expected, the spirit of chivalry is strong, just like a holy knight who will be called the first sword of the Kingdom of God in the distant future.Swallowing my emotions, I picked up a heavy gift box and said:\"Don't be disheartened. Do you think she can really hear me? She just ran away by instinct.\"\"I'm not depressed. More than that, you know what?\"\"What?\"\"You're the only one not being attacked.\"\"......Oh? It's true.\"Clowns were only sneaking around me, in contrast to relentlessly chasing other children. Even Thesilid, which exudes divine power, was no exception, am I the only one?'They must be undead.'The passive skill I had, 'Notoriety that resonates in the underworld' was obviously the main cause of the effect.At the moment the Clown's white face, who was flying around, overlaid with that of a skull, and the moment it attacked the children, a dreadful scythe-like afterimage was revealed by its blunt movement.Intermediate Undead, Grim Reaper. That was the identity of the Clown doll.That's good. Due to the timing, the main character must have just awakened his divine power, and the undead is particularly vulnerable to divine power.Then a thought suddenly came to mind.'Wait a minute? So the reason Thesilid was attached to me was to use me as a shield?'My grateful emotions stopped at once. Meanwhile, Thesilid narrowed his eyes at me.\"As expected, there's less attack because I'm next to you. No way...are the demons not attacking because you're on the same side?\"It is a scary and embarrassing misunderstanding. I immediately pleaded innocence.\"Hey, I'm on your side.\"\".......\"Thesilid's sea-blue eyes widened.\"You're on my side......?\"I raised my right hand as if taking an oath.\"Yes, your side. Really. I swear.\"\"......I see, well. For now, let's just say that's the case.\"With a bitter answer, Thesilid averted his gaze. It seems like he's letting it slide. Even after I said I was on his side, I fell troubled.Now what?Unfortunately, saving everyone like a hero was impossible for me.Since Descent is a fast-paced skill that has no backup plan, it must be used in a decisive battle with the boss. It's no use attacking the butler or making a riot by attacking lesser demons.The owner of this dungeon appeared only after going to the boss room. I guess I'll have to stick with Thesilid as well.Soon, almost all of the children ran into the hallway.The Clowns will keep chasing after them, but it was better than the reception hall that was decorated like a creepy play.\"Oh no! The situation in the West Annex where we are located is the worst. Is it because there's only one stigmata? Even so, I don't think you can use any powers. Oh! Maybe you are the weakest of the stigmata?!\"Thesilid was just not compatible with this many-to-one battle. He was not provoked needlessly.\"It seems there are several hide-and-seek places. I have to join my friends, but the number of Clowns doesn't go down.\"\"Are you using the divine power?\"\"No. Those things look like monster-type, so I'm trying to save it.\"\"Use divine power. It looks like these dolls are disguised with phantom magic, but they are actually intermediate-level undead. You can't see it, but they are holding a scythe, so be careful.\"\"How do you......It's getting harder and harder to figure out your identity. I'll trust you for now.\"Thesilid threw the toy wand to the floor.\"Huh? What is it?\"It was the moment Rodrigo felt an unusual sensation and looked at Thesilid.A white light shone on Thesilid's hands. It seemed he cast a very sacred and powerful skill just by looking at it.Since divine power and magic cannot be omitted from the start-up word in the chanting process, I soon knew the skill name.\"Baptism of condemnation.\"Pussack!The head of the Clown doll, which was held in his grasp, turned to powder. The destructive baptisms continued one after another.\"Oh oh! Now you're showing off your skills! But to no avail! I can make more clowns!\"Thesilid silently killed the creepy Clown dolls.\"The Clowns will fight you until you get tired. Well, then! I have a spectacle in the Southern annex, so I'm out!\"Only me and Thesilid were left in the reception hall. I spoke behind his back.\"I think that's enough time for the kids to run away from the reception hall.\"\"Why didn't you run away?\"\"I'm your shield for n-...Thesilid, back!\"The Clowns scythe was drawn towards the back of Thesilid's head as he looked back at me.At this rate, our little doormat is in danger of being crushed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"......!\"Thesilid's eyes widened at my urgent cry.But in contrast to his startled reaction, he reached out quickly and precisely, without looking back.And he smashed the Clown's head.Swallowing a sigh of relief, I brought up the main point I hadn't talked about before.\"Anyway, this won't end! Let's get out of here.\"It's annoying to play around with demons, but it's best to follow the rules of the dungeon when inside a dungeon.The game in progress is hide and seek so we had to hideI grabbed Thesilid's wrist and started running down the hallway outside the reception hall. There was a Clown doll in the hallway, but it was easy to break through when I took the lead.When the dolls were out of the way to some extent, we came to a place where the doors ran from side to side, like a hallway full of rooms.I picked one random room, went inside, and caught my breath.\"For guests, ha-ha-ha-, the bedroom, ha-ha-ha-, Out of -ha-ha-ha-.\"\"Don't overdo it.\"Thesilid, unlike me, did not show any signs of exhaustion.['The Scales that Judges the Soul' says that you might have an S-class constitution, but makes fun of you because your physical strength seems to be an F-class.]I can't. When I get home, I have to do physical training and buy a job change package to work out right away.I took water out of my bag, drank it, and it calmed down a bit.Meanwhile, Thesilid tried to lock the door, but to no avail. I looked around the bedroom and found a closet.\"There is a lock inside to hold the door in place. Let's hide in here.\"\"That's a good idea.\"The closet was large and we were both 10 years old, so it was enough.In case the dolls open the closet, clothes were pushed to camouflage the side of the door that was not locked.When the closet door closed, the inside was so dark that I couldn't even see my palms. In that state, I held my breath.Creak.The sound of the wooden door opening was heard. Since the footsteps can't be heard, it's a doll.Thesilid was prepared to attack at any moment but I wanted it to pass as quietly as possible.And after a while.\"It's gone.\"\"Whoa....\"At Thesilid's words, I took a deep breath that I had been holding back.\"I don't know if it will come again, so let's keep hiding here.\"\"Yes.\"As soon as Thesilid's brief affirmation fell, I rummaged through my satchel and pulled out a luminous stone. I dimmed the brightness to make it the same as a candle and hung it on a stick. Because I had to do work that required light.\"Let me look at your wound.\"\"There's none.\"\"I saw you injure your shoulder in the fight.\"\"It's a scratch. This isn't even a wound-\"\"Don't pretend to be strong and listen to me.\"After turning Thesilid to the side, I looked through the satchel bag again.\"The bag is small, but so much stuff comes out......Huh? Healing Potion?\"\"I made it. My dad's an alchemist, so I learned from him.\"Thesilid seemed surprised at my ability.There were black marks in the wound on Thesilid's shoulder. As I practiced alchemy, I naturally gained some medical knowledge, so I quickly diagnosed it.\"As you said, the wounds aren't a big deal, but you got poisoned by the undead. If you leave this alone, the wound will rot. Can you detox yourself with divine power?\"Thesilid gave me a troubled expression.\"I can't. Not only me, but all the stigmata are unable to use healing skills even if they awaken divine power.\"There was such a penalty due to the adverse effect of forced awakening. Even a novice who awakened divine power the normal way can do basic healing.That's why Thesilid lamented that there was no healer that could be used around stigmata.If he could heal, he would have healed, deal, and tanked, all by himself. Because the original was aiming for a Munchkin feast from the begging.\\nI comforted Thesilid.\"Don't be discouraged. I knew it, but it was better to ask at least once.\"\"......I wasn't discouraged. And don't ask questions knowingly.\"His pouty face was also cute.\"Un, yes. Don't worry, I have an antidote anyway.\"\"Really......why did you ask.......\"Pretending I didn't hear his grumbling, I took out a detoxification potion and completely cured the poison. The empty bottles were collected, put in the bag, and another thing was taken out.\"Eat this.\"Thesilid's eyes twinkled when he saw the sandwich wrapped in oiled paper and the milk in a glass bottle. He was dragged into a dungeon on the way to the restaurant, he must be very hungry because he even fought a battle.It seems that the likability for me in Thesilid's eyes has risen a bit.\"Can I really eat it?\"\"Yes, you're hungry.\"\"What about you? Let's split it in half.\"\"I ate at a restaurant earlier and there are plenty of other things to eat.\"I took out the macaroons that Bianca had given me. Thesilid was startled.\"That bag is really endless.\"\"Yes. It has a space of a warehouse. It's a dungeon item.\"Thesilid began to eat quietly. After taking the first bite, he was surprised by the taste and tried to eat it sparingly.He only ate tasteless church food, now that he tasted dishes prepared by Chef Peisha's hand-picked apprentice, it was like a new world opened.While we were hiding, I felt as if I had entered a bunker hideout to escape the zombie apocalypse at the end of the century. Actually, I don't think it's a very bad interpretation. In terms of being chased by the undead.It was when half of the sandwich had disappeared into Thesilid's stomach. He, who was diligently following the church's meal etiquette, finally opened his mouth.\"You knew it.\"\"Un? What?\"\"Name.\"\"Oh, my name?\"I thought it was time to finally say my full name.\"No. How did you know my name?\"\"Huh?\"\"You called me earlier. When the crown doll aimed at the back of my head.\"-Thesilid, back!Oh right. I called his name in an emergency.['The Spoiler Inspector' eyes are wide open.]The Inspector seemed nervous because he was afraid that remarks that could cause discord in the seating such as 'I knew because I read in a book.' would come out.Of course, I didn't intend to make such a disrespectful revelation, but I didn't want to pick up lies for excuses.\"Um, is it that important that I know your name?\"\"No. There are many more important issues. Whether it was the fact that you recognized the Clown doll was Grim Reaper, that they didn't attack only you, that you had enough alchemy skills to detect and heal the poison of an intermediate undead, or that you had items that would appear in at least an A-grade dungeon. \"\"So many.\"\"The most important thing remains.\"\"What?\"\"Telling you about the duty of discipline does not diminish my divine power. How come?\"What? Really?Is he saying the rules of the Seven Virtues and the Seven Sins don't work for me?\"It's still like that. Even though I said two taboo words, there was no change in divine power.\"The taboo words here mean 'discipline' and 'duty'.\"But it doesn't mean that my divine power doesn't increase when I do good deeds. It goes up, but doesn't come off.\"Wow. This is awesome.The passive ability, which had the biggest stake in leading the protagonist on the path of the pushover free pass, was an exception for me. To top it out the preceding score of the Seven Good Virtues was applied, and the negative score of the Seven Deadly Sins was exempted.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' suggests that the transmigrator privilege is overbalanced.]['The World-building God' says it's natural because she is an S-class transmigrator.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' chews his lips, saying that he should have made that S-class transmigrator his believer.]It's a convenient situation. Would he be able to eat fewer sweet potatoes in the future?As I weighed his words, Thesilid questioned.\"What the hell are you?\"\"It's a very important secret, so I'm not going to tell anyone. Instead, tell me your secret, and I'll tell mine. Fair Trade. Equivalent exchange. How about it?\"\".......\"The good-natured protagonist did a good job of reverse thinking.He must have realized that he was not in a position to interrogate others, as he was strongly bound to the secrets of 'The Commandments of the Seven Good Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins.'.\"It's hard, isn't it? Everyone has secrets they can't tell, Thesilid.\"\".......\"\"Of course, I understand the feeling of being wary. So, let me make sure of one thing.\"\"What?\"\"I'm really on your side.\"\".......\"Silence returned again. After a while, Thesilid turned to the sandwich in his hand and finished it.\"Well, if I can see that you are fine even wearing a relic, you are not on the side of evil.\"\"Thanks for understanding.\"\"So......what is your name?\"\"Ellet Rodellaine. You can call me Ellet.\"Thesilid hesitated a little before opening his mouth.\"Thank you, Ellet. You healed me and gave me food.\"\"You're welcome.\"As if praising a polite child, I handed a wrapped macaroon. Thesilid kept cringing to show that he was not used to receiving, but it was also cute.After eating, we had a brief strategy meeting.\"Ellet, do you have any more potions?\"\"A lot. Are you going to subdue the boss?\"\"Yes. Because that's the only way to escape from the dungeon. I'm going to join my friends and then pull out the boss, because you're not an awakened for any of the 3 great power is dangerous so.......\"(Note: 3 great powers-> Aura, Magic, Divine Power)\"I will go too. There are many types of potions, so I have to follow you to get what you need.\"\"That's true, but are you okay?\"\"Anyway, if you fail, all the kids here, including me, will die. I'd rather do something than hide and wait for death.\"Thesilid was solemnly silent. He had eyes that saw civilians burning their courage ahead of the decisive battle at the end of the century.No, that's not it, Thesilid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI'm going to carry you guys. Instead, let's take a bus to the front of the boss room.\"Okay. Let's do that.\"\"Thanks. I will do my best not to get in the way.\"As a sign of good luck, I gave Thesilid a fruit whipped cream cupcake.\"......I obviously fell into a dungeon, but how come I'm eating so well? I have never eaten anything like this, not even on a holiday.\"\"Eat well to fight well.\"\"Even if I eat the food you give me, I won't fall into the sin of gluttony.......\"\"Really? Then eat more. This is chocolate tiramisu and peach milk tea!\"\".......\"I appealed to the fact that I also had a digestive potion and fed Thesilid a lot of delicious things.Meanwhile, I opened the system and looked at the map of the mansion. The four annexes, which are divided into east, west, north, and south, are in perfect symmetry with each other.The first floor of each annex consisted of a reception hall, a banquet hall, a kitchen, and guest bedrooms, and a maze-like hallway connected the rooms.'Let's see. To get to the boss room......'Using my privileges as a transmigrator without regret, the contents of the original work were also checked in the integrated library.It was easy to find the part I needed because I had bookmarked it in advance.[Bookmark 473 - Reminiscences of a sweet potato sprout #Mansion of Toys #Childhood #Battle Royale]'Um, according to the original story, the young main character is suffering from poisoning and is still losing his stamina by fighting continually...... As expected, if you planted sweet potatoes, sweet potatoes are bound to grow.'When I was fully aware of the contents, Thesilid, who ate all of the chocolate tiramisu, informed me of an important fact.\"The energy of the Clown dolls has disappeared. I think we can go out.\"It was when I carefully opened the closet door and left.<Ah! Sound test! Ah- Ah-! Can you hear me, children? Hide and seek is over!>Butler Rodrigo's voice came from somewhere.When I looked carefully, a bronze ornament in the shape of a human face adorned in the fireplace had a moving mouth.<Well, let's see the results. Because there are a lot of stigmata, the situation in the east annex is the best. The West Annex, on the other hand, is disastrous. It must have been too much for the weakest silver-haired kid to do by himself. Anyway, congratulations to all the surviving children! Clap clap clap clap clap!>The bronze relief ornament gave a bizarre sneer.\"Let's hear it all before destroying it.\" (Thesilid)\"That's a good idea.\" (Eli)Agreed, I picked up a fire poker and prepared in advance.<In that sense, I prepared dinner! We have prepared sweet treats that will fill your mouth with cavities, so please go to the banquet hall within an hour. Of course, there should not be spoiled children who are late for dinner, right? I believe there won't be, but just in case.... Come on, everyone, take a look at the nearby fireplace!>We already watching, it was clean with no sparks.<Our Count Orsche's mansion boasts a centrally managed chimney with state-of-the-art air conditioning! What this means is that as soon as the banquet begins, Hellfire will pour out through all the fireplaces throughout the mansion! Except for the banquet hall.>Hellfire is a living flame, an atypical monster that burns everything on its path.<So if you don't want to be a cookie in the oven, you have to arrive on time. This is the end of the message! See you later, children!>Pussack!As soon as the bronze ornament shut its mouth, Thesilid crushed it. My fire poker had lost its utility.Thesilid shook his hands and made a serious face.\"What else are you scheming?\"The third game confirmed in the original is 'Playing House of Hallucinations'.Children who put their mouths on a dessert containing hallucinogenic drugs from the demon realm fall into madness and are devastated.\"They will do something with the food. There are still a lot of children who were starving when we feel here, so they won't be able to stand the smell of freshly baked bread. We have to stop it.\"\"Is there a way?\"\"Yes. Let's go.\"Thesilid opened his eyes asking for an explanation.I laughed as I thought of throwing water at the arrogant Butler demon.\"Let's go to the kitchen and make a mess.\"\u2720Ghuooo......thud!A giant teddy bear wearing a chef's hat and a frilled apron fell to the floor. The last monster here, the bear, was the chef.\"You worked hard, Thesilid.\"I and Thesilid walked across the kitchen, stepping on the sprawled dolls. The workbench was lined with icing cookies and cakes in glamorous colors.I cautioned Thesilid again and again.\"You can't eat it.\"\"Thanks to you, I don't want to eat anything because I'm full. The color is also unpleasant, it's like a poisonous mushroom. Is it really poisonous?\"\"It's not poison, it's a hallucinogen. If you eat it, you become a maniac who attacks others.\"\"But how do you know so well?\"\"Secret.\"Thesilid stared at one side of the kitchen with a firm expression. His eyes were stuck in a bucket of cutlery. The knives and forks to be served were very sharply forged.Even if he doesn't have to use great imagination, the future was obvious.\"Ellet, if you leave it like this, the other annexes will be a disaster. We have to go and stop it.\"There was an \u200b\u200bagreement on the goal. But the method was the problem. I pointed to a realistic obstacle.\"We don't have much time left. It would be unreasonable to move to another annex, go inside and sweep the kitchen.\"\".......\"\"This is not the time. We also have to go to the dining hall right now. The butler said that when dinner starts, he releases hellfire everywhere except in the dining room.\"\"Then, since we are going to the dining hall anyway, what about going to the dinner hall in another annex? Even if dinner starts, we can reduce the damage by keeping the children under control until the hallucinations are over.\"Thesilid's heart to save at least one of the remaining three places was sincere. That's why he's the main character, albeit a pushover one.\"Well. The way to the other annex is uncertain. If we have a chef-class gatekeeper like the one we fought in the kitchen here, we can be in danger because of the delay.\"\"Ellet, I won't force you into danger. I'm going alone....\"Sweet potatoes are making the sound of mashed potatoes. He's a little kid who hasn't awakened his ability to return yet.\"By yourself? Do you know the way to another annex?\"\"......\"\"You don't know. You came to the kitchen because I was guiding you.\"\"Map......If you draw......\"\"No paper. I can't do art and I don't want to.\"\".......\"\"Don't even think about doing anything reckless.\"Thesilid succumbed to my iron-wall stubbornness.\"Then......should we just leave it alone? Are you satisfied with the fact that only the dinner in the West Annex was stopped?\"\"No.\"\"What? There's no other way, right?\"\"I've never said we don't.\"At that moment, a twinkling light returned in his sea-blue eyes. I started digging through the satchel.\"We don't have to go and save the children ourselves. In short, we just need to solve the hallucinogens, right?\"A string of herbal baskets that were much bigger than bags was dragged out by my hand. Of course, these were not traveling luggage, they were stored because of the expiration date.\".........You're actually here to smuggle herbs into the kingdom, aren't you? This could fill a full wagon.\"\"I got caught. You took a bribe earlier, so pretend you didn't see it.\"The materials were sufficient, and this mansion-type dungeon boasts state-of-the-art air ventilation equipment.Everything is perfect.\"Let's go play with fire, Thesilid.\"\u2720A special monster lives in the house of Count Orsche, at the garbage incinerator.It was an atypical monster that struggles to sustain fire by finding and burning skulls in a place where only ashes remain. At first glance, it looked like a bonfire and his name was Helverus, a 'Hellfire'.It's been 200 years since Helverus left his warm hometown of Muspelheim and came to Orsche's mansion.In the meantime, he has been in charge of burning his body to incinerate garbage, light a kitchen stove, and heat the mansion.To be honest, working for Count Orsche wasn't a good job. He came here because he thought he would be fed three meals a day of high-quality firewood, but the only thing that was paid as fuel was dead bodies.He even thought he should at least eat firewood once in a few decades.<This contract......if not......I want to go back to my hometown.......>Today like many days, he was crouching with a hungry stomach. After a long time, someone knocked on the garbage incinerator.\"Helverus, when it's time, lit the house on fire. Except for the dining hall.\"The butler of this mansion, Rodrigo. Was a very vicious bastard who only bossed others around.<I'm hungry......no power.......>\"Here you go, eat. It's a corpse.\"The body of an adult who was not worth making into a doll was thrown on the ground.<I'm a vegetarian.......>\"Shut up, you degenerate demon! I'm going to throw you in Niflheim.\"Niflheim was a permafrost town, the complete opposite of his hometown, Muspelheim. He absolutely hated cold places.Helverus trembled and swallowed the corpse. The size of the flame was slightly larger.Rodrigo gave another order before turning around.\"Oh, warm the bathwater too. It's disgusting that those tiny humans came in with outside dust.\"<.......>It is pitiful that he has to prepare even the Butler's, who is not the lord, bathwater.Helverus roared and blasted the embers through the hole in the wall. It was a plumbing hole connected to the bathroom. Now it was time to get to work. After gaining strength by burning all the corpses he crawled towards the largest pipe.The first place he arrived was the dance hall, the only space located in the center of the first floor of the whole mansion.The plumbing of the Count's house is designed to start from here and spread out to each annex to the east, west, north, and south.Whoofss!The soft feel startled Helverus, who slipped out of the fireplace.<Uh, huh? T, is this a special meal?...?>The fireplace, which should normally be empty, was filled with haystacks. Of course, there was no way Rodrigo would have prepared a special meal for him because of his personality, but he was very hungry, so he ate it first before thinking.<So-So good! It's delicious...... !>How long has it been since he last had a vegetarian meal? It was not even cheap weeds, but the smell of healthy luxurious herbal scent was spreading.Helverus roamed all the fireplaces in the dance hall and ate piles of herbs. His body, which was the size of a campfire at first, was as big as a fire dragon's breath and fluttered.Helverus, who had eaten up the entire cart of dried herbs, burped. The smell of medicinal herbs came out black with smoke.<Oh......! Time is already......!>It went back into the fireplace and ran through the pipes like a runaway locomotive, puffing out black smoke. It was so full of energy that it was possible to spread the embers without stopping by the fireplace one by one.Every fireplace connected to the pipe that Helverus passed through, poured out fire like lava. In addition to the pungent herbal smoke.Thanks to this, the scent of detoxifying herbs filled the whole house of Count Orsche.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They sat at the dinner table according to the rules of the game.\"Hestio, aren't you hungry because you were dragged into the dungeon the moment you were about to eat lunch? Come on, ah~\"\"Why don't you clean that up?\"Hestio slashed Ephael's kindness of giving him a hot pink cupcake with a knife and the cake splashed to the floor.\"No, Hestio! Throwing food on the ground, won't you be punished by 'strict order and goodwill'?\"\"Eat by yourself and get a reward.\"\"Ah, I wondered what would happen if I ate it.\"\"A bastard who is more like an enemy than an ally. What kind of dungeon subjugation I'm doing with this guy? As expected, I have to leave this party.......\"Except for the two boys quarreling, the dinner hall was quiet. Nothing has happened since the dolls had served dessert half an hour ago. The fair Butler demon did not appear either.Thanks to this, only the children were sitting in front of the dinner table. The children were generally wary of the food, but they were also hungry, drooling, and crying.Ephael looked at the fork and knife and commented.\"It's sharp. I've got a rough estimate of what they're up to.\"\"It's best not to let other kids eat, but....\"\"If we do, we won't be able to leave this banquet hall forever.\"Because the mean demon will lock the kids here and won't let them go until he gets the show he wants.Although Hestio and Ephael had different personalities, they had similar thoughts.And by that time, there were some children who just run out of patience.\"I can't take it any longer!\"\"Me too! I want to eat too!\"The children picked up the cookies and poured them into their mouths.Desire is contagious. Even the children who had been holding back well, stretched their hands for the dessert while looking around.At some point, the look on the children's eyes changed beyond gluttony, as if they were possessed. One dug up the cake with their hands and whipped cream was all over his forearm, another swallowed so many cookies that it was hard to breathe.Eventually, a fight broke out over food.\"Give it up! I took this first......!\"The children opened their eyes out of focus and began to pick up forks and knives.\"Don't touch the food...It's all mine....\"\"Sa-sausage......I want to eat sausage instead of cake....... Where's the sausage......?\"There was a man, or a demon, who appeared as if waiting for this bizarre atmosphere of madness.\"Ohh! Looks like the game is just about to start In the South Annex!\"Butler Rodrigo appeared. He had freshly bathed and had a moist face flushed from the heat. He seemed like some kind of perverted for some reason.\"Now, the third game is 'Playing House of Hallucinations'! Forks, knives, plates, silver candlesticks, and more! There are a lot of playing house sets, so let's use these to kill people our age!\"Ephael and Hestio stood back to back.Ephael wiped the fork where the cake had been taken before with a napkin and held it vertically in front of his face. Hestio crossed his arms, with one knife in each hand.\"Hestio, blessing please.\"\"When dealing with kids, let's stop using divine power as a fellow human being.\"The children found Ephael and Hestio and approached them. It was a time when they were nervous thinking about the other kids rushing.Whoofs!There was a small explosion in the fireplace. The banquet hall was filled with smoke in an instant.\"Cough! Cough-Kuh-Cof! What! Didn't they clean the chimney properly?!\"Rodrigo had just washed up and was now covered with ashes. In the corner of the fireplace, Helverus looked at him.When the strong smoke and the sound of coughing subsided, the situation in the banquet hall was quite different.\"Ugh, my head hurts......\"\"What......? Why am I on the table and holding my knife upside down......?\"\"Hey, someone stabbed my arm with a fork! Blood!\"\"I-I'm sorry! I thought it was a sausage...Why did I....\"The children came back to their senses one by one.\"I think there's no need to fight anymore.\"\"I know, right?\"Hestio and Ephael bewilderedly lowered their knives and forks.Only Rodrigo ran rampant.\"What! How did this happen! Why is the hallucination gone? Hey, Hellfire! You come here!\"<.......>\"Hey! What is that smoke that you brought with you? What did you eat! Huh?!\"<.......>Helverus reduced his size to as small as a candle. He tried to exercise his right to remain silent, but every time the flame flickered, black smoke flew out.\"It's a detoxifying herb!\"Rodrigo, who was angry to the top of his head, stepped on Helverus recklessly.\"You useless firecracker bastard! Die! Just disappear like this!\"<Ah, oh no! No...! I'm wrong! Please spare me......!>Pshhh!Rodrigo was a fairly high-ranking demon. With a few stomping of his feet, Hellfire, one of the representative monsters of the demon realm, was extinguished in an instant. Only a lump of black charcoal, presumed to be its nucleus, was left in the place.Crack!Rodrigo even stepped on and crushed it.Around the time he was about to sweep his bangs with a refreshing smile as if his anger had been resolved. He wrinkled his face again to see if something unusual had happened elsewhere in the mansion.\"Wait, what is the situation in the West Annex?! Psychedelic desserts weren't even served! Kitchen, kitchen! What are you doing...Hold on, why does the kitchen look like this!\"It sounded like the crackling of his teeth could be heard by miles.Hestio and Ephael whispered.\"The West Annex is where Thesilid is. Do you think he had something to do with the detox?\"\"No way. He's not the kind of guy who can fool people like this.\"\"As expected, right?\"\"Of course.\"They had earlier on defined Thesilid and cider were completely unrelated.(Note: cider in here = a cunning slap backfilled with satisfaction on revenge. But it's usually about satisfaction.)Around that time, something strange happened to Rodrigo.\"How dare......You are making me mad!\"His white hair turned red and flew upwards. It was the true face of a demon.\"......Ha, I was beside myself for a moment without realizing it. This can't be done anymore. I think the difficulty of the game should be raised sharply according to the level of the children.\"His exposed gums and fangs were threatening like those of a wild beast.\"I will skip from the fourth through ninth games and go straight to the tenth game. The name of this game is 'A Spider Lily has bloomed'!\"The children made faces of what is that, but there was no kind explanation.\"Just to your knowledge, this is a traditional game in the history of the demon world. Playing games is all about learning.\"Rodrigo tapped his finger, and black powder fell from the ceiling. The children were terrified and shook their heads.Meanwhile, Rodrigo's fingers clicked again. This time, the banquet hall vibrated and a giant Mole doll appeared through the floor.He looked like a gardener, wearing suspenders jeans, and a checked steamed bun hat.\"The tagger is here, it's the Mole Gardener! Let's proceed right away without a break. Game start!\"<A Flower......has......bloomed...... !>The mole doll leaned against the wall and vaguely recited the game name, then looked back.\"What the hell is this.......Uh, wait! Y-Y-Your head... ... !\"\"My head? What's wrong with my head.......Oh? I can feel something!\"\"Hey, it's sprouting from my head!\"Mole continued to be faithful to the tagger role.<The Flower has......bloomed......!>\"I-It keeps growing! Aww!\"\"What's this! I-I hate it! Mom!\"The black powder were seeds.On the surface of the children's heads, a demonic plant that took root in an instant was sprouting and even flower buds were blooming. The growth rate was different for each.Hestio with a cute green bud on his head looked back at Ephael.\"Ephael, why is there nothing in your head?\"\"Really?\"\"Yes. Because your head is a field of flowers, I thought it would bloom in bunches, but I was surprised.\"\"Thanks for the compliment. Anyway, if there's really nothing in my head....huh? Wait......I can feel something small right now.\"\"What? It's growing up, growing up. The more you pet it with your hand, the bigger it gets? Keep petting it.\"In that state, the two looked at the Mole doll.<Flower......has.......>Plant growth stopped while the Mole doll looked at the wall reciting the tagger's special lines.<Bloomed......!>The moment it looked back, the flower started growing again. However, when Ephael stopped moving his hand, the growth stopped again.Hestio shouted around.\"Don't move! If you move when the Doll looks back, it will grow!\"\"Oh, that's amazing I can't believe you already know the rules! Pretty good for a snooty br-, no, pretty good for a little lamb!\"Children with buds and flowers on their heads stopped moving. The dinner hall went silent in an instant.The only thing that resonated in the stiff air was Rodrigo's excited voice.\"Right now, you have a Spider Lily seed infiltrated into your head. Whenever the tag catches a movement, it will grow quickly, take root, and flowers will bloom. Aren't you looking forward to seeing pretty flowers blooming in your head?\"\"Hi-Hing......!\"\"I-I-I don't like it.......\"\"The Spider Lily is the most loved flower in the underworld. Flowers of various colors bloom, but among them, dark purple is the best. It's a rare color that only comes out once in a thousand years, so I've never actually seen it. However!\"\"Uw-UWahhh!\"\"Hiccup!\"\"You never know. Maybe some of you can grow a dark purple Spider Lily, right? I'll recognize this child's value as a flowerpot and save their life! So, get ready and make pretty flowers bloom!\"No one was tempted. The feeling of the roots tentacles, which gently groped the surface of the head, was terrible. Besides, even if it looks okay right now, as time goes by, the roots of the flower will dig into the head and feed on flesh and body fluids.It was obvious that they would quickly turn into a doll when everything was over.The children struggled not to move and were holding back even crying.\"Oh, I'll let you know in advance in case you have an ignorant but brave friend. If you try to forcefully pull out or cut the flower, the roots will dig deep into the skull in an instant. Be careful.\"Ephael gently retrieved the hand that was holding the fork above the back of Hestio's head.Another plan was needed.\"Hestio, what now?\"\"Why are you asking something obvious? We need to go out of the dungeon and be treated by a cardinal-level healer. Do you want me to tell you how to get out of the dungeon? We just have to subdue the boss.\"\"Hmm, then I'll have to deal with the Mole and the butler first.\"\"Yes, that's right.\"Hestio answered and placed his hand on Ephael's back to give a blessing, that is, to apply a buff.\"Ephael, go and bite!\"\"......Uh, yes.\"Contrary to the shaky reply, the movement was swift.Ephael, holding a fork in his right hand, smashed the floor with his feet. In an instant, the distance between the Mole doll was reduced.<Flower.....has......bloomed...... !>\"......!\"Flinch!Ephael came to an abrupt halt stomping on his brakes. His eyes met the button eye sockets of the mole doll.<.......>\".......\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moved! Grow up, head, head!>\"Hey, don't yell that at my head!\"<Said again! Grow up!>The flower buds on Ephael's head became as plump as about to bloom. His Spier Lily was a violet color the same as his eyes.\"Ah, that blonde kid is a bummer. As expected, I thought stigmata wouldn't be a good flowerpot.\"Rodrigo sat cross-legged in his chair, watching the show.\"Oh, forget it! Just die!\"Ephael ignored the growth of the flower and ran towards the mole doll.Gugugugu!The fork loaded with divine power was blocked by the Mole doll's sharp claws.Contrary to its dull appearance, its front paws were as fast as Ephael's attacks. As he was prioritizing evasion, it was not easy to get the timing right and deliver a powerful blow.\"Oh, that's annoying.\"It was time for Ephael to step back and catch a breath.<Priority......change......!>The Mole's buttonhole eyes turned to the other side. It was Hestio.The doll plundered at high speed and rushed to Hestio.\"Hic! Hey, punk! Why are you attacking me! I didn't hit you at all!\"\"Oh-oh! All right, Hestio! Block it with your body to buy time!\"\"Hey, fight properly!\"\"I'm sorry. I'm not a tanker, I'm a dealer.\"(Note: I mistook Ephael's role. He's the damage dealer, Thesilid might be the Tanker.)The minimum number of a dungeon subjugation team is 4 people and consists of a tank, a dealer, a supporter, and a healer. In a situation where the tank cannot do its job, the healer is the first priority target, and the second priority target is the supporter.As long as the buff was given, it was natural for the attack to concentrate on Hestio.\"Oh, dear. Wasn't the Vatican's final weapon the Sacred Sheeps? Why can't you use the power at all? Such a disappointment.\"Hestio and Ephael shuddered at the bitter ridicule.It was their first dungeon. They were embarrassed in many ways to suddenly engage in a real battle after fighting only with training-bred monsters until now.Besides, the Mole doll in front of them was a middle boss of an S-class dungeon. It's equivalent to the boss of a B-class dungeon, so normally a raid of 6 or more people will have to deal with it.Hestio, driven to a dead end, blocked the Mole doll's front claws with a knife.\"Hey, Ephael. I really didn't want to say this.......\"\"Is that a will?\"\"Hey, shut up.\"\"Sorry. Tell me.\"\"I miss Thesilid.\"\"That's a will, all right. I will pass it to him.\"\"Shut up and fork hard!\"Rodrigo blew out a hateful cheer.\"Still, you guys are doing pretty well. The East Annex and the North Annex little lambs have already been wiped out. But here, with only one dealer and one supporter, you are still alive. That's great!\"\"......!\"Hestio and Ephael were startled.Annihilation of the stigmata in the east and north? So what about the west? Is the West annex where Thesilid was?\"Try your best. Well, it looks like you'll be following your friends soon.......\"It was the moment when the devil spoke like a viper.Kwagwag-wang!The huge door of the dinner hall shattered and forks and knives flooded in. The Mole doll quickly moved away from Hestio.\"What!\"Rodrigo jumped up from his chair. It was also up to the butler to welcome the intruder, but he was astonished to find Thesilid in the doorway.\"Yo-you silver-haired lamb......! This is not the West Annex, why are you here?! How did you get over here in such a short time!\"Rodrigo's contribution to removing the body of Hellfire was very important.\"Hestio, Ephael, are you alive?\"Thesilid, with a golden flower on his head, ignored Rodrigo and sought out his friends. The intruder was not alone. Behind his back, a pink-haired girl poked her head out.\"Introduce me to your friends, Thesilid.\"\"......!\"Rodrigo's eyes widened to the limit when he saw Ellet.A plump flower bud was saw on the top of her light-pink head.The color of the petals, which showed off their presence by particularly scattering demonic energy, was dark purple.\u2720For some reason, it feels like the eyes of everyone were more focused on me than Thesilid armed with the main character's buff.The butler, who had exposed his gums towards Thesilid a while ago, turned his eyes toward me.\"Unbelievable! Dark purple! Is it really dark purple? I can't believe I'm the one who bloomed that precious dark purple! Maybe I have talent as a gardener?!\"The demon was talking nonsense thinking that I'm a flowerpot in his house.It was an opportunity when Rodrigo was so moved that he lost awareness of everything else. Thesilid claimed the Mole doll's attention on him and dragged it towards the side of the hall that had no children to deal with it.I approached the wounded stigmata. It was easy to recognize thanks to the white uniform.Let's see. Black hair is Hestio, and blonde hair is Ephael.\"Hello, you are Thesilid friends, right? My name is Ellet.\"I wanted to make a good first impression, but their expressions were wrinkled.\"Who is his friend?\"\"Did he say that with his mouth? Friends?\"It seems to be an important issue to be addressed even in this situation. Then I must be serious, too.\"You aren't friends? Then you don't need to heal your wounds?\"I asked while waving the healing potion.\"He's my friend.\"\"That's right, my friend.\"Their attitude was very flexible. They must have been friends that Thesilid needed.Thud!<Ke-e-eek.......>The Mole doll foamed from its mouth and collapsed. Following the West annex, Thesilid killed the mole in the South annex.Even among the Stigmata, who were preciously raised in the Vatican, he was a protagonist.The Doll fell, but Rodrigo didn't even care because his only interest was the flower in my hair.\"Whoa, dark purple.......dark purple petals......! This is the best! If I decorate my office with that flowerpot......Hold on. Should I go to the dark auction house of the magic world? Or should I offer a bribe to one of the three great kings? Ufufufufufufu.......\"Rodrigo, who had been struggling with vain dreams, spoke to me.\"Cute little pink-haired girl over there, what's your name?\"\"Did you invite without knowing the guest's name? The butler is disqualified.\"\"Ah! Even with this Rodrigo in front of him, she has a bold personality! I'm starting to like not only the flower, but also flowerpot!\"Rodrigo's eyes widened.\"But if you're a lady, you'd better answer a gentleman's question politely. Otherwise, I'll pop the heads of these kids one by one until an answer comes out of that cute mouth......!\"\"Ellet Rodellaine.\"\"Very good, Miss Ellet. Fufu....\"Ephael and Hestio looked angry as if they saw my quick change of tone as a surrender.\"Miss Ellet, I quite like you, so let me give you a special choice. Why don't you go with this Brother Butler?\"\"What happens if I go?\"\"After being changed into my favorite gothic Lolita dress, you will have the honor of saluting the great Count Orsche! Don't ask what happens next, because I haven't decided yet whether to hand you over to the auction house or give it to the Demon King.\"After pretending to think for a moment, I answered.\"That's a pretty attractive suggestion.\"\"What?\"\"Hey! Are you crazy?\"Ephael and Hestio, who were next to me, made faces that looked like their eyes would pop out. Thesilid was far away so I couldn't see his face, but I looked at Rodrigo, ignoring the reaction around me.\"Right? Right? Little Ellet, you also think so, don't you?\"\"Yes.\"\"As expected, a lady's choice is wise. Well then, come over here and hold this butler's hand... ....\"\"Instead, there are conditions. Release all the kids here.\"\"What? Well, that's a bit... ... .\"\"You can't? Why can't you do that for a lady like me? Were you disqualified not only as a Butler but also as a gentleman?\"\".......\"Rodrigo who had his pride wounded, trembled.All right. If I scratch it a little more, I think I'll succeed. All the kids here get out of the dungeon, and I go straight to the boss room. Wouldn't this be killing two birds with one stone?['The World-building God' notices your strategy and claps for your performance.]\"Can you or can't you? Come on.\"\"Fi-Fine! Instead, sign this contract that means you will do anything I ask in the future......\"It was then.Shik.A knife loaded with divine power flew and tore Rodrigo's contract and at the same time, my body was pulled back.\"Don't be ridiculous. I will never let this kid go.\"......Ah.This ambush wasn't part of my plans.Thesilid, the righteous pushover, hid me behind his back, making the whites of Rodrigo's eyes turn red with anger.\"You rude silver-haired bastard! I cannot forgive you for ripping my sacred contract!\"\".......\"\"I have to set a good example for stigmata and other naughty brats. It's enough to keep only the pink flowerpot alive!\"Oh, the plan is a failure.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' says that boarding the express bus to the Boss room seems to be out of the question.]I think so, too, Mr. Balancer.As originally planned, we had no choice but to take the regular bus operated by Thesilid and his friends.Rodrigo flew up to the ceiling.\"Just wait, children. I'll find out the price of my rare flower and come and play again! Until then, I'll send you the Grim Reaper, so you can just play hide and seek!\"He greeted me separately.\"Pretty flowerpot lady, I will prepare a dress and go pick you up. Goodbye for a little while!\"With a wink at the end, Rodrigo disappeared, and a Clown doll popped up.\"Hey! It's that doll from before!\"The children hurriedly scattered away to hide. Only me, Thesilid, Ephael, and Hestio did not move from the banquet hall.Hestio came up to me, dryly striking the Clown doll.\"Hey, did you say your name is Ellet?\"\"That's right.\"\"I see, Ellet. I'm afraid you are somewhat following along Thesilid steps and doing the same thing....Agh! Hey, why are you pushing people?!\"Thesilid cleared Hestio. But it didn't seem like the purpose was to save me from nagging.\"......\"\"......\"Thesilid stared at me without a word.['The World-building God' grumbles about as to why the little man is suddenly setting the mood.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' likes the little boy's angry face because he's handsome.]It was. Thesilid had an expressionless look as if holding back his anger.\"Were you thinking of sacrificing yourself?\"No, I was planning on riding the express bus by myself.Thesilid came a little closer to me, while I was exercising my rights to remain silent.\"You know what happens when you get dragged away by a demon? Demons are not called the devil for nothing. You'd rather die than suffer forever. How dare you make such an offer to the demon?\"It was then that his calm tone began to waver.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You are not a saint, and you are not something special. There's no reason why you should sacrifice yourself for someone you don't know.\"\"......\"I was scolded by a ten-year-old.['The World-building God' says the guy can't even use the return ability yet and still thinks he's special enough to look down on an S-Ranked Transmigrator.]['The Troubled Skyscraper Architect' says that he seems to be talking nonsense while the discipline limit of his buff is exempted.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' feels that the weak mentality of the other gods, who comment on strange and nonsense things, was pathetic.]['The Spoiler Inspector' grumbles that there is an error in the main character's setting of ethical values.]The Inspector's message brought me to my senses.Only then did I realize why I was so embarrassed that I couldn't say a word.Thesilid just violated 'Humility' and 'Kindness', committed 'Anger', and denied the spirit of sacrifice that is equivalent to 'Charity'.(Note: I looked up, and the right name is Seven Holy Virtues, I will fix the title later.)It was an unimaginable violation of the rules for the usual Thesilid, but it was possible against me because of my privileges as a transmigrator.'It's not always good to be exempt from rules.'Thesilid's confession of his true feelings had a great ripple effect on Ephael and Hestio.\"Hey, Hestio. Did you hear that? Why is he speaking common sense out of nowhere?\"\"I know. I'm feeling chills right now.\"What is this reaction?It's like I'm the one in charge of the pushover role!I felt the need to fix the mood quickly.\"Okay. It's my fault. I won't do that again, so please relax your face.\"\"......Yes. Sorry for being angry.\"Now that the conversation was over, it was time to reorganize. I looked at the Grim Reapers flying around and suggested.\"Let's go to a safe place.\"I didn't forget to loot instead of Thesilid, who doesn't care about trophies and rewards.I took by-products from the fallen Mole doll and saw something shiny in the fireplace, so I shoved it into my inventory.After searching for a suitable place, we entered a guest bedroom. This time, instead of hiding in the closet, we moved the furniture and closed the door.With the four of us sitting around in a circle, we decided to have a proper introduction time. Thesilid stepped out.\"I will introduce you. This is Ellet. She can do alchemy and she has many potions. And this is Hestio and Ephael. You can tell by looking at the clothes, they're also Stigmata.\"\"Nice to meet you both, Thesilid friends.\"Ephael and Hestio's expressions wrinkled again. This time, it seemed that they were going to ask the person directly.\"Hey, Thesilid. Did you really say that we were friends with your own mouth?\"\"That.......\"Why are you hurting our little doormat?It was then.Gurgling. Gurgling.The sound came from two different places with a little lag in between, making it offbeat.\"You're not friends? Then we don't have to share delicious food, do we?\"I took out a delicious sandwich and held it.\"We are friends. That's right, friends.\"\"He's my best friend. Best friend.\"\"Really? If you're his best friend, I'll give you another one. Eat a lot, Ephael.\"\"Oh, yeah!\"When I gave one more to Ephael, Hestio made an angry and sad face.I can't be cheap with food, and with appropriate reason, I also took one more out for Hestio.\"Be good friends with Thesilid in the future.\"\"Okay. Rather, it is delicious.\"\"Would you like more?\"\"Y-Yes!\"In addition, with the warm heart of a parent who takes care of their children, I brought out drinks and other types of food.Thesilid watched the scene with a slightly strange look.During the time to recharge our stamina, we talked a lot.Topics went from my subspace inventory, which was as mysterious as the stomach capacity of growing children, and how to detoxify children who took hallucinogens.\"You said you carried a wagon of detoxifying herbs? How big is that bag? Buy me that, Hestio!\"\"Shut up. Anyway, I knew it wasn't Thesilid's plan. He doesn't have the brains to do that.\"\".......\"After we finished talking about Thesilid, we had a meeting.\"What shall we do now?\"\"We have to subdue the dungeon owner.\"To Hestio's question, Thesilid answered firmly. Ephael sighed and said.\"I wandered around the inside of the mansion while we were playing hide and seek, but I didn't see any exit gates. After all, it seems true that the gate is controlled even before the boss battle takes place. External help is not an option.\"Hestio also helped share information.\"Thesilid, you may be aware of this, but the stigmata in the East and North annexes were annihilated. I heard it from the Butler Demon.\"\"Then we are the only ones left.\"The atmosphere became somber. The outlook was negative when we looked at the odds of whether we could subdue an S-class dungeon with just four children.I pointed out the positive points.\"The combination is not bad.\"Unlike the original, there is also an alchemist. My capability may be low in middle battle, but I'm quite a healer.\"And I also know the way.\"Actually, we don't need to do anything else, we just have to hype up and go to the front of the boss room. Isn't it?Perhaps my words had little encouragement power, for they had no effect on the renewal of the mood.This time, Ephael stepped up.\"Ah, I'm not cut out for stuff like this. Why don't we just pray for the best?\"\"What are you talking about all of a sudden?\"\"You never know. Maybe \"strict order and goodwill\" will grant a miracle? Just like the last time, we might get lucky and the Descent might come.\"\"Descent?\"When I asked back in surprise, Thesilid explained.\"Not long ago, a Descent of Divinity was sensed from the direction of the Kingdom of Vinchester. A new Saint has been born, so the church is looking for it.\"\".......\"Oh, this is probably.......['The World-building God' is proud to say that the reputation of its first devotee has already spread to neighboring countries.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' asks if, from their point of view, it might become heresy instead.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' says it's fake that they are looking for a Saint, and it's doubtful whether they actually dispatched a heretical judge instead.]['The World-building God' shouts around asking who is heretical, arguing that those people are the ones that serve a god who already left home.]As expected, it's about me. I asked carefully.\"What does the Church wants by finding that person?\"\"Since it is a principle for those who awaken the Holy Spirit to obey the Church, they will be appointed as Saint or Saintess and then bear the responsibilities and duties accordingly.\"It meant that I was going to donate my talent for the rest of my life. I did not want to eat the Vatican's meal ever again, so I decided not to use Descent of Divinity in front of others.Of all things, a Saintess.I glanced at Thesilid.\"Hm.......\"\"......Why are you looking at me like that?\"-No one asked you to be a hero. You are not a Saint, and you are not something special. There's no reason why you should sacrifice yourself for someone you don't know.The words that he told me earlier about me not being a Saint were past the expiration date.\"Nothing.\"\".......\"Ephael picked his tempo again.\"Anyway, Plan A is subjugation. If that doesn't work, well, then we go ahead and move on to plan B.\"\"What is Plan B?\"\"You also know it, Hestio. Kill them all and be the last one alive.\"Ephael's tone was playful, but those were not words that should be disregarded.I jumped up before the atmosphere subsided again.\"If you're done resting, let's go to the boss room before the flowers grow any further.\"The flower on our heads could not be solved with a potion.After getting rid of the Mole doll, the growth rate slowed down, but as time passed, it was obvious that the negative impact on the body grew.\"Okay, let's go.\"The three stigmata stood up with wretched faces.\u27203rd floor of Count Orsche's mansion.After defeating four mid-bosses, we arrived in front of the Boss room at the end of the corridor.\"Are you ready?

Don't do anything that catches the Boss's attention.\"Hestio took great care of me.\"Yes, don't worry, I will avoid you because you are the number one target for attack.\"\".......\"Thesilid, who played the role of opening the door like a dutiful tanker, said something as if trying to reassure me.\"As long as there is a dark purple flower on your head, he will not attack you.

There sat a middle-aged gentleman with an oval body.\"You finally came. I was waiting for you.\"It was a bonafide last-boss line indeed.At the gloominess of omitting self-introductions, the three stigmata sheep flinched as if they were intimidated.For me, the system introduced a middle-aged gentleman, but....[<System> The owner of the dungeon, 'Count Orshu \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588' appeared above \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588.]What are those blinds? Is the system broken?'World God, are you there? Why is it like this?'There was no answer. Did he intuit about bug rewards he would have to give and go into hiding? Around the time my doubt started rising.\"Let's go.\"\"Yeah!\"\"Bite it, Ephael!\"While I was distracted by a system error, the three of them rushed in.\"Wait, guys! Now I.......what? They are fighting quite well, aren't they?\"At first glance, the aspect of the battle seemed to be the three pushing the Boss back. Count Orsche was only large in size, but his movements were slow and there were many gaps.A fight in which they have the advantage. It was completely different from the original.'Is it because I helped the three get in peak condition with potions and food?'It was strange to think that way and to be proud of it, because...'For an S-class dungeon, the Boss was too weak.'After experiencing a few battles, my eyes developed quite a bit.The Boss was slightly better than the Bears and Moles mid-boss we defeated today. Of course, he wasn't fighting properly, but I felt it was fundamentally not good enough to compare with Ardiman, who was an A-class dungeon boss.Suddenly, an odd thing popped into my mind.The entrance gate has been controlled from the moment we got into the mansion. What did that mean?'No way......!'Kugugung!The heavy body of the egg gentleman fell to the floor and the expected congratulatory message of subjugation did not appear, of course.\"We did it......!\"\"Hestio!\"As soon as I screamed his name, he instinctively retreated. A few strands of his black hair were cut off with a fraction of difference.Krawnggg!The place where Hestio had been until a while ago was completely sunk. As expected, they would attack the supporter first.\"Wh-what! Where is it!\"\"It's not the time to look around! Everyone gather!\"The obedient children came back after hearing my shout. Thesilid looked around wary of our surroundings and asked.\"What the hell happened?\"I opened my mouth and stared into the air.\"Yeah, it was weird from the start. Why didn't we get a gate when we just entered the dungeon? If you think about it, it's quite simple. Because we've already met the Boss. Come out now!\"The answer came back.\"......Oh, my lady.

What if the main character with a strong sense of responsibility and mission says, 'Because you are a saint, you have to serve humanity!'?As a matter of fact, when I tried to negotiate with Rodrigo, he gave a passionate speech not to sacrifice myself because I'm a civilian. But, on the other hand, wouldn't he change his attitude towards an opponent with special powers?Just then, Thesilid answered with a serious face.\"Okay.\"\"Well, I thought so......what, you won't tell?!

There were expectations that it might be possible to identify the apostle this time around.However, none of the survivors rescued through the closing gate had the divine power to cast Descent of Divinity.In the end, the Cardinal Council concluded that the apostle of Descent of Divinity went inside the dungeon only to subdue the boss and suddenly disappeared after the job was done.This was largely thanks to the fact that the silver-haired boy who had faced the boss until the last standing stigmata, testified that when he came to his senses, the boss had already been subjugated.The silver-haired child was the ace among the stigmata, and because he was considered a guardian of the doctrine, no one could have imagined that he would lie.The inside of the Vatican was crowded with parents trying to retrieve the surviving children.The Cardinal Council mobilized healers to undo the children's doll debuff, heal their wounds, remove any remaining Spider Lilies from their heads, and return them to their parents as soon as they were identified.The only exception was the pink-haired girl that Thesilid had carried and rescued from the dungeon.Ellet was unconscious with a seeping fever all over her body.The healers judged that she was suffering from the shock of falling into a dungeon burst and gave her an isolated room.Diseases caused by problems with the body's immunity or mental health were not a specialty of healers, so there was no further action. They didn't even call a doctor or an alchemist. Because the Vatican's beliefs of authority rejected other forms of medicine.Cardinal Cattleya was not able to look after Ellet often because she was busy with the post-processing of the disaster. Since Ellet's family was in the kingdom, not in the Holy Country, it would take a long time for news of her to arrive so they can come to pick her up.Fortunately, there was someone who stood by Ellet's side at a time when she was almost left neglected.It was Thesilid.Thesilid worriedly looked at her and placed his hand on Ellet's forehead.\"Is this the God's fever I've only heard of......\"He heard that God's fever had no after-effects, but he couldn't just watch it and do nothing.Thesilid put the ice pack on Ellet's forehead, rummaged through her satchel bag, and fed what appeared to be a potion for fever.As expected, nothing worked. Ellet radiated charcoal-like heat all over her body, exhaling with difficulty, one breath at a time.His sea-blue eyes sank, unlike his usual reactions.\"Giving an ability that comes at a price like this....is very much like 'Strict Order and Goodwill'.\"His self-talk made an uproar in another dimensional unknown to him.['The World-building God' is shocked by the harsh curse words.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' laughs because he is a handsome boy who speaks well.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' says it's a good thing that she doesn't have to worry about being framed as a heretic.]Thesilid was still looking at Ellet with gloomy eyes.\"It would be better for the Vatican to never know.

Without me, everyone would have been annihilated except for him.\"According to the original story, Thesilid would have been the only survivor with a major trauma because of Ephael's plan B.However, such a crazy battle royale did not happen, and Hestio as well as Ephael were unharmed.'Then what happens to the original after the tutorial is over?'Around the time when doubts started to rise.['The Spoiler Inspector' blames you for twisting the original.]Yes, I thought you were coming.['The World-building God' gets annoyed that the lame nagging about the original is starting again.]['The Spoiler Inspector' bursts out in agony because it's the first time a transmigrator has made such a large error during the tutorial period.]['The World-building God' teases to watch a lot because it seems like it's the first time seeing an S-class transmigrator.]['The Spoiler Inspector' opens his eyes in defiance.]['The World-building God' stares back in boldness.]I thought they would call quits with the staredown, but soon after, World God got angry and fired messages one after another like a rapid-fire cannon.['The World-building God' criticizes the 'The Spoiler Inspector' to quit working on the transmigration project if he's going to keep coming out like that.]['The World-building God' says that if they wanted to only reproduce the original, they would read the original instead of bothering to re-dimension it.]['The World-building God' shouts that they don't want to see a puppet show, but want to see the souls of all living things carve out their own destiny!]Wow, carving their own destiny.I shut my mouth at the wonderful verse that touched my heart.'Oh my God. How come the World God only says the right things? After all, it is not for nothing that 'word' was included in the name of the God!'(Note: This God has \uc5b8(word) in its name. This is a pun.)['The World-building God' is proud of the praise of his first believer, ahem, ahem.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' rolls her eyes and says the believer is seeing this god with rose-colored glasses.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' admires your social skills.]The inspector was quiet. It was clear that he had agreed to the perfect logic of the World God.The fight ended, but my question was still unresolved.After the tutorial, the original work begins. And the beginning of the original is also the starting point of regression. As soon as the original story begins, this world will have a branching timeline from episode 1st to episode 100th.Out of all those hundred options, I finish my tutorial by falling on the 17th timeline.'Yes, episode 17. The episode where the main character dies in vain at the hands of the final boss.......'Let's not think about losing motivation for now.Anyway, back to the story, the tutorial is commonplace to all timelines, but there are a whopping 100 episodes diverged from the original starting point. If so, what is the status of the main character, which I changed during the tutorial, reflected in the original work?Is it only reflected in episode 17? If not....'World God, will the flow I change during the tutorial change the entire original work?'The answer was heavy.['The World-building God' answers yes.]Startled, I asked again.'You say everything changes from episode 1st to episode 100th? All of them?'['The World-building God' says that in all episodes from episode 1st to 100th, the main character's friends will be alive, and the skills the main character has shared with you will be applied.]If you listen up to this point, you can say that it is good that the growth environment of the main character has been improved.But if I'm right....'There are exceptions, right?'['The World-building God' says yes for that, too.]This is where the important part comes in. I waited quietly for an explanation.['The World-building God' says your soul is the exception. Because it comes from outside of the world of regression, it's not copied for all other episodes.]'That means.......'['The World-building God' says that you are a unique existence that only lives in Episode 17.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In other words, the protagonist will always remember me while no one else will.(Note: If you came until here, and are still confused, just think that 'axis of regression' works as a backup. Terry has a backup for every death. So he remembers everything from the previous timeline while living on the next timeline.)But I couldn't feel any positive emotions.According to the World God explanation, in all episodes except for episode 17, I become a non-existent being. From the perspective of the main character who remembers me in every timeline, isn't it like being gaslighted by the whole setting?(Note: Gaslighted -> manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity. Also, it means that even if Ellet did change his past, if she doesn't change anything on the Tutorial anymore, doesn't save him from his first death, or the things she already changed don't bring changes in his first sixteen deaths, Thesilid might think he's going crazy until he finds Ellet on the 17th timeline.)Doesn't this mean that the main character can go crazy?['The Spoiler Inspector' clicks his tongue, wondering if you can now understand why you shouldn't do whatever you want during the tutorial period.]Ugh. I shrugged my shoulders.In the midst of bickering between the World God asking who you are to nag at my believer, and the Inspector, who claps back telling him to educate them properly, Bianca came back from looking at the tombstones.\"Hias is squatting in front of the tombstone all day, and Agapan is wiping the dust until the stone wears out. The other skeletons seem to like them a lot, though not to that extent. Epiden wants you to say thank you as a representative.\"\"That's great.\"We also named the seven skulls serfs while erecting the monument. Bianca and I used the names of flowers after much consideration.Hias of Hyacinth, Agapan of Agapanthus, Epiden of Epidendrum, etc.The skull beauty that I gave the cultivation skill is Epiden.As amazing as it sounds, Bianca understands the skeletons very well. It's always fascinating to see.Suddenly, I remembered something I should ask Bianca.\"Bia, can you get me some holy water?\"\"Holy water?\"In order to raise Elephantipes, divine power is essential. If I awaken divine power, I can make it myself, but that will only be possible after 943 days.Of course, not counting the days I was rolling in my bed with God's fever.\"It's a herb that requires a lot of effort.\"\"Yes, it's worth it.\"It's a key ingredient for the cure of the plague. I don't know how successful the breeding will be from now on, but at least we need to secure enough quantity to be used in the Gillette estate that Bianca will rule.As if feeling motivated, Bianca told me the good news.\"The potion trade system is ready. I have all the distribution channels and stores to deliver prepared, so all we need is the goods.\"\"Already? I think it's been a month since you said that we should organize a Commerce Guild.\"\"I got help from the treasurer, so it was quick. It happened that commerce was included in the successor classes. I told Father I wanted to start a business as part of my class, and he was happy to finance it.\"Great skill, drive, and timing were added for this job.Bianca handed me a note while I was lost in admiration.\"The first order quantity is about this much...How about delivery 15 days later?\"\"I'll try!\"Since Bia has already laid down this much for the Guild, it was right to do it unconditionally.\"Today, I will talk to Mr. Rodellaine through the treasurer. Eli is still young, so a guardian has to represent you.\"\"Right.\"\"Well, come to think of it, if you start a business in earnest, you will be busy, so it will be difficult to do the kitchen work in the morning. I'll take care of this too. Just go say hello to Chef Paisha so she won't be upset.\"\"Ah, Bia......Thank you so much for taking care of everything!\"\"......It's not that much.\"Bianca's voice became a little shy when I hugged her because I couldn't overcome my emotions. Smart and cute, too.At that time, the skeleton, Epiden, who had awakened the cultivation ability, came to this side as if he had something to say.Clattering! Clattering!He moved his joints vigorously by mixing hand gestures and footsteps, but....... Hm, I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm sorry.Bianca translated for me.\"Winter will soon come to the dungeon farm. They need to prepare for the cold.\"\"Do you understand that?\"\"I saw him trembling.\"Was that what it meant?Even while I was surprised, Bianca and Epiden continued to communicate.\"Epiden says the winter on this farm is terribly cold.\"\"How can he know that when he doesn't have any flesh anymore......Well, that was harsh of me, sorry. Anyway, he's saying that farming will be disrupted, right?\"\"Yes. Should we make a greenhouse? What should we do?\"\"Don't worry. I picked up something good just in time.\"\"Something good?\"I rummaged through my satchel.And, Ta-da! What I brought out in front of Bianca and Epiden was....\"A piece of charcoal?\"\"It's the core of a Hellfire.\"I picked it up from the fireplace in the South Annex banquet hall.According to World God, this Hellfire is an unusual 'corrupted demon'. He's not interested in evil deeds even if he was born a demon, so he wouldn't be a threat.\"Still, demons are evil, so we have to wake it up and look at the status to decide whether to use it or not.\"I lit the charcoal-like core on fire.\u2720Helverus, the vegetarian Hellfire, was drawn to the warm energy and slowly regained consciousness.Fortunately, it seems that he did not disappear. However, the aftereffects of the damage to his core were great.He was 300 years old, but now his body has become a small candle of 50 years old. At that age, he was like a newborn baby. If he opens his mouth like this, maybe only the sound of crying would come out....<Hu-Hungwy......>Even if it wasn't a cry, the words came out slurred.Will the strength and dignity accumulated over 300 years disappear like this? If he had endured a little longer, he could have been humanized. He was so sad that it felt like he was going to burst into tears.\"Are you hungry?\"A girl's voice was heard from a distance.As if his vision had deteriorated, the surroundings were blurry, so Helverus was wary and crouched not knowing who it was.At that time, something was scattered over the heat, and it was burnt down by the flames of Helverus.The fragrant scent that softly spread around was definitely dried grass. He was after all a vegetarian.<Y-Yummy!>He forgot his vigilance and devoured it.\"He eats very well. He already ate a whole bag of herbal waste.\"\"It's the size of a fist but It's getting bigger.\"\"It looks like a pet.\"\"Can I try feeding it?\"\"No, Bia. It can bite you.\"Apparently, there were not one, but two girls.My eyesight returned a little bit, and I was able to distinguish between fuzzy lumps and colors.The pink girl broke the herbal waste into small pieces and asked.\"What is your name?\"<He-.....Helberosu.>A calm attitude even in the face of a demon. Not knowing what kind of high-ranking demon the opponent was, Helverus answered obediently.\"I see, Helverus. Count Orsche's Mansion dungeon was closed, so you can't go back.\"<I-I don wanna go back.>\"Actually, hospitality for you didn't look good in Orsche's mansion. I picked your core that was rolling around in the fireplace. If I had left it alone, you would have fallen into the Demon Realm's garbage dump when the mansion closed down.\"<Hi-Hing.>The garbage dump in the Demon World was a place that was famous for being very cold. Just imagining it was scary.\"......When he cries, the flame droops flat and a lot of water vapor comes out.\"\"I feels like his shoulders are dropping. Cute. You're cute, so eat more.\"I nibbled at the long-thin stem the black girl offered me. I was careful not to bite or burn her fingers.The girl with pink hair tied in pigtails said.\"Because our Bia likes you, I'll make a special offer for you.\"<What is it?>\"You could go underground and make geothermal heat. If you do that, I'll give you all the by-products left after harvesting on this farm. What do you think?\"<......!>It was then that Helverus was able to look around with his restored vision.An enormous farm stretched all the way to the horizon. The quantity of herbal by-products from this place would be enormous. Just looking at the straws piled on one side, there were three huge piles.The flames of Helverus were twinkling.<All, all mine......?>\"Yes. They're all Helverus's.\"<Do...... ! Do...... !>This was the workplace Helverus had dreamed of.He was tired of urban life, so he studied a lot of things that he needed to work on a farming job. He was trained to match the bathwater heat of the picky Rodrigo, so he was confident he could fine-tune the temperature.\"All right. That pretty skull over there is Epiden, and he's the caretaker. Listen well and ask for a lot of food.\"<Yes!>That's how the family in Ellet's Dungeon Farm increased.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you know what I just talked about with the treasurer?\"\"Don'tknow. What were you talking about?\"\"This time, the Gillette family is establishing a business, and they want to be the first to distribute the potions that I made!\"\"Wow, really?\"\"Yes! And he put forward very unusual conditions. They said they'd charge the potion with almost no distribution margin at all!\"\"Oh my god!\"\"The reason is that there is a risk with it because it's a company that was established to test Young Lady Bianca's business skills, let alone worry, I'm even more convinced that she will do well.\"\"I know!\"As if it were the first time I had heard something I already knew, I responded enthusiastically and thought in my mind.It was clear that she made these conditions with consideration for this and that with words that would not be burdensome to my pushover father.As expected, our Bianca is the best.Frintz asked Father, who was hurrying to meet the date and the amount of delivery.\"Dad, are you selling apple juice-flavored potions and steak-flavored pills that Eli makes?\"Frintz was always eating the poorly made products that had no transaction value. It was worthwhile to give him herbal medicine to help him practice swordsmanship, so Frintz grew taller and had a strong frame.\"Yes! How did the lady know that I wanted to sell Eli's potion as well? Even I think those should be the main product!\"\"Wow, we are going to get rich! What Eli made is just amazing!\"\"Yes. This dad is really, so proud of our daughter.......\"Dad wiped away his tears for a moment.\"I'm going to work hard and make a potion that's as good as Eli's.\"\"It's only a trick. The healing effect can't match the potion that Dad makes. I have to work hard to become an alchemist like my dad!\"\"My daughter speaks beautifully, too. Let's work hard with this Dad. If the business goes well, the treasurer said that he had plans to open a direct sales store.\"\"Oh! Direct Selling Shop!\"It is an alchemist's dream to open their own potion shop. Dad's eyes were wet with emotion.\"As expected, Count Gillette is merciful. How grateful I was since he accepted a fledgling alchemist who was wandering with two little kids....\"\".......\"That's not it, Dad. If it wasn't for Bianca, you'd still be a fledgling alchemist, who couldn't even get the minimum wage while bound by a slave contract.\"I'm so grateful to even get connected with the new herb supplier. Isn't the quality of the herbs coming in these days really good? In the past, herbal shops used to mix rotten things and rarely set deadlines.\"That's because I'm the one delivering.\"If they can even get us these high-quality ingredients, the potion profit is coming to us almost in full......The Count's share seems too small, is it okay?....\"Ah, now let's stop talking about this!It is true that Bianca offered unconventional conditions for the convenience of our family, but it was I who was also supplying the materials, so it was not going to be to the extent that my father was worried.It was impossible to explain them in detail, so I dismissed them briefly.\"Don't you think Miss Bianca and the Treasurer will do a great job? I don't think running a business is something we should get involved in.\"\"Oh, yes! I had a little presumptuous thought. I'm glad Eli stopped me.\"We started discussing which potions to make.We also actively accepted Frintz opinion, who was in charge of the tasting, so the atmosphere became more like a family meeting.As soon as the contents were sorted out to some extent, production began. Now all that remains was to do mechanical work.When my father made potions and pills, it became a division of labor in such a way that I post-process the food and Frintz made the taste test. As is common with those who started a business, our family was filled with hope and talked about dreams.It started with a Frintz.\"What will Eli do when you have a lot of money?\"I'm going to spend it on my Transmigrator exclusive cash shop.\"I should help you become a knight, Brother. I'll save the rest of my money for the future of your Knights academy.\"\"Ah, Eli....\"At the words of the Knights Academy, Frinz looked at me with admiration and emotion.It will take quite a while of time because I have to stay there for 6 years, but I'm glad that he seems to like it too.Frintz asked dad the same question.\"What about your Dad? What do you want to do when we get rich?\"\"I....\"The face of our single Dad, who had raised two children by himself while drenched in hardships, became dull.\"I want to visit the house we lived with Mom. I haven't been able to go there because I haven't had time.\"\".......\"\".......\"The atmosphere became somber.Ironically, my transmigrated body also lost her mother early. Instead, this time, the difference is that she didn't die while giving birth, but disappeared.It was then that a watery tone started to form in my father's voice.\"Your mother......She was a person who appeared out of nowhere and disappeared just as suddenly...\"\"She ran away......hmph.\"Frintz covered my mouth.\"Shh, the next time we split the chocolate chip cookie in half, I'll give you a bigger portion.\"\".......\"This is the kind of negotiation I've heard a lot about. Except coffee ice cream turned into chocolate chip cookies.I mumbled while my mouth still covered by Frintz's hand.\"It should be the part that has a lot of chocolate in it.\"\"Okay. Shush now.\"Frintz seemed to want to protect Dad's beautified memories, but to me, the mother of my transmigrated body didn't have such a good image.'A person who blocked the path of a brilliant young man!'From the first meeting between Dad and Mom, something was strange.It was a time when my father was being exploited in the Golden Ivory Tower. One rainy day, Dad went to the forest to dig herbs to make a living. Then he found an injured woman there and took her to his hut for treatment, after that, she settled down there with memory loss as an excuse.After being rescued, she had the nerve to eat from the meager earnings of a young student.As I was reminded of the old saying against picking up people on a rainy day, my father's recollection began.\"She was a high-maintenance person. It looked like she grew up being well-taken care of....but she was also strangely good at hunting, so she walked through the woods and caught animals, saying she picked them up on the way home. Moreover, since she was always hungry, she often begged me to cook the stew quickly. At that time, I secretly cried a lot while cleaning the intestines of dead animals....\"As he recalled those memories, dad had a happy face.You really loved her.My cheeks became even puffier.That being said, my evaluation of a bad person who turned a brilliant young man into a widower did not change.Anyway, the scope of the family that I accepted after I transmigrated was Dad and Brother.It's enough to care only about these two people, there's no need to attach affection to the mother of a transmigrated body who I don't even know the face of and is suspected of running away.Perhaps noticing the dissatisfaction in my heart, Dad spoke in her defense.\"At a glance, it felt like she was living in a different world than us...... It's not strange if one day she regained her memories and went back to where she came from.......\"No, that's just being garbage.I've never had a mother before, but I can still say this.\"Don't you hate her? She left you with two kids and disappeared.\"\"Not at all. I'm always thankful for gaining two treasures.\"\".......\"When I heard such a thing, I couldn't complain anymore. Then a piece of unexpected information came in.\"I don't think Mom abandoned us.\"\"Brother?\"\"Until now, I thought it was a dream and I didn't tell you. Actually, I saw Mom the night before she disappeared. We also talked.\"\"What? Really, Frintz?!\"Excited dad almost spilled the flask.While I was fixing it, Frintz brought up the eyewitness record.\"I woke up in the middle of the night from a nightmare, and all of a sudden Mom woke up next to me and got annoyed at something. Then she took a hoe and a plow from the yard and went into the woods.\"\".......\"\"I remember what she said back then when I called her by the window. She said 'It looks like some black cattle that don't even know their place have come out of the cage, so I'll go grab them'......I think it was something like that......\"\".......\"......What. Is it just me? Doesn't Mom feel quite unusual?\"I'm sure mom had her reasons.\" (Frintz)\"I also remember. When I woke up, the tools used to grow herbs were gone. I wondered if something went wrong when she went to catch something like a wild boar.......\"(Dad)For some reason, I had a strong feeling that it might not have been a wild boar.What the hell was Mom doing?'Ah, I don't know anymore.'I put aside the questions I couldn't answer right away and concentrated on making potions again.\u2720The daily routine of praying early in the morning, stopping by the Dungeon Farm to supply herbs, and performing alchemy in my Dad's lab continued.There was a lot of work, but there was no shortage of time. On the contrary, there was free time left. It was thanks to the fact that the time flow of the Dungeon Farm was tripled if compared to real-time outside.When I brought a scale inside the dungeon to measure the herbs, the daily production target was met in the early afternoon when I carried everything out.Bianca was also busy taking successor's classes.With my personal spare time available, I decided to start an important task that I had put off.[<System> I purchased the 'Job Change Package (Combat)'][<System> Select 'Aura Master's Energy' to acquire 'Aura Awakening Quest', 'Physical Training', and 'Weapon Training']I bought the Aura package and opened it with the wretched heart of getting my one-year fitness membership canceled.Sniff.

There really was a training ground in the middle of a place that looked like a dense forest.It was an outdoor space the size of a small gym. However, the facilities were densely packed.There were log stepping stones, single rope bridges, iron rod overpasses, rock walls, zip tracks, etc. All connected to form a single running track.'Is-Is this an obstacle arena for the Iron man challenge?'The Architect who was serious about physical training immediately denied my evaluation.['The Troubled Skyscraper Architect' judged it to be at the level of a kid's cafe.]I-I'm past the age to go to a kid's cafe!My body shuddered by itself, but it was impossible to refund the Aura package, and the trainer was full of motivation.<Good!

My physical condition had changed a lot and I felt as if I could participate in track and field as a part of the national team and win a medal right now.<Excellent work, Cadet Ellet. It seems that basic physical training is now over. I thought it would take at least a month, I'm really surprised.>\"Hehehe. It's all thanks to the instructor's support.\"<I'm glad that my support became a strength. I think we can start to take on weapon training.>On the fifth day of training, Agnes conducted a theory class before starting full-scale weapons training.<Cadet Ellet, do you know what other names Aura users have?>\"Yes! Sword Master!\"<You got it right. It's Sword Master. It means that you have attained the ultimate in swordsmanship. So, do you know why you can take the first step in Aura only when you reach the last step of swordsmanship?>\"Um, well.......\"Agnes did not delay the time as if it was natural to not know.<I'll show you.>Agnes, who embodied her ghostly form in front of me, started the demonstration. She had a twig in her hand.<Aura is the source of life, and to put it simply, it is like flowing water. It's formless. It is no ordinary matter to let such Aura flow according to one's will. Even when you have mastered swordsmanship and can handle your beloved sword as if it were a part of your body, the only thing you can do at first is to let the aura form on the sword. So, by default, Aura users enter under the title of Sword Master.>Swish.As Agnes shook the twig, a white aura of energy overlaid on the branch. It was a sword called, Aura Sword. Of course, it's not a real sword, but an energy reinforcement.<The realm of Aura users is divided into three stages. Can you tell me what they are?>\"Beginner, Expert, Master!\"<Yes. At the Aura Beginner stage, once you get used to it, you can inject Aura into any shape. Like this twig.>\"Wow, so everything around you can become a weapon?\"<Yes. However, this cannot be said to be a high-level skill. It's basically forming an aura layer on any type of surface. Now I'll show you the Aura Expert.>The white light on the branch gradually increased in length.\"Oh, the Sword Aura is taller than me.\"<No, this can't be called a Sword Aura anymore.>Tuk.Even though Agnes dropped a branch on the floor, the white light remained in her hands. Then I remembered the name of the weapon made of that light.\"Sword......so, Aura Blade?\"I inadvertently said wuxia martial arts terminology, but corrected it in the middle.<Yes. To understand it in a simpler way, Aura, which is like flowing water, becomes hard ice. The higher the level, the harder the Aura Blade becomes, far exceeding Adamantium, Mithril, and Orihalcum.>\"Ah....\"Agnes let go of the Aura Blade, but it did not fall nor vanished.<There is no rule that you have to hold it with your hand. All you have to do is make it flow with your will.>\"What?!\"The sword of light floated in the air and revolved around Agnes. Then, at some point, it stood tall and exploded into seven.\"Oh god...\"Crazy. This is the Ten Thousand Swords.(Note: I'm so in deep-level of Wuxia termology at this point that I want to cry.)<This is the ultimate state, the Aura Master. Seven is the limit for me.>\"Wow! Sist-, no, Instructor you are so cool.\"I felt like falling in love for real. At this point, should I push Aura as my main ability instead of just divine power?<This is not the end.>\"What? Is there another after Aura Master?\"<Soul sword.>\"Ah.\"<You must have heard of it. It is a state of transcendence that can instantly kill an opponent by moving the Aura at will. In terms of divine power, it can be said that it is at a level where only a proxy of god can step on.>(Note: The divine counterpart used is called\uc5b8\ub839-Kodama. The act of words having power. So, if you say Die, and you have plenty of divine power for it, the person dies. Proxy of God is pretty much near it.)\"Wow....\"<I did not reach it.>I felt remorse from the words she added with a smile.The theory class ended with the seven spectacular swords disappearing.<First of all, you should choose the type of weapon you want to master to the extreme. It will take a long time to find the right weapon for you, Cadet. Let's try them one by one from now on.>\"Yes, Instructor!\"I took out the 'training weapon package' I bought at the cash shop for today's class. It was a kit containing various types of weapons such as swords, spears, bows, and whips.Agnes, who praised my readiness, said.<Cadet Ellet, I have some good news and some bad news before you pick up your weapon. What would you like to hear?>\"T-the bad news?\"<Up until now, I have been very kind. From now on, as you start training in earnest, you will know the true fear of this instructor. I'll show you why this instructor is called Hell Instructor!>\"Hik. The good news is?\"<The Cadet is very lucky to meet an instructor like me.>\".......\"<Oh, I don't mean to make fun of you, it's because I know how to wield all weapons. I can teach you any weapon you choose. That's what it means.>\"Aha.\"Nodding my head in agreement, I thought to myself.'The instructor is lucky too.

You have achieved Whiplash Lv.3.]\\n\"Hehe?\"<......>\"Instructor?\"<What kind of monster...... Where did this legend come from?>I think it's the best compliment I've ever heard. I'm so proud.Agnes sighed and assessed me.<You can just choose whatever you want to do. Choose your main weapon and secondary weapon.>\"Oh, then I.......\"There was a weapon I had in mind from the beginning.Without hesitation, I chose the sword as my primary weapon and the whip as my secondary weapon.Agnes was silent for a moment, and I waited for her reaction.<Cadet.>\"Yes.\"<Did you choose it on purpose?>\"A little?\"I laughed softly.<......You're a snarky cadet.>Agnes, aware of my true intentions, seemed to smile a little, but soon changed to her serious face.<Cadet Ellet, I will ask properly. Does that mean you want to learn the Whip sword?>I also looked at her with a serious gaze.\"Yes.\"I've learned a bit about Agnes.Agnes Azlit.A paladin who wields a Whip-Sword that freely changes length and path according to the flow of Aura.She was famous as a hero of the continent and a Saint of the Holy Country who stopped the 'Ice Palace Dungeon Burst' decades ago, from the front lines.But even before such achievements, she was a promising aura user with unrivaled skills inside the Vatican.Already mastering all weapons in her teens, she earned the title of Weapon Meister, and in her twenties, looking for a deeper realm in martial arts to dig into, she mastered the whip-sword and devised her own swordsmanship.Is constantly argued that if she hadn't died and were still alive, she might have defeated Prince Hispenril, the strongest in the current setting.'Maybe she would have reached the level of Soul Sword.'It is a special sword technique made by a person who became a role model regardless of nationality. It was absolutely necessary to learn it.<It's been a long time since I've seen these eyes. You seem really greedy.>\"Yes. Please teach me.\"<The Whip-sword is different from a normal weapon. You can only learn it when you have reached the limits in the sword, the whip and can handle Aura at an expert level or higher. In the first place, a whip-sword is a sword that is maintained with Aura.>\"I know.\"<Hoo, and you still dare to choose swordsmanship that is far beyond the starting line? Good. If you don't change your mind until you qualify, then I'll think about it.>\"Really? You promised!\"<Yes.>I got a chance. I gave an immediate bow.\"Thank you, Instructor!\"\u2720The rewarding life of a transmigrator continued.I pray early at dawn, lightly lap over obstacle tracks, do morning swordsmanship training, weigh herbs at the dungeon farm in the morning, craft potions in Dad's lab in the afternoon, and train again for the rest of the day...The time to be a playmate of the Count's Young Lady was diminished. Bianca has also been busy with her successor classes these days.We could only see each other for a moment in the evening, like now.\"Mr. Rodellaine and Eli's potions are finally on display in the shop from tomorrow.\"And as always, it's a work topic.Gillette's estate had three dungeons. The subjugated dungeon is always crowded with adventurers who have come to dig up resources.The places where my potions would be delivered were the potion shops around there.\"This is the contract document. Read it.\"\"Okay.\"As I took the papers Bianca gave me and looked through them, I spontaneously yawned.Uninteresting content is also a problem, but I was really tired from continuing training even after the effects of the Ginseng extract had decreased fatigue....\"......hot!\"I came to my senses after I dozed off, but when I saw Bianca sitting across from me.\"oh!\"\".......\"\".......\"She was doing the same.We checked each other's condition and laughed.\"You look very tired these days, Eli.\"\"Bia.

Actually, it wasn't even the first time. I secretly slept with Bianca several times.It might be troublesome if a commoner's playmate is found to be getting this casual with the Count's Young Lady, but it was okay because there were no servants entering Bianca's room without her permission.I lifted the blanket and tapped the seat next to me.\"Bia, finish your homework and hurry up.\"\"I just finished. I'll go.\"We lay side by side facing each other.Feeling very tired, Bianca fell asleep quickly as soon as her head touched the pillow, and a gold light glittered on my necklace.<She looks just like Cattleya when she was young, but the creepy part is that she's smart just like my friend.>It sounded like she was complaining about it, but she had a soft voice.<But this child doesn't have much power. Will she be okay in this harsh world? ....Ellet, please take good care of her.>\"Of course.\"I whispered softly and closed my eyes. It was time for a good night's sleep to face a rewarding tomorrow.\u2720A C-class dungeon located in the southwestern part of Gillette's estate, 'The Contaminated Crystal Cave'.Although the boss was subjugated decades ago, it is a dungeon that has not been closed due to the production of various mineral resources.Even today, adventurers lined up early in the morning to make a living working in the dungeon.Taking off their jacket and holding a pickaxe, people looked more like veteran miners than an adventurer. The subjugated C-class dungeon was nothing more than a regular mine.Tung! bang! Tung! bang!Lively sound of pickaxes hitting stone echoed throughout the crystal cave.\"I've never seen you before.\"\"I am working as a daily worker to earn some money. Have you been working here for a long time?\"\"Yes. I've been here since the boss was subjugated, If you take all those years into account, you can say I'm a miner now. Hahaha.\"\"Somehow, I thought your biceps were extraordinary for a simple miner.\"\"You have good eyes for a young friend! These are my pride!\"The inside was warmed with the heat of labor. Beads of sweat flowed down the cool muscles that were wriggling with excitement. Everyone in here thought their body was a precious asset and the muscles they have been constantly managing seemed to shine.Around the time they shared information on nourishing food and drinks, and tips for mining.Doom! Ta-ah! Doom! Ta-ah!A dull vibration reverberated throughout the cave.\"Hey, what is this sound?! Is-is this a beast?!\"The part-timer was startled. He was just a novice swordsman who couldn't even awaken the Aura. He applied for the job application believing in the words of the employment agency that this was a safe dungeon, but what kind of sound is this?But others didn't care at all.The veteran man chuckled.\"Brother Fhenril has come to work today. Indeed, even the sound of his pickaxe is different!\"\"Bro-Brother Fhenril?\"\"Look over there, over there.\"Doom!Vibration echoed again from within the dark space pointed to by the veteran.There was a man there.A very famous middle-aged man to everyone in the area, who quietly started mining in this place about a month ago.And the reason for his fame....Doom! Ta-ah!Pussack! Crascking! Kuruwuru!The inexhaustible power to destroy the dungeon with only the power of his body!The part-timer was shocked.'Gasp! To have the strength to match that of an Aura user with just muscle power!'Indeed, the middle-aged man called Fhenril was the owner of unusual muscles.The lumpy biceps brachialis, the pectoralis major as wide as a wall, and the rectus abdominis as hard as a shield.The flexing created by those muscles was truly an art, and the shape of his upper body was a well-balanced inverted triangle that could be admired even in geometry theory.The light reflected from the drops of sweat rolling down the wheat-colored skin was dazzling.The moment he flicked his bangs to wipe the sweat.'Gasp.'A breathtakingly handsome face was revealed. He was the epitome of a muscular middle-aged man.The part-time youth, whose mouth was open, came to his senses and decided to point out one thing.\"By the way, is that person younger than you?\"\"What kind of bullshit is that! If he's stronger than me of course he's an Older Brother!\"When he heard the logic, the young daily part-timer thought that it sounded right. Other adventurers in the cave were also looking at Fhenril with envy.\"If only I could touch those muscles once....\"\"How does he prepare his food? What kind of pills do I have to take for muscle supplement to get to that?\"\"Ah, I want to ask him the secrets to his muscles. But I don't dare approach......!\"Meanwhile, Fhenril's pickaxe continued.When he swung his back and hit the wall with all his strength.......Kwawagwagwang!A road that did not exist was created anew.\"Hmm!\"Fhenril looked down at his dynamic wriggling muscles.'The pectoralis major and erector spinae seem to be in very good mood. The deltoids and lats seem to be a bit sprained, so I'll have to train them today to heal them......Oops, it's time to eat my pills!'Fhenril hurriedly put the muscle-supplement pill into his mouth and chewed it.The taste was bitter enough to paralyze the tongue, but it didn't matter for him to sacrifice his sense of taste to prevent muscle loss.Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!\"Th-there's a crack in the ceiling... ... ?!\"\"Ah! It's collapsing! Everyone get away!\"A once-in-a-decade emergency broke out in the subjugated C-class dungeon.The ceiling collapsed and a beast appeared. A massive wriggling body, a mouth with sphincter-like teeth, and acidic bodily fluids dripping down.Someone said its name.\"Ac-Acid Worm!\"\"Why, why are there still such large beasts......!\"Chwii!\"Ouch, aww!\"As the acid worm sprayed saliva, screams erupted everywhere along with the smell of burning flesh.\"W-We need to call someone who can fight......!\"The Acid Worm, which was the size of a house, was a C-class middle boss. To get rid of it, at least one Aura Beginner must come. However, it was impossible to find someone who could handle Aura, leisurely mining in a subjugated C-class dungeon.Those with combat power at best in a slightly better level than ordinary, were confused.They tried to run away, but a rockfall occurred when the Acid Worm appearance blocked the entrance.\"A-Agh!\"\"R-rookie!\"The young part-time was in a crisis, isolated by the sudden fall of rocks. The moment the monster's disgusting mouth was about to hit him.Phog!A pickaxe flew and struck the worm's face. When the Acid Worm, which had been stunned, flinched in place.\"Gyaa!\"Someone rescued the young daily part-timer in a princess carry. Leaping through the air, he looked down at the young man and asked.\"Are you okay, young man?\"\"What? Ye-Yes!\"It was then that the young man realized that he was encased in a pectoralis major as wide as a plain.\"I-It's Brother Fhenril!\"\"Brother Fhenril saved the newcomer!\"The adventurers chanted the name of Fhenril with joy.Some even chewed their lips out of envy when they saw the young part-timer's hand that was gently resting on their brother's pectoralis major.Kuo!The Acid Worm, which had lost all its teeth and had to eat porridge for the rest of its life, was very angry. He rushed at Fhenril, spitting out acidic bodily fluids.\"Bro-Brother Fhenril! It's dangerous!\"\"Avoid, brother!\"\".......\"Fhenril did not follow the advice of his younger brothers.His legs stood firm in place, like a breakwater that withstands the waves.The moment when everyone closed their eyes at the sight of the Acid Worm rushing in a straight path.Fhenril raised his fist silently and then.Paaaah!The Acid Worm, which stopped with a fist stuck in its forehead, shrank like a spring. In an instant, Fhenril lifted the Acid Worm with both hands, like weightlifting training weights.Boowoo!And ripped it apartThe mouths of the people who witnessed the scene opened beyond normal surprise.\"O-our brother...was he an Aura user?\"\"No. That was......just pure muscle power.......\"\"Oh, my...... Brother. It's amazing.......\"The person concerned only checked the muscles as if he was not impressed with the situation.\"Hmm! The training wasn't all bad.\"He ordered for those around.\"Come on, heal your wounds.\"\"Ye-Yes, Brother!\"There were no serious injuries.While the adventurers drank the healing potion they each carried, Fhenril finished cleaning and cleared the rocks that blocked the entrance.It was at that moment when he quietly returned to his place and picked up the pickaxe. His composure, which had been calm even in front of the worm, was finally broken.\"No! Where is my mind! If I don't eat every 30 minutes, I will lose muscle......!\"Fhenril gave a look of dismay as if he had just lost his country when he saw the muscle supplement pills that had melted by the worm's bodily fluids.At that time, the young part-timer who owed his life shyly approached him.\"I......Brother, if you are in a hurry, even this....\"It was a finely-wrapped pill, Gillette's lord certification mark and the label 'Rodel' stood out. From the perspective of Fhenril, who has been consuming all kinds of medicinal herbs, it somehow felt more magical than normal pills.\"It's not as good as the grace you've given me, but it's my small token of gratitude. Please accept it, brother.\"\"Hmm! I'm not a person to be indebted to someone.......\"\"I understand! Come on. You are losing muscles right?\"\"Hmm! Right! Thank you for your kindness.\"Fhenril took the pill in one bite and chewed it.As usual with medicines that are good for the body, he prepared for the pain on his tongue that he would feel in the future.But.\"Hey, this taste......?!\"The taste of crispy deep-fried pork and juicy sweet sauce spread throughout the mouth.It was more delicious than a decent dish, so it was like a shock in his life, who has been following a low-carb diet so far. He also suspected that it might be a hallucination. However, seeing his muscles rejoice more than ever, it was clear that he ate a muscle supplement.\"Do you want more?\"\"Oh, huh! Hmm......! I will not refuse...hum!\"\"You will have an upset stomach, brother! Drink the potion while you eat!\"\"Hmm! It's a healthy-looking spinach color. Thanks......No, how does a potion taste like juice?!\"Taking a closer look at the glass bottle, he was able to find the name Rodel again.\"Alchemist Rodel......To make something like this.......\"Fhenril, who had been saved by the taste, shed tears of emotion.\"Brother Fhenril was moved.\"\"Did he say alchemist Rodel?\"The adventurers who were watching the scene memorized Rodel's name.Unintentionally enjoying an influencer effect, Ellet's collaboration with Leonard quickly began to go viral, centered on the Tainted Crystal Cave dungeon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As a result, the Lord left all administration to his aides in the name of closure training and was locked up in the dungeon for several months.Most recently, a month ago, he disappeared leaving only a note saying he was going to practice in the 'Contaminated Crystal Cave'.Aides predicted that it would take at least two more months for him to return home.But today, to everyone's surprise, the Lord returned to Raemian House.Chief Adviser Edgar said as he picked up his old jacket.\"Why don't you make yourself comfortable, sir?\"\"I don't know what my daughter is going through, how can this father be comfortable?\"\"For you to say that, seems like your muscles have become more plentiful.\"\"Well....\"There was no cloth under the coat.

I feel uncomfortable because I stopped training because of you.\"On the day he left the dungeon, he struggled to shake off the clinging younger brothers he made on the mine saying for him not to go.Edgar said to the disgruntled prince.\"I have found the traces of Princess Elthea.\"\"......!\"The prince jumped up from his seat.\"Where is it! Where the hell is she!\"\"It was surprisingly close.\"\"Close?\"Edgar opened the map with an apology.It was only after he delivered the news that the Duke understood why he had dared to summon him to the mansion again.Edgar's index finger was pointing to the mountain behind a small village nearby.It was not far from Raemian House.\"A sword mark, presumed to be the princess's skill, was found in this dungeon.\"Traces of a daughter found after 13 years.There was a glimmer of hope in the Prince's eyes.\u2720'Hmm, this is where we are going.'I was looking at the system map. Near the Principality's capital, a small town with a mountain behind was marked as the destination.Today is the day I go on a filial trip with my father to my hometown.It was time to depart.Having finished storing the necessary items, I stood up carrying the satchel bag diagonally over my shoulder.\"Eli, have you packed all your travel items?\"\"Yes, I packed more than last time.\"\"Yes, well done. It's dangerous outside the house.\"\"I'll be back soon. Stay healthy, Bia.\"I hugged Bianca once and went to my dad.\"Eli, Frintz. Hang on to Daddy.\"\"Yes!\"I and Frintz answered at the same time and hugged Dad's waist.Crack.The space transition stone shattered, and the view was erased with a bright light.Soon a familiar message arrived.[<System> You have entered the Peronsa area, the capital of the Principality of Hispenril. Adjusts the current time according to the time difference.]We arrived in the middle of the city. It was a bustling street lined with cute and pretty shops on both sides of a neatly paved boulevard. Everywhere my eyes touched was like a watercolor landscape painting.\"Hey, look over there!\"There was a landmark of the Principality to where my eyes were dragged at Frintz's cry.Golden Ivory Tower.A place where gold, the symbol of materialism, and the ivory tower, a symbol of noble learning, were combined.Faithful to the concept, the cream-colored exterior walls were covered in sparkling gold paint, and true to its name, the tower's height stood out from the surrounding low-height buildings.I measured the floor, finger by finger up the window, and was disappointed.\"Hey, it's only up to nine floors.\"Isn't it a bit low to call it a tower?Soon an expert's rebuttal came in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Eli, hand.\"\"Hand here!\"\"Does Frintz want to walk hand in hand, too?\"\"I'm fine.\"I was proud of Frintz, who said that he was a little tall for that. It was worthwhile to make the medicine.There were many waterways in Peronsa.Around the time we were waiting for the double-decker cruise ship to pass through to cross the bridge, a group of men in luxurious green robes stood beside us for the same purpose.'An alchemist belonging to the Golden Ivory Tower.'I instinctively raised my head and looked at Dad. He adjusted the hood and covered his intellectually handsome face.They were talking with each other.\"I heard that Professor Hickim got a lot of research funding this month?\"\"What? Half of the research money coming into the ivory tower will always be Professor Hickim's.\"\"The performance is a bit sluggish these days, but he is the authority in the field of regenerating potions.\"\"The next owner of the tower will definitely be Professor Hikim Sarmatan.\"I felt my Dad's hand shaking and gradually getting wet. Thanks to that, something I've been wondering about for a long time has been solved.'Hikim Sarmatan.'The name of the parasite master who attached himself to my father and sucked up the research results was clear.['The World-building God' says he is the same person who ended up ruining the ivory tower due to corruption and embezzlement in the middle of the original work.]While learning alchemy from my father, I had mastered all the recipes he studied.Among them, there was also a regeneration potion.It seems that the guy named Hikim, has been announcing Dad's achievements as if they were his own, even after Dad was expelled. It was a very lucky villain, who was able to get many research funds by stealing other people's results while only playing and eating.I clenched my fists and vowed.'Dad's enemy, one day I must have your head cut off.'['The World-building God' is deeply impressed by your filial piety.]The cruise ship passed and the pier that opened upwards returned to its original position. After the alchemists moved away, Dad regained his composure and smiled weakly.\"Eli, Frintz, are you hungry? Shall we eat first?\"\"Yes!\"We answered with more vigor on purpose. Following Dad's guidance, the tour of the capital of the Principality began.After eating pancakes and bacon at a famous brunch restaurant, I looked around the artisan workshop street and the art street to buy souvenirs.\"Ah, Eli! Fr-Frintz! Doesn't your leg hurt? Gasp, gasp....\"The physical strength of the two children who purchased the Aura package is that of an overpowering kid. I and Frintz were somewhat disappointed, but we decided to take a break because we wanted Dad to catch up.Dad wiggled his legs as if he was about to collapse, but he went into the shop at the far corner of the cafe street.It was a dessert cafe with a pretty and cute girly vibe, decorated with dried flowers. The reason for choosing this destination was soon revealed.Dad took a sip of the tea he ordered and started the tale.\"This was one of the places I went on a date with Mom.\"I and Frintz listened intently dipping the fondant chocolate into the bowl and eating it.\"It was a famous dating spot, but it took a lot of courage to come here only with the weekly wage I got from the ivory tower. But it must have been a place lacking for Mom. She asked me what the hell is this kind of dessert, and told me to eat it all....\"She's so mean. He even went on a date by squeezing all his fortune dry out of thin air, but blatantly ignoring people's sincerity is too much!At the moment when affection for my mother was about to plummet.\"She fed it directly to me.\"\".......\"\"One bite after another.\"\".......\"\"Then, by the time I finished eating, she suddenly wanted to taste it...Hmmm! I will continue when Eli and Frintz turn fifteen.\"\".......\"This genre was edited for 15 rating.\"Mom said she didn't like the food outside, and when we went out on a date, she always ate as little as a bird. Then when we got home, she would complain that she was starving to death.\"Was she the type who could only eat home-cooked meals?\"One day, she said she was so hungry that she caught a wild turkey at night and made me roast it whole. And then gave me all the leg parts to eat because we had a lot.....\"What? Did you give up the legs? Did mom really love dad?!\"......She said that she suddenly changed her mind, so she took it and ate it all by herself. She didn't even give me a bite.\"\".......\"Yes. I knew it. It can't be true. The moment I felt a little relieved.\"I found out later that that was when she was pregnant with Frintz, right? That's how Dad and Mom became a family!\"\".......\"In front of his daughter, who was unable to adapt to the fast progress, the father was happy with a shy face.So, this is how it feels to hear the stories of men and women living together before marriage.'What were you doing instead of studying?!'As a daughter, I had mixed feelings and had a shot of cold black tea, but unlike me, Frintz seemed to be impressed with the story. He exclaimed with the chocolate smudged on his lips.\"I want to go back to the house where our family used to live!\"\"Yes, we've seen enough of the capital, so let's go now.\"We decided to rent a business carriage to move around.\"Could you please take us here?\"I entrusted the directions to a self-proclaimed native and boarded the carriage.The carriage exited the capital gate and wandered over the hillside.While traveling for a long time, the life of a young student who would have ridden a horse-drawn carriage that was more like a wagon early in the morning to go to work in the Golden Ivory Tower was pictured in my mind.The place we arrived at was a small, shabby village along the mountain.In fact, there was a sense that it was not enough to even call it a village. There were only a few houses, and at least there seemed to be few people living in those.\"Frintz! Eli! We're here!\"Dad pointed to the house in the deepest part of the village, which is located almost in contact with the mountain.It was a cute little two-story hut with a triangular roof.Unfortunately, reality has not been preserved in a beautiful form as much as memories. The hut was like a haunted house because it had been neglected for six years. All furnishings were robbed, and the footprints of mountain beast were stamped on the floor.\".......\"Dad stood still for a moment. I was worried that my father would be hurt by the reality of the worn-out and ruined memories.I and Frintz took a look and started clearing the house, no matter who came first.\"It's small, so we'll clean it up soon! I'll start with ventilation!\"\"I found a towel. I'll mop the floor with this!\"\"Huh? Oh, yeah, Dad will clean up the weeds in the flower bed!\"Dad joined without knowing it. Somehow, we ended up cleaning up the abandoned house in earnest, but after doing it, it became so clean that we decided to stay for a day.I have brought a sleeping bag, too. I was a little excited, thinking it was a camping site with a roof.\"Dad, look at this! I found a treasure in the attic!\"\"Oh My God. That's the ball you used to play with, Frintz. Did it remain?\"\"There are a lot of these things here. Come up quickly!\"\"I'll go!\"It seems that items that had not been stolen were left in the attic.I shouted to the attic.\"Dad, brother! I'll take a look outside.\"\"You mustn't go too far, Eli!\"\"Yes!\"I looked around the hut. And let out a groan of agony.\"Well....\"Now I am facing a serious problem.Obviously, while cleaning, I looked around every corner of the house.[<Quest> Hometown Tour (Difficulty: D)Let's take a look around the hometown where the whole family lived together.Success Reward: 30 Packs of Ginseng Extract\\nFailure Penalty: None]The quest was still incomplete.I put in an inquiry right away.'World God, are you there?

I turned on the system map to explore a larger area.What am I going to do in this place?There was a mysterious empty space in the forest leading to the mountain behind. Forming a perfect circle felt more like a crater than an empty space.As I gazed intently at the entrance to the forest, the necklace rang.<Are you going in?>\"No way. If I suddenly disappear, Dad and Brother will be worried.\"<You are a good child.>\"Of course.\"\u2720That night. The sound of breathing was heard at different beats.I quietly got out of my sleeping bag so my family wouldn't wake up, and managed to escape out of the house with a satchel bag and the necklace.\"Phew!

I arrived after about 10 minutes in a walk with small steps. The destination was fairly close.The wide recessed crater melted into the surrounding terrain with the passage of time.A huge pool of knee-high clear water has become the home of underwater plants. It was very beautiful to see the water plants swaying in the water under the moonlight.I looked at the place where the image of a full moon was shining. The center of the huge pool-like crater.There, a foreign gate was slowly creating a vortex.\"It's a dungeon.\"Just then, a message appeared stating that the quest of 'Hometown Exploration' was completed.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' nodded his head saying that, as expected, no dungeon can be missed by an S-class.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' sends a reproach to the 'The World-building God', asking if he was deliberately guiding believers to a dangerous place.]['The World-building God' hurriedly explains that this was a subjugated C-class dungeon with no boss, so there will be no trouble.]Agnes looked around and commented, in a friendly tone because she was not in training mode.<This puddle looks like it was originally a crater. It is a sign that a burst has occurred.>\"Burst?\"I was surprised. 'Dungeon Burst', where monsters and demons burst out of a dungeon, like an explosion. No matter how low-level dungeons are, if a burst occurs, the difficulty jumps up and gets upgraded to at least S-class.When demons and beasts who used to run rampant in the dungeon run rampant in the human world, the damage is enormous. It was a disaster that may destroy the Serentra Continent if it is not prevented regardless of which dungeon burst open.That was Dungeon Burst.I checked the age of aquatic plants with 'Plant Detection', one of the cultivation skills.\"The oldest of the plants here are less than six years old. If the burst happened six years ago, the whole town would have been devastated.\"I got goosebumps after saying it aloud. It was around 6 years ago when my family was still living here.<It seems to have been quickly dealt with the moment it burst open. That's what I call real luck. By the way....>Agnes' expression darkened.<Since the dungeon burst has occurred, there must have been victims, but a memorial is not visible. It seems that the dungeon itself is not known to the outside.>It was as Agnes said.Usually, it is normal to be a crowded place day and night because of adventurers who have come to dig for resources, but on the contrary, this place was becoming a part of nature.As if, the world did not know the existence of the dungeon.In this case, there is only one conclusion.\"The subjugation squad was annihilated, so no one knew about it.\"<...Yes. It seems that I became a comrade of the owner of the dungeon.>I couldn't answer back hastily.Because that was also the story of Agnes. A righteous person who sacrificed themselves to prevent a dungeon burst.Agnes, who had been praying for the dead for a long time, turned to me.<Ellet. I have a request.>\"Request?\"<Would you mind recovering the remains of the subjugation party?>At the same time, World God also encouraged me to enter the dungeon.['The World-building God' sniffly tells you that there is no record of anyone looting boss items in the dungeon.]There's no need to think anymore, as S-class boss items are waiting to be looted.\"Yes, I will.\"<Thank you very much.>\"Well. Shall we go then?\"I took off my shoes and rolled up my pajama dress. I went to the shallow but wide center of the puddle and looked into the gate. It was a place like a water well of unknown depth.Without hesitation, I jumped inside.[<System> You have entered the C-level dungeon 'Black Salt Desert'.]Well, it's a dungeon where the only resource really seems to be salt. Even so, I don't really want to eat it because it's black.'Where did they defeat the boss? Let's see the map.'There was only one thing that stood out on a bleak map that was almost blank. A Temple-shaped architecture. That would be the boss zone.\"I think we should go all the way northeast from here. It's about 20 kilometers, so if you walk non-stop......\"<Ellet, look behind you!>I turned around, led by Agne's urgent voice.Kirruk!A giant scorpion the size of a tiger was rushing towards me in a straight line.\"......!\"I held my breath and looked at it with wide-open eyes.The moment when the scorpion, which has been steadily narrowing the distance, finally casts a shadow on my face.Pussack!I took out a wooden sword from my satchel bag and swung it. The scorpion flew far away.\"Oh, that surprised me.\"I poked the scorpion, but there was no movement. It looked like he died instantly.<A desert scorpion in one blow......normally, you have to train for at least two years...>This is the power of buffs and doping. Ahem.It has already been 4 weeks since I started training under Agnes' teaching. Rigid body had already reached level 23 and the wooden swordsmanship had reached level 21.Although it is said that the level up is slower as the level goes up, it seemed that the Aura awakening requirement would be fulfilled first than the divine power.I decided that I had to control the achievement of either physical strength or weapon skills. Agnes, who had come to her senses, said in a stern voice.<This is your first practical debut. Well done, Cadet Ellet.>\"Cadet? Is it training time?\"<I think it would be good for cadets to gain experience in a subjugated C-class dungeon.>\"That's great.\"It really was. I was able to learn a sense of combat and raise my experience points thanks to the beasts that attacked here and there when I get bored.[<System> Congratulations! Reached Rigid Body Lv.24.]\\n[<System> Congratulations! You have achieved Basic Wood Swordsmanship Lv.22.]\\nI also leveled up a week's worth of training.Of course, the original purpose was not forgotten. I diligently moved my legs so as not to slow my steps even as I defeated the incoming beasts.After maybe an hour or so, a tunnel made of huge bones appeared.<The ribs of a demon dragon.>I guess he was the middle boss. Like a guardian dragon of a temple.<But it's weird that it's just bones. Dragons would take a very long time to rot. Was this in a mummified state in the first place?>\"Wait a minute.\"I immediately opened the system. The real time indicated by the clock was a few minutes past midnight after I arrived at the dungeon entrance.\"I checked it now, and it seems that the time difference between this dungeon and reality is at least 20 times faster.\"<What?>In general, the time flow of the dungeons is faster than reality, but this 'Black Salt Desert' seemed to be unique.'Since six years have passed in reality, and at least 120 years in the dungeon.'It's the right time for a corpse to have turned into white bones. I only hoped that the relics could be retrieved.\"......Let's go. I'm sure they have waited long enough.\"I entered the Demon Dragon's skull and walked along the tunnel made up of his spine and ribs. And it was when it came out of the tip of his tailbone.[<System> You have entered the 'Barrier of the Black Temple'.]Whoooow!My vision became foggy and a sandstorm began to blow. The salt rushed into my mouth.Agnes was taken aback.<If you lose your sense of direction, you may be trapped in the barrier forever. Returning is....>\"It's all right.\"I just have to look at the map and go. I walked steadfastly through the storm that seemed to blow my body away. At that moment, a flickering black shadow was reflected in the hazy vision. It was slowly but surely coming towards me.<Ellet.>Agnes also warned me.I prepared my wooden sword with the intention of immediately destroying the beast obstructing my path.When it finally got closer to about five steps.\"Ugh...uh....\"\"A pe-person?\"It was a muscular middle-aged man staggering like a zombie?Thud!He even fell in front of me.<It's not a demon. It's like an adventurer in distress because of the sandstorm.>\"Wake up! Mister! No, Grandpa!\"It was when I slightly changed the name in consideration of physical age.\"Sto-Stomach....\"\"Injury to the stomach! ......you don't have one?\"\"I'm hungry.......Oh, no.

Wake up.\"\"Ung......uh.......\"He seemed unconscious.I poured the potion into his mouth, where only moans flowed and put the pill. I was worried if he could swallow it or not.\"Hmm......!\"Gulp, gulp! Chomp, chomp.

As expected, you were alive!\"\"Uh, uh......Excuse me?\"Grandpa burst into tears and hugged me. At this point, I was confused, but also very curious.Who the hell is Elthea?\u2720Aaron Jake Hispenril shivered and the muscles of his body trembled.It has been two months since he entered the dungeon in search of traces of his daughter, who ran away from home 13 years ago. He lost consciousness in a salt sand storm, and when he opened his eyes, he saw his daughter in front of him.To be exact the daughter in her childhood.\"Elthea! How hard have you suffered to become this young!\"\"Uh, um, hey, I'm not Elthea.\"\"What?\"Prince Hispenril looked at the girl again.When he saw her embarrassed face, he came to his senses at once.What he saw in front of him was a 10-year-old child. Not his daughter, who was already an adult by the time she ran away.\"My name is Ellet. I think you misunderstood me for someone, Grandpa.\"\"......\"Prince Hispenril's shoulders drooped like a deflated balloon.Yes, there's no way its Elthea.Knowing it would be hard from the beginning, he tried to soothe his upset stomach. Even though he knew the little girl wasn't his daughter, the Prince couldn't take his eyes off Ellet.'How can you be so similar to Elthea?'He even had some doubts.Could it be that it is a mirage created by the desert of the Demon Realm? The demons are trying to deceive me......!\"Grandpa, would you like a sandwich? I made it.\"\"......!\"-D-Dad, eat some cookies before you work. It-it's so delicious, it's hard to eat alone....The image of the young Elthea who came over to the office and offered a gingerbread man cookies, overlapped in his mind.\"I-I really want to eat.\"\"Yes, here it is!\"\"Huk, chew chew, sniff, sniff, hahaha! It's delicious. Really tasty.......\"\"Really? Eat more! Eat a lot!\"It was actually very tasty. It had a feeling that it tasted similar to pills made by Alchemist Rodel, who, not long ago, opened up a new world to him.At this rate, it felt like he would betray his muscles and open his eyes only to gourmet food.\"Grandpa, you must have been starving for a very long time.\"\"I starved for ten days.\"Since it was not a situation to argue about low-carb food, he cleanly finished even the bread.\"Ten days? What happened?\"\"It must have been two months since I was here. The food I brought ran out immediately, and I survived by eating the beasts. Fortunately, there's salt everywhere, so it was edible.\"\"Uh, um, you have great survivability.\"\"But it has been a problem since we entered the storm zone. I didn't see any beasts that could eat it and lost my sense of direction.\"\"You worked hard, Grandpa. You can rest assured now. I will guide you safely to the exit gate.\"The prince laughed for a moment. Isn't this small child speaking boldly as if she was going to escort him?Prince Aaron Jake Hispenril, is currently the strongest on the continent.'Hey, this child is going to be big later.'The grandfather laughed for a moment, then said with a smile.\"Sweetie, the favor is appreciated, but I have no intention of leaving the dungeon.\"\"What?\"\"If I can break through this storm, it will be a boss zone. There may be someone I am looking for over there.\"The little girl's Peridot-like pale-green eyes flickered. Even that reminded him of Elthea, and the prince felt a stinging pain in his chest.'Elthea.......Are you really here? Maybe this kid I'm looking at right now......Isn't this your soul that is bound in this dungeon?'Ellet, unaware of the fact that she had been suddenly treated as a ghost, asked.\"What kind of person is it?\"\"My daughter who disappeared 13 years ago.\"\"Ah......daughter.......\"The atmosphere suddenly became somber. Thinking that Ellet would apologize for asking something unnecessary, the Prince coughed loudly and added.\"My daughter is much older than you. If she were still alive, it wouldn't be strange if she had a daughter of your size.\"\"I see.\"\"No, wait. Thinking about it, it's not only that.\"\"What?\"\"How come she would only have one daughter? She must have had a son about two years older than you!\"\"Ah yes.......\"The prince who suddenly became too engrossed in his delusions, turned his daughter into a married woman with two children.Ellet tried to get the talk back on track before the Prince's imagination stretched further.\"Anyway, you're saying she's about my mother's age.\"\"Yes, that's right.\"Is it because of the flow of the conversation? Suddenly, the Prince became curious about the mother of a girl who looked very much like Elthea.\"Hey, how did you come into a dungeon like this? Your mother would be concerned.\"\"My mother.......\"He was happy that he succeeded in inducing the topic naturally.\"She won't be worried. She ran away six years ago and I don't know where she is.\"Startle.\"R-R-Run away?\"\"Yes.\"I shouldn't have picked that topic!While the Prince struggled to find a way to recover, a ragged voice continued.\"My mother abandoned her two children and her husband and left the house. So Dad had to put all of his efforts into raising us on his own.\"\".......\"\"Well, my brother said that she went out with a hoe and a plow to catch livestock that escaped and went missing......but as far as I can see, it's just a running away from home.\"\"I-I'm sorry. I brought up a bad story.\"Ellet smiled broadly.\"No. I was young, so I don't have any particular memories of my mother. It's okay because I've been living as someone who doesn't have one. Well......you listened to my complaint, so Grandpa can do the same.\"\"Huh? me?\"\"How did you lose your daughter?\"\".......\"The Prince's hard cheeks were dyed a peach color. He spoke out despite the overwhelming embarrassment.\"My daughter......It's a runaway.\"\"Oh.\"\"Well, but it's all my fault! My daughter ran away because I was wrong!\"\"How did she run away?\"\"That is.......\"The story of Prince Hispenril that followed was comparable to the narrative of a Ropan family drenched in the regretful tag.When the Prince was young, he had a commoner woman he loved. However, not being able to overcome the opposition of his family, and after only hurting each other, they broke up.Years later, the Prince learns that she died and that there was a child in her womb at the time of their breakup. In the end, he inquired all over the continent orphanages and managed to find his daughter, and that was Elthea.A young daughter was left behind by a woman he loved. Of course, he wanted to be nice to her and that's why he brought her home.However, the young Prince was blunt, cold-headed, and tactless at the time. He never knew how to give his daughter the love he had never received from his parents. Besides, just looking at his daughter's face reminded him of his lover, whom he couldn't protect.He couldn't even look straight into the child's face whenever he thought that the weak woman had closed her eyes after giving birth to a child alone. He thought that if he compensated his daughter for her mother's share, his guilt would go away.So the young Prince made a decision. He decided to give her the best he had, namely his family.Ellet paused for a moment and asked.\"Wow! Grandpa, were you noble? Baron? viscount?\"\"Hmm.\"\"Are you a Count? Wow!\"\"Well, it's not important, so don't worry about it.\"\"Yes, Count.\"\"What do you mean Count. Just call me Grandpa.\"\"Yes, Grandpa.\"The story continued while hiding the exact identity with a suitable adaptation.The Prince's intentions were good, but the method was a problem.His family had a very strict education system, and Elthea, who had lived as a commoner for eight years, had many shortcomings.Thus, the successor education Elthea's became unprecedentedly strict.She struggled every day from dawn until late at night with thousands of teachers to instill swordsmanship and learning into the child.And as the head of the household, the Prince....-You are now the princess of Hispenril. Behave worthy of a princess.The words he said to his daughter who brought the gingerbread man cookies explain everything.No, he'd rather say he was lucky to have made it this far.In his desire to make his daughter 'like a princess' as soon as possible, he even said these words.- Servants are watching. Refrain from calling me father in an informal way.At this point, Ellet said something.\"Oh my god....she can't even call her father, father....\"The criticism in her eyes was clearly read as to what a great family he came from to even do that. The Prince felt a great blow to his heart, but he continued the story that had already begun.\"Then one day.\"\"It's not over yet. Wait a minute. Let me get some lemon carbonated water.\"(Note: she's telling about drinking cider (satisfaction) because this story is too frustrating.)\"Well. Anyway, one day....\"A girl who looked exactly like his dead lover appeared and claimed that she was the real daughter of the Prince.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Later, he felt like both were like the first and second daughter, so it didn't matter who the real daughter was.However, the Prince's attitude toward the two was remarkably different.Elisa resembled his dead lover very much.For that reason, her delicate figure, which was so delicate that he thought would fly away when the wind blows, was particularly painful to his eyes, and the Prince could hardly control the protective instinct that came from his gut.Anyway, Elthea will be strong as his successor, and Elisa, who has a weak body, he decided to raise her carefully without making her suffer. He also had a desire to play the role of the father, which he had never been able to do for Elthea. But....\"Huh, you said Elisa was a fake?\"\"Yes. It was a scam for my family and fortune. The orphanage director, her guardian, Elisa herself... they were all together in the scam....\"\"Oh, well, so you're hard on your real daughter and full of love for your fake daughter? In front of your real daughter?\"Yes, that's right.\"\"Then what was the reason for your daughter to run away from home? The truth was revealed after she run away, right?\"\"That......at a family meeting, I announced that I would join Elisha into the family, but that night Elthea came to my office and wept sadly. I was embarrassed because I'd never seen her like that before. I thought I needed to comfort her, but I didn't know how....\"\"What you said......?\"The Prince took a deep breath.\"For being so petty, I scolded her as a disqualification as the next head of state.......\"\".......\"Ellet gulped the carbonated water, and she opened her mouth.\"Can I just say one word?\"\"Wh-what?\"\"I'd run away from home, too!\"\"Ung!\"\"You should've done better and been nicer while she was there!\"\"Kuh-huh! You said you'd only say one thing!\"\"Who cares!\"It was very hard to have the little girl lash out at him with the same face as Elthea. The old Prince, who had many tears, stole the wet tears from his eyes.\"So, it's a story of when I deceived, but I really thought of both of them as daughters...\"Excuses were not a good choice in this situation.\"You can say such words only when you have given enough faith as a family. Didn't you say that at the family meeting, you declared your own desire to make Elisa officially a family member? From the real daughter's point of view, 'Oh, you judged me as a fake daughter and publicly branded me! Then I will be kicked out soon!'\"\"Ugh....\"There was nothing to refute. Just before Elthea ran away from home, the words she spat out like coughing blood came to his mind.-Is this father's decision?-What should I do. Now that I am useless, you will not be able to let me go because of the honor of the family, so you must be very uncomfortable.-......Why are you mad? It's something you've been wishing for. You never thought of me as a daughter! Even if I die, you won't shed a single tear! I'd rather die!-That's why I'll disappear so that you won't become a stain on your family's honor! That's good, right! Are you satisfied? You must feel better now! Congratulations, Duke!'That's why you went into the dungeon alone?....'After roaming the Black Salt Desert for two months, the Prince could see traces of his daughter's unique aura and skills carved into the rocks and bones.Obviously, Elthea was the only one who came in here and stopped the dungeon burst.What the hell. An honorable death, is this what she wanted? But who is to blame? The Prince himself pushed his daughter to think of herself as a tool for the family.The prince sniffed his nose on his handkerchief.After thinking for a while, Ellet said as if she had made up her mind.\"Grandpa, I am going to the temple.\"\"What!\"The Prince was in tears and had a blocked voice, thinking of his daughter who had defeated a dungeon burst alone\"Don't make your Dad worry and go home! In the first place, the dungeon is not a place for a child like you to come!\"\"I know how to use a sword. A C-class dungeon without a boss is nothing. Above all, I know the way to the boss zone, so I can get there quickly.\"\"Really? Do you know the way?\"The Prince's attitude changed.The little girl had a knack for finding the way even in a salt sand storm where even the compass stopped working!Before the Prince could say anything, Elle suggested first.\"If we hurry to the temple, it'll only take an hour. Come with me, Grandpa.\"\u2720It was very convenient to take this grandfather. I wonder what he did with Aura, the salt sand did not touch my body as if he had opened an umbrella. Furthermore.\"Child! Your steps are too slow!\"\"Kyaa!\"Grandfather gave me a shoulder ride and sprinted at high speed. I was confused at first, but soon got used to it.\"Wow! This is exciting! Grandpa, faster!\"\"OK! Hold on tight!\"Feels like riding a train in an amusement park!I grabbed the grandfather's head with both hands. If the angle changed from the northeast side of the temple, I pulled the left and right hairs to drive his direction.\"Stop pulling! It will fall!\"\"You have a lot of hair, so I think it would be okay if it falls out a bit. You don't have to worry about baldness for the rest of your life.\"\"Hmm! That's right!\"The run at a phenomenal speed continued. In this way, the arrival time seems to be greatly shortened.I spoke in admiration of the grandfather's physical abilities.\"Grandpa, you must have been a really good knight in your old days.\"\"What do you mean about the old days!? I am still on active duty!\"\"Yes, yes. Here. You need to take supplements before muscle loss occurs.\"\"Hm......? Wait! Isn't this Rodel'spills? How can you have something that is out of stock and even money can't buy?!\"\"My dad and I made this.\"\"What?! Was Alchemist Rhodel your father?\"\"Exactly, Dad and I. Rhodel is the Rhodel of Leonard Rodellaine and Ellet Rodellaine.\"\"I see, I see. You and your dad are a miracle. To get a performance like this in a dungeon!\"\"But what's grandfather's name?\"\"Hm, just call me Grandpa Jake.\"\"Oh, Grandpa Jake. It feels very friendly.\"It was when we had about 10 minutes to get to know each other a little more.[<System> You have escaped from the 'Barrier of the Black Temple'.]The salt sand storm cleared and the sky was clear.Crrrie! Crrrie!There was also a monster that came to meet us as a commemoration of entering the new area. I could feel two desert gargoyles wandering through the air, staring at me.\"Tsk, annoying things.\"Grandpa looked like he was trying to put me on the ground, and I said quickly\"I'll take care of it.\"\"Come to think of it, you said you knew how to use a sword. Do you want to try it?\"Grandpa smiled with delight. He looked like he wanted to see a cute talent show. A disgruntled voice was heard from my necklace.<I don't like his smiling face because it resembles someone I know. Let's make fun of this grandpa, cadet Ellet.>Yes! I answered inwardly and grabbed the wooden sword.Shh!I waited while riding on his shoulders. Finally, two desert gargoyles came rushing in with their wings tilted back.As soon as they came into the gap, I drew two sharp lines.Kyeeee!The Gargoyles flew left and right, making a tearing sound. It was a shriek filled with death.\"Oh! Child, that's pretty good!\"<Heh, of course. Whose student is she?>For some reason, Agnes seemed to be more proud.\"Oh, we are here.\"[<System> You have entered the 'Black Temple' boss zone.]It was a temple building with an eerie energy that seemed to fit a fallen god. The walls and ceiling were full of cracks. Relying on the light that leaked in, we slowly went inside.Possssh.The inside was not clean.Heaps of salt sand piled up and flowed down everywhere we could see. The size varied from the size of a small mound to the size of a hill. The floor was also made of salt, so every time he walked, the grandfather's feet sank.\"There is a lot of salt inside.\"\"That's strange. I don't think there was a salt sandstorm in this area.\"\"I know, right. It's like it was moved on purpose. Does anyone have any salt farm business here?\"The question was answered when we reached the end of the hallway.There were no more heaps of salt. Instead, stone statues of salt in the form of monsters greeted us.Countless hyper-realistic salt statues.Each one was not a standalone work but harmonized with the other. It was a scene of being tangled and trampled in a mess as if trying to scramble out of the area.I could guess the identity of the artist who expressed such a creepy level of vividness.I said, getting off Grandpa's shoulder.\"It looks like they are beasts caught in stone statues. I guess that was the boss's ability.\"For example, a monster like Medusa.\"Elthea....\"Grandpa was depressed. But my thoughts were different.'In this case, there is actually hope.'We broke down the salt statues blocking the entrance and entered the huge hall. The scenery that looked like ruins told us that there was a fierce battle here.Tentacles like thorns wrapped around the temple pillars supporting the ceiling.Ours eyes raised along with the place where the tentacles were gathering.The dome ceiling was visible only when our neck was bent all the way, and at the tentacle's ends, there were huge eyes split in half.['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' says it seems to hurt, and he caresses his own eyelids.]Don't have empathy for a disgusting monster.Those tentacle-like eyes seem to have been the boss here. As it was subjugated, the salt powder fell down as if to show that it was also petrified.It was then.\"El-Elthea!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was a woman who seemed to kneel with all her might for the last attack.'Did you stop the dungeon burst by yourself?'Even after rubbing my eyes, there was only one stone statue of a single person. She seems like a very strong person.Oh, this is not the time to be surprised.\"Elthea! No way, Elthea! Why do you look like this......! Arghhh!\"Grabbing the stone statue, I approached the sobbing grandfather. I patted the grandfather's back, hoping for a little consolation.\"This is the grandfather's daughter......What?\"I squinted my eyes.\"Uh, huh?\"\"......Sniff! Why are you doing this, child?\"\"Huh......That's.......\"Seeing the stone statue up close was unbelievable.The woman in a modest linen dress did not let go of the weapon from her hands until the last minute.The two famous weapons she used to defeat an S-class boss alone, was.......A hoe! And a plow!Suddenly, I remembered Frintz telling us about his memories.- She took a hoe and a plow from the yard and went into the forest.She said that she would catch some black livestock that came out of their cage not knowing their place.Fascinated by the stone statue's face that looked exactly like me, I called her out without realizing it.\"M-Mom......?\"\"What?!\"Grandfather turned to look at me in surprise.I tried to calm myself as I looked at his wildly swaying eyes.\"Well, that's......It's the same as my mom's last description that my brother told me.\"\".......\"\"I told you that my mom didn't come back from catching animals that ran away with a plow and a hoe.\"\"Well, you did......\"\"Look. Here, a hoe in her right hand, and a plow in her right, and livestock that almost escaped the dungeon up there......the eye monster?\"\".......\"\".......\"For a moment, there was a chilling air current.The grandfather squatted straight toward me instead of hugging his daughter's stone statue.After a while, we attained enlightenment and opened our mouths at the same time, regardless of who came first.\"Then the mother who ran away.......\"\"Then the daughter who ran away from home because grandfather was upsetting......\"The identities of the habitual runaway matched to a T.Grandpa's eyes widened violently. Sharing the joy of meeting his grandchildren was decided to be postponed for a while.First of all, we had to help the person who became a stone statue of salt.\"There are no fatal injuries. If we release the petrification, there is a high chance that she will come back to life.\"\"Yes, it is. I have to go to the Vatican right now and ask for someone who can lift a curse......!\"I calmed my grandfather.\"You don't have to.\"\"What?\"\"Can you promise that you will keep a secret of what you will see from now on?\"\"Why do you......Yes, I promise.\"The grandfather who read my seriousness nodded and after a small thank-you, I stood up straight, facing the salt statue who I believed to be my mother.\"Descent!\"\"Oh, child?\"My hair color changed to silver, my eyes turned gold, and my legs floated in the air. Grandpa hurriedly grabbed my wrist as if he was grabbing a kite that was about to fly away.\"it's okay. It doesn't go up that high.\"\"Wh-what is this...suddenly such a great divine power...Besides, it's a Descent of Divinity......?\"\"I'm deeply religious. Would you believe in God, too? I'm looking for new believers.\"Recalling the forgotten pyramid business, I secretly carried out missionary activities. But grandfather was embarrassed and only muttered.As expected, there would be no way to get the deal sealed just by talking.\"Omniscience.\"I opened the search engine and looked for a skill to break the curse of the salt statue. I gently placed one hand on the statue's forehead and solemnly spoke to grandfather, who was full of tension and anticipation.\"With the grace of God, I will undo the petrification. When the petrification is released, I hope you will engrave God's mercy on your heart for the rest of your life.\"\"Oh, I see! God bless you, please hurry!\"\"Yes. Omnipotence. The baptism of purification.\"[<System> Advanced skill 'Baptism of Purification Lv.46 (+10)' is activated.]The light from my hand was absorbed by the statue's forehead.Jok! Juk! Jok!The surface of the stone statue cracked like an egg before hatching.\"......Puha!\"The woman, whose petrification has been released, burst into breath at the scattering salt powder. Her messy, voluminous hair was, as expected, pink.She snorted and spat out the salt in her mouth and got annoyed.\"Oh, damn it! I made a mistake at the end and opened my eyes! A lot of time must have passed...... Huh? Father?\"\"Elthea! Oh my God!\"It seems that he was in a situation where he naturally called for god.[<System> Converted atheist to believer.]As planned, the Descent assimilation rate had risen.['The World-building God' is satisfied with the spread of faith.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' chews her lips in envy.]I unleashed Descent and watched the father-daughter reunion. Grandfather hugged my mother, the daughter he had found for the first time in 13 years. He almost locked her on his pectoralis major muscle.\"Elthea! WHUAUAA! Elthea!\"\"Wh-why is father here....\"The agitation was only momentary. Mother soon straightened her face, clenched her teeth, and shouted harshly.\"Get out of here. It's disgusting!\"\"El-Elthea!\"\"Oh, get out of my way!\"\"El......Guha!\"Thud!I opened my mouth. It was because mother had thrown grandfather far away.'A giant that weighs more than 100 kilograms......!'['The World-building God' whispers to you that you should listen to your mother.]I-I will.Mom shook her hand as if it was nothing and swept her hair.\"Huh? Are you...Ellet...?\"She found me\"Ah....\"My name was called, but I couldn't answer, in confusion.I'm supposed to say.....hello.Strangely, that easy 'hello' lingered in my mouth. Mother came to me as I was just blankly standing in place.\"Ellet! Eli! You are my babe, right? Why are you so big? Oh, no! This can't be! Missing all of my daughter's cute and lovely childhood!\"\".......\"\"No, rather than that, why are you in the dungeon? How come you are in such a dangerous place...Are you hurt? Come here, let me have a look, huh?\"\".......\"She squatted down and made eye contact with me. The eyes that scanned my limbs and my face were filled with worry and love.Why? It's somewhat hard to breathe.This is weird.\"I don't think you're hurt....... Are you all right?\"Nod.\"Whew, that's good. Anyway, this is really crazy. How many years have passed.......How old is my baby?\"Seems like it's time to give a slightly haunting answer.\"Te... ten years old.\"\"Oh, this is mental! It's been 6 years?! Ah, sorry for the bad words! Oh, how have you been? Did you miss Mom a lot?\"\".......\"\"Ma-Maybe you don't remember mom? It's mom, I'm your mother....It's not like you don't remember me, right? huh?\"\".......\"\"Baby, why? Say something. Don't make that face....\"......What's my face like?I patted my face with both hands. However.I don't understand.I don't know.The pouring of worries and affection was so sweet, warm, and fuzzy. I couldn't resist the cotton candy-like kindness I had received from a female adult for the first time.It was even a little confusing.Why?What the hell?It's been a while since I've taken over the life of Ellet Rodellaine, so why am I so shaken by the presence of my transmigrated body's mother?Even at this moment, I put up with something as I was about to cry, holding back my words in my choked throat.\"I'm.....sorry......I-I don't remember.\"\"......Th-that, yes, it can happen. The last time I saw you was when you were four years old.\"Mom was visibly sullen. Did she not want to be caught with a distorted face as if she was about to cry? My mother hugged me again and patted me on the back.Pat pat....\".......\"The body temperature that came from her body, which had completely dissolved the petrification, was warm.Oh, I shouldn't do this.I felt like I was going back to being a child.The happiest thing in accepting the life of Ellet Rodellaine was the presence of a father and a brother. My family, who loved me and is unconditionally on my side, had eaten up all the shortcomings of being transmigrated in an S-class survival novel.Yes, frankly, I liked my transmigrated life.I think it was even more so because I felt strangely familiar with my father and brother in here. It's not the first time I've thought that this is what would feel like, if all my family members in the previous life had transmigrated here.It was ironic that there was no mother even after transmigrated, but since I was used to it anyway, I thought that my father and my brother were enough.Right, that's enough. I have a childish body, but what is my mental age? I'm all grown up. The age of needing a mother is long gone....But it was not.A mom.I wish I had one.'I wish I had a mother too.'I needed a mom. I wished I had a mother.This wish will be the same even if I go back to the age of my previous life, or even if I grow old and have a lot of white hair. For both adults and the elderly, a mother is a mother.After realizing that, it was as if a child in my heart, who had not been able to grow up due to a lack of it, raised its head.Then a crying voice was heard.\"E-Even so...... m-mom is back now. I'm in front of Eli now. S-So...Won't you call me mom... ... ? Hm......?\"\"Mom... ... .\"\"Yes! Yes, Eli! It's Mom!\"I was really curious about something.\"Mom......Where have you been?\"\"......Hm?\"\"Why are you giving me a hug just now?\"\".......\"\"Can I...... really have a.....mother......?\"\".......\"My mouth eventually moved on its own, and I acted like a child.No answer was heard. Instead, the hug became a little warmer.\"Mom is sorry, I'm sorry. I've been away from home for too long leaving Eli, Frintz, and Dad. I'm sorry! Really sorry! And thank you. Even without me, you grew up so pretty and courageous.\"\".......\"\"I will never leave again. Now we will never be separated. We will live together forever. We will be happy. Okay? It's a promise, hm?\"\"Promise......\"I think I got the answer to something I've always been curious about.This is what a Mother is like.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a long time, after a very, very long time, the message came.['The World-building God' tells you not to forget to pack your items.]From the long hesitation and dry content, deep kindness was conveyed. I laughed softly.'Yes!'At that time, as if judging that the mother-daughter reunion had been sufficiently accomplished, grandfather carefully intervened.\"Well......Elthea.\"\"Who are you?\"\"It-It's Father!\"\"I don't have a Father.\"\"Kuch-Hop!\"Grandpa stopped breathing as if an arrow had been shot in his chest. Mom hugged me tighter by the shoulders and shot back coldly.\"You found your real daughter. I found my real family, too. I'm going to live with my family.\"\"I-I kicked Elisa out! The orphanage director and Viscount Bisten deceived me by setting up a scam with a theater actor. It was a scam targeting our family. Now that we've cleaned everything up, let's go home now, Elthea. Please?\"\"My home is not there.\"Grandfather was at a loss at mother's determination.\"I-I'll hand you the title right away. There is no need to suffer outside. If you bring your husband and children to live....\"\"A title? Property? Do you think that means anything to Aura users like me?\"\"T-then, Elthea....\"\"I don't need anything.\"My mother didn't even listen. Grandpa was restless and poured out his words as if hanging to the last hope.\"I-I was wrong, Elthea. The fact that I treated you strictly it's because I wanted to quickly raise you as the heir, regretting everything I did to you I worked hard on Elisa wanting to atone because I had failed to be a proper father to you.\"\"When Elisa was there, you treated me as invincible, now that she's not, you came to me to say you cared?\"\"A-At least, remember one thing. The reason I cared so much about Elisha was that I projected you onto the child. The things I couldn't do to you keep coming to mind, so I wanted to do something like a father with a heart of atonement....\"\"You call it an excuse? I was practice, and she was the real deal?!\"\"Un, huk, sniff. That, yes it's all lame excuses. I was just stupid, I was all wrong....\"\"......Wait, what are you doing?!\"Eventually, grandfather knelt down to his knees in front of mother.Mother grabbed him by the shoulder and tried to get him up, but grandfather didn't budge, even with the strength she had earlier threw him far away.\"As a poor and terrible father, I did not know how to love and care for you as a daughter. So please, please. Give me a chance to learn how to love you even now.......\"\".......\"\"Ho-how can you forgive this father? Just say the word, I'll do anything, really anything......\"\"......\"Mother quietly turned away from grandfather.\"El-Elthea! D-Don't turn around, Elthea! Show me your face! Please!\"\".......\"I didn't think my mother would be such a tough cookie.I could see everything from her side. Holding my hand tightly, my mother grimaced as if she was about to cry. Mother still had her back turned to Grandpa and after barely clearing her voice, she said.\"......I don't want to see your face yet. Give me some time.\"\".......\"\"I was happier to leave that house. I don't want to go back to that choking and stifling place and I don't want to take over the family.\"With those words, Grandpa slumped his shoulders so much that I wondered if his muscles had shrunk.\"I'll wait. I'll keep waiting. And once again, I'm really sorry.\"\".......\"Tuk Tuk.Mother, who is an Aura user, can probably hear the sound of water drops on the floor where grandfather was kneeling.It was then that some cracks appeared in her iron wall.\"If you are so sorry....\"It was an atmosphere where an opportunity for atonement would be given. Grandfather readily raised his head.\"Just talk! Anything!\"\"Just screw up one person, no, uh, how do you say? Ah, um, uh......ah! Give him a hard time.\"I was moved by the mother's choice of words, which showed her great care for her children's education.\"Who do want me to give a hard time to?!\"\"Hickim Sarmatan.\"Oh, my.Here is the name of our father's enemy!Mom angrily wiped her face with one of her hands. A gleam of murdering aura flashed across her eyes, which was revealed after her hands were removed.\"I was going to cut his thro-, no, I mean, I was going to get back at him, but I couldn't because a dungeon burst suddenly occurred near my house.\"\"What did he do? Could it be that he did harm to you?!\"\"He's an elder alchemist from the Golden Ivory Tower who harassed and exploited my husband.\"\"What! Our son-in-law?!\"At this point, I helped to provide the latest information.\"Not only that! Later, he was framed as a research thief and kicked out of the ivory tower. Because of that, you don't know how hard he struggled to raise me and brother as we moved here and there.\"\"......Did that happen?\"In an instant, Aura was nestled in mother's hoe.Grandfather rushed out, fearing that he would lose the chance to use the parasitic master as a redemption ticket.\"Leave it to me! I will take responsibility for Hickim Satan and judge him in the name of justice.\"\"It's Hickim Sarmatan. Please memorize the name of the sinner first, not the name of justice.\"\"Yes! Anyway, that guy! To persecute my son-in-law and the great alchemist who created the culinary fantasy of pills and potions! I cannot forgive him!\"Grandpa pounded his chest muscles. Seeing him speak so confidently, it seems that grandfather had quite a lot of power.He noticed that mother's expression softened and carefully spoke a few words.\"El-Elthea.

In times like these, you need someone to push your back.\"Mom, I think I will miss Grandpa too.\"\"Ye-yes! It's good that the grandchildren will also have allowance money to spare!\"\"......I'll think about it because my child said so.\"\"Re-really?! Please think about it! Thanks! Thank you very much!\"\"Okay, calm down. No need to make a fuss about it.\"I also pretended to be half-hearted to match her, but my mother's expression looked more comfortable than before.\"My pretty daughter, hands with mom.\"\"Hand!\"My mom held my hand and smiled sweetly. I was laughing my head off too.\"......Wait.\"Suddenly, mother's face became frighteningly stiff, as if she was ready for a fit of anger.\"Eli, you....\"\"Yeah?\"What? What I did do wrong?\"What's going on? Why are you looking at a child with a terrifying face?....\"\"Eli!\"\"Oh my god!

I have to go to the doctor. I have to close the dungeon right now....\"\"Oh, Mom, wait a minute.\"As I grabbed her wrist with my hot hand, mother looked back, her face distorted with anxiety and concern.\"Don't worry. It's called God's Fever, but it'll be fine in two days.\"\"What do you mean fever?\"\"That......I don't have time, so please ask Grandpa for details. More than that, I have a request. As for the fever, it's a secret, so please, let's stay in the dungeon a little longer until I recover.\"I don't want to worry my dad, brother, and Bianca because I've been sick for two days. To do that, I need to use the fast time flow of the dungeon.\"But this high fever.......\"\"Please. I'm begging you. Please.\"\".......\"There was no answer, but I had a feeling that she would hear me out.\"I have food and camping gear in my satchel, so please use it. Then I......I'll take a nap for a while and wake up.......\"\"Ah, Eli!\"\"Baby!\"My head bent over backward.[<System> You suffer from 'God's fever' as a result of unreasonable use of the Divinity.

They pitched a tent in the ruined temple and stayed there for two days to nurse me.\"Do you know how much Mom was worried!?\"As soon as the penalty fever was lifted, the first thing that came into view was the face of my mother with swollen eyes.Mom hugged me tightly and cried for a long time, then she let me go after I complained that I was choking.Grandfather handed a handkerchief to Mom, who was still sniffling her nose. Mom graciously took it, blew her nose, and returned it to grandfather.It looked very natural and friendly.\"You opened your eyes, baby. Are you feeling well?\"\"Yes. Sorry for worrying you.\"It seems that while I was asleep, grandfather explained to Mom the power I possessed and the 'Descent of Divinity'.There was no need for me to explain again to Mom the secret to immediately breaking the petrification curse and the cause of my fever. However, Mom was a little dissatisfied.\"If the cost of using Descent had to be this painful, we could have waited for someone from The Vatican.\"\"I wanted to see Mom soon.\"\".......\"As soon as Mom made a tearful face again, grandfather stepped out.\"Hmm! Now that you are up, have breakfast. Let's eat and go out.\"The sun in the dungeon was in the middle of the sky, and in reality, it would be dawn, but because I had finally woken up after a long time sleeping, grandfather set the standard as the morning.Grandfather prepared a breakfast table consisting of duck meatball skewers, herb salad, honey roll bread, and fig jam. Of course, we just took out everything that was in my satchel.\"My granddaughter is a good cook, too!\"\"She takes after Leo.\"Mother replied, tearing the honey bun in half.Whether it was true that she was a noble young girl who had received a rigorous education, Mom's eating movements were unparalleled elegant.Now that the family meal has been prepared, a friendly conversation could not be missed.\"Eli, Dad didn't look for someone else while Mom was away, right?\"The knife that applied jam shone coldly. Looks like it had a little bit of aura.\"Dad was always missing my mom.\"\"Really?\"\"Yes. As soon as he finally had some free time and money to spare after a long time, he told us he wanted to visit the house where he lived with Mom.\"\"Oh my, my! That Leo is really. When we meet, I should reward him thickly.\"Looking at my mother, blushing like a girl while thinking about the one who loves her, makes my heart warm.Mom was very curious about how our family was doing at Gillette Estate. I didn't know much about life before I transmigrated, but I know we were living like pushovers, so I cut it short as much as possible and focused on the story after I transmigrated.Mom listened intently, her eyes shining. It looked as if she was trying to fill in the six years she couldn't be with our family with my words.On the other hand, there were people who lost 13 years.Grandfather wondered about the story of the seven years from the time mother ran away from home until she became a salt statue in this dungeon.Mom reluctantly opened her mouth.\"I don't think it's a good thing to hear....... Immediately after I left the house, I was overwhelmed with evil thoughts, so I went into the SS-class dungeon alone without thinking about anything.\"\"Kuh! That, like that... ... !\"\"But after being beaten up by the boss a little bit, I came back to my sense. Fortunately, the boss zone was open and the boss was also a beast type with no intelligence, so I was able to escape after hiding for a few days.\"\"Whew.......\"\"After I got out of the dungeon, I was in a hurry to heal my injuries, so I tried to warp to the city center. However, it seems that the warping stone was damaged during battle. My husband found and healed me after I warped to the wrong forest and collapsed. I wanted to forget everything while living like that.\"\"Ugh....\"\"Life was on the poor side. The only thing I could do while living off his goodwill was to catch prey. I wanted to hide my name and work as a mercenary, but I got pregnant quickly and I had severe morning sickness, so I couldn't. After that, I was busy with childcare.\"\"I-I see....\"How do parents feel when they hear the story of their daughter's free-spirited cohabitation before marriage? I could not know, but I gave grandfather a little more herb salad.Herbs were good for mental and physical stability.\"......No need for dressing.\"\"Yes.\"Now it was grandfather's turn. There's something I've been curious about for a while.\"Grandpa, you said you were a noble. What kind of family is it?\"\"Hm-mh! Let me tell you what kind of person is this Grandfather......!\"\"It's nothing much. He's just playing the king on a little piece of land.\"\"What do you mean small? Compared to the title, it's not that small!\"The arguments between the two were conflicting, so I had to make my own judgment.\"So what's the family name?\"\"You will be surprised to hear it!\"\"I wouldn't be!\"Grandfather was triumphantly stretching his chest muscles and when I faced him and imitated him, he said.\"It's Hispenril.\"\"......What?\"What? Huh? Hmm?I think I heard it wrong.\"This grandpa is Aaron Jake Hispenril!\"\"......Oh my god.\"It was a familiar name. It was the name of the strongest man on the continent, who took the top spot until the main character repeated the regression 40 times.Really?I looked at my mom for confirmation. Mom just ate meatball skewers with a look of disapproval.If it's like this, I have no choice but to ask.\"Mom...... was a princess......?\"\".......\"It was a silence of positivity.The pendant necklace rang.<Somehow, I didn't like him from the first time I saw him.......>For reference, Aaron Jake Hispenril and Agnes Azlit were famous for being fierce rivals and classmates at the Knights Academy when they were young.On the other hand, grandfather seized a golden opportunity to express the family's splendor.He looked at me and said in the tone of a teacher in class.\"Baby, as expected you're smart. That's right! Mom is a princess! So what happens to her when your mother inherits the Duke's seat? Our little child here becomes a princess!\"\"......!\"Oh my god! Jackpot!Princess! The secret of birth is revealed! In addition, a rise in status!'Th-the true essence of childcare......!'['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' clicks his tongue asking why you still haven't given up on the dream of childcare.]It's because you always give me hope!But everything was just hope torture.\"I have no intention of going back.\"At Mom's firm voice. I and Grandpa shrugged our shoulders at the same time.['The Scales that Judges the Soul' gently tempts you to give up childcare and go to the R-rated reverse harem Ropan.]The reverse harem keyword has added to Libra's taste.(Note: Libra is another word for Scales, and used as this goddess nickname.)['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' insist that you already have Bianca.]Oh, come on.Then my grandfather glanced sideways at me, looked at Mom's eyes, and said something.\"Th-The child seems to want to come to the family....\"How dare you sneak up on the granddaughter's shield? This is quite an awkward situation.\"Grandpa.\"\"Yes?\"\"I wanted it a lot, very much, I sincerely coveted the position of a princess. But I respect Mom's decision. If Mom hates it, I hate it too, and if she doesn't like it, I also don't need it.\"\"......\"Sorry Grandpa, but I'm drawing the line.Mom has been badly hurt by Grandpa for a long time, and she has not yet untangled her heart.I was the one who criticized grandfather even when I heard the story without knowing that his runaway daughter was Mom. I could not make a shallow change of posture because I was momentarily blinded by the position of a princess.As for the bloodline issue, Mom is the only way to connect me and grandpa. So, Mom's heart is important, and it is right to follow her choices and actions.\"S-Such resolution ....\"Mom chuckled as she looked at the embarrassed grandfather.\"I don't know who the adult is and who the child is. Shame on you for thinking of using your granddaughter.\"\"I-I-I'm sorry. I have no face to show...\"Grandpa lowered his head with a face stained in red. Meanwhile, Mom hugged me and rubbed our faces together.\"Oh, you are so pretty. As expected, this is a daughter made by Leo and me.\"\"Hehehe.\"It's okay if I don't upgrade my status right away.'As long as my family is around, I'm good.'That alone made me happy enough.In addition, life in Count Gillette's Castle where Bianca lives was good, and the household's lack of means was only going to get better thanks to the success of the potion business.So I don't have to be a princess.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' says t's a good self-justification since you can't leave Count Gillette during the tutorial.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' was laughing out loud saying that childcare was impossible by nature.]['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' is satisfied with the setting in which you have no choice but to be tied to Bianca.]\".......\"Phew, can't I block this?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But he didn't stop it.From now on, Mom is going to meet Dad and Brother after 6 years. Our family also needed a perfect closure, in private.\"I-I'll be waiting for Thanksgiving.\"\"......Go first.

Mom quietly watched him until the end, without any extra words.\"Let's go too, Eli.\"\"Yes.\"Mom took my hand and we headed towards the hut.In reality, two and a half hours had passed since I entered the dungeon. If Dad and Brother woke up and found me missing, they might be worried.\"Eli! Eli, where are you!\"Not surprisingly, as I approached the house, I heard my father's voice.Dad, seen over the bushes, was looking around in his pajamas with a lamp in his hand. Soon after, my brother ran to my father in the backyard.\"I've looked all over the house, but I can't find her anywhere.\"\"Where is she at this time of the night....\"Mom took a deep breath next to me.A father who is in his 30s and a son who has grown up so much.

My father, who was trying to say something, stopped when he saw my mother who was with me.\"This......How.......\"Dad slowly approached with his gaze fixed as if only Mom could be seen in the world. Mom waited in her place with a weeping smile, and when the distance was narrowed to the point where the hands could reach.\"Oh......!\"Mom grabbed dad and hugged him tightly.\"You did a great job while I was away. I'm sorry I'm back only now, Leo.\"\"Really......Are you Elthea?\"\"Yes, it's me.\"\"E-Elthea......!\"This time it was Dad, who tightly hugged Mom. His watery-drenched voice echoed through the night air.\"Why......! Where did you go, that you're back only now......! M-Me, I thought you left me......I thought you were gone......\"\"I can't live without seeing you for a day. I wouldn't do that.\"\"Then where were you until now? Are my eyes wrong? You......Why does it seems like you didn't change at all?\"\"That's because I fell into a dungeon.\"\"What! Dungeon? Why were you in such a dangerous place!\"\"Uh, how did it happen? Anyway, the beast there was a guy who used special tricks, so I turned into a stone statue of salt, so I couldn't come out. Well......I'll tell you the details later.\"\"Okay. You're back, that's all that matters. Thanks for coming back. Thank you very much. Don't go anywhere, anymore. Stay by my side.\"\"Yes, I will. I promise.\"\"Elthea......\"\"Leo.......\"A touching reunion was heading towards the finale.Two people were caressing their cheeks as if trying to confirm each other's existence. I feel like the distance between their face was getting smaller and smaller.Hmmm.I have to pretend I didn't see... No, first of all, I have to cover Frintz's eyes first... But where is brother? As I was looking around, Frintz announced his location.\"Mom?\"\"......!\" (Dad)\"......Oh, Frintz! My son!\" (Mom)The two came to their senses at the sound of their innocent son's voice and fell apart from each other. Mom, who coughed to change the mood, said to Frintz, who was five steps away.\"Yes, Frintz. It's mom. Do you remember, me?\"\"I-I remember. When I was 6 years old...... You went to catch livestock with a hoe and a plow in this outfit.......\"\"That's right. Our Frintz was six years old, and he's already grown up like this. Come here, let me give you a hug.\"\"Mom!\"Frintz burst into tears and hugged Mom. The charge of her son, now a grown boy, was fierce. But Mom took it easy and even held him up to take his feet out of the ground and twirled in her place.Meanwhile, I sneakily approached Dad.\"I'm sorry I left without saying anything. But, I brought Mom back, so can you please let me go once?\"\"Eli......\"Dad's wet eyes were sweet as always. I saw a large hand approaching me and thought he was going to pat my head, so I gave my head right away.\"Ouch!\"But he pinched my cheek.\"This is punishment.\"\"So-Sowwy....\"After stretching my cheeks out like a rice cake, Dad patted my head while I was rubbing my returned cheek.\"This is an award. Thanks for finding Mom, Eli.\"\"......Hehe, let's hug Mom too, Dad.\"I grabbed Dad's hand and went to Mom and Frintz. Mom was wiping Frintz's face, covered in tears and runny nose.After I made fun of his appearance, Frintz hugged Mom to hide his face and I also hugged Mom from the other side.And finally, Dad hugged everyone.The four of us stayed together for a long time, hugging each other. We smiled brightly at each other with tearful faces.\u2720A month after that.The Golden Ivory Tower, a holy land for alchemists located in the Principality of Hispenril, was experiencing a period of hardship for the first time in its 300-year history.'Ah, it can't go on like this! The Golden ivory tower may be ruined in my mandate!'The Tower Chief, Karlon Logos, who now bears the responsibility of the Golden Ivory Tower, was about to die.It started about a month ago. The huge donations and research grants that came in every month to the Golden Ivory Tower were cut in half.This is because Prince Hispenril, a big shot in the world of sponsoring, abruptly announced the suspension of sponsorship.It wasn't just that. Various regulations sprung up in the principality one after another, all in the name of managing the quality of craftsmen's products and the integrity of the distribution.The first application target was the healing potions.The Ivory Tower, which had made huge profits by selling the low-quality potions made by the apprentices during the practice session, was inevitably damaged.'The money line is dry! At this rate, the Golden Ivory Tower will be crushed! Ah, why did something like this happen when I was the Tower's chief......!'It didn't end here.Recently, tax inspectors from the Duchy even stormed into the laboratory and private residence of the tower chief, Karlon.They apologized, but they rummaged through his space in front of him, saying they had no choice because an anonymous tax evasion accusation was received.If it was another alchemist there were possible grounds for suspicion, but out of all people, they were targeting Hickim Sarmatan, who has walked a life focused only on research, and in which even dust doesn't come out when he shakes it.Karlon knew immediately who the anonymous accuser was. He thought, trembling with humiliation.'You fucking Duke, you bastard! Why the hell are you doing this to me!'As a result, Kalon immediately wrote a letter to Prince Hispenril.The gist of the letter, written in a fluid style comparable to a love letter, that took up to fifty thousand six-character to complete, was as follows.'If you have any complaints, speak up, bastard!'The Prince also sent a solemn and respectful reply.'Okay. I will go to the place where the old geezers flock.'Thus, the two met at the Golden Ivory Tower.Sushh.Kalon, who aged ten years in a month, poured tea by his own hand.It was an expensive tea made by brewing seven types of herbs grown only with holy water and used in top-notch healing potions.The dessert to be served was decided as a muscle supplementation pill according to the Prince's taste.Of course, it was difficult to use the one made in the ivory tower, and it took a much effort to find his preferred pills made by Alchemist Rodel. It tasted and looked like raw chocolate, and it went well as a refreshment for tea time.The Prince, who still had a nice and artistic muscular body, sat across from him and lifted his cup.\"Hmm! Long time no see, Tower Chief.\"\"Yes, long time no see, sir.\"\"By the way, I think your face has shrunk to half the size. Are you eating well and exercising? Muscles are important as you get older, do you want me to teach you some weight training suitable for your age?\"\".......\"Pretending to be worried while you are the one who made me like this!'Until you became a tyrannical crazy Duke, I was jogging five laps of the ivory tower every morning!'Karlon groaned but held it in. Sadly, he didn't have any patience left to exercise, so he rushed to the point.\"The prince will be busy protecting the peace of the principality, so I will get straight to the point. It seems that the reason for your discomfort is in our Tower, if so, please tell me exactly what the problem is. I will correct it.\"\"Hmm! It's a misunderstanding that I feel uncomfortable. I feel as good as my great thoracic muscles these days.\"The Prince fluttered his arms, showing off his wriggling chest muscles while striking a pose.Karlon just wanted to leave his seat, whether the survival of the Tower was in check or not.'Should I just retire?'It seemed like a good idea. He, who had only studied, was too innocent and pure in order to face such a dirty political exercise of power.'Okay, let's give up the Tower Chief's position to Hickim Sarmatan and run away!'Although Hickim was a guy with endless greed, looking at the research results he has published so far, his ability was solid.Above all, in terms of using the disciples to favorably wash public opinion, win the favor of the wealthy, suck up donations, and form factions with alchemists in the tower, there was no other to face him in terms of politics.While Karlon was thinking about escaping from reality, the Prince picked up the pill and ate it.\"Hmm! Very good!\"\"Well, do you like it?\"\"Of course. My son-in-law and granddaughter made it.\"\"What?\"I've never heard of it.\"Son-in-law? What do you mean by...Perhaps, did you find the princess?!\"\"Yes. I found my daughter after 13 years, and that's not all. I found my daughter and got a son-in-law, a granddaughter, and a grandson!\"The Prince chuckled.If I make him feel better here, things will work out. Karlon was motivated once more.\"Oh, congratulations! Now that you mention it, it seems that your son-in-law is alchemist Rodel. He seems to be a great talent that is hard to find even in the Tower. What do you want me to do? If it's okay with you, I'll make a seat for him in the tower right now....\"In an instant, the cheerful smile on the prince's face was completely bleached of vigor.\"You kicked him out and now, you want him back?\"\"Huh? What......?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"There is one among you who kicked my son-in-law out of the tower.\"\"......!\"In an instant, Karlon's brain jolted.This is it, the reason why the Prince thoroughly roasted me until now!\"......Hmmm, I think we've talked enough. It was good tea. As you said, I'm busy with government affairs, so I'll go back now.\"\"What? Oh yes! Take care, sir.\"After the Prince had left, Karlon rejoiced that he had finally found a breakthrough. But those feelings lasted only for a moment, and his old face was dyed with anger.'What kind of bastard!'The one who dared to touch the Prince's son-in-law and made me suffer because of it! If caught, I'll never let you go!\"......Now that we know the reason, you guys have to work hard.\"\"Yes, Master!\"Karlon summoned five of his most trusted and capable disciples to conduct a thorough investigation of the list of banned alchemists.The disciples discovered the personal details of the man in question, and the reason for his expulsion and that made their eyes widen.\"Master, look at this. Leonard Rodellaine! Rodel is in the name.\"\"He is of an appropriate age and looking at his portrait, he was handsome. Princess Elthea must have liked it too.\"\"It is recorded that he was very talented towards potion alchemy. The characteristics of the potions and pills released by 'Rodel' are similar.\"\"This guy, no, this alchemist is definitely the Prince's son-in-law.\"\"Let's see....\"The reason for his dismissal was that he stole research materials from his teacher, Hickim Sarmatan.Karlon was startled.\"Hi-Hickim? What do you mean Hickim?!\"Why is the name of the next potential Ivory Tower Chief candidate coming from here?'Ah, no! No way!'But.\"Master! Here is a report on Professor Hickim and the Prince's son-in-law in detail.\"\"Oh, we are not sure yet, let's not call him the prince's son-in-law for now.\"\"Master, with all due respect, it seems that he is indeed the Prince's son-in-law.\"\"Gasp.\"The contents of the report brought by the youngest, most capable disciple, were shocking.Leonard Rodellaine was once a promising talent because of his excellent admissions results.He was said to have been lined up with elders who wanted to make him a disciple, and Hickim, who was not an elder at the time and had not achieved much, snatched him away.The trick employed was beyond lame and despicable.It was the result of blatantly making use of manipulation of his self-esteem lying that the elders would not pick him because he was nothing much, to the accusation that there is a rule that if you do not find a teacher and quickly register within the day, he would be expelled.\"What? Pretending to be kind, and coercing him to go under the tutelage, he basically made a connection by snatching it?\"\"Yes, sir! His personality is quite the opposite of you, teacher!\"\"If that's true, he's a complete bastard, isn't he? Youngest, is this reliable information?\"\"Master, do you not believe me? I'm feeling sad.\"\"I lied. Our youngest is so cute that I forgot for a moment that you are the heir of the Dark Intelligence Guild Leader.\"\"I understand. I also forget sometimes because I am cute.\"\".......\"Karlon finished reading the report, taking in the youngest's nerve-stabilizing potion that was being handed down to him.From the moment the rotten discipleship relationship was formed, it was a full-fledged start to tragedy.Leonard's performance, which the Ivory Tower was paying attention to, was sluggish, and on the other hand, Hickim was on the rise. Leonard, who was expected by everyone as a raw stone, was easily forgotten and was treated as a stone by the roadside.In the meantime, Hickim poured out research results to the extent that his incompetence just before his rise could not be understood.The most remarkable achievement was in the field of regeneration potions. A regeneration potion that regenerates amputated body parts. If only this was developed, alchemy would no longer be treated as a backward technique when compared to divine power.It was like the long-awaited project of the alchemy world, so Hickim received the support of numerous alchemists at once and was elected an elder of the Ivory Tower.\"......But could it be that all these great studies were stolen from the disciple?\"\"Yes. In fact, there has been one such exposure attempt.\"\"When?! Why didn't I know?\"\"Inevitably, Master was recovering from pneumonia, so it happened when Hickim was in full control of the tower. It was before I enlisted.\"\"Oh, then it must have been six years ago.\"\"Yes. That was the moment when the Prince's son-in-law was expelled from the Ivory Tower. It's right on the back page.\"The courageous person who accused Hickim was an elder alchemist named Orca Getter.He shouted the truth that Hickim had exploited the flaws of the apprenticeship system to intercept the research results of his disciple, Leonard. But......\"Hickim is also incredibly good at politics.\"\"Yes. After all, the only real skill he had was to play dirty tricks.\"Contrary to the accusation, evidence and testimonies began pouring out that the disciple was the one who stole Hickim's research. Public opinion swelled that Orca had framed Hickim because of jealousy, and all the newspapers of the Principality were busy covering for Hickim and swearing at Orca.There was no implementation of true justice. Orca faced a headwind and was dismissed from his position as an elder, and confined himself to the laboratory due to social phobia.Leonard was silently kicked out of the tower.\"For reference, it is said that at the time of his departure, Leonard Rodellaine had a six-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter, both of whom had pink hair.\"\".......\"Princess Elthea's pink hair is famous. The fact that he has a son and a daughter is also consistent with the existence of grandchildren mentioned by the Prince.After checking all the information, Karlon finally came to a conclusion.\"Hickim Sarmatan! This is the culprit bastard! Go get him, now!\"\"Yes, Master! What should we do? \"The five disciples, who had their eyes shining, waited for the command. It was the moment, the Ivory Tower Chief, who can exercise absolute power like a god within the tower, will show his real power.We can't wait to see it!Karlon exclaimed.\"Call the 12 Elders under me, including Hickim! Right now!\"\u2720\"An emergency meeting?\"It was a sudden call, but I was able to quickly find a reason to understand the convocation.These days, the financial situation of the Golden Ivory Tower was in jeopardy due to the pressure of the Prince.'What kind of crazy person goes against the Prince. Tsk.Tsk!'Hickim Sarmatan, was a middle-aged alchemist with the only hair left behind on his sideburns.He confidently assumed that he wasn't the crazy one. He was born with the ability to win the favor of high-ranking people with great shrewdness. The years of receiving research funds and donations from many people prove this.In any case, the Tower Chief of this generation was a timid old man, so he did not know how to respond flexibly to political games. This kind of problem would be over if Hickim himself went to the Prince and rubbed his hands once.'That's why I have to be the Tower Chief.'This is how crisis makes heroes. I have to go to the emergency meeting and solve the problem by showing off my insight and ability to respond.As the next Tower Chief, shouldn't I be able to do this much?With that thought in mind, Hickim moved triumphantly to the Elders' meeting room. All the elders, including the Tower Chief, were already seated in the conference hall.Hickim was proud of the fact that he was the last to appear, just like the main character.\"Haha, I'm a little late because I've been busy with research.\"\"If you are here, sit down.\"Karlon, whose eyes are especially strange today, immediately started the meeting.\"I will start the emergency meeting now. The topic is the financial crisis the ivory tower is facing right now, as you all know.\"\"Tower Chief.\"Hickey immediately took his butt off his chair and spoke.\"I think it is important to understand the motives behind the Prince's intentions. Fortunately, I'm an expert in this field. If you send me as a representative of the Ivory Tower, I'll be sure to find out what is making the Lord uncomfortable.\"\".......\"Karlon's eyes widened even more towards the confident Hickim.\"Oh, Professor Hickim is reliable!\"\"As expected of the candidate for the next Chief seat!\"The other elders around were busy throwing praises as chirping birds.For them, it was certain that Hickim was the most influential as the next Tower Chief. It must have been the desire to suck up and score on such an opportunity.Karlon snorted his nose inside and accepted Hickim's words.\"I am of the same opinion as you, Hickim. I thought everything would be fine if I just sent you to the Prince.\"\"I'll take care of everything! As expected of the Tower Chief, you have a great eye for people.\"\"But before that, I want to ask you a few questions.\"\"Yes. What is?\"It felt good to be recognized in front of everyone and Hikim smiled broadly, with a mean face showing how confident he was to answer any question.\"Remember the name Leonard Rodellaine?\"\"...... \"His face hardened while he was smiling, so he couldn't hide his true color.'W-Why is that pushover's name coming up here?!'Those who wanted to look good to Hickim bought time for him.\"Tower Chief, that would be an unpleasant name for Professor Hickim.\"\"Hm-hum, why are you bringing up a story that's more than six years old now?\"\"At that time, Professor Hickim had to suffer so much because of this absurd conspiracy.......\"At that time, the world was on his side thanks to the money he spent to wash public opinion.Relieved, Hickim skillfully wore his pensive mask.\"You say Leonard Rodellaine......I don't know why Tower Chief suddenly brought up that name, but of course, I can't help but remember it. It's my sore finger.\"\"A sore finger?\"\"He didn't have any talent for alchemy, but he did a good job of documenting data, so he was a guy that I took under my wings, fed, and nurtured. But, as we all know, that guy is the enemy of grace...\"A muffled groan resounded everywhere. Thanks to the elders who moved in, Hickim performed even more passionately.\"No matter how impatient he was because research results were not being delivered, how could he have thought of stealing his own master's research!\"\".......\"\"He was such a fool. He happened to steal my research on regenerative potions. The whole world knows that the regeneration potion is the achievement of this Hickim Sarmatan. There's no way anyone would believe an accusation that it was stolen from an apprentice. Tsk, tsk!\"At this point, the others will come in on their own.\"That's right. Why did he do something that would be revealed soon anyway?\"\"It was a felony that not even apprentices should be pardoned with!\"\"Expulsion was the just price he paid for it.\"Karlon, who had been listening quietly, raised one hand and silenced the elders. The question continued.It still had something to do with Leonard Rodellaine.\"It turns out that Leonard was the father of two children, and he didn't use a house in the capital, but worked hard commuting from a suburban hut. An immediate disciple of an elder who has dependents to take care of, has good support for it, right? What happened?\"\"What? Ah, that... ... .\"Because you pocketed his support money!It was a trivial matter that no one had ever taken issue with. Why is it that the supreme power in the Tower asking about that now?\"H-His, wife......! Leonard's wife was extravagant. Leonard fell head over heels for a gold digger! He was a disciple with a lot of problems......but, what is the importance of this old story now?\"Karlon later recovered his brazenness and shouted back at Karlon.\"Aren't we talking about the Tower finances now? This has nothing to do with the emergency meeting, does it?\"Although Hikim's excuse was lacking, it was true that it was off the topic of the meeting, so it was time for the elders to remain silent.The Tower Chief, Karlon replied indifferently.\"I'm asking because it matters.\"\"What?\"\"Hickim.\"\"Oh, yes. Tower Chief.\"\"Professor Hickim.\"\"Yes, yes.\"\"Hey, Hikim, you bastard.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"......?!\"Wh-hat?'T-The Tower owner just cursed......?!'Around the time when everyone in the meeting room was startled. Karlon let out the anger he had been holding back.\"Hey, you crazy bastard! Did you know that Leonard Rodellaine was the Prince's son-in-law?!\"\"......!\"Hickim felt the shock of being hit in the head.'What......? Who said what about the Prince......?'He looked around, doubting his ears and his head, wondering if he had heard it properly. The elders, too, were speechless with their mouths wide open.Hickey's eyes widened in embarrassment.\"You're not going to answer me, punk?! Did you know that?\"\"Oh, no. I didn't know......?\"Karlon did not hide his contempt for Hickim's stupid reply. Only after receiving that bitter glance did Hikim's head start working little by little.'So, the pushover Leonard Rodellaine's is the Prince's......Son-in-law......? Son-in-law? Son-in-law?!'Hickim's face turned white.\"I-Is that real?! Le-Leonard is the Prince's son-in-law?!\"\"Yes, you bastard! The one who you cursed for being a gold digger is the princess! The Prince is mad at you and is shaking the Tower because of it!\"He could hear the elders around him murmuring, 'Is that what happened?'Hickim felt the sweat glands all over his body being stimulated.\"Well, it's..., That can't be....... A guy like Leonard.......\"\"You still don't understand the situation? Are you escaping from reality? That's understandable.\"It was then that Karlon's tongue began to move like a sword dance.\"Hey, you crazy punk. Did you dare own the merits of all that research? I looked into everything! You've been exploiting the Prince's son-in-law for the past 15 years!\"\"......!\"Hickim wanted to run right away and shut Karlon's mouth. However, the opponent is the Tower Chief and that was not an option. The truth that he had been trying to hide with all his might began to be revealed.\"The guy who couldn't properly make even a single healing potion, all of a sudden, became an elder because he published the Prince's son-in-law's research as if it was his own.\"\"Th-that......\"\"It seems like you haven't done anything since you framed and kicked him out. You only preserved your position by dividing the research left behind by the Prince's son-in-law and publishing it sparingly.\"\"I-It's a misunderstanding......\"\"Shut up! It seems like I have lived long, but it's the first time I've seen a parasite like you. How can you think of sucking someone dry for a whopping 15 years? Even the Prince's son-in-law on top of that?!\"\"Ugh.......\"The public opinion that was laundered six years ago by pouring sacks and sacks of money was now overshadowed, and the conference hall was buzzing.\"D-Did Professor Hickim do such a thing......?\"\"The scandal six years ago......does it means that what Professor Orca said was true......?\"\"Then the elder who spoke the truth was dismissed, and the disciple who was a promising talent was kicked out......?\"\"Oh My God!\"Gazes of looking at trash were poured on Hickim. Shaking and trembling, to avoid the situation from going even more south, he stood up and shouted loud enough to pop a vein on his neck.\"Pr-proof! Do you have any proof? There's no evidence......!\"\"Hey.\"\"What?\"\"Can you say those words in front of the Prince and his son-in-law? Then go ahead and try it.\"\"......!\"Indeed. It was meaningless to mislead the involved people. The person holding the hilt was the Prince, the owner of this land, and the victim, Leonard, now had the Prince's power on his back.\"Ah.......\"Dump!Realizing that everything was meaningless, Hickim sat down.Karlon calmly declared.\"For that reason, we have decided to dismiss Hickim Sarmatan from the elder's seat and permanently remove him from the Ivory Tower. Anyone with an objection?\"\"There is not!\"After shouting in agreement with the Tower Chief, the elders spit out swear words at Hickim.\"You bastard, how dare you to snatch and eat a golden disciple like a piece of crap?\"\"It's the bottom of all thrash in the world!\"\"It's not enough to throw you from the roof of this ivory tower!\"\"Ah! If it wasn't indoors, I'd spit!\"Sturdy alchemists, who looked stronger than usual, came running at Karlon's call. They were the direct bodyguards, loyal only to the Tower's Chief.A stern command was issued.\"He is an unscrupulous thief who stole the success of others. Take him somewhere and lock him up.\"\"Yes, Tower Chief!\"\"Hey, let this go......! Who do you think I am!? I'm Hickim Sarmatan! The symbol of the Ivory Tower, the alchemist......Kwok!\"\"It was noisy, so I made it quiet.\"\"You did well. Go.\"While Hickim was dragged along like a pack of meat, Karlon gave instructions to the youngest disciple.\"Reinstate Orca to the office of elders, clean up Hickim's lab and empty it. Don't forget to tell the Prince he can come to take Hickim at once.\"\"Do you want me to write a letter to the Prince?\"\"No, write it in the newspaper. Make it loud. Then he will naturally find out.\"\"As expected of Master! Then I will contact all the newspapers.\"Hickim's downfall proceeded steadily and a villain's scream echoed through the door.\"Ah......no......! No way, noo!\"From the next day, daily newspapers in Peronsa, the capital, started pouring out articles about the incident.[Shock &amp; Breaking News] Hickim Sarmatan, the master of regeneration potions, was expelled from the Golden Ivory Tower!Today, the Golden Ivory Tower elders committee unanimously decided to expel Hickim Sarmatan, 50, Ivory Tower Elder Alchemist.According to the official announcement, Hickim is accused of taking the research work of his immediate disciple over the past 15 years and publishing it as his own, and is accused of framing his disciple and expelling him from the ivory tower when his crimes were in danger of being exposed six years ago.Hickim denies all charges, but he will soon be sentenced to a final trial in the presence of witnesses who tried to accuse him six years ago.......[Exclusive] Hickim becomes an astronomical debtor!While the supporters of Hickim Sarmatan (50, unemployed) had been protesting in front of the Ivory Tower for the third day, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the supporters, demanding that Hickim return the money he had unfairly obtained by the end of the year.In addition, the Golden Ivory Tower also decided to collect all of the research expenses and special prize money that Hickim had received, and a movement to take away his influence started in earnest.Since Hickim, who usually spends a lot, does not have the ability to repay, it seems that it will be difficult for him to escape from prison.Meanwhile, Prince Hispenril described the case as a 'felony that disturbs the social order', and he plans to detain Hickim for interrogation by the end of today.......\u2720The media outlets of the Principality made headlines about the ugly teacher, who scrambled to steal his student's life, falling into the abyss.It has been the third day since he was fired from the Ivory Tower, his entire property was confiscated, and he was criticized by public opinion.Hickim, unable to withstand the speed of his fall, lost his mind.\"H-H-Here is......?\"When Hickim woke up, the place in his eyes was a gloomy, dark prison.He immediately remembered being imprisoned in the Ivory Tower warehouse and then put on a convoy, and while on his way somewhere, being baptized with eggs and tomatoes and fainting.Then, is this the Karma prison where criminals who are about to go to trial go?However, an unexpected voice rang out from nearby.\"Hmm! Did you wake up, Professor Hickim?\"\"Oh, D-Duke......sir?\"A middle-aged man with muscular, artistically lumpy muscles appeared in his vision. Can't be wrong, he was the Prince. It seems he was in place for quite some time, sitting on a chair right next to the grate and reading a book.The small book about half the size of his chest muscle was the Bible. The Prince smiled kindly when he saw that Hickim's gaze reached the Bible.\"I recently entered religion. Isn't it all God's blessing to find a daughter and get a son-in-law and grandchildren after 13 years?\"Hiccup!The word 'son-in-law' made Hickim jolt. He couldn't drink a sip of water properly, but sweat was pouring down like rain.\"So I started reading the Bible, and I really liked the verse about loving your enemies.\"\"En-Enemies......\"It was a strong word that stuck in his heart. Seeing Hickim trembling, the Prince put down his bible.\"My son-in-law must have studied about the hardships of life a lot, all thanks to you. Let me pay you back.\"\"......!\"Whoops!The sound of cracking knuckles savagely reverberated through the basement air.\"Hi-Hick! I-I-I didn't know that h-h-h-he was the son-in-law of your grace, I didn't know...! Oh, no! Don't do this......!\"\"What's so scary? I was just stretching.\"\"Huh?\"\"Well, would I ever be able to beat you? You still have a public trial, it would be difficult to hear that the Prince of the Principality had personally tortured criminals.\"\"T-That's right. As expected, right? I didn't kill anyone, and even sinners have human rights....... Whew....\"\"However.\"\"What?\"\"As a believer, I want to love you, who is my enemy.\"\"......!\"It's crazy!The Prince opened the bars and entered the prison. Hickim, who stepped back in fear, sat down with his back against the wall. A huge shadow fell over Hickim's body, and the Prince's hand moved closer to his eyes.Pin-.The Prince's index finger slightly touched his forehead. That was all.\"Huh?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because he didn't feel anything that could be called pain.But after a while.Tok......Tok.......Shas, Sushas.......Things that he didn't hear before began to be heard.Moisture that had condensed between the stone walls fell into water droplets, and the sound of a small insect crawling among the straw pierced his ears. The hearing wasn't the only problem. Hickim's body was trembling. The moist air on his skin was cold as rain, and he couldn't stand it.Not to talk about the smell. The stench emanating from his own body seemed to choke him. He tried to breathe through his mouth, but this time he felt the taste in the air.The disgusting taste of gutter.\"Wh-what the hell is this......\"\"There is a method of communication that has been passed down from generation to generation in the Hispenril family. It's very effective for getting close with friends who don't like to talk.\"\"Gasp......!\"Hickey covered his ears.The Prince seemed to be speaking normally, but it felt like his eardrums were about to tear.\"Y-Y-Your excellency, what is this......Aww!\"Poke.When the Prince lightly stabbed Hickim in the head with his index finger, he struggled in pain as if his skull was split open.\"This is an Aura operation method that elevates the senses of the whole body. Except for sight, it makes the senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch, very sensitive.\"\"Huk, huk......huk...\"\"Now then, shall I love my foe?\"\"Huh... W-W-What?The Prince approached Hickim with his arms wide open. His wriggling chest muscles and biceps were getting close.\"Let's hug.\"\"Oh, no......don't......!\"\"Here we go! Let's love the enemy! Hug time!\"\"Aaaaaaaah!\"A scream echoed through the dungeons of the prison.A lot of screams echoed for a long time.The Prince's green eyes sank deeply while giving abundant love to Hickim.No one had ever endured Hispenril's torture method with a sane mind. One hour. Just that was enough to turn even a trained assassin into a wreck.The Prince had no intention of letting Hickim out of this place. What if he let him go? After living for several years in prison, he was a person who would do the same thing again without reflecting.In alchemy or any other field, he would steal the success of others and destroy one's life and family.\"......Hmm, is that enough?\"It was after about 15 minutes. The Prince threw Hickim's droopy body on the floor and went out of the prison. After the disappearance of the prince, a hollow voice resounded in the quiet dungeon.\"Hee-hee......e-enemies...... hehe! Love......lets do it......huh.......\"Chapter 11. Job change completedThe tutorial area, Count Gillette, was peaceful and safe as always.It was time to do gymnastics in the morning sunlight in the empty lot behind the Alchemy Lab.Dad came running with a happy face and shouted.\"Eli! Mom said we're going to have lunch in the pond garden today. Is that okay?\"\"Outside? I love it!\"\"What do you want to eat? Ask anything!\"\"Will Dad cook?\"\"Of course! It's been a long time since we had a family picnic, so this Dad will show off his skills.\"\"Wow, Dad's cooking! I'm excited!\"When I raised my arms, Dad followed along and raised his arms and we clapped our hands together.\"Ah, Eli, your hands are spicy.\"\"Oh, sorry!\"I forgot to control my power.My father was too weak of an adult to handle a child who bought the Aura package. When I gave my Dad a lot of blows on his red palm, he told me some surprising news.\"Well, mom also decided to prepare the snacks.\"\"Oh, is Mom, cooking snacks?\"Mom can't cook, she's really bad at it.\"She's making sweets in Dad's lab right now. I don't know what she's doing, but she kept me from coming in because it's dangerous. Hahaha!\"She's not even baking in the kitchen, but in an alchemy lab.'It's ok? No, is it even safe?'I looked out the window of the lab with worried eyes. Dad, who was smiling brightly, suddenly whispered to me with a serious face.\"Even if it doesn't taste good......You know, right?\"Nod, nod, nod!It was at that time that I vigorously nodded my head.Whoops!Suddenly, a light flashed from the lab window and an explosion occurred!<Is that light from Aura?>\"......\"Why do you need Aura to bake?As I pondered the question, a wind mixed with sugar came out and swept through Dad's body.Well, I should prepare a digestive potion just in case.I concentrated on stretching again, thinking like a smart daughter filled with filial piety.I carefully recalled what had happened to my family after returning to Gillette County with my mother.\u2720A month ago, when I first introduced Mom to the people in the Count's manor, Bianca congratulated us with deep joy as if it was her own. And she even persuaded the Countess to provide an independent space in the annex so that our family could spend time in a cozy and close manner.It was a very different treatment from ordinary servants.Bianca didn't forget to attach an externally appropriate reason for the fear that we might feel burdened.\"Is something that should be done for our resident alchemist and the successful Rodel's owners. Other than that, you are my only playmate, and your brother is an aspiring Aura user.\"Of course, instead of refusing the consideration, I welcomed it with open arms. I couldn't go out of the Count's castle during the tutorial, it was really nice that the living environment was improved.Meanwhile, Mom's adaptability to the Count's manor was enormous.\"Nice to meet you. Viscount Carmel. I heard that you are the swordsmanship master who guides our son Frintz.\"\"What? Who are you? Viscount Carmel is my teacher......!\"\"Haha! Master Romdio, I'm sorry, but let's vacate the place for a while! Whew, it's an honor to meet you, madam. My name is Andymion Carmel.\"Although he is now a middle-aged man with a catfish mustache, Viscount Carmel was famous as a genius swordsman that had short bobbed hair in his former years.Even his name was handsome.Mother and Viscount Carmel greeted each other warmly, leaving aside the Count's crazy scoundrel.\"Please call me Sir Elthea rather than Mrs. I am also a knight.\"\"Indeed! Somehow, I thought that the aura you were emitting was unusual, I see that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Please call me Sir Andymion, Sir Elthea.\"They grasped each other's skills with a powerful handshake. The first one to open their mouth was Mom with a face that said, 'Oh, he's pretty good?'\"Frintz has a great teacher. You must have reached the level of an intermediate Aura Expert.\"\"Haha, I'm just barely an expert intermediate, and.....wait, but how at a glance......?!\"Viscount Carmel, who immediately became more polite after shaking hands, was startled.\"Hmm, it's a pity to hear that you made a close call, but if you don't mind, would it be okay if I could help a little in breaking down the walls of Sir Andymion's limitations?\"\"No, of course! Please!\"\"Well then, let's take a look.\"\"Oh, oh my!\"In that way, Mom allowed Viscount Carmel to cross the threshold that had not been reached for the last 10 years. Since then, Mom and Viscount Carmel become friends through swordsmanship who occasionally engaged in skirmishes.The match between two Aura Experts was a great study for me, so Frintz and I often watched their bouts. However, there were people who watched the match with fervent eyes, regardless of studying it or not.\"Dad, are you here again?\"\"Yes......\"Dad's face, which had captured Mom's in his eyes, was half-bewitched.It's not that I don't understand.The figure of Mom fighting with a long spear in her right hand and a dagger in her left hand was elegant and cool, as if she was presenting a sword dance.Even Agnes was impressed with Mom's footwork and admired her beauty.\"Ah, Elthea...you were such a person. That's how she used to hunt wild boars and wild turkeys when we lived in the hut......\"It is a pity for Viscount Carmel, the opponent of the Duel, who suddenly took on the role of a wild beast being hunted.Dad said something new.\"Oh, my. I think I'm going to fall in love with mother......\"\"Aren't you already in love and married?\"\"That's the problem. I think I will fall in love again without hesitation even after marrying and having you and Frintz. What should I do?\"\"What do you mean? We can just live happily together for a long time.\"They said that if you love, you will miss them even if you see them right in front of your eyes. And this heart wasn't just for Dad.\"Leo! You came to cheer for me again today.\"Mom started looking for Dad as soon as the match was over. Having finished drinking the potion Dad had given her, she suddenly brought her face near Dad's.\"What? I think you smell good, Leo.\"\"El-Elthea.\"It's a scene where someone who doesn't know would think that a young and pretty knight was playing tricks on a naive older alchemist.But the scent story was true. These days, Dad was working hard on applying beauty potions because he was sad that the age gap with mom was wide.\"Is it the scent of flowers? Dandelion?\"As she sniffed her nose against his face, their eyes naturally met from a short distance away.Their cheeks turned red and their eyes grew hot.\"Elthea.......\"\"Leo.......\"I quietly left my seat hoping they had a lifetime of good health growing old together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thanks to this, everyone in the Count's castle knew that my Mom and Dad had a golden relationship and that Mom was a swordmaster.In the meantime, my mother took advantage of her skills to find herself a job.\"Leo, now that the kids are all grown up, I'm going to start working soon.\"\"E-Elthea? That outfit is......?\"Seeing Mom in her uniform, Dad was stunned. Mom calmly informed him, not knowing if he could hear a word or not.\"I got a job as an escort for Countess Gillette from today. Call me Sir Elthea in public.\"\"You......were a knight, too.\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"Ah.\"Mom leisurely went to work after kissing Dad on the back of his hand and completely taking his soul out of his body.Escort work was easy.The castle was very peaceful, and even the few knights that were employed in the Count did not dare to speak up against a top-tier Aura Expert user. The only concern was whether Mom could fit in with the Countess's picky personality, but...\"Oh my God, Sir Elthea! Look at how the uniform suits you to a tee. It's so cool.\"\"I'm flattered, ma'am.\"\"Come here and sit down. A nice tea just came in and I prepared it to have together with Sir Elthea.\"\"I'm at duty, ma'am.\"\"Don't do that, will you? It's lonely, talk with me for a bit.\"\"Then one drink, please.\"\"Thank you!\"The Countess, Sandra Gillette, was isolated from the aristocracy because of her origin as a commoner.She had never been invited to a tea party or ever hosted one herself, so she was often beside herself with loneliness.It was natural to feel affection and envy toward a dignified same-sex person who treated herself with chivalry and respect.There was even something in common, as both had a son and a daughter.\"I don't know how to educate my children. I'm worried that the rebellion phase of the first one has gotten worse.\"\"Everyone goes through a stormy period. I ran away from home, too.\"\"Sir Elthea did? Oh my, oh my. Please tell me more.\"\"Whew, it's a long tale, to say the least.......\"Thus, Mom's adaptation to the Count's Castle ended perfectly.\u2720Back to the present\"......Sir Elthea is great. In fact, I've never seen my mother being so kind and considerate to anyone.\"\"Yes, I didn't know the Countess would like my Mom so much either.\"\"But on the other hand, I think I can understand my mother.\"\"Hm?\"\"Because I like Eli too.\"\"Ah.\"['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' happily smiles.]Bianca and I went for a walk to the dungeon farm and were talking about lots of things.The passage of time was three times faster, so winter had already passed and spring had begun in the dungeon.Helverus, who had been busy with heating work for a while, was now living a carefree life.These days, he spent most of his time taking a nap in the small fire pit that Epiden had made.The soft flame increased and decreased intermittently.While Epiden was placing a tin kettle in the furnace to make tea, water droplets splashed on the little demon, making the startled Helverus's flames soar high.Thanks to this, Epiden's white jade-like white skull was charred.Krurarararara!<I-It's not my fault...! It's Epi who surprised me, isn't it?.....!>The Flame Demon and the Undead Skeleton began to quarrel with each other.Today, the dungeon farm was also peaceful.I and Bianca returned to our conversation. We were talking about my mother's adaptability.Bianca sensibly asked.\"Eli, I heard that Sir Elthea came from a noble family. I couldn't ask her properly because she drew a line about it, do you know what family you are from?\"If you are the next head of household, you should know everything about other families. I nodded.\"Will you keep it a secret?\"\"Of course.\"\"It's Hispenril.\"The reaction was as expected.\"......\"Bianca opened her eyes wide. She looked like a rabbit because of her red eyes. It was only after three seconds had passed that her head seemed to fully understand the meaning of my words.\"The prin...cess? That...the one that was missing, Prince Hispenril's......daughter?\"\"It's not a disappearance, it's a runaway. In fact, I even met my grandfather. He told her to come home, but she refused, saying she didn't need the family name nor its fortune.\"\"No, a title of a princess was...just like that....\"Bianca's eyes shook, but her confusion was only for a moment.\"By the way, Prince Hispenril has only one child, and that's the princess, right? Isn't the family inherited when the time comes anyway?\"\"Yes. In fact, after thinking about it for a while, I took Mom's side between her and grandfather.\"\"You did a great job.\"\"Right.\"We joked around and laughed.Bianca asked seriously.\"Later, when you became a princess you won't pretend not to know anything like the Countess of the outskirts, right?\"\"Hey, look at you worrying about all sorts of things. More than that, my Dad and Brother don't know. Keep it a secret until Mom tells them.\"\"Yes. Trust me.\"Just around the time we were having a heartwarming moment. Agnes necklace rang and she lamented.<Ha, it's shocking even thinking about it again. I can't believe I was training the bloodline of Aaron Jake Hispenril.>At the Knights Academy, Agnes and Grandpa were competing for the same rank. Agnes complained that it was very unfair to lose first place several times.Well, good educators shouldn't be swayed by personal emotions.I smiled brightly.After the brief break, I and Bianca parted ways to do our respective duties.I went straight to Dad's lab. It looks like Mom cleaned up after she finished baking her confectionery, but it was still a mess in my opinion.I plan to quickly clean it up on behalf of my father, who is in the middle of cooking in the kitchen of the annex by now.While cleaning, I decided to refill the reagents that are running out. But one extra reagent was on a shelf high enough to reach the ceiling.I climbed up on the top of a simple ladder and stretched out my arms, but I did not even vaguely reach them.One Descent and this is nothing!...It is impossible to use it anyway and while I was whining on my tiptoes, I felt a presence behind me.\"Can I take this out for you?\"\"Huh?\"A slightly murky voice rang in my ear, then someone took out a reagent bottle with ease and held it in my hand.\"Oh, brother.\"\"Yes.\"As I turned my head, I saw Frintz stepping on the bottom of the ladder and stably supporting my back.Frintz was growing like a storm these days. Seeing that he had become a tall boy in a month, I thought that growing boys were a very mysterious existence.\"How did you grow so tall? It seems like the height from yesterday and today are different. Brother, aren't you growing taller every day?\"\"It might be. My joints are numb and I can't get used to it. My voice suddenly came out strangely, too....\"\"I know. It feels a little bit like when you caught a cold?\"\"It's not pleasant to hear, right? It's getting thicker....\"\"Not that but, doesn't your throat hurts when you talk?\"\"Not really.\"\"Then that's fine.\"When I looked at Frintz with envy and wondered how big he became, he smiled and hugged me without notice.\"There we go!\"\"What!?\"\"I'm going to get you off the ladder.\"\"Then drop me off.\"\"I have changed my mind.\"\"Why!\"\"Hey, you are so small. I can pick you up this high in a flash.\"Frintz hugged my ten-year-old, not too small, body and boasted about his height and muscles.He grew up well, but I was still a little kid, so the comparison was quite stark. I could have tried to get out of Frintz's arms, but I just let him do whatever he wanted.\"When will my little sister grow up?\"\"I'll grow up soon! Starting today, I'm going to eat double the growth-nurturing pills.\"\"That's too bad. Then I have to hug you a lot now. If not now, when would I carry you around?\"Frintz, who became a young lad, laughed like a spring breeze blowing cherry blossoms. I guess his charm has increased since he suddenly grew up.\"Brother, are you happy to be tall?\"\"Yes. It looks like I can carry Eli around.\"\"Except for that.\"\"I like that swordsmanship is easier and more vivid. I feel like I am getting stronger day-by-day thanks to you. From now on, I'm going to protect Eli, so just trust him.\"Um, well, that's a little...I think I have a higher level of Rigid body right now, but of course, I didn't say it outright.\"Yes, of course! Brother, you know, because you're the eldest son of our family, we have high expectations. Good luck, Brother!\"\"Yes!\"I gave him the burden, no, the motivation to get a knighthood. I think I'm a really nice little sister.\"But why did Brother come to the lab?\"\"I came to pick you up.\"\"Oh, come to think of it, it's already lunch time.\"\"Yes. Mom and Dad will be waiting for us. Let's go, Eli.\"I went out with Frintz, excited about the idea of \u200b\u200bhaving a picnic. Mom and Dad went out early to make preparations. Instead of the knight's uniform, Mom wore a mini dress and held a parasol, she was very pretty.\"How do I look, Leo?\"\"It's dazzling, Elthea......\"Dad couldn't take his eyes off the sight.\"I'll carry the picnic basket!\"In the eyes of a growing teenager, a basket full of things to eat was nothing sort of a treasure chest.Frintz took the lead, flashing the picnic basket.\"Let's go first, Eli. Mom and Dad, come quickly.\"I diligently followed Frintz.In the meantime, my eyes were fixed on the lunch box, or the picnic basket, that naturally smelled of food.Hmm......['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' asks why you're staring at the picnic basket as if he's an enemy.]\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was nothing that serious.When I was in the third grade of elementary school, there was a picnic, and it was the first one I had after losing my family. As the whole school went to the same place, my lunch box was a little compared to my cousin-sister.I bought the basic kimbap and dumplings sold at Kimbap Heaven and put them in a black bag, while my cousin packed a hotel-style, high-quality catering lunch.In addition, my aunt gave pretty and delicious homemade snacks to the classmates in my cousin's class. It was a roll of cake-shaped cotton candy with the flavors and colors of various fruits added.At that time, my cousin's homeroom teacher kept one packed snack and secretly gave it to me.But not knowing how she found out, my cousin came to our class and made a fuss to give it back because she didn't want to give it to me. It was hard to receive many glances because of the commotion, so I reluctantly returned it.'My life was rough, really.'I realized once again that I was not in a position to curse about the pushover free pass.With a sigh, I arrived at the pond garden inside the Count's Castle. My family sat around a bench table cut in half and opened the picnic basket. A dinner that blew away all my cluttered thoughts was unveiled.\"Wow!\"Butter pancakes with a savory smell, grilled goose, pork dumplings full of cheese, sweet-baked blueberry muffins, and raspberry juice that can spread freshness in your mouth!\"It looks so delicious!\"\"Dad's the best!\"\"Hm!\"My proud father ripped off the leg of the main dish, roasted goose, and took care of Mom first.\"Elthea, it's your favorite part.\"\"Oh my gosh, Leo, you are really.\"\"Wait. I'll cut it for you to eat. ah-.\"\"Ah-.\"\"Did you swallow? Then take a bite of the pancakes.\"\"Yes, ah-.\"\"I'm so glad you ate well.... Why aren't you eating, guys? Go ahead and eat.\"\"......Yes.\"I and Frintz answered without energy, realizing that we were pushed to second place.\"I feel like I lost my father.\"\"......Dad was originally Mom's, brother.\"The rest of the leg was left for Dad to eat, and I tore off the wings.\"Eat this, brother.\"\"Thanks. I'll also take care of yours.\"\"Yes. Let's take care of ourselves.\"\"Yes, Eli.\"Thanks to this, I reaffirmed our sibling loyalty and friendship, so I don't think it was bad.I and Frintz competitively ate the food, boasting our subspace inventory-like stomachs. When I was resting while pounding my tummy, Dad announced in an exciting and proud voice.\"Eli, Frintz. Mom has prepared a special snack for you.\"\"Wow!\"\"Wow!\"The long-awaited snack reveal has come.\"Don't expect too much.\"While Mom was coughing with a red face, Dad took out a snack, and at that moment my eyes got bigger.'Cotton candy?'I was stunned because I didn't know I would see it here.\"Ta-da! Mom made fairy cotton! Isn't it amazing?Fairy cotton was another name for cotton candy.\"I-Is this is fairy cotton?\"It seems that Dad didn't crack down on Frintz's reaction.Mom's work was, to be fair, more like a devil's cotton than a fairy's. That was because the blackened sugar was thickly entangled like a hook. Mom also hesitated to say whether it bothered her.\"I thought it would be easy, but it was harder than I thought. I tried it last night because Eli wanted to eat it in her sleep.....\"\"......\"......It seems that the habit of talking at night is still there. I'm sure I cursed my cousin a lot in my sleep. Even so, Mom decided to cook it because of my sleep talking.......I felt a little, no, quite strange.\"That......Well......I can make it better next time. Don't force yourself to eat.\"I came to my senses when I saw Mom hiding the cotton candy behind her back in a sulky mood.It's not the time to be absent-minded.\"Mom.\"\"Yes, Eli.......\"\"Give it to me. I really wanted to eat it.\"\"Really?\"\"Yes!\"I took a big bite of the cotton candy. It tasted more like dalgona candy than cotton candy. A dalgona that was burned black, but even so.\"It's delicious, really.\"It was the best cotton candy I've ever eaten.It was even tastier than the cotton candy I bought, with the money I asked my family for while being called cheap and disgraceful, when I came home from the picnic in the third grade of elementary school.\"Thank you, Mom.\"\"Eli....\"\"What are you doing, brother? It's really delicious! I'm going to eat it all by myself.\"\"Oh, ah, no!

We are really doing it?\"My eyes sparkled.Learning Mind's Eye means that we are finally starting to get used to Aura.<Yes, we can start to learn it slowly. Sit down.>\"Yes!\"It was a rare theory class after a long time.<Mind's eye meditation refers to the practice of feeling the presence of Aura, understanding the flow, and gathering it to form a core. For Aura users, it can be said to be the most basic act akin to breathing, and since there are several types of meditation, the nature of the Aura that can be operated on the core varies depending on which method is used.>\"The main difference is the color, right? I like white. Normal things are also very beautiful.\"<We have the same taste. However, color is only a secondary issue, and it is more important to build an Aura suitable for the chosen swordsmanship. If you learn a fire-type Aura meditation method, but later change the method because your sword technique matches the icy nature, Auras with different temperaments may collide. In severe cases, the core may be destroyed.>\"Ugh....\"<Of course, what I just said is a very extreme example. It's not difficult to switch unless you've learned quite a bit of special swordsmanship and meditation techniques. Depending on the person, several types can also be mixed and used in moderation.>Let's raise the question.\"Is there any method that suits Instructor Agnes' whip-sword technique?\"<Yes. You have to learn how to push your senses to the limit. It doesn't collide with other Auras, but it doesn't convert either.>This means that you have to separately train for whip-sword only.<You said you wanted to learn the whip-sword, but you can't decide your career path just yet. So, it would be better to learn a basic method like everyone else.>\"Yes.\"I didn't complain. Because Agnes, a professional educator, made all decisions with me in mind.In addition, accumulating a regular Aura that's not used for the whip-sword does not mean that it's useless. When using swordsmanship and whip, I can use a regular Aura.<I'll show you a demonstration.>What Agnes taught me was the 'Ragnar Bless Method,' and it was the most basic method that paladin trainees in the Holy Country learned.<Did you understand? Follow after me.>\"Yes.\"Even if you master this and feel the Aura, it does not mean that you will awaken it. It takes a tremendous amount of practice just to feel, understand the flow, and attract it.Those who have awakened are people who could form a core that accumulates aura inside their body.'It takes a long time for that. So, I'm really grateful for the help of the system.'If I achieve Rigid Body Lv.50 and Sword Skill of the same level, I will awaken the Aura immediately. So, to be honest, I didn't really need to practice meditation right now. After the system awakens the Aura, it's only necessary to increase the available aura capacity...While I was thinking of that.[<System> 'Ragnar Bless Meditation Lv.1' in progress.

As you may know, many swordsmen die without being awarded the title of Sword Master. But if it's you, Cadet, I think you can awaken the Aura before you turn 20.>Agnes' encouragement made me smile.In 10 years I will be 20-years-old. No, there's no need to wait 10 years.3 years is enough.The time at which the divine power is awakened will be the same at which the Aura is awakened.\"I will work hard!\"\u2720Meanwhile, from the top of a Zelkova tree, there was a person watching what was happening at the iron man obstacle course.\"Hmm......\"Through the thick leaves, a little animal-like girl could be seen on the ground. The pink-haired child stared at the air and eagerly shook her head, as she occasionally murmured to herself.If ordinary people had seen it, they would have thought it was a strange situation. But the woman who is now secretly watching the little girl was different.'My daughter's teacher seems to be a bit of an unusual being.'Elthea's eyes lit up with interest.Both Frintz and Eyelet were training hard. At this rate, she will be able to have duels with her children one day.Elthea smiled delightedly at the expectations that made her heart pound with excitement.\u2720As the peaceful daily life continued, time quickly flew by.The alchemy business with Dad continued to be successful with each new product launch, earning us a fortune.Thanks to the steady and repeated training, Rigid Body had already surpassed level 50, and swordsmanship reached level 49.After that, the level of swordsmanship was adjusted by learning other weapons, training footwork, or concentrating on meditation.After revealing to the family that I was practicing swordsmanship, duels with Mom and Brother took place frequently.I always won when dueling with Brother, and always lost when against Mom. Each time, Agnes, who had a strong desire to compete, doubled the amount of training making it even more difficult.In order to awaken the divine power, I worked hard in attending the chapel every dawn.After coming back from the 'Black Salt Desert' dungeon, I never had to use Descent, so there was no chance of missing a morning prayer due to God Fever.Besides, I didn't really have to go outside the tutorial area.The Chief of the Golden Ivory Tower sent an invitation for an elder position to the alchemist Rodel, but we refused it, and on Thanksgiving, which is once a year, Grandpa who couldn't wait and came to the Count's Castle first.Grandpa officially established his status as an adventurer who earned a lot of money for Mom's sake, who still hated the Duke's title, but Bianca, who knows the circumstances tried hard to treat him without any inconvenience while keeping up with Grandpa's sloppy rhythm.Later, it became like an annual event that happens every fall, so Bianca came to simply see him as a Friend's Grandpa.The seasons came and went several times while I was living a small and calm daily life.I have greeted 3 autumns in this world.Last week was the third time I ate turkey breast with Grandpa, and yesterday, with the sleet-like first snow of the year, I turned thirteen.It has been 2 years and 9 months since I transmigrated.In terms of days, it was only five days away from the 'A Thousand Days of Prayer' quest being completed.\u2720Finally!

I have gone up one step from the Cardinal level to a Saint.In terms of Magic, it's like being an Archmage of the 8th Circle, and if it's Aura, it was the limit of a human being, a Sword Master.I felt a new and mysterious energy filling my body and I took a deep breath as if enjoying it.['The World-building God' is moved by your growth and smooth a handkerchief around its eyes.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' says, an S-Level growth indeed.

It was because of the auspicious white light that poured into the center of the main chapel after a long time.\"Oh, oh! A person who has reached the level of a Saint has been born! This is the first time in 200 years!\"\"In this day and age, an Awakener of the Divine Power who has reached the limits of human beings! I'm sure this is the protagonist of the Divine Descent!\"\"I think it was because they were in the middle of a closed-door training that they were quiet without using Descent of Divinity for over two years!\"\"Oh, I can't wait to meet them whoever they are! Where the hell are they......!\"At the moment of awakening, when Ellet's vessel of holy power expanded to the level of a saint, the cardinals who felt her presence were thrilled.Among the cardinals gathered in the chapel was Cattleya, Bianca's grandmother. She was listening to the cardinals, never knowing that the hero of the auspicious white light was Ellet.\"We have to hurry up and find where the Saintess is and take them to this Vatican!\"\"Sir Clovis, who is in charge of the search for the Saintess, is not doing very well.\"\"Well, since the presence of the Saintess has become clearer, there will be good news soon. Let's wait a little longer.\"\"But is their gender determined to be female? Everyone has been calling them a Saintess since before.\"\"Hmmm, I think the public reaction was good when I promoted it towards a Saintess rather than a Saint......\"The topic of conversation had shifted to politics.The cardinals, who exchanged enough words, were in the midst of leaving their seats and going away. When almost all the people in the chapel had left, Cattleya also stepped into the corridor.At that moment.\"Cardinal Cattleya.\"It was a wonderful voice that the 1st Choir of The Vatican would covet. She turned to see a boy who had caught up with her height.Silver hair that sparkles as if it was made by emitting the light of the day and the moon, and eyes that go back and forth between blue and green depending on the angle of light, like the water of the shallow sea.Delicate and beautiful features like a crystal statue crafted by a craftsman reduced the viewer's sense of reality.Silver hair, a white face, and a paladin uniform.Armed with pure and holy colors from head to toe, the sight of the boy receiving a beam of light from the surroundings made him look more like a holy being portrayed in divine paintings than a human being.Cattleya called the boy's name.\"Brother Thesilid.\"An overwhelmingly strong contender, that God favors, amidst the stigmata. Thesilid Argent.Cattleya's gaze, as usual, was directed over Thesilid's head.'It's still the same.'Life expectancy was normal. However, the remaining life was not visible.He too was a special being chosen by God.The voice of a boy who had yet to go through his puberty quietly echoed through the air.\"I heard that you visited Count Gillette last Thanksgiving.\"\"That's right.\"\"You must have had a peaceful time after a long time. Wasn't there anything special in the Count?\"Was the boy usually this friendly towards me? Curious, Cattleya answered.\"Should there be something special about it? It's been a long time since they stopped paying attention to the central politics and dungeon subjugation, so it was peaceful as always.\"\"Even the servants?\"\"Servants?\"\"There was a girl who came to The Vatican before and got caught up in a dungeon sink. I remember she was a servant there.\"\"Oh, you mean Ellet. At that time, you were the one who rescued and carried her out. It's already been over two years, have you been paying attention?\"\"Yes, a little.\"\"She's doing just fine. She's not as big as you, but she's grown a lot. She's starting to have some girly charm.\"\"Is that so....\"As he lowered his gaze, Thesilid seemed to be holding on to a small smirk. He usually had a nice and gentle smile on his face, but now the feeling was quite different.Having sensed the gaze of observation from Cattleya, Thesilid hastily ended the conversation.\"Thank you for your time, your Grace. Then, I'll be going.\"In the manner of a knight, he placed a fist on his chest and bowed, then turned around. As he reached the end of the corridor, he ran into two boys waiting for him.\"Why did you go to the place where only old folks gather?\"Hestio, the tallest of the three, swung his long black hair and asked sternly.\"That's right. Cardinal Cattleya is not very friendly with stigmata.\"Ephael, who was going through his period of transformation, helped with a hoarse voice.Thesilid answered.\"I came here to inquire about Ellet's well-being.\"\"Hey!\"\"Hey!\"The two friends burst exclamations at the same time.\"I told you to stop using honorifics because it's annoying!\"\"After being appointed as a knight, did you finally awaken your ultimate fetish? I know you were impressed by the chivalry, but isn't it too harsh?!\"\"....\"Thesilid, who had unspeakable circumstances, was just embarrassed by his friends handling of his persona concept.'I can't say that I have to use respectful words to increase my divine power.'His 'The Commandments of the Seven Holy Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins.' buff was a problem. Since he knew that honorifics had a synergetic effect on his divine power by satisfying both items of humility and kindness at once, he had no choice but to change his language habits.Even if he wanted to do something about it, there was a sad unchanging fact for him.He thought that if he awakened the Aura, he would have to worry less about his divine power. But somehow, like the main character of a fairy tale, he was a physically special human being, so he manifested what was called a 'divine aura'.Ironically, after awakening the Aura, he had to manage his divine power even more tightly.\"......I just want you to understand.\"He tried to hide his sorrow while talking back.\"I do not understand!\"\"Stop it!\"Their reaction was intense. He couldn't lose his few friends and Thesilid, who rarely backed down, choose to listen to them.\"Okay. I will not use it in front of you.\"\"Yes, please. Let's live normally.\"\"Don't let me be ashamed when we're together.\"On the way back from the main building, Thesilid recounted the story of how he met Cattleya.It was Hestio who brought up the topic.\"You said you came to ask after Ellet's well-being? If it's Ellet, is she the girl we met at the toy mansion back then?\"\"Yes.\"\"She did leave a bit of a strong impression. When she said she was going to marry the devil with that flower on the top of her head...I wondered if another Thesilid had appeared.\"\"....\"\"Anyway, I admit that she was quite the amazing kid, but......Do you still care about her well-being? She's just an ordinary kid living in a different world from us. I don't think we'll ever see her again.\"\"We'll see her again.\"Thesilid spoke conclusively.Didn't they learn shared skills? A reunion was inevitable.While Hestio shut his mouth at Thesilid's firmness, Ephael cleared his throat and advised.\"Well, don't let the old folks find out. If they knew you were interested in a girl, they would be out of their minds.\"\"It's not like that.\"\"Even if not, be careful. Because they get hung on even with little details.\"That was correct. The denomination was as conservative as it was faithful. It has been more than two centuries since the doctrine of the denomination was revised to allow marriage.However, the denomination used to argue that it is natural for, only stigmata, to consecrate their life to God.It was commonly thought that they should live like a puritan for the rest of their life while being treated as a servant.Ephael, who had a dream of leaving the priesthood and going back to secular life, let out a deep sigh as he became depressed after talking about it.Hestio wanted to change the subject, and just in time, there was good news to be shared.\"More than that, it seems that we are going to go outside The Vatican very soon.\"\"We are going out? Really?\"\"Yeah, Ephael. I overheard the State Council meeting this morning, and such talks came up. They said they were preparing to send stigmata to a place in need of a denomination on the continent. It's being called missionary and volunteer work, but it's probably dungeon subjugation.\"\"Oh yeah!\"\"You really seem to like it.\"It seems that the stigmata are finally going to expand the horizon of their world outside The Vatican.Thesilid also felt a little bit of anticipation in his chest.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I finished the level up related to the Aura job change, which I had paused for a while.The condition for awakening Aura is to exceed level 50 in both Rigid Body and Weapon Skills.The Rigid Body level had already satisfied the conditions, so only swordsmanship that was on level 49 had to be raised, and after training for about two months, I was able to fill the required experience points.So, at the beginning of spring, I was able to manifest Aura.Whodudu.A sword extended horizontally and as soon as cherry blossom petals hit the white light that dazzles even in the middle of the day, they disappeared.I stared blankly at the scene for a long time.<Congratulations on becoming a swordmaster.>\"Thank you, Agnes.\"<How do you feel?>\"Honestly, I think it's a little more touching than when I gained divine power.

Several times a day, I had a weak thought that only awakening the divine power would be enough. Nevertheless, there was a driving force that had brought me to this point, and that was......\"Honestly, it's all thanks to Agnes being the instructor.\"<Of course, of course. The Vatican's 1st hell instructor is scary after all.>Agnes put both hands on her waist and puffed up.

I'm higher up, so I'll stick with my rank badge without taking it off.\"<Ugh, you are really.>We looked at each other for a moment and laughed silently.As if she had suddenly remembered, Agnes said.<You finally awoke the Aura, but didn't your God congratulate you today? The heresy you serve...>\"It's not heresy, it's 'The World-building God'.\"<Ahem.>Religion was a sensitive topic, and Agnes and I almost became enemies in the middle of laughing.At that time, World God appeared as if he knew we were talking about them.['The World-building God' rushes over and wave the '\u2605(Congra-) Sword Master (-tulations)\u2605' picket.]Even though these days the preparations for a large-scale update were in the final stages, World God took the time to congratulate me.'Thank you, World God.'['The World-building God' urges you to not be disappointed because the other gods are busy with their work, so he was celebrating as the representative.]'Of course.

Both divine power and Aura are at the stage where they need to practice in real-world training from now on, but there is no suitable place in the County.>\"I know, right. As I said before, I can't go out of the Count's castle at will.\"There is a way to get a quest from the World God and go out, but it cannot exceed a week at the most.The moment the original work begins, the movement radius restrictions are lifted, but in terms of time, it is the spring of the year I turn 20.It was still far away.<The God you believe in is overprotective. They don't let you out because it's dangerous.>\"Overprotective? Hmm, well, that's one way to interpret it, and it sounds pretty good.\"<Seems like you like it. Anyway, it's impossible to gain hands-on experience while playing dungeons.>\"Yes.\"At this rate, no matter how much I receive the Blessings for high-speed growth, I will hit a wall and stop growing.

A lot had changed in the meantime.Spring was the season when all things flourish. It was also a good time for people to take a step toward a new beginning.The Knights Academy in the capital of the Kingdom of Vinchester was like an official certification institution for knights on the whole Serentra Continent.It was a place where all aspiring knights on the continent were crazy for admission in hopes of receiving a knighthood.In the new spring, the entrance examination for the Vinchester Knights Academy was openly held, and Frintzs, who received a recommendation from Viscount Carmel was headed for Wilhelon, the capital of the kingdom.\"I'll be going, Eli. Take care of your health. Mom and Dad, too.\"Frintz, who had become a mature boy, gave us his farewells.He seems to be going out for a little outing, but in reality, if he passes the exam, he will go through the admissions process and enter the dormitory attached to the military academy almost immediately.And there was no chance that Frintz would fail his entrance exam.\"I'll send plenty of potions and pills every month, so make sure to eat them well. I will write you often.\"\"Yes, yes. After all, Eli's the only one I have. If there is someone who bullies you while I'm away, remember their names.\"\"Brother, if there is an aristocrat who is territorial at the military academy, write their name in a letter and send it to me.\"My mood while seeing off my brother, whom I would not see often in the future, was bound to be a little gloomy.Frintz stroked my head with a large hand as if to soothe me. Meanwhile, Frintz had another companion with the same destination.\"Hey, Frintz! Won't you come soon? I'll leave you behind!\"\"Wait a minute, Young Master. I'll say goodbye to my parents.\"The grumpy boy with indigo black hair next to him, was Romdio Gillette, the Count's scoundrel, who grew up with a mean face.Romdio also decided to enter the military academy. Thanks to a huge donation from the Count of Gillette, he was admitted without examination. It was quite different from the original. In the original story, he found another noble who was qualified to be appointed as a knight and paid for the title.It's hard to know what kind of wind blew in his head to give him the idea to enter the military academy and compete fairly and transparently. Was the presence of Frintz a positive stimulus?Graduation may not be possible, but I just hoped that he would learn a few manners as a knight before coming back.\"I told you to come quickly!\"Frintz couldn't resist annoyed Romdio's urging and ended up only hugging our parents one last time to say goodbye.They broke the space transition stone and disappeared. When even the swarm of lights they left behind had completely dispersed, mother glanced at me and was caring.\"Eli, you don't really want to go to school?\"This was the thirteenth time I was asked this question. When my mother found out that I had recently awakened to Aura, it seemed that she was feeling sorry for my swordsmanship talent that would not be polished.\"I will train differently in here.\"\"Yes. If you change your mind, please tell me. Even if mom has to borrow grandfather's power, I'll let you go to school.\"\"Thank you for saying that.\"It had been two days since Frintz had left, and before I could adjust to vacuum in the family, another parting came.\"Eli, I have something to tell you.\"\"Bia?\"\"I am going to the capital for a while.\"\"Ah, the social season must have begun. But Bia is still 13 years old. Isn't it a little too early to attend the Debutant Ball?\"\"Yes. So, the debutant is a superficial reason, and I am actually going to look into the central political world.\"\"Ah.\"In the main story of the novel, the Vinchester royal family becomes unstable due to a dispute over the succession to the throne.It seems that the nobles are shrewdly moving as the prince and the princesses gradually set up a confrontation. Up until now, Count Gillette has built a wall with the central political world, but with the ambitious Bianca as the next head of state, the Gillette family's strategic direction will change.The war that this fragile-looking noble lady will fight will be fierce.Bianca said with a slightly bitter smile.\"I'm leaving the day after tomorrow. And depending on the circumstances of the palace, it might be away a little longer.\"\"Ah...\"'A little longer' probably means a yearly prediction.My brother's military enlistment I've been mentally preparing for a long time...... but, unlike entering the military academy, the breakup with Bianca felt quite sudden.I covered my feelings of loss and told stories that might be helpful.\"Be careful, of the First Prince. Because what you see on the outside and your real personality are very different.

Please cut me some slack.Because of someone's watchful eye, there was nothing more I could tell Bia. Instead, I rummaged through my satchel.\"And this...I was originally going to give it to you on your birthday, but I will give it to you now.\"\"Hair decoration?\"\"Yes.\"What I pulled out was a hairpin made of red corsage with jewels.\"Pretty. It looks like a camellia flower.\"Of course, it's not just an ordinary accessory that's just pretty.It was obtained by paying a large amount of money at the cash shop, and it was described as 'The accessory used by the legendary femme fatale'.It was also practical.

In proportion to the wait, my expectations grew even greater.With a pounding heart, I looked at the system screen.So, the content finally released is......![<Announcement> 'Tower of Trials Update'Heroes transmigrated from another world! What is your limit! Prove your infinite strength by challenging the top floor of the tower!]\"Wow!\"There you go! This is it!Tutorials are the best.['The World-building God' says this is a masterpiece.]['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' says that usually, the 100th floor is the top floor, but because you are an OP, he had to build up to the 300th floor.]['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' caress the eyeballs that almost fell out during QA.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' has announced that they will make a balance patch based on your attack.]The gods of the development headquarters said one thing after another and disappeared for a get-together dinner party.<What's going on? Why are you suddenly shouting cheers?>\"Agnes, let's go training. My lord gave a training ground for me.\"<A whole training ground?>\"Yes. It's because he's very generous.\"Then, suddenly, an important question came to mind.'Wait a minute, World God! Just one urgent question!'['The World-building God' asks what's going on.]'I'm asking you just in case. Once I enter the tower, I won't be able to get out until I conquer the top floor, right?'How many towers are known to imprison the challenger? I couldn't be disrespectful to my parents because I went in to get stronger and disappeared for nothing!Fortunately, World God took my worries away.['The World-building God' says that there is no such thing as sweet potatoes in this tower.]['The World-building God' explains that The Tower of Trials is a 24 hours free entry and exit building.]It was user-friendly because it was part of the 'Transmigrator Support System'.'Yes, thanks for the reply. Have a nice dinner party!'Now there is nothing to worry about. I picked up my satchel with a light heart.<It looks like a subspace training ground similar to a dungeon. I'm looking forward to it.>\"Right?\"<Then let's use a real sword to commemorate the start of actual training.>\"Wow! Are you finally allowing me to use a sword-like sword?\"<Yes. Your Aura has awakened, you can't carry a training sword forever.>The sword Agnes spoke of meant the loot obtained from the 'Black Salt Desert' dungeon three years ago.It belonged to my mother, who was the original subjugator, but Mom didn't need it because she mainly uses spears and javelins.So the sword that became mine, was called Europe.I finally pulled out what had stayed in the corner of my satchel for a long time. Europe was a sword with a glazed, silvery-blue blade.After wearing Europe around my waist and tying my long hair up, I was finally prepared.\"Come on, Agnes.\"[<System> Do you want to go to the 'Tower of Trials Entrance'?]Yes!A white light enveloped me.\u2720'Sigh, The Saintess....'Clovis Argent, a young and handsome blonde paladin of The Vatican, sighed.He was the real son of Cardinal Vesalius Argent and as the leader of the Knights Templar, he was indeed a promising paladin.But he is now, very much likely, about to leave a blemish on his career.It has been three years since the Knights Templars were tasked with the search for a Saintess.He searched the entire continent, but could not find a clue about her.'Were you stuck in the dungeon all along? How come it feels like there's no divine power at all?'Nevertheless, a Saint's vessel of grace is one that reached the limits of human beings, and at the same time, that presence would have become more distinct.Every time he returned to The Vatican, he hoped to escape from the nagging of the cardinals who were still arguing why he had not found the Saintess yet.\"'Strict order and Goodwill', please give me the opportunity to meet the Saintess you have hidden.\"Soon after he stood up, straightened his bent knees, and drew a holy sign.\"Brother.\"\"Ah, Thesilid. Were you here?\"\"Yes.\"Thesilid Argent, a boy with special silvery hair who proved God's blessing, was behind him. The two share the same Argent surname, but blood was not mixed.Cardinals were often attached as godmothers or godfathers to the Sacred Sheep. Thesilid was given the surname Argent because Clovis' father played the role.Being a godfather was only nominal. After all, the Ministry of Education took full responsibility for the care of the Sacred Sheep, who were orphans.Cardinals also did not take responsibility for their godchildren.Because The Vatican's treatment of stigmata was nothing more than nurturing a public good for the salvation of the world.Clovis was no different in such a desolate environment.Whenever Clovis returned to The Vatican, meeting Thesilid's face briefly was almost the only point of contact they had. Just like now.\"You were ordained a paladin last winter. Congratulations.\"\"Thank you.\"\"I heard that the Sacred Sheep were reorganized as a member of the Templar's Offices in the Heretic Judgment Bureau. Are you starting your outdoor activities now?\"\"It has already started. We have completed three missions so far.\"\"Already? What was the mission?\"\"It was a dungeon subjugation.\"For the past two weeks, they have been traveling around the country and subjugating two B-class dungeons and one A-class dungeon. From the very beginning, the difficulty level was rather high.The subjugation squad consisted of stigmata, including Thesilid, and four apprentice healers. They were all inexperienced and overcame many dangerous challenges.In particular, when they had to fight the boss because they were stuck at a dead-end in an A-class dungeon, Thesilid almost carried it alone.He briefly recalled the time when he faced the black dragon alone with the wounded subjugation squad members in the cliff cave.It was very difficult to fight without heals on a thin rock bridge connecting both ends of a cliff.'I wish I had a healer that I could use.'It seems that Thesilid's habit of mouth, which did not stop throughout the original work, started from this time.\"Then what's the next mission?\"\"The day after tomorrow, I leave to cleanse the Agoni area and spread the word of god among the native people there.\"Clovis raised and lowered his eyebrows in a swift movement, but the act itself was caught in Thesilid's eyes.\"Um, if it's Agoni......It's adjacent to the Ragneif Magic Republic. If you find any clues about the Saintess in there, let me know.\"\"I will.\"\"Okay.\"As always, it seemed like they had enough conversation. It was when Thesilid silently bowed and tried to turn around.\"Wait, Thesilid.\"\"Do you have something to say?\"\"How much do you know about the Agoni region?\"It seemed that there was something about that region, as he had a dubious reaction earlier.\"I heard that the damage caused by the dungeon burst a long time ago made it an unrecovered land.\"\"It's a den of heretics.\"\"......\"\"If the missionary mission fails, you will know the next discipline to be applied by the rules of the Church.\"\".......\"Thesilid's fingertips trembled. Clovis, noticing his agitation, nailed in a strong tone.\"Since you have been selected as a member of the Heresy Judgment Bureau, you have the right to excommunicate from now on. The excommunicated have no human rights, and killing them is not murder. Heed my words and do not hesitate to obey God and the Church.\"\".......\"Thesilid rolled his eyes instead of answering.A denomination that worships the one and the only God.Because of that, Thesilid sometimes felt that his god was not 'Strict order and Goodwill' but rather only 'Strict order'.Order, discipline, doctrine, and rules were more important than good.The special stigma engraved on the inside of his left arm was proof of the same context.\"I'll be on my way.\"He was already used to swallowing the things he wanted to say.Thesilid showed his courtesy again, turned around, and exited the chapel. Dark shadows persistently followed his steps as he walked down the long corridor.Thesilid, who will be walking the sweet potato road in earnest, had a dark expression on his face as if he had predicted his future.\u2720I opened my eyes to the smell of grass and the gentle breeze.A magnificent tower standing on a vast meadow greeted me. The high top was obscured by the sun's rays of light that burned the retina.I stood in front of a huge iron gate and a friendly note was attached.[Descent Banned!]Still, I did not intend to use cheat codes. I had to fight with my own skills.I opened the iron door and as soon as I entered the antique interior.Koo!The iron gate closed by itself, blocking any escape route.[<System> You have entered the 'Tower of Trials 1st floor'. Watch your surroundings.]Straight into battle. I like it.I focused on my hearing while waiting for my eyes to adjust to the increasingly dimmed light.'Signs of presence......there's only one.'It looks like a one-on-one because this is a low floor.<It's coming, cadet Ellet.>Hearing Agnes' warning, I reached out to Europe.Thud! Boom! Boom!A heavy enough weight to pass vibrations in the foundation of the floor. The enemy was slowly approaching.An unidentified enemy approached the torch-lit area.And finally, I saw the terrible boss on the first floor....!Moolkung! Moolkung![<System> Tower of Trials 1st floor boss, 'Cute and pretty slime' has appeared!]\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Moolkung!!A slime the size of a large cushion shook its sky-blue pudding-like body, threatening me. It looked like nothing but dancing around.The embodied Agnes covered her mouth with both hands.<Oh my, what should I do? So cute......!>Pooch!I put aura on Europe and cut the slime with a single slash. Hm! As expected of a famous sword.\"Let's go up, Agnes.\"<......>\"What's wrong?\"<You really value efficiency.>\"Thanks for the compliment.\"The loot was retrieved from a pool of sticky sap. There were plenty of ingredients to make alchemy coagulants. This is quite good.I went straight up the stone steps to the next floor.[<System> Tower of Trials 2nd floor boss, 'Lumpy Poisonous Spore Mushroom' has appeared!]Pussack!Kueek!Mushrooms burst and spores fell like sleet from all directions. If left alone in contact with the body they could cause poisoning.\"Detox.\"I also need to raise my Holy Power skill level.\"Come on, to the next floor!\"[<System> Tower of Trials 3rd floor boss, 'Hungry man-eating plant Nepenthes' has appeared!]Whoops!A huge tulip with tentacle roots shattered into pieces.\"Hmm, is this the difficulty of climbing the stairs up to the 300th floor? Well, next.\"[<System> The 4th floor boss of the Tower of Trials, 'A vicious Ogre' has appeared!]Slash!\"Ugh. Mammals are a first, this could be seen as stomach training. Next.\"[<System> Tower of Trials 5th floor boss, 'Skull knight crazed by resentment' has appeared!]\"Oh, undead? He could be killed with heal. Come on.... Oh, he's not coming. It must be scared because of the passive 'Notoriety that resonates in the underworld'. Seems like my side has to go, Heal! Heal! Heal!\"Kii-Kiiieik!\"May you sleep peacefully under the name of God. Then on the next floor.\"It was roughly like that.As the kids who looked like bosses came out but died in one hit, the time to climb the stairs was longer than the time to kill the boss. The most successful place, however, was the 15th floor.[<System> The Tower of Trials 15th floor boss, 'Infinite Zombie Summoning Circle' has appeared!]Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo-hoo!....\"I will stay in here for a while and work out. Healing level will go up a lot.\"<What kind of Heal do you learn by attacking......>\"What do you mean attacking? Attitude is important. I treat zombies as patients and heal them with compassion.\"<That's not what your face says.>\"Patients keep running away. Sheesh, it's not like I can turn off this infamous passive. Hey, stop there!\"Whoo whoo......!I worked out until the overloaded summoning circle burned down and disappeared and Heal level had just reached 10 after a beautifully successful completed mission.\"I'm hungry. Let's go eat.\"<I can't believe you're hungry after dealing with zombies.>During the tutorial, the system reduces the emotional shock I received, so it didn't hurt me much even if I watched a pretty horrendous scene.If I get used to it visually, I wondered if I would become dull to some extent even after the tutorial was over and the mental barrier was lifted.I hope so. In order to survive in this world, it seems that training my stomach is essential.I gave an appropriate reply to Agnes.\"There are no zombies now. After a certain amount of time after the attack is over, the body disappears, so it's really handy.\"I sat down in a suitable place on the floor and ate a sandwich.The menu was a sweet potato salad sandwich and a chicken breast sandwich. Perhaps because of the dry food, I suddenly wondered about someone's well-being.'Is our Pushover Free Pass doing well?......'......no way.He will be rolling over and over again in the sweet potato field, before the beginning of the original work, to build up the heartbreaking background history of the protagonist.I'm stuck on tutorials and there's nothing I can do for him. I can just try my best to do what I can right now.After finishing my meal, I shook off my seat and stood up.\"I'll go up to the next floor.\"\u2720I dashed up by defeating each floor of the tower in a ruthless way.I think it was a great attack speed.On the first day alone, I cleared up to twenty-five floors, on the second day, twenty-two, on the third day, eighteen floors, on the fourth day, fifteen floors, on the fifth day, ten floors, on the sixth day, seven floors.So on the seventh day...Kiiieehhh......!Woohoo!The half-human half-beast harpy, whose wings were cut off, plummeted to the floor. When I saw it wriggling in the middle of a pool of blood, I decided to show mercy.Pusch.I put Europe into the harpy's vital point and turned it at a right angle.[<System> congratulations! You defeated the 100th floor boss of the Tower of Trials, 'Raging Harpy'.]It was when I was looting over the corpse of the boss.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' is crying because an OP climbed to the 100th floor in a week!]'I'm pretty good, right?'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' says that it was just a tutorial so far, but the real Tower of Trials starts on the 101st floor.]'I see. I'll look forward to it.'As always, I climbed the stone steps to go to the next floor.The structure of the tower was simple. If you go up the stone stairs that seem to surround the rim of the tower, you will see an iron gate leading to the next floor. Behind the iron gate was a gym-size hall, and the boss was always waiting in the center of it to welcome me warmly.However, this formula was broken on the 101st floor.Twitetete!When I opened the iron door, a forest appeared. It was too big to be an indoor garden and I could even see the sky.<From the 101st floor, the battlefield appears to be transformed into a special environment. It's like a dungeon.>\"Uh, well, it's nice to see the sunlight after a long time.\"<It was a shame that we only fought on a well-polished floor of a training gym, but this worked out quite well. You should fight in places where various terrain features are different.>The boss on the 101st floor was the Magma Golem in the middle of the volcano. I was able to encounter the boss only after untimely mountain climbing. As the architect said, I felt the jump in difficulty from the 101st floor. I couldn't finish it like I used to.Agnes showed off her skills as an instructor.<Keep your view wide. You can't look back during battle. You have to figure out the terrain of the place you are fighting in by shifting your point of view.><It's better to have on hands experience. Let's use this terrain. The more cunning and agile the enemy, the better indirect attack works. Try deflecting the whip at the obstacle.>As a model cadet, I diligently followed Agnes' instructions.\"Whoa, haha......, ha......\"When I finally caught the boss, I was completely exhausted. All I could do was stand on top of the cooled magma golem with Europe cleaved on it.<You did a great job, Ellet.>\"This...... Is this what an A-level boss looks like?\"<Yes.>It meant that this one was on the same level as Ardiman.At that time, I used Descent and made Ardiman almost die with only one ultimate skill. I realized once again how deceitful Descent was.'No wonder the penalty was also fatal.'As I went upstairs, the attack speed gradually slowed down, and I could attack only one or two floors a day.After a month had passed, it became difficult to clear even one floor a day.After the seasons changed and I broke through the 200th floor, it was only possible to clear a floor in three or four days after making several attempts.The attack period gradually increased. One a week, one every ten days, one every fortnight... ...Sometimes it was one a month.That's how much I've grown. In particular, the ranking rose a lot thanks to the high level of Holy skill.The seasons cycled and the year changed twice.It was the summer of my fifteen years of age.The day I succeeded in clearing the 265th floor I smiled with satisfaction and tried to activate the healing skill on a scratched wound.[<System> Basic skill 'Healing Lv.60 (+10)' is activated.]It's a great level. Now, there is no shortage of places to go as a bonafide healer. This was even a pretty decent level that was purely raised by actual practice and hard work.The necklace rang.<It's overwhelming compared to the other skills. The sacrifices of the undead were valuable.>\"It was a noble sacrifice.\"<But can I be honest with you?>\"Of course. We are that much closer after all.\"<You and Healer don't quite match. No matter how I look at it, you are an attacking type.>\"Well, didn't I tell you that my hope for the future is 'a useful healer'? That's why I choose to awaken the divine power first.\"<Really? I can't believe it.>I smiled happily and looked up at the blue sky on the 265th floor. It felt like I wanted to shout something like.'Are you watching, Pushover Free Pass!'I raised the level like this to heal you.It was a time when I was happy.<By the way.>Suddenly, Agnes embodied herself in front of me with divine light. Her face had been erased of playfulness.<I think the time has come, Ellet.>\"Yes.\"I also took a serious attitude and posture.Coming here, my growth was not limited to the divine power. Especially today, there has been a big change for me.Agnes opened her mouth in the most solemn atmosphere.<I'll ask you again. Cadet Ellet, do you still want to learn the Whip Sword?>\"Yes, Agnes.\"I have reached the level of an aura Expert, the minimum standard for beginning to learn The Whip Sword technique.[<System> Your ranking changes. Current Rank: 52nd (\u25b251)]As the heat in my core was captured, the rankings rose sharply. It seemed that the system finally recognized me as a person with dual abilities.[<Quest> Achievement of 'Compulsory education time for a wise transmigrated life (for S-class transmigrators)'.][<System> This quest can be completed and rewarded when the tutorial ends. Keep your rank in the top 100 until the end of the tutorial.]It's not bad. I need this quest to remain so I can keep checking my ranking.'There are people I want to compare with.'Agnes smiled before my eyes.<Welcome, now you are my cadet and disciple.>\"I will do my best, Master!\"I took out a whip sword for training that I had prepared earlier as I shouted loudly.Agnes ordered the training in the dungeons inside the Tower to be suspended for a while so I could focus on training in whip sword fencing, footwork, and meditation.I steadily followed, mastering the techniques, building up aura, and laying a solid foundation.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With each breath he took, the air mixed with ashes bitterly filled his lungs.Suddenly, sparks rose from various places into the dark blue sky.A-class dungeon, 'The execution site of living sacrifices'.On the iron crosses that filled the hillside, silhouettes that looked like human beings hung one by one.It was a trace that people who got caught up in the dungeon sink had been used as sacrifices in the devil's ritual.Those victims were heretics.The Church never gave burial to the dead who were not baptized by 'Strict order and Goodwill.'The bodies of the victims hanging on the Iron Crosses will flow into the Demon Realm's garbage dump as soon as the dungeon is closed.In fact, he could have saved them. If only The Vatican had approved the entry into the dungeon a day earlier.But now, it's nothing but useless regret.Thesilid closed his eyes. All he could do after lowering his sword was pray for their soul.\u2720Kugugugung!The white giant monster fell and a cloud of dust rose. Although visibility was not secured for a long time, I put my training whip-sword in its sheath.A message popped up with the click of the metal parts coming together.[<System> Congratulations! You defeated the 275th floor boss of the Tower of Trials, 'The undead Boned-Dragon'.]<It was easy to catch. That's really great.>\"It should be easy. In the meantime, we have already caught ten dragons.\"The ten floors that I climbed after becoming an Aura Expert were the Dragon Slayer special training section.Fire Dragon, Ice Dragon, Light Dragon, Darkness Dragon, Poison Dragon, Mountain Dragon, etc.Since I've caught all of the demon dragons by attribute, I knew almost all the existing dragons' weaknesses.The undead demon dragon was nothing to me.<Indeed, you've only been catching dragons for a year already.>\"I know, right.\"Architect...isn't it a bit too much to use ten consecutive bosses like this?['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' coughs in vain.]Well, wouldn't the end be almost in sight if even the dead dragon was already revived and recycled as an undead dragon?I decided to think positively.<You need to loot, Ellet.>\"Oops.\"The bones and dust clouds had just subsided. I went into the ribs of the Undead Dragon and picked up the item.\"There's an alchemy material and one skill book......Oh, no weapons.\"<That's too bad.>\"Hey, why don't you give me a weapon? It's already on the 275th floor. I think it's about time for the Tower of Trials to give me a whip-sword.\"Instead of a whip-sword for training, I wanted to have one that I could use.While grumbling, one dubious point came to my realization.\"Huh? These bones are not going away.\"After defeating the boss in the Tower of Trials, the body would disappear after a certain period of time.However, the bones of the Undead Dragon showed no sign of disappearing as if they had assimilated into the surrounding environment.I tried to break the relatively stout dragon's forelimb bones. Of course, it was still bigger than my body.The forelimb bones that boated delicate finger joints did not disappear even though they were separated from the main body.\"Wow, I can take this!\"<Huh? What are you going to do with it?>\"Everything has a purpose.\"Savoring the joy of getting an unexpected item, I put the bones in my satchel bag.It was so big that I could only carry one left arm and the tip of the tail, but I think this should be enough.\"I'll go outside for a moment before going up to the 276th floor.\"I went out through the exit gate. I was set to arrive in my room via space transition.It was time to step out of the annex building and walk toward the main building.<Ellet, look over there.>In the middle of the road, I found a very welcomed pink hair.\"Oh, it's my brother. Brother!\"\"Eli!\"Frintz, who was attending the military academy, came to the Count's Castle after a long time.Come to think of it, it was in the middle of summer when cicadas shouted.\"It's summer vacation from today.\"\"Yes.\"\"Why didn't you tell me in advance? I would have waited for you after making something delicious.\"\"Well, I can come directly with the transfer stone anyway.\"I openly eyed Frintz in his cadet uniform. In the few months I haven't seen him, he has grown taller and had an even more handsome face.Now in the fourth grade. Eighteen-year-old Frintz grew up to show off both as a tall handsome man and a youthful boy.\"But what about the scrond...No, I mean, what about Young Master Romdio? Didn't he come with you?\"\"The Young Master has seasonal supplementary study. He must have done poorly on the exam.\"\"He failed last year, and this year is also precarious.\"\"That's right.\"\"Did you do well on the exam? You shouldn't be like Master Romdio.\"\"You worry about everything.\"Frintz responded with a joke to my playful teasing. He stroked my hair and made a mess of it.['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' laughs at where in the world such a sweet older brother exists.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' is satisfied with the fact that he has grown into a great Ropan-type older brother.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' suspects unfair application of the right to change the genre.]['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' says that the transmigrator's sibling is not even a little sister anyway.]While the gods were discussing the stereotypes of siblings, I continued to talk to my brother.\"But why aren't you telling me your grades?

I looked it up, but with inconclusive finds, I'm guessing it's like the birds in a nest who fight for the best place to receive the food from the mama bird, so the weaker gets pecked to the worst place. )\"It's not ranking. Call it using a sword to show sibling love.\"After breaking up with my brother, I headed to the library.I didn't mean to read books. It was because the entrance to the dungeon farm was right in the corner of the library.The gate of the dungeon was revealed when a book with a specific title was pulled out.Stepping inside, a farm that was as well-organized and decorated as a garden unfolded before my eyes.Clattering? Clattering!Clattering! Clattering! Clattering!The working skeletons found me and danced while bumping their jaw. It almost seemed like it meant to welcome me.There was even a guy who actually welcomed me so I could understand.<The farmer......! The farmer is here......!>After waking up, Helverus moved along the furrow and came to me.When I threw herbal dregs at the jumping Helverus, he burned them up and deliciously ate them up.The devil, who was accustomed to preying on things, somehow had a pet-like corner.\"Hello everyone. How have you been?\"<Oooh!>Clattering!\"How is the farm situation?\"Epiden rattled for a long time while gesturing. I watched closely for a long time with a serious face. However....'Sorry. Without Bianca, I can't understand anything.'Albeit, there was no particular problem.<The herbs are prepared, so go ahead and use them. Right now, they're working on the maintenance of the water reservoir, and when it's finished, we can use the water irrigation channels. A little while ago, everything was finished and freshwater came in.>Thanks to Helverus' interpretation.\"I see. Good work. Is there anything difficult about your work?\"Clatt....ering....Epiden's gestured and rattling became weak. Unsurprisingly, Helverus told a gloomy story.<I'm worried about Hias and Agapan. Hias broke his arm bone yesterday, and Agapan completely lost one of his leg bones.>\"What?\"I quickly looked around the worksite. At the same time, Hias was shoveling with his arm in a splint, and Agapan was struggling to realign his leg bones.\"Oh, I knew it would be like this. I told you not to work too hard.\"<They wanted to work hard to make a pound...>The skeletons here are more than a few hundred years old and that meant that their bones were that old.It was not only yesterday or today that they complained of fractures, wear and tear, and osteoporosis. Apparently, the two of them overdid it and something finally broke.\"You guys, come here. I will treat you.\"I beckoned to Hias and Agapan kindly, but.Clattering! Clattering! Clattering!The two skeletons hugged each other tightly and shook their heads violently.\"What?\"Hold on, are you turning down my favor now?I was sending out absurd glances, but Helverus blocked my way.<Do-don't do it, farmer......! When it comes to heal, don't do it in Hias and Agapan! Fo-Forgive them! Pl-Please, Helverus will help, I will work hard! Waaa!>\"Who said I would use heal? I won't.\"<Really?! You are not going to dispose of them like trash?>\"Am I the devil? I'm not using it, so come here, it's safe.\"It was only then that Hias and Agapan reluctantly came before me. They were still shaking though.\"Heavy ho!\"Coogong!I pulled the Undead Dragon's left arm and part of his tail from the satchel.After examining them diligently, I pulled out the middle bone and put it on His's arm.\"Okay, this would be perfect.\"The middle bone of the undead dragon's hand replaced the broken arm bone.Parts exchange complete!Clattering...!Hias was surprised to see his arm moving well again. After confirming that it was functioning normally, I moved on to the next patient.\"Agapan, yours need some processing.\"I took out his leg with worn-out joints, beautifully cut the demon dragon bone with an aura, and put it in a new one.\"Done. Move it.\"Tadadadadada!Agapan began to run through the farm at great speed.Come to think of it, Hias, who was treated first, returned to the worksite and was shoveling like crazy.<Hias and Agapan say the dragon's energy is rising!>There was even an unintentional spec-up effect.

You, too, have been in the same body for hundreds of years, so you must be creaking and squealing around.\"Clattering! Clattering!The skeletons that had shining sockets in their skulls, flocked around, chattering about their painful areas.Helverus immediately went into the interpreter role.<Aster backbone is sore....Bello's left hips is....>I repeated the process of disassembling the bones one by one, replacing them with new parts, and assembling them.It felt like being a skeleton's doctor.['The World-building God' is moved by the appearance of a true healer who heals even the undead.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' complains that the unconditional belief in the follower makes her cringe.]Clattering!

It was a coastal city with many wealthy merchants.An S-class dungeon sink occurred there. It was a disaster that would normally have taken hundreds of lives, but El Torine was lucky.The name of the dungeon was 'Sky Fortress of the Fallen Heaven'.The sky was the main stage. As if to match this, the sinkhole appeared several kilometers above the ground, so the ground was relatively safe.Merchants rejoiced thinking that this was all thanks to their usual large donations.Although the disaster was avoided, the subjugation had to proceed.The huge sinkhole that tore the sky was still open because it could not suck in its prey.Through the bizarre hole, a bewitching purple sky and a black floating fortress could be seen.El Torine's city council requested the Vatican to dispatch troops, and the denomination immediately sent a subjugation squad consisting of stigmata, three holy knights, and healers.The subjugation went smoothly. Since more than a hundred people were involved, even an S-class boss could not last long. The Fallen Angel, the master of the Sky Fortress, was executed with holy stakes piercing its six pairs of wings.The problem occurred when closing.\"W-why is that?!\"\"No way, is it going to fall?!\"The sky fortress, which people thought to be permanently anchored in the purple sky, began to fall at a terrifying speed towards the gate.It was a kind of self-destruct mode.At this rate, the wealthy commercial city would suffer damage equivalent to a meteorite impact.\"Oh, pl-please do something, paladins! This will turn my house into a wasteland!\"\"Even if you say that the dungeon has already been closed....\"\"Wait, then, are you going to just keep watching? For what will you use the holy power you saved until now? At least hurry up and make a barrier around my house!\"\"It's no use. As long as you don't deploy an ultimate barrier with an 8-level divine power....\"\"Heck! Do you think I make donations to hear that?! These incompetent things!\"The merchants of El Torine got angry and broke the space transition stone to run away.However, the citizens were not like the wealthy people who carried always carried a stone by default. Most of the stranded citizens felt hopeless at the intuition of certain death.Then someone climbed the roof of the bell tower. It was Thesilid, a paladin with graceful hair and a holy white uniform.'Since closing has started, the durability of the fortress must be very low. It's worth a try.'He had reached the level of an Aura Expert.In addition, he had bishop-level divine power that was raised by strictly following 'The Commandments of the Seven Holy Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins.'He raised both powers to the limit and activated them simultaneously. The combination of Aura and Divine Power took place.\"The Siege Spear.\"A huge lance made of sacred aura rushed towards the gate. The moment when the pole of light that seemed to burn the retina reached the sky fortress.Kwagwagwagwang!The building of the devil, which was penetrated by the ultimate anti-aircraft skill, was shattered.Thanks to this, El Torine avoided the fate of being devastated leaving only an empty crater in its place.However, the city was not without damage. It was because there was nothing anyone could do until the fragments of the sky fortress fell.Buildings in the city collapsed and burned with debris that fell like rain. There were no casualties, but property damage was severe.Following that, the El Torine City Council and the Vatican's government bureaucrats, who usually fuss over money issues, steamed the sweet potato to a crispy state.The two groups treated the fortress fall and the fortress fragments fall as separate events.In other words, it was true that Thesilid prevented the destruction of the city, but it was also true that his actions triggered a catastrophic rain of debris. In addition to the fact that he did not wait for orders from his superiors and acted according to his will, Thesilid was disciplined.As a result, upon returning to the Vatican, Thesilid suffered from hearings and was ordered to fast and repent for three days, pray for penitence for a week, and stay in prison for another fortnight.\"Hey, are you okay?\"Visitors came to the penance room, which was nothing more than a detention center.It was two of his few friends, Hestio and Ephael.\"Why won't I be?\"In his calm voice, Hestio ran his hands through his black hair, not hiding his annoyance.\"Even if you are being treated like this after doing a great job?\"\"Think of it as a medal of honor.\"\"Ha, really......\"\"Hey, Hestio. He's that type of guy. Better just let it go.\"\"Yes, I almost forgot it for a second. Thanks for letting me know, Ephael.\"\"......\"Thesilid once again looked back at his personality. The current situation had absolutely nothing to do with the 'The Commandments of the Seven Holy Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins.', which had always constrained him.It was the result of acting solely according to his beliefs, and he did not feel bad because he was really honest in making that choice.It was not that he was unaware of the evils of the bureaucracy.He just thought that maybe 'strict order and goodness' recognized the situation and gave him discipline accordingly.That was when Thesilid was trying to self-objectify.Hestio and Ephael rummaged through their arms, pulled out something, and handed it over the metal grids.\"Hurry up and take it.\"\"This......\"It was rye bread and milk. It was hidden for him, who could not drink a sip of water for three days as a punishment.Thesilid blankly looked down at them.\"What? Are you not going to eat it because the rules are important?\"Hestio's tone of voice showed his annoyance, but there was a strong sense of fear that Thesilid would refuse the food.Thesilid laughed a little.\"No, I'll take it, thank you.\"\"......I thought I'd force it into your mouth if you refused. Well, hurry up and put it on your mouth.\"Both watched while Thesilid was eating and Hestio sniffed out words of encouragement that might help Thesilid digest.\"Don't be too down. No one can deny that you saved people.\"\"That's right. If the El Torine City Council didn't make a fuss, the Vatican wouldn't even do this......\"\"Ah, well, Ephael. That's not quite true.\"\"No?\"Hestio had a personality that he had to perfectly distinguish both right and wrong before setting down any type of conflict. Still, the flow of conversation changed to a story that interrupted Thesilid's digestion.\"The Vatican must have been taking this opportunity to take it out on you.\"\"Taking it out? On Thesilid?\"\"Yes. I want you to listen carefully. It's not the first time Thesilid has disregarded the discipline of the Order and acted independently, isn't it?\"\"That's right. In particular, it wasn't something unusual for every heresy judgment we came across.\"Thesilid responded with honest flinching and Hestio looked directly at him with a sigh.\"Isn't that the truth? You are probably the only one among the stigmata who has never killed a heretic.\"\"...... \"Of course, it was not something that could last forever. Thesilid's eyes darkened.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now there were only three floors left.It's been six and a half years since the Tower of Trials was updated.Except for attending Frintz's graduation ceremony at the Military Academy earlier this year, I almost lived in the tower.Thanks to my sincere closed training, I made it to the top 10 strongest on the continent.I also perfectly mastered the unique skills and footwork of the whip sword that Agnes taught me and learned how to operate a special aura from my mother.It is said to be a method of \"conversation\" handed down from generation to generation through the Hispenril family, but to be more precise, it was a method of torture.When I returned to the room after finishing the production of alchemy goods, the full moon was floating in the middle of the sky outside the window.After washing up, I dried my wet hair and stood in front of the mirror.My face, just coming of age, was reflected in the glass-lined with mercury.Looking at the long pink hair, dense facial features, and the peridot-colored pupils in the straight eyes....'Hm, indeed a beauty.'I'm so satisfied I want to support the tip of my chin with my index finger and thumb.['The World-building God' is proud that you have grown so well.]['The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' says that it's the average appearance of a Transmigrator.]['The Creative Business Manager' sighs and says that it's regrettable that they cannot sell the right to change appearance due to high-quality standardization.]Facing my growth in the mirror, it becomes clear that a lot of time has passed.\"There are six months left.\"Until the beginning of the original only half a year remains.['The Spoiler Inspector' complains that as soon as the tutorial is over, you will run like an unbridled foal and sighs at the thought of the destruction of the original.]['The World-building God' yells for the inspector to stop talking about the original.]While World God stopped the Inspector's nagging, I sharpened my sword.I was very careful with my hand when I touched my sword, which was decorated with gold and light blue on a white background.This sword was called <Serpens>, the whip sword obtained by beating the 276th floor Boss.I stayed at the Lair of the Greedy Lord Dragon for three days and three nights and choose this one after much consideration. It prided itself on being the best sword in existence among the whip swords.\"Hehehe.\"I couldn't even hide the laughter that came out of me. The cross pendant rang and Agnes asked a question to confirm with me.<Did you say that you can finally leave the Count's Castle after half a year?>\"Yes.\"<What are you going to do when you leave?>\"Pushover...No, we need to find Thesilid first, right?\"<Oh, do you want to see him that much?

I have never seen the Architect who is serious about physical training actually recommend a break.'I must quickly conquer the 300th floor and prepare to go out to the County.'I closed my eyes after showing a firm will. It was already past midnight, so I quickly fell asleep.It must be dawn over there.Did he, who was having a rough time even before returning, fall asleep well?I fell asleep, hoping that he had a good dream.\u2720\"......\"He stood alone in the canyon under the pouring rain.The shadow of a man, who had managed to hold on with his sword in the ground, eventually collapsed.The cold and sharp raindrops fell on his body that was lying on the floor, drenched in muddy water.There were corpses all over the place. It was just too big of a number to be found in a B-grade dungeon. The summoning circle of an unknown demon drawn in the center of the canyon was also not something to be seen in a B-grade dungeon.However, the known information was that of a normal B-grade dungeon, and the Vatican dispatched Thesilid alone to this 'Valley of Heresy. As a result....Thesilid raised his arm and covered his eyes. The devil whispered in his ear, making him grit his teeth.<Look at the corpses of heretics. Everything is your work.>\"....\"<The Vatican will be proud to welcome you back. It was an achievement worthy of praise, you prevented the ceremony of expanding the Demon King's Domain by annihilating the heretics that were entering and leaving the dungeon, isn't it?>\"......\"<So, how does it feel to be a hero? Dear child of 'Strict order and Goodwill'.>Thesilid spoke like a spit.\"......Shut up.\"The stigma in his arm was hot. In the midst of this, the divine power that steadily fell according to the Seven Deadly Sins was the culmination of contradiction.Thesilid removed the arm that had been covering his eyelids.

Architect, please write an apology letter \\n\\nA sea of \u200b\u200bfog spread out in all directions.The sailboat I was riding in made its way through the calm waters of a windless sea. I focused on the sensations of my surroundings.A blurred vision, the sound of rippling water. Fishy moisture touches the body and an unpleasant dense mist, as if someone's breath was being sucked in with taken breath.'It's coming.'Something strange happened in the calm sea. Raging waves crashed in all directions but not because of the wind.I held out inside the boat for a while, being baptized in salt water for a long time.Feeling the calming current, I lifted my head. A huge shadow shone in the mist.Whoops.The ruler of the misty sea looked down at me with empty eyes.It was the upper body of a beautiful giant woman. There were fins where her ears should have been, and traces of scales all over her skin. Holding a huge harp in her arms reminded me of a Seiren. So, it was not hard to imagine that the lower body hidden in the water was similar to that of a mermaid...Kuwagwagwagwang!Her lower body vibrates and writhes while mercilessly hitting the water surface. It was the body of an endlessly long snake.Her name is 'Cursed Undine Ciel'. She was the boss on the 298th floor of the Tower of Trials.(Note: I'm not sure if it's Wounded, Undead or Undine, but I choose Undine because it makes more sense.)At her tail, the sea began to run wild.<Ellet.>\"Don't worry, Agnes.\"I held onto the mast and withstood the current. It was fortunate that there was a boat that can't be turned upside down provided by default in this field.Of course, balancing was up to me. But thanks to this, I have been specially trained on my sense of balance over the past two months.Kugugugung! Kugugung!As soon as the tsunami was over, a wriggling body attacked from all directions. The tail was thick enough for three adults to hug together. It was meant to thoroughly crush me.\"......\"I can't lose the boat. I jumped first and approached Undine Ciel.Shwiiii!Avoiding the chain attacks of the Boss that was trying to wrap her tail around and hit me, I climbed on the wriggling body as a stepping stone.Another part of her body came upon me again.Koo-cram!I blew the attack off with Serpens. Thick scales cracked from the body scratched by the blade.Kyieeee!Undine Ciel tried to smack me out of her body. I tumbled backward to avoid it, but a mishap happened.Kwaduck!\"Ah, damn.\"The 'non-overturning boat' broke.<Again?>\"Let's continue.\"<What are you going to do?>\"There is a way. Watch.\"I stepped on a piece of plank that floated to the surface and gently stood up. Undine Ciel, who opened the distance, held her harp.Ahhh-!The singer of the deep sea started playing her performance. Undine Ciel was a magical beast. The classification of her family was the Sono-Mancer, a creature who controls sounds.I dealt with it immediately.\"Blessings of Protection.\"[<System> Intermediate skill 'Blessings of Protection Lv.18 (+10)' is activated.]The auxiliary skill level was on the low side, but it was enough to protect my ears when combined with the power of Aura inside my body. In the first place, shel wasn't attacking my eardrums.[<System> Warning. The 'Tsunami of destruction' is coming.]A huge wall of water rose high enough to cover even the sky.\"Ha....This Sister is using this skill again.\"I glanced around. A situation in which only the fragments of the wrecked boat were floating around.It is a very unfavorable condition for life who walks the earth to have nowhere to set foot. Only wizards can float in the air.I broke out in cold sweat and poured out my regrets.\"Oh, come one. If only Descent could be used.\"<Breathe in first.>\"Yes. Hubub!\"KwakKwakKwak!The natural disaster summoned by Undine Ciel engulfed me. The force that seems to destroy everything hit the whole area. It was powerful enough to turn the fragments of the ship into powder.The moment my body was swept away, I saw Undine Ciel smiling as if she had known of her victory.But she won't be able to keep a smile after the tsunami clears.Swaaa...Above the water surface where the tsunami has subsided, peace has been restored. I leisurely 'walked' on the floor.Tap. Tap.The boss had an astonished expression. It was understandable because under my feet was a silver wall. It was the ultimate skill 'Mercury's Barrier'.<Can you use a barrier like this?>Mercury's barrier boasted a majestic silvery Great Wall built in the middle of the sea. It was thanks to the big increase in skill level.I greeted the dumbfounded Boss.\"Welcome, Sister. To my castle.\"Soon Undine Ciel's beautiful face was distorted with anger. She was the ruler of this place. It was only natural for her to explode with anger, as I recklessly built a castle on her territory.Ahhhhhh-!\"You saved me the trouble of provoking you.\"Undine Ciel rushed in, raising her voice from the depths of the abyss.The Boss hit me in the front and tidal waves of destruction, tall as mountains, hit my remaining three sides.I loaded the Aura on Serpen. Undine Ciel was originally a divine spirit. Since there is resistance to divine power, it had to be dealt with Aura.Kwagwang!The tsunami on three sides was blocked by Mercury's Barrier. The front was left open for Undine Ciel.\"I told you I'd welcome you.\"Kwajiijik!At the top of the fortress wall, Undine Ciel's nails were blocked with a sword.Chaeng! Chaeng! Keang!After a long battle, a standoff was reached. Stretching her sharpened nails even more, the Boss opened her huge mouth, revealing her fangs.Aaaahhhhh-!Sonic waves of sound hit my body. It was a vibration strong enough to explode the whole body of a normal person. However.\"You're spitting on me.\"\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It slashed various parts of Undine Ciel's body like a whip and wrapped around her like a wire.It was the 'Snake Hunting Festival, one of the whip sword techniques.\"It's great that Aurors don't have to shout out their skill names.\"Undine Ciel resisted, but as a result of constant training, my aura overpowered her. I was about to cry over my first win in two months.\"It's over now.\"Kyaaaa!In the end, Undine Ciel's body, tied by the whip sword, was unable to move anymore.She was frozen in a dynamic posture like an Imoogi trying to ascend to heaven. Fear and despair were read on her face as she looked down at me.(Note: Imoogi is a Korean mythological snake, sometimes described as a dragon.)In my left hand, I held another sword, Europe. It's time for the little mermaid to go down the drain.\"Bye.\"Whoomp![<System> Congratulations! You defeated the 298th floor boss of the Tower of Trials, 'Cursed Undine Ciel.]I removed Europe and sheathed Serpens.The split blade parts embedded in wires were retrieved and the blade was put together in the form of a complete sword.What should I say about the Whip Sword? It seems to have a charm akin to the union and transformation of mechas.\"Sigh, so cool.\"<Yes, that's why we learn the whip sword.>I looted through pastel-colored bubbles and found two items. 'The Mermaid's Tears' and 'The Spirit King's Harp String' came out.The mermaid's tears were the material used in the highest quality potions, and The Spirit King's Harp String was both a part of an instrument and a wire weapon.Both seemed useful.['The World-building God' applauds.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' is delighted that the tedious closed practice will be finally over after two more floors.]['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' is surprised that you have already broken through the 298th floor.]['The Critic who adjusts the balance' writes a plan to upgrade the Tower of Trials.](Note: Changed 'The Harsh Commentator who adjusts the balance' to 'The Critic who adjusts the balance' for better nicknaming.)When I defeated the boss, a notification automatically went to the management office making the gods come to send messages.In the meantime, it was evaluation time for The Vatican's 1st Hell Instructor, Agnes.<Very good, Cadet Ellet. Now, you can stably defeat an S-class boss alone.>\"I had quite some trouble, after all, it's an S-class.\"I took a peek at my continental ranks while being stuck in the tutorial quest.A whopping 7th place. It's the same rank as when I first used Descent to catch Ardiman.Although the skill level of sacred power was much lower, it seemed I was being ranked high because it was creating synergy with aura.<It's okay to be a little more proud. If it's an S-class, it's a beast that an elite 12-man subjugation team must stick together to fight.>\"Hehehe.\"It was true. I was an all-around talent.As a Transmigrator, I have no role restrictions because it was enough to buy the necessary skill book at the cash shop and learn it.I can tank, attack, heal, and buff by myself.But it was difficult to become proud. If we are talking about catching an S-class boss alone, it's only on the same level as the Pushover Free Pass around the 20th time of his return.I still have a long way to go if I make an absolute evaluation based on the original that returns 99 times.However, I had a trump card skill.'What would happen if I used Descent in the present state?'I haven't used Descent of Divinity since I lifted my mother's petrification curse in the Black Salt Desert. It was because of the prohibition of using Descent inside the Tower of Trials and the fact that for the past 7 years, I almost lived only in the Tower.Obviously, according to what World God explained in the past, the power of Descent of Divinity increases in proportion to the increase in my strength.At this point, when I can defeat an S-Grade boss by myself without the need to use my ultimate skill, I wonder how much my stats would rise if I used Descent.['The World-building God' adds expectation that, let alone episode 20, you will be able to chew and eat even if the main character of episode 99 comes out.]['The Critic who adjusts the balance' insists that Descent also be confiscated outside the tower as it's classified as an OP skill in that world.]I was a little saddened by the words of the critic who always wanted to nerf me.Today, I'll have to argue about it for a bit.'Mr. Critic, did you forget that my timeline is episode 17? It's too much to confiscate 'Descent of Divinity' after dropping me in the round where the Final Boss appears right in the beginning, don't you think so?'I bluntly asked without hiding my expression.['The Critic who adjusts the balance' flinches.]Look at this. Not even the Critic can argue about that.This just goes to show how scary is the last boss. He basically kills the 17th Pushover Free Pass like a bug, using so much as a hand gesture.When I think of the Final Boss, I feel that I need to become stronger.<Huh? You are going upstairs right away?>\"Yes. I have to go.\"I climbed the stone steps leading to the 299th floor. Now that it was going to be another boring grinding time, the gods of the Transmigration Management Bureau encouraged me to work hard while they went back to their own work.But.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' watches you with anxious eyes.]Hmmm? Why isn't the architect going back? And why is he also quite nervous?'Mr. Architect.'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' is startled.]'What are you hiding?'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' was taken by surprise and says nothing with a flustered tone.]'The system is relaying everything to me. Please, hurry up and tell me quickly.'The architect was quiet for a long time. It was only when I was thinking about whether he had read my message and ignored it, that the reply came.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' desperately asks if it is not possible to attack the 299th floor a month later.]'Why?'I waited with my hand on the door on the 299th floor.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' exercises the right to remain silent.]Then I'll have to open it and go in.I think I'll know why as soon as I open the door, besides, I'm quite curious.Agnes also cheered me up.<Now there are two floors left. Come on in.>\"Yes!\"I pushed a huge arched iron gate.Kiiing.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' screams silently.]Light poured through the crack. A slight feeling of floating in space enveloped me as I covered my eyes with my hand. This feeling is definitely....'Spatial movement?'It was a moment of realization.[<System> You have entered the S-level dungeon 'Slime Cuisine Cave'.]That's weird.Obviously, I opened the door on the 299th floor of the Tower of Trials, so why is the message that I have entered the dungeon popping up?I squinted and looked around.A cave that can be said to be a classic of a dungeon world. Thanks to the natural nightlight stones embedded in various places, I was able to see the interior clearly.Glow-in-the-dark slimes boasting bright colors greeted me with plump bouncing, it feels like I was at a ball pool because of the huge number.Tung! Tung! Tuuuuung!It was enough to hit those who attacked me with a hand slap coated in aura. The slimes that bounced off like volleyball balls hit the wall and exploded.\"Agnes, this looks like a real dungeon.\"< That seems like it. What happened?>I have some predictions, but I still need to get an accurate answer.'Mr. Architect, how did this happen?'Only then did the architect confess the truth.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' confesses that the 299th floor is still under design, so he hastily connected it to any S-class dungeon available.]Breaking News!The Tower of Trials, updated 7 years ago, turns out to be in fact unfinished!It was roughly as expected. I clenched my head and answered briefly.'You must write this in your apology.'It seems to have been an aggressive remark.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' vomits his words in anger that he was running out of time because you are an OP human.]['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' complains that it is impossible to consume the contents of a 300-story tower in only 7 years.]['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' said that he secretly patched the boss several times, but shouts that this is too much.]I see. You did a ninja update.(Note: When something is updated without notice.)My eyes were getting narrower. Only then did the architect stop pouring out messages as if he realized he had done something wrong.Judging from the circumstances, it seems that the other gods, including World God, do not know yet.If so, there is only one way to prevent the architect from writing an apology.'Okay. I just need to find the exit gate and leave calmly, right?'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' asks in doubt if you will do that.]It was regrettable that I had to give up the opportunity to explore the dungeon, but I gave up taking into account my relationship with the architect.Since there was no need to catch the boss, there seemed to be no need for a weapon, so I put both swords in the satchel bag.Perhaps, more than words, it was a clearer expression of my will, and at last, the architect was relieved and happy.\"Agnes, there must have been a problem with the Tower of Trials. First, I need to find the gate and go out.\"<It's a dungeon where you can only get slimes at best. Seems like a C level, but why not close it lightly and leave after?>\"You can't look down on this one.\"I remembered the dungeon grade and the name the system gave me.\"It's still an S-class dungeon. The slimes here are the prey that the cave master feeds on.\"<Then you must be careful.>If it's an S-class boss she can defeat it, but the Tower and the dungeons were completely different.In the Tower, it was possible to repeatedly challenge the boss several times and fail just as much.But the dungeon is real.One failure is likely to lead to death.Agnes seemed convinced that I was stepping down because of that.I suddenly wondered.'Mr. Architect, I am asking just in case. I also can't use Descent here, right?'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' says that the ban on Descent will apply from the moment the dungeon is connected to the Tower.]As expected, unfavorable rules apply without fail.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay'Hmm, just in case you don't know.'Having decided to be more careful while I was at it, I decided to take a moment to read.I set up a barrier around and opened my collection of bookmarks of the original in the integrated study room to search for the name of the dungeon.[Bookmark 291 - The Story of Potatoes #Slime Farming Cave #Pushover friends of a sweet potato #Duke Wallenstein #Stigma Curse]'Unfortunately, it's the dungeon from the episode where the Little Duke, who turned hostile to the main character, is introduced.'Duke of Wallenstein.He is a character who was forced to point his sword at the main character because of the unfair orders of the first prince he served.The Little Duke had a human affinity for the main character and had a personality that values \u200b\u200bchivalry by default. Conflicting between beliefs and orders, he eventually falls for the main character's persuasion and lowers his sword.So, the readers wondered why the author didn't roast the sweet potato and gave a warm ending...'The curse that fell when the Little Duke went on his knight training trip must have been triggered at that time, causing an S-class dungeon sink.'And that was the end of the character that sacrificed and died for the main character.The 'Slime Cuisine Cave' I got in was where the Little Duke of Wallenstein got the curse, and it was the same S-class dungeon that appeared at the decisive moment of reconciliation with the main character.In the meantime, I have read the original several times, taking notes of important information.Thanks to this, I was able to quickly figure out what the boss was and what was dangerous in the dungeon.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' says that you decided not to catch the boss and protests as to why you are looking up the target.]The integrated study was closed due to the architect's resentment.Plump!As soon as I walked through the barrier, the slimes attacked again without knowing what they were doing.Whoosh!When I smashed the slime flying in front of my face, the hit slime flew down the cave passage and knocked down other slimes like bowling pins.\"Oh, it's annoying. Divine Punishment!\"Kwawagwagwang!Lightning bolts poured down the front, burning the slimes in the straight passage. The surviving slimes also fled in fright, so the road was cleared up.Kururururu!<The cave will collapse.>\"I'll be careful. Come on, let's find an exit...\"I quickly took three steps back.Kwawagwagwang!The ceiling of the place where I was a little while ago collapsed.Hic. Maybe because I used the ultimate skill earlier?!Fortunately, it wasn't.\"Cough, cough!\"\"Is everyone okay?!\"It wasn't just the piles of stones that fell. Four people appeared from the thick cloud of dust.'Wow! People!'It was my first time meeting adventurers. But unfortunately, the mood was not good to say greetings.Chomp!Soon, a demonic beast fell from the ceiling.Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.It was a huge slime that was black like ink and blocked all the passageways.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' is relieved that this is not the boss.]The black slime stretched its body like a tentacle and attacked the four people.Shhhhhh!\"Everyone behind me!\"A handsome young man with platinum blonde hair stood in front with a sword and blocked the attack. A bunch of black tentacles was cut off by aura.Ho, he's quite talented.I suddenly realized that the clothes the young man was wearing were familiar. It was the uniform of the Knights Academy that Frintz wore home every vacation.<It's a cadet. I didn't expect to see one here.>The other three who fell together seemed to be hired.One mage and two snipers with middle ranged weapons. Except for the cadet, there were no aura users.There was no need for me to go out, as the cadet did it all by himself. The tentacles of the ink slime were cut off while he showed off that he was an aura user.Fearing that it would die as is, the ink slime fled upstairs through a hole in the ceiling.\"Are you all right?!\"A human cry was heard from above the floor where the monster had escaped. There were more companions.\"I don't see any monsters on this road. You'd better come downstairs.\"The cadet made a decision by looking at the road I had cleaned beforehand. Looking at his natural disposition, he looked like an aristocrat.The young wizard who had a gentle-looking face and had felt first lowered the party with floating magic.<The condition is serious.>Agnes' evaluation of each person was such, and I was also sympathetic.There were in total 8 people.There was only one person who looked like a healer, and there was a kid about ten years old in the party, and except for these two people, the others didn't seem strong overall.At the very least, it was enough to go to a B-grade dungeon.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' urges us to go on our way without thinking of pursuing a friendly meeting in the dungeon.]But before that happened, there was a show happening right in front of my eyes.A man in his late 20s in a priest's uniform began to get annoyed with the group.\"Hey, what kind of subjugation team is this messed up! Hey, come here Leader. Come talk to me.\"\"Priest Joachim...\"\"Because of your poor command, the assistant healer who was dispatched from the Vatican office was eaten by the boss. How are you going to take responsibility?!\"\"That...\"A woman in her 40s, who seemed to be the leader of the subjugation squad, had a somber face.\"Isn't that an accident caused by Priest Joachim who woke up the boss?\"\"Wha-what?\"\"Because of that, two of our colleagues were also lost. From the start, this was a safe place where you could dig up resources with some safety, but you dared to use your low-level sleep skills on the sleeping boss that even had the opposite effect....\"it's a troll.\"Hey, shut up! Are you blaming me for losing The Vatican's healer? Don't you know that if a healer gets hurt, it's also the responsibility of the subjugation squad?\"It was cowardly to hit them with the rule of thumb in this kind of situation.\"...I'm sorry.\"\"Sorry or whatever, if I go back to the church, you won't be able to get any more healers to this guild again, so just remember that!\"\"M-Mr. Joachim!\"The captain bowed her head and begged him to look the other way just this once, but to no avail.A troll healer named Joachim was busy nagging as if to make all of them hear everything.\"Oh, the more I think about it, the more annoying it gets. After all, I think I'll have to heal everyone here by myself.\"It seems that even the main topic of the anger he had about his college being eaten was because he would be harmed in some way.The eyes of other people looking at Joachim were fiery. In particular, on one side, even a strong killing intent was felt.However, in the dungeon, the healer is akin to a government post. Not to mention especially if it's the only healer left.The subjugation crew took care of their facial expressions and tried to soothe Joachim.\"Mr. Joachim, we will do our best so that you don't use heals very often.\"\"Of course, I will keep Priest Joachim's security as the first priority.\"\"Please, lessen your anger, Mr. Joachim. You have the most important role, right?\"Because healers are so precious, a strong bound of hierarchy is formed, but it was still a bit too much in this case.Even Priests can ascertain pressure since it's a nameless small or medium-sized subjugation group.\"Can we really get out of here? We've got less energy, we've got no backup healers, we've got two loads!\"Joachim's fingers point to the two quietly in the corner. It was a little girl and a boy with gray hair.<It seems that these two are not members of the subjugation squad, but survivors.>It was time to agree with Agnes' words.Joachim nervously ruffled his hair, correcting his words.\"No, now there are three instead of two. That girl!\"Huh? me?\"You can tell just by looking at it. That girl got caught up in the dungeon sink, too, and she's going to ask us to take her out.\"\"....\"\"Hey, Leader. Are you going to take that person as well and tell me to heal eight people by myself?\"\"Priest....\"\"I refuse to adding more unnecessary people to this party! Take me or take that girl! Choose either one!\"\"....\"\"Come on! Choose! Is it me or that girl?!\"...what is this.I, who stood still, was suddenly put on the option menu side by side with the troll healer on a power harassment mission.\"Pr-Priest Joachim...\"Everyone was perplexed, not knowing what to do with the only remaining healer's fit or rage.Like people who were about to do something bad because they couldn't avoid it, they looked sorry for me.\"What are you going to do?\"\"Well, we have to go with the Healer.\"\"Mr. Joachim says he's having a hard time....\"\"I will obey your will.\"\"All right. Well thought out.\"Except for a few people, the view of seeing almost everyone cling to Joachim was...haha...I could only laugh.I just stood still, what is this all about?I can't. We'd better get things straight!At that time, a handsome cadet with an angry face protested against Joachim.\"I can't believe it. Nobody is asking you to sacrifice, but to be so stingy about giving charity, I wonder if you're really a person who serves God.\"A living justice in a place like this?Who is the person I want to introduce to our Sweet Potato?\"If the priest is going to come out like that, I'm out of here. I have no intention of participating in anything that goes against chivalry!\"I patted him on the shoulder, holding back the desire to applaud.\"Excuse me, cadet.\"\"Hmm?\"\"I liked what you said. So, excuse me for a second.\"\"What?\"I grabbed the wrist of the bewildered cadet who had injured his left arm.I smiled when I saw that everyone's eyes were gathered on me.\"Heal.\"\"......!\"\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is my healing that has reached the level of advanced skills by leveling up!\"Oh, my God!\"\"Oh my God, such a heal...!\"As expected, the response was enthusiastic. In particular, Joachim was speechless with his mouth wide open. I smiled and greeted everyone.\"Hello. I'm a healer. Would you like to go with me?\"\"Me! Me!\"\"Take me, please!\"People lined up behind the cadet. Everyone except Joachim.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' hates unnecessary party formation.]The architect grumbled, expressing his tendency to play solo.\"Wh-what...\"Joachim, who had been supported until a second ago and was suddenly abandoned, had a bewildered face.\"What, no, thi-this is absurd...Cog!\"\"Priest, me too~.\"Someone tackled Joachim on the shoulder as they walked past him, in a very deliberate manner.No one came forward to support him as he collapsed.\"Ho-how could you do this to me...?\"That's why you should usually do good to the people around you so that you won't dig your own grave.This isn't even worth sympathizing with.\"I need to treat your injuries. I'll see you one by one.\"\"Oh my god! Does a Priest even heal wounds like this?\"\"The priest over there told me to endure it unless I broke a bone because it was a waste of divine power....\"\"After all, strong people are different!\"\"Look at the healing speed. You are so fast that no one can compare!\"If Joachim slaps, I should hit an uppercut.The subjugation members poured out praises for me, demonstrating their ability to comfort and soothe Joachim.\"These people...until now, you were begging for my heals...!\"Joachim's face turned red, he is unlikely to be good at controlling his anger.If, so.\"Ah, it's taking a long time and it's cumbersome to go through the injuries one by one. I will treat you all at once!\"Flash!I was annoyed, so I activated the area heal 'Healing Field'...\"Gasp!\"\"Oh my god!\"\"Wow!\"A brilliant light emitted by advanced skills and a holy breeze that engulfs my body as the caster.The divine power overflowing in full overwhelmed the surroundings.<Ellet, you look very strong.>Yes, that's what I was aiming for.Everyone's injuries were healed at the same time and cheers erupted from all over.\"....\"Joachim had become calm before he knew it. His face color was also back to an ordinary skin color that seemed to be able to control his anger well.And after a while.\"Oh, Sister!\"Joachim shoved the others and ran towards me.\"I almost didn't recognize you because you weren't wearing a priest's uniform! Oh, my God, I should have noticed!\"\"....\"\"Since a Sister with strong divine power has come as a healer, I have to assist. Please, Sister, heal as much as you like and leave all miscellaneous things like detoxification and immunity to me. Right?\"\"....\"\"Oh, you don't like it? Uh, uh, well, then......! Should I do all the healing by myself? I, I will squeeze my divine power! Uh, somehow and, erm, I'll do it all by myself! Sister just needs to supervise!\"\"....\"I didn't even say a word. What's with this result?Seeing Joachim actively claiming to be a healing battery, the subjugation crew murmured.\"I've never seen Priest Joachim crouch like that.\"\"How can a person be so different....\"Joachim must be desperate in his own way, after all, this is a situation where a high-grade compatible healer appeared to replace him.If he doesn't act like he has an iron plate for a face to get a secondary healer position, at the least, he'll be thrown out of the subjugation squad.I looked at the subjugation leader with a sense of handing over the decision-making authority. The quick-witted Joachim was quick to flatter the leader as well.\"I will report to the Vatican about the unexpected accident that happened earlier, Leader!\"\"...The more healers, the better. We would appreciate it if both of you would join us.\"A decision was made. Then it's time for a simple introduction.\"I am Anne, the subjugation commander of the 'Pure Gold Apples'.\"\"I'm Kyle, a subjugation member.\"\"I'm Kana, his little sister. I belong to the same Guild.\"\"My name is Seijin, a wizard who came in as a mercenary.\"\"You can call me Ray.\"\"My name is Ash.\"\"It's Frese.\"\"I am your trusted brother, Joachim!\"For some reason, there was an atmosphere where only the name was revealed without the last name. maybe because we would be together for a little time.Then me too.\"I'm Ellet. Please feel free to talk comfortably with me.\"A total of nine people, including myself, started moving.Exit gates in the dungeon are randomly generated and then disappear. Unfortunately, the system map didn't show the gate, so I had no choice but to diligently move my feet to find it.While walking through the cave passage, Joachim kept pretending to be friendly.\"Sister Ellet, how did you come to be alone in such a shabby place?\"\"It just happened.\"\"What about your party? Where have all the subjugation crews who have to risk their lives to protect the Healers gone? What disgrace they are!\"\"I don't have any.\"\"What? You don't have a party? In this S-class dungeon...?\"Not only Joachim, but some of the subjugation members looked at me with surprise.\"Is it possible that Sister also got caught up in a dungeon sink like me and came here?\"A little child in a brown ponytail, who had been walking close to me since before, interrupted.She threw in a nice setting, so I decided to use it.\"Yes. I got caught up in a dungeon sink. Frese must have been like that.\"\"Yes. I was obviously lying in bed to sleep, but when I opened my eyes, I felt a strange feeling, and suddenly there were a lot of slimes around.\"A world where you fall into a dungeon sink while sleeping. As expected, the survival difficulty is S-class.Of course, this is also an extremely unfortunate case.Suddenly, a little question came to mind.\"You came alone, there was no one else?\"\"Yes. I was alone.\"\"Then, how could you walk among the slimes...?\"\"I was struggling with being buried, but this Uncle here saved me!\"The person nominated was the cadet who identified himself as Ray in the introductions. He flinched and muttered as if he was very upset.\"Why am I an uncle, and she's the older sister...?\"\"Yes, Frese. Please also call the aspiring knight here your brother. There is not much of an age difference.\"\"...Are you defending me?\"\"My brother is also a cadet at the military academy. We can't just let this injustice go.\"\"Right.\"But Frese was stubborn.\"But you are wearing the uniform of the Knights Academy. When my dad went to the military academy, he was already old. Military academy Cadet Uncle!\"\"Ugh.\"This world or that world, everything seems mean...I offered my deepest condolences.\"Uh, um, would you like me to call me you Brother as well?\"\"No, it's fine.\"\"Yes.\"There seemed to be some kind of empathy now, I'll take this time to ask you a question.\"Cadet Ray, I have a question for you...\"\"You seem curious about me. I'm a graduate of the 117th class of the military academy, and currently on a one-year knight training trip to receive a knighthood according to the custom. I applied as a mercenary to the 'Pure Gold Apple' subjugation team to earn money for travel.\"\"I see. Congratulations on your graduation.\"\"Thank you. It seems like it's been a while since I got pure well intended congratulations.\"\"I can feel the sorrow of a second son. You must have been compared to the top a lot.\"\"...Right. After all, I was labeled as second place, so even if I stood still, I was often compared to the first place, I finished second until graduation. Sigh...\"\"Oh, but that's not what I was going to ask.\"\"Oh, really? So what were you trying to ask?\"\"The cadet must be a nobleman. Your manner is quite easy to see at first glance.\"\"Ah...\"I thought he would come out shamelessly, but Ray made excuses with an embarrassed face.\"That's because I'm not used to respectful words to people other than my parents.\"\"Really? You must have met a lot of other nobles at the military academy. Did you have a good relationship with your classmates?\"\"Yes! Everyone has a higher status than me...Well, no. More than that.\"Ray tried to turn his words.\"You said that your brother was also a cadet at the military academy. It could be someone I know.\"\"Oh, come to think of it, my older brother also graduated this year. He must be a graduate student from the same year as Cadet Ray.\"\"Really? What's his name?\"Discovering traces of alumni in a foreign country creates a sense of joy that was not seen before. Ray's eyes lit up.But.\"Frintz. He gave a speech as a representative of the graduates.\"\"...\"Why did his expression harden the moment I said my brother's name?\"F... Frintz?\"\"Yes.\"\"Your brother is called...Frintz?\"\"Is there something wrong...?\"\"Oh, no. Nothing.\"But, that's not a face that says it's nothing?Why are you doing this? My brother isn't the type of person to mess around with others? He's kind, smart, and good-looking, so he's a likable type right?Then Ray looked at me and muttered something.\"Come to think of it, you have pink hair ...\"His eyes fluttered wildly.When I was about to ask why the hell he was doing that. Suddenly, Ray opened a quiet distance from me.\"Excuse me...?\"\"I-I'm sorry. I am allergic to pink hair. I need you to stay away from me.\"\"....\"I wondered if it was a lame excuse, but he was acting like someone with an allergy.< My goodness, now I'm seeing all sorts of things. He's quite the weirdo.>['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' advises to not stay too close.]I was grateful to Agnes and the architect for being on my side.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To break the ice, I decided to talk to someone else.\"Seems like some of you got in because of a Dungeon sink. Did you get caught up in the sink like Frese?\"The target I spoke to was another person who was not a member of the subjugation party. He was a boy in his late teens, with gray hair, clad in black leather.Was his name Ash?\"Ah, well, Ash is....\"The party leader stepped out with a puzzled face. Like I asked something I shouldn't have asked.Ash opened his mouth.\"No.\"It was a slow and low voice to match his gloomy atmosphere.\"I was a mercenary belonging to another subjugation party. We were attacked and the party was broken apart.\"\"Then the others...?\"\"...Wiped out. I barely survived because my brothers told me to hide in a cave.\"(Note: You know that Korean costume of males calling older males they are close as Hyung. Is the same here, they were really not real brothers.)At this point, I felt awkward and embarrassed, it seems like the subject needs to be changed. I glanced at his waist left side.\"Well, seems like you are using a one-handed sword.\"\"Yes, I'm terrible at it.\"That ended the conversation and I slowed down a bit. My pendant necklace rang as I intently looked at Ash's back.<It's all lies.>I totally agree with Agnes.If I had to pick the two strongest people besides me in here, it was the pink-hair allergic Ray and the gray-haired boy named Ash.He is not at all a person who would hide under anyone's protection.Furthermore.<You can tell by the calluses on his hands and the way he walks. He's a double dagger assassin. Seeing what he's hiding this fact, it looks like he has another motive to be here. He's dangerous, so be careful.>Agnes, who is the Vatican's 1st Hell Instructor and also a weapon master that has mastered all weapon techniques had excellent eyesight.I answered quietly so that only Agnes could hear me.\"I know.\"Because I'm a transmigrator.Ash Night. A first-class assassin belonging to the assassination guild 'The Night Eagle' and a direct disciple of its Guild master.In the original work, he was also the villain who was commissioned by the Magic Republic of Ragneif and aimed to end the protagonist's life, so I can't help but remember.'He might even be responsible for the annihilation of the subjugation party. There is no better reason to keep mouths shut after an assassination than using the excuse of being wiped out in a dungeon.'Suddenly, Ash looked back at me and I almost flinched.<What is it? Why is he looking at you?>R-Right, why is he?My conscience was poked for no reason because I was throwing a wary gaze on his back for a long time.\"For a healer, the back is dangerous. It is better to walk ahead so as not to fall too far behind the group.\"\"Ah yes...\"I stood side by his side because I didn't want to have an assassin in the back of my head.\"Please speak comfortably. I think you're older than me.\"The kindness of a murderer is usually anxiety-inducing. Apart from that, I had no particular reason to refuse, so I accepted.\"Yes. I will, Ash.\"\"Thank you, Sister.\"\"....\"\"Any problem?\"\"Hm, no.\"Ash was a sociable assassin.\"I can't see the gate.\"Seijin, a young wizard walking in front of him, spoke up.He is a researcher belonging to Ragneif's Wizard Tower, and it is said that he came to obtain materials for a research thesis. Much like a graduate student preparing a master's thesis.Like a scholar, he looked like an existence far from battle, and he was vigilant about his surroundings like an herbivore.\"We should go outside quickly and inform the other subjugation teams that the boss has woken up.\"\"Co-Cof.\"Joachim coughed with an uncomfortable look. He seemed to be conscious that he had woken up the boss and made trouble for everyone.Frese, who came to my side again, opened her eyes and asked me.\"Can't the people here defeat it?\"\"To subdue an S-class dungeon, you have to gather a lot of very strong people.\"\"Aha, the people here are weak. Then why are you in such a dangerous place when you are weak?\"There is a cruel side to the innocence of children.\"We're here to dig up resources.\"Seijin corrected his glasses and explained.\"Usually, resources are mined after subjugating the boss, but this dungeon is a little special.\"\"What's special about it?\"\"The main resource here is the glow-in-the-dark slime, and the boss is the one who is cultivating the slime. The desire to eat emitted by the boss has the effect of promoting the production of glow-in-the-dark slimes. So, when the boss dies, the slime farming ends, so we just put the boss to sleep so we can mine resources.\"\"Aha.\"As soon as he finished his role as a teacher, Seijin recalled the reality again and trembled in fear.\"The boss who woke up must be walking around the dungeon by now. If we don't hurry to find the exit....\"He shortened his words as if conscious of Frese.The boss here is a 'Predatory Anglerfish'. It's been a while since it woke up so the hungry bastard will try to eat us.The members of the Pure Gold Apple Guild trembled their shoulders as if they were chilling to the bones, and said one word at a time.\"The boss looks...It was really terrible. I don't want to see it again.\"\"Right. I'm afraid it'll come out of my dream. The others who were caught by him are now...\"\"Kyle, Kana. For now, let's just think about finding an exit.\"\"Yes, boss...\"['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' complains that if they really understood their situation they should walk faster.]The road that had been going in a straight line for a long time ended. Connected to the end of the cave passage was a huge hall-like cavity.There were many natural nightlight stones, and there were also many colorful slimes that were produced.\"Wow, how much is this all?\"Almost at the same time, I stepped into the place as if I was possessed by the view.\"It's dangerous!\"Five black slimes popped out. As before, a part of their body spread out to form a bundle of tentacles that stretched out to attack.Shwiiii! Shiwiiiiii!Ray blocked the surprise attack, giving the others time to line up.The three members of the Pure Gold Apple, the allergy cadet, and the graduate student took the lead to deal with the slimes.\"Five mutants...!\"\"It's because the boss woke up. These guys aren't farmable prey, they're kind of caretakers.\"It was when Seijin, who had a long strap bag, showed off his knowledge.\"Arghhh! Sa-save me!\"Joachim, wrapped in black tentacles, screamed to the point where the cavity rang.Ray cut off the tentacles to save him, but problems arose. The number of mutant slimes had increased.\"Oh My God. I think the screams just now brought in the slimes.\"\"Damn it! It's a bastard who's worse than an enemy...!\"\"I'm regretful as the Captain! I should have abandoned it!\"\"Joachim, you bastard! Sit still in the back and do some heals!\"As the number of slimes increased, the situation turned into a crisis.\"Si-sister...\"\"It's okay, Frese.\"When I was about to heal people's injuries right away while soothing a frightened child.Shh!In the midst of the chaos, a bunch of black tentacles rushed to me.Swoosh!The tentacles were cut off in front of me before I could use my hands. Ash, who had been watching from behind, came out.\"Sister is our top priority for protection.\"\"It's all right.\"I replied while snatching the tentacles that rushed at Ash with my hand. After tying them in a ribbon shape, I threw the slime away.A tint of surprise and interest flashed in Ash's eyes as he looked at me.\"You seem to have done quite a bit of physical training.\"\"Yes. When I was young, I was teased a lot for being weak.\"I can't forget the nagging of Libra(Scales), the Critic, and the Architect.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' said it out of love.]'Yes, yes, of course.'I did not use aura and moderately countered with self-defense. Of course, I also did heals from time to time. Contrary to his aspiration to do his best by himself, Joachim was virtually useless because he was in a panic.\"Oh, thank you, Miss Islet.\"The Pure Gold Apple trio was good enough so as to not hold others' ankles back. The number of black slimes steadily decreased thanks to Ray, the second-ranking knight graduate who was strong as a hundred men, and Ash, who was quite powerful also contributed quite a lot to it.It was a time when there were now ten or so enemies left. Ray, who was stealing sweat from his chin, said in a tone filled with suspicion.\"Those guys...What's wrong with them all of a sudden?\"The slimes, who had been recklessly rushing until a while ago, whether there was a difference in power, changed their stance.They quivered and crept back to the corner. As if they were opening the way for someone.And that means.\"Get back!\"It was the moment I shouted at everyone.Thud thud...tututut...dududududu...!The walls cracked and fell down making way for a great abyss that appeared in the center of the cavity's ceiling, from which black and evil things stuck out their heads.Whoo! Whoo!Ten of thousands of ghosts let out terrifying screams. The existence that appeared in the ensemble of Hell's Funeral Song was...[<System> Dungeon's owner, 711th place in the Demon World, 'Obsculia, the Predatory Anglerfish', has appeared!]Oh, the Boss came out.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' is screaming no.]The ghosts that only had eyes and mouths wriggled like caterpillars. A cluster of ghosts in the form of a giant anglerfish. That was the boss of this place, Obsculia.<It's creepy.>Agreed.Ghouuuuuuuuu...!The ghostly anglerfish stretched its neck long and devoured the farmable slimes that were attached to the walls of the cave.The slimes eaten were stored in Obsculia's translucent black body.Like a boa constrictor snake, it ate everything at once to slowly digest it later. When I looked closely, I saw a person inside the Obsculia.\"Lumina! Gentis!\"Seeing Captain Anne shouting, those seemed to be fellow colleagues of the Pure Gold Apples.<They are still alive, but they won't last long.>Obsculia was not satisfied with gobbling up slimes.<Not enough...><I'm hungry...><Master...feed...><Please...>Then Obsculia saw us and its countless eyes flashed at once.<Food...!>The ghostly anglerfish rushed in like pouring rain.\"Hing!\"The boss used its overwhelming numbers to wrap around and surround us. Everyone was trapped in a black vortex.\"Protect the healers...!\"\"Argh!\"\"Priest Joachim!\"One of the ghosts that were spinning around us, bit Joachim and swallowed it in one gulp.I was next. A huge black mouth was rushing towards me.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thank you.\"\"No problem. It goes without saying that you are the top priority.\"Right after being protected like a healer. Ray intervened with a cold face.\"You were also an Aura user.\"\"Yes, brother.\" (Ash)\"What? Brother?\"\"It's not an important issue, so let's not argue about that.\"\"Right. The important thing is something else. Why don't you take out your main weapon to show your real strength now?\"\"Oh, did you know that far?\"As if waiting, Ash threw down his old long sword and pulled out the twin daggers that had been attached to his thighs.\"You and I should be the main force. I'll be on the front.\" (Ray)As expected, a very knightly decision. Ash and others agreed and said one word at a time.\"Yes, I'm not confident about the front.\"\"Please. Our Pure Gold Apple Team will follow up and attack.\"\"I'm a wizard, so I'm going to take on the rear support. First of all, I will start with mantras.\"While Seijin applied a buff, Ash asked me.\"Excuse me, sister, but what is your healing range?\"\"About 25 meters in radius.\"\"What? Not the diameter, but the radius?\"\"A-Are you serious, Miss Healer?\"Even though I kept it short, they seemed surprised. While I was silent, Ray refreshed the atmosphere.\"This is not the time to be surprised. I will count to three and open the way. Everyone get ready.\"\"Yes, cadet!\"Susususu...!I felt Ray pumping his aura up. It seemed he was about to set off an aura storm to drive away the ghosts.\"Then one, two...!\"Aura against ghosts was inefficient. I can't let the stamina of the main power in the party go to waste.I whispered in a quiet voice.\"Exorcism.\"[<System> Advanced skill 'Exorcism Lv.28 (+10)' activated.]\"Thr...! What?!\"Papa Papapapa!Kyieeeeee...!The ghosts were torn to shreds by an exorcism spell. While they were screaming in pain, the vortex that lost its power was destroyed at once.\"In-Incredible!\"\"As expected of a cadet who placed 2nd in his year!\"Ray flinched in embarrassment while the people admired him.You can't stand there like a fool.\"Cadet, let's go.\" (Eli)\"Ah!\" (Ray)It was only after I pushed his back that Rey came to his senses and kicked the ground. The Pure Gold Apple trio followed.\"Ahhhh!\"\"Hyaaa!\"It was a shout so they could overcome the fear of facing an S-class boss.\"...I have a question, but I will do it once I'm back, sister.\"Ash was the last to move. At a speed that the average human eye cannot detect.Ray, who was at the forefront, leaped to the wriggling Obsculia. The sword filled with aura was branded horizontally.Shh! Sizzling!In a stroke filled with aura, dozens of ghosts were slashed out at a time. Driven by momentum, Ray fired aura slashes one after another, and the Pure Gold Apple trio followed and shoved weapons into the far end of the Obsculia.\"A-Attack works!\"\"Great!\"Ash circled the edge of Obsculia and slaughtered to his heart's content.\"I need to hit the back of the head, but I don't know where the back is.\"Obsculia was weak for S-class due to its cluster nature. The steadily decreasing size of the boss boosted the morale of the allies. However.\"If we continue like this... W-wait! Look at that, Captain!\"\"Oh My God! What's wrong with that speed?\"Whoa...!Kuohhhhhh...!The abyss on the ceiling spit out black ghosts like a back-flowing sewer. With the replenishment of ghosts, Obsculia remained the same size as before.\"Damn it, there is no end!\"\"Where is the weakness?!\"As time passed, there were also minor injuries. Allies bitten by the ghosts bled from their limbs.\"....\"Watching the battle from behind, I healed their wounds without a word. Because right now, I'm a healer.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' is watching you.]Ash walked over to Ray.\"Brother, this is just a war of attrition.\"\"I know. But right now there is no other way.\"The only thing they can do is endure. Without a healer, they would have been completely wiped out by now.After a while, Obsculia, who had been only suffering until now, started to fight back.<It hurts...! It hurts...!><How dare you... hurt me...!><I can't forgive you...!>Pushshush!Suddenly, ghosts burst out of the abyss like a fountain gushing water. It was an astronomical number of ghosts that would remain even after restoring the Boss's body. They started taking over the walls and ceilings.\"Ugh!\"\"Wh-what!\"The nightlight stones were covered and the cavity quickly darkened. The ghosts seemed to keep pouring out. The walls and ceiling were not enough to accommodate them, and the ghosts were trampled under the allies' feet.\"Ah, it's dark...!\"\"Come this way! Take my hand!\"When the people withdraw from the swamp of ghosts to ascend to higher places.<You can't escape...!>Obsculia casts a curse.[<System> Warning. 'Stigma of Prey' is activated.]A black pattern appeared on the backs of everyone's hands, including me.<Food...food...><Be quietly eaten...!>The Ghostly Anglerfish covered the whole cavity and flashed its eyes at the same time. Hundreds of millions of ghosts hidden in darkness revealed their presence.\"Huk...\"It was an overwhelming number. It felt like peeking into the Halls of Hell.[<System> 'Stigma of Prey' activates 'Fear effect']Resistance to fear was difficult unless they reached a certain level. Even Ray and Ash hardened for an instant, not to mention the rest.\"Ah...I can't believe it...\"The psychological dam that had barely managed to hold back despair collapsed. A deep fear appeared on the face of the Pure Gold Apple trio, who had been struggling so far.\"The Num-numbers...\"\"It's hopeless...we will all be eaten...\"I could heal their wounds and buff their bodies, but it was impossible to raise the spirits of a terrified mind.<Ellet.>\"....\"['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' is restless and gives you a side glance.]Whooooooooo!The ghosts tried to attack the Pure Gold Apple trio, which was frozen on the spot, like a swarm of piranhas. In an instant, Ray hurriedly intervened and blocked the attack.\"Ugh.\"He was bitten in various parts of his body in the process, but he stood firm and persevered.While I quietly poured healing on him.Sususu...!Ray fixed his sword and strongly pumped up his aura. His sword was lowered vertically like a judge's mace.Kwagwagwagwang!The ghosts in the place where the aura flew away melted cleanly and disappeared. It was powerful, but it wasn't significant. The empty spaces of the exterminated ghosts were filled in an instant, and Ray gasped as if he had exhausted a considerable amount of power.The Golden Apples behind his back were not in fighting condition.Ray spoke solemnly to Ash, who came a beat late.\"You said your name was Ash, right? I will attract attention, so take everyone and run away.\"\"Are you serious?\"\"Yes. Take care of the rest.\"\"It is an impressive example of chivalry. But unfortunately, it seems to be too late for that.\"\"What?\"\"Brother, you are a bit slow on perceiving things. Look.\"Ash raised the back of his hand in front of Ray's eyes. The black pattern was on the backs of everyone's hands, not just Ash's.It was also the very same curse that the Little Duke of Wallenstein had for the rest of his life in the original.\"It's a brand that will make you prey of this Boss for the rest of your life.\"And as long as it is branded, Obsculia always appears in search of its prey.Seijin who approached them before they knew it, bitterly added to the facts.\"It might be better to just die here than to become a medium of a dungeon sink. It will get the people around you.\"Ray was gravely silent.Ash smiled with deep skepticism.\"Oh, I would have lived if I had bounced off alone as soon as the Boss came out.\"The Pure Gold Apples had already given up on everything.\"Ah, my God. How did this happen to us...\"\"Death, we will die. It was unreasonable from the beginning, an S-class...\"\"Haha...It's all over...\"An air of fear and despair hung around everyone.Oh, it's suffocating. I need to ventilate.'Architect.'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' flinches in surprise.]That was then.<Dinner...! Time...!>Swoosh!Countless ghosts attached to the ceiling stretched their bodies all at once. They intertwined and formed a different shape. It was a huge mask of black matter in the shape of a blazing sun.It looks as if the head of a masked monster was glued to the ceiling, and soon, the main body came out of it.<Hunt...! Begins...!>The black-sun-like maks came flooding in vertically with its mouth wide open.\"Oh my god!\"\"Ah, ah, ah......!\"The moment the giant mouth was about to swallow us all, I raised my right hand toward the sky and spread my palms out.Kwagwagwagwang!Along with the roar, a light vibration rose up the ankle and wrapped around the body. After it calmed down, a bewildered groan was heard.<What...what...!><Food... why...!><Not chewed...!>In the air, Obsculia's sun-like mask crackled its teeth, and sparks were splashed everywhere.\"Uh, what happened...?\"People slowly opened their eyes and raised their heads.A silver light reflected in their eyes and glistened around. There was something between the allies and the Boss, that reflected Obsculia's attack.Ash muttered with a blank expression on his face.\"Walls...?\"A silver citadel surrounded and protected everyone.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ray and Ash, who were suddenly feeling good, had confused eyes.\"It's such a divine power...?\"\"Sister, who are you...\"It's not possible to have a private chat with an S-class boss right in front of you. I was silent and just looked at the Obsculia beyond the barrier.<Keeyeeek...!>Obsculia's mask, which was pushed back in a face-off of sheer power, widened the distance.'Architect.'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' was nervously waiting for your words.]'I'm sorry, but you will have to write that apology letter after all.'['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' lets out a deep sigh.]['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' confesses that he knew it would be like this from the time when you didn't rip off rewards in return for doing him a favor.]As expected, you know me too well.In fact, it's true that I didn't even get a deposit for fear of such a thing.I was grateful for his reply.'Thank you for your understanding.'I took out my whip-sword, Serpens, from the satchel bag with ease.Sururururu!The finely divided joints cried out a beautiful sound. Following my stroking with the left hand, Serpens donned a white light.A light of surprise shone again in the eyes of the companions.\"Th-That's aura...\"\"How can Miss Healer...? Isn't Miss Healer a healer..\"I smiled softly and asked for their understanding.\"Stay here for a moment.\"I took a step outside the barrier. Outside the Silver Citadel was like hell.I stepped on the wriggling ghosts on the floor and walked out alone. As I stood in the center of the cavity, the mask of Obsculia looked down at me from the ceiling and shouted.<Food that cannot be chewed...!><Let's get rid of it...!>Ghosts from all over the place attacked with their mouths open as if they were competing to get the first bite. It was like a tidal wave from hell rising from all directions, it was a remarkable sight akin to Hell on Earth.Sususu!I put aura on my sword and slashed it. The raging tidal wave exploded like a soft bubble.The sea of \u200b\u200bghosts showed no sign of calming down. As expected, attacking this way turns the battle into a war of attrition with no chance of winning.'The speed of gathering is faster than the speed of cutting.'Right then.[<System> warning. 'The Predatory Legion' is coming.]\"...!\"I could see a huge wall rising like a mountain in front of me. It was the same when I looked back. A tidal wave of ghosts, completely different in size than before, was about to hit me from both sides.\"Miss Islet!\"\"M-Miss Healer...!\"Kwagwagwagwang!The legions engulfed me in a collision.The ghosts crushed me. The weight and suffocation of being crushed swept over my body.\"No!\"\"Sister!\"Ray and Ash's urgent cries came from afar. I chanted a sacred spell, feeling a little sorry for making them worry.\"Exorcism.\"Papapa! Pavat! Pavapat!<Kyehhh...!><Kyaaaah...!>The ghosts, piled up like a mountain on my body, exploded like a fireworks display. It took several seconds for them to become dust from the near front to the far end because it was so dense in quantity.The cavity was definitely cleaner. Seeing the state of Obsculia, which consumed half of its anglerfish-like body, I grinned.\"It's easier to throw away trash once everything is in one place.\"A sigh of relief could be heard from afar, while the expression on Obsculia's mask changed into an angry face.<Dare you...!>The ghosts attacked again.<I can't even chew...!><Mere food that doesn't look tasty...!>Are you calling that an insult?When I cut down the insignificant ghosts with my sword while thinking like that.<How dare it joke around with that mouth in battle. Do the same, Ellet.>\"Oh, yes.\"I replied while turning the ghosts, that rushed like moths, into dust.\"Shut up. Puny pet.\"In the original work, Obsculia was set as the devil's pet.Oh, but wait. I made the same mistake, didn't I?There was no provocation effect even if a pet is called a pet. I swung my sword and added.\"You are not even cute.\"<...!>\"To raise something like you, your owner's taste is very poor.\"The response I wished for came fast.<Ho-Ho-How dare you...!><Poor taste...that lowly mouth...! Insulting...!><I-I can't forgive you...! I will never forgive you...!>The ghosts connecting the mask and the ceiling increased. Obsculia, whose neck bizarrely stretched out, attacked me directly.<I thought you'd need to poke it more, but it's already coming down. The qualities of a tank are overflowing in you.>\"Of course. Whose student am I?\"Kwannng!As soon as I answered back, the mask and my sword collided. Obsculia has been attacking me with her mouth, which has changed to look like a shark's teeth, with the might to bite a piece of me.Chaeng! Klang! Chaeeeng! Kaklang!Whenever Serpens and Obsculia's masks collided, a light that seemed to burn the retina popped out.Crack!The right cheek of the mask that my attack had rubbed against created a microscopic crack.However, some of the ghosts that descended from Obsculia's neck that was still attached to the ceiling were absorbed and it fully recovered.A body with both defense and regeneration was difficult to deal with.'Should I do something with the main body first?'It was time to frown slightly and receive Obsculia's attack with a sword.Kaaang!\"...!\"I opened my eyes wide, it was because Obsculia bit my sword with its sharp teeth.<Hehehe...!><Caught...!>Kugugugu! The teeth of the mask and the blade of the Serpens rubbed against each other, making a scratching sound.I tried to pull my arm to retrieve the sword, but it didn't budge.<Ellet.>At the same time Agnes warned me.<It's over, tasteless food...!>From behind the black sun mask, ghosts stretched out like tentacles and aimed at me. The sword was stuck and time was running out to chant holy spells.If you do not let go of the sword and leave the seat quickly, it's a dangerous situation.Of course, that's for if I were an ordinary knight.\"Serpens.\"The whip sword answered the call.Tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak, tak.The part of the sword that was not bitten by Obsculia was divided into joints and stretched out like a snake.Susasassa!With the wriggling of a nimble snake, all the tentacle-like ghosts were cut off at once.<How...!>You thought you had caught me\"The truth is I caught you.\"<Nonsense...!>I had no intention of stopping here.Chararara!The whip sword went behind the mask. The target was the ghosts who were moving the mask.It's hunting time.Swoosh! Swoosh!While I continued the confrontation with the mask in the front, the slicing started from the back.<Hi..Hiiiing...!>As time passed, the bundle of ghosts that made up Obsculia's neck slowly thinned out. The destruction rate of the whip sword was faster than the rate at which the ghost replenished the Boss's body.Obsculia's neck became noticeably thinner and the moment that last blow was to be done.<Keeeeeeeiek!>The boss screamed letting the sword out of its mouth and backing away.A mask that was precariously dangling from its neck, which had become as thin as a rope, tried to escape to the ceiling.In the meantime, I could see the neck being quickly restored in real-time.I must finish it before the Boss completely climbs into the ceiling and protects its neck with the body's defenses.\"Fuu.\"I pulled up the aura of my whole body, put it on the Serpens, and swung it like a whip towards my target.'Hit it!'Swoosh!Finally, the bunch of ghosts attached to the back of the mask were completely cut off.<Kyaaaaaaaaaaah...!>KWANG!The mask plummeted to the ground like a marionette that had fallen off its string. Obsculia's body was also thrown upside down on the floor.Whoooo...Kuohhhh...The ghosts crawling on the floor flocked in. Since they had no limbs, they struggled to straighten the mask with their own body.But as I approached, they trembled and hid behind it.\"Get lost.\"I burned away the ghosts around me with divine power.If these things connect the mask and the ceiling, or more precisely, the mask and the abyss, it starts all over again.Sururururgn!Serpens, who returned to a sword, was raised horizontally.The body of the boss, weakened by the loss of connection with the abyss, was cracked and shattered here and there.Obsculia's mask begged with a very pitiful expression on its face.<Sa, save me...><I...><I was just hungry...!>Whoosh!The blade pierced its forehead.Crack...crack crack!Cracks appeared on the mask starting from the forehead. Obsculia, who sensed that the end would come, exclaimed in an exasperated manner.<No...! I'm scared...!><Master...! Save me, my lord...!><Master Carpeus...!>Crackeng! Like pottery, the mask shattered to pieces.<Master...miss you...>Pssush...The pieces of the mask became black powder and were swept away by the wind.Kuohhhh...Whoooo...The remaining ghosts were sucked into the abyss.Tuck, duck! Dududuck!Earth and stones once again covered the abyss that was like the jaws of a monster. The hole that made the abyss was completely filled and disappeared.[<System> Congratulations!

But now, with a sword in hand, she was completely different.She looked straight at the enemy with terrifyingly serious eyes and no other expression on her face.Ray somehow felt a little suffocated just by watching from afar.Whoooo!Before he knew it, the battle was about to end. Ellet pointed her sword at the mask of Obsculia that had been stuck on the floor.At that moment he felt that the straight lines created by her long arms combined with the sword were elegant and beautiful.Pussack! Pssus....The pierced Obsculia shattered into black powder.\"She killed an S-class boss alone...\"At this point, I can't help but wonder.\"What the hell is the Rodellaine family's craft...?\"Frintz Rodellaine, a senior graduate of the 117th Military Academy, was also great, but his sister was in a league of her own.No, it was rude to make a comparison.In the face of overwhelming superiority, it was meaningless to have a sense of self-esteem.Raywin felt that this incident completely healed his pink-hair allergy. On the other hand, it seemed that he was not the only one in awe.\"Is she human?\"The owner of the voice was Ash. Who couldn't take his eyes off Ellet. It was a persistent gaze.He spoke in a trembling voice.\"I can't turn her into an enemy. I will never touch anyone related to her.\"It was a good resolution.\u2720The news also came from Sanarak, a land of the demon world in which strange rock cliffs rise above the desert where life has been wiped out.\"Did my cute pet die?\"Carpeus, the owner of this place and the second highest ranking demon king in the demon world, smoothed his chin in a thoughtful recollection.In front of the throne where he was sitting, a long and crude stone staircase meandered. It looks like a pilgrim's path leading to the holy land on the top of a mountain.It was a unique scene but commonplace in Sanarak.There, countless demon tribes, who were nothing short of a large army, bowed their heads and looked at the demon king.Carpeus added.\"Do humans express this as crossing a rainbow bridge?\"(Note: A euphemism for death. It's mostly used to refer to the death of a beloved pet. Created by an American poet.)It was a soft voice as if there was no emotion at all. Many of the powerless demons who were seated in front were relieved in their hearts.But some of the quick-witted ones fell flat on their stomachsThat was a wise choice.Pussack! Crash! Plush! Puck!As soon as Carpeus's red eyes flashed, the heads of the demons that were standing near disappeared.\"Hic!!\"The surviving demons desperately banged their heads on the stone floor.The virtues of demons were desire and obsession. In particular, Carpeus was famous for his obsession with his possessions.\"How dare a human...how can a lowly livestock harm my beloved pet?\"Now, it was a little annoying, so I put it somewhere else, but at one time it was a pet that he even loved. It was so cute seeing it wriggling like a bug and squealing, so he raised it by feeding it with soft slime baby food.\"I can't forgive you.\"He smiled as his teeth were revealed.\"Then the next item to discuss.\"Carpeus, who changed the topic, captured his ferocious energy and relieved the other demons who were holding their breaths for dear life.\"What is the Vanquisher of Evil whereabouts?\"\"I-I'm extremely sorry.\"\"You still can't find it from the time Rodrigo Orsche was killed? By the time that human life is over and reincarnated, it will be even more difficult to find.\"Just as the cruel demon king's eyes were about to flash red again, one demon rushed out.\"Oh, I found out what Count Orsche did just before his extinction!\"\"Sigh, tell me.\"\"It was the Marquis of Gibrilte who last spoke with him through the telecommunication mirror.\"\"What made him communicate with the owner of the dark auction house?\"\"He said he got his hands on a purple spider lily and inquired about the price.\"\"What? A purple spider lily?\"Carpeus' eyes flashed in a different sense.What was the purple spider lily? It was the national flower of the demon world, which is said to be the best collectible among high-ranking demons who came from great houses.If it doesn't exist, he could care less, but if it does exist, of course, it had to come into the hands of this Demon King, Carpeus, himself.Once he had it, he thought he would love it more than Obsculia.Of course, the land was barren, so he would have to grow it in a pot. Carpeus felt possessiveness simmering after a long time and drew up his gardening plan.The report continued.\"The Marquis of Gibrilte asked back many times while doubting if he really had obtained a purple spider lily, but it seemed to be true. So he told the Count to put it up at the auction house, but Count Orsche was debating whether to give it to the Demon King or not.\"\"Oh, really?\"Carpeus made a rare, contented face.\"It's both a commendable and reprehensible thing. He should have perished after giving it away.\"It was when he reevaluated that Rodrigo Orsche, who looked like a sassy bastard, was a loyalist quite contrary to his looks.The demon who was reporting read the mood of his lord.\"My lord, that's...\"\"What is it?\"\"When asked which demon king he was going to give it to, he said he was still thinking about it...\"\".....\"It was truly a life-threatening statement.Pshuck!\"Huk!\"The demons around turned white. This is because the existence of the demon who was posting the report had turned into a black bloodied cake.After the popping sound of flesh, only the grinding of molars could be heard.\"Rodrigo, that punk...\"Do you dare leave the great tree Demon Kings behind and take it as yours?Ferocious magical energy swirled around the Demon King. His red-tipped blonde hair flew like crazy in the explosive updraft.\"Huk, hic.\"\"M-My Lord, please, let go of your anger...\"If left alone, it was an atmosphere that seemed to tear all the demons on the stairs of the audience with anger. Other demons rushed to stop the explosion.\"W-We will try to find the whereabouts of the purple spider lily!\"\"I see.\"It was only then that Carpeus buried his body deep in the throne of naturally carved rock.\"I will give you guys one notification and end this meeting.\"Finally, we can get out of this scary place!The demons rejoiced but Carpeus's mood completely changed.\"It was revealed that 'He' was coming soon.\"\"......!\"A murmur full of surprises spread like dominoes down the stairs.\"Re-really?!\"\"Oh my gosh! He will return so sooner than expected!\"\"It is very unusual. Is there any reason?!\"\"Does it matter? This is nothing less than a happy occasion!\"\"Yes, it's a blessing for the demon world.\"Carpeus's face while replying so, had a completely different mood from the moment before.Until now, he had been showing off his wild dignity as a ruler, but now he had a humble look like a priest who declares an oracle.\"Ah, how long have I been waiting? it's coming soon. The end of the world of filthy cattle is soon to end.\"He looked up at the sky with a face full of ecstasy. His hands were raised reverently as if offering sacrifices on an altar.\"Come! Give your welcoming to the 'Newborn Chaos and Evil'.\"(Note: Look, there was no better naming here...\uac13 \ud0dc\uc5b4\ub09c is 'freshly born' and\ud63c\ub3c8\uc545 is Chaotic Evil, the one usually used in D&amp;D for Alignment System.

As for the items, a skill book for wizards and a passive skill book came out one after another.Although most of the skill books are sold in the Cash Shop, some skills can only be obtained by catching the dungeon boss.Apparently, the exclusive transmigrator cash shop mainly deals with versatile mainstream active skills used in various world settings, so it was not possible to cover all skills within a specific world.Unfortunately, the skill book for the wizard was an all-around skill sold at the Cash Shop.If Seijin wanted, I would sell it to him at a bargain price, but he declined saying that he was in a different line of magic.The magic book was only for Erebo-Mancer, dark magic that was treated as a niche field even in the Magic Tower.Who would use Erebo-Mancer skills in a world where a denomination forms a whole nation?It was perfect for being despised as a warlock or, at worst, being caught by a heretical judge and taken away for punitive labor.The spell book, which had no demand and was cumbersome to dispose of, was immediately thrown into the corner of the satchel bag. There was no promise as to when it would be brought out again.Unlike the magic book, the passive skill book was not for sale in the cash shop and was very useful.[<Skill> 'Reversal of Predation (Passive)')Increases the chance of inflicting a fatal wound when fighting a human-eating enemy.]<Oh, isn't this pretty good?>Enemies with terrible eating habits were widespread. I learned it right away.The dungeon was not immediately closed and I decided to leave it alone for the time being.If the dungeon, which was responsible for the livelihood of adventurers as a glowing stone mining farm, suddenly closes, chaos will spread.Now it was time to part ways. I greeted people in front of the exit gate.\"Thank you. Thank you very much.\"\"I will never forget your grace for saving my life.\"A total of five members of the Pure Gold Apple Guild, including the two who were eaten by Obsculia, bowed their heads to me.\"Stop it, please. Anyone who sees it would think that Sister Ellet beat up the S-class boss by herself.\"Joachim, who had only woken up a while ago, made fun of his mouth again.The Pure Gold Apples made a face that said, \"How can such a stupid and ignorant bastard exist?\"\"If you don't know what to say it's better to stay silent! Healer Ellet here is...\"(Kana)\"Priest Joachim.\" (Ellet)I cut off Kana's words, a member of the Pure Gold Apples. Only sweet potatoes will kindly explain things to fools like Joachim.\"Yes, yes, sister! Speak!\"\"Assistant healer who still has not come to your senses, take care of yourself and return to the Vatican. I want you to directly report that what happened in the dungeon was an accident that was caused by your own negligence.\"\"Oh my, Sister. What do you mean by my fault? I think there's a misunderstanding. Actually, the evidence that I did it.......\"\"Lastly, pay attention to your usual behavior before you get stabbed in the back.\"\"...\"I cut off Joachim, who was lying all the way to the end, said only what I wanted to say, and turned around.\"Then goodbye everyone. After I see you all off, I will go too.\"\"Yes! Farewell!\"\"Be healthy, Healer!\"\"May the path of Miss Ellet be filled with only blessings of 'Strict order and Goodwill!\"\"Cool sister! Bye!\"I especially waved my hands for Frese and soon the figures of the people disappeared into the gate.However, there were two people who did not go.Cadet Ray and the first-class assassin Ash.\"Ash stay here because I want to talk with you later.\"\"All right, sister.\"Ash made a proud face.\"Cadet Ray, do you have anything to say?\"\"I have something that I want to talk about just the two of us for a while.\"I asked Ash to step aside. Standing with my arms crossed, I spit out words pretending to be grumpy.\"You said you were allergic.\"\"Cof, cof, hum.\"You should feel shame about what's embarrassing.Ray, now wanting to renew his image, took a moderately alert posture and put on a solemn expression on his face.\"Ellet.\"\"Yes, Cadet.\"\"You are my lifesaver. If you ever come to the Wallenstein estate in the future, please stop by.\"\"The Wallenstein estate?\"Wallenstein Estate. Where have I heard that name before?I remembered the tag I had put on my bookmarks.[Bookmark 291 - The Story of Potatoes #Slime Farming Cave #Sweet Potato Friends Potatoes #Duke Wallenstein #Stigma Curse]I'm sure it's about the little Duke, who had no choice but to turn into a hostile relationship with the main character, no way...I asked in dismay.\"Don't tell me, Duke Raywin Wallenstein...?\"\"Yes.\"Rey, no, Raywin nodded his head with a shy and proud face while a message just arrived confirming his identity.['The Spoiler Inspector' sarcastically says that you greatly contributed, once again, to twisting the flow of the original.]No, wait.I was greatly perplexed. This is because Raywin in front of me had crucial personal information different from the original Raywin. Right now he...\"But you are in the second place...?\"In the original story, Raywin won first place while attending school, graduated at the top place, and was scouted by the Royal Knights. Because of that, a confrontation with the Sweet Potato was established.Raywin was a little choked up.\"Do you also think that it's pathetic that the Little Duke of Wallenstein didn't make it to the top?\"\"I didn't mean it that way. I made a mistake. I'm sorry.\"When I came to my senses and apologized politely, Raywin nodded his head without any further misunderstanding or interrogation.However, sadness seems to have remained.\"What do you think it's the reason I graduated in second place instead of top place? It's all because of your brother.\"Do you think it's my brother's fault?['The Spoiler Inspector' holds his forehead, saying that you used not only yourself but also your brother to warp the original by remote control.]It was Agnes who gave an easy-to-understand explanation.<Frintz is weaker than you are, so it's hard to realize, but he deserves to be a top graduate of the military academy. By the way, he also gave a speech on behalf of the graduates.>I turned my head to the side and whispered, covering my mouth with my hand.\"Frintz said his classmate had refused to be the representative so it fell on his lap?\"<Even inside the military academy people can't help but accommodate power. They must have been trying to give priority to Prince Wallenstein over a commoner.>\"But Raywin refused it?\"<Yes. At first glance, he seems just as straightforward as your big brother, the position of representative obtained using the hands of the family would not be honorable.>\"Ahh.\"<He has a wonderful personality that can be called a model for a knight. Ellet, you must meet a man like that when you grow up...>After hearing the back story, I looked at Raywin again.\"Are you finished talking to yourself?\"\"Yes. Uh, well, I didn't know brother was the top graduate at the military academy. He got a scholarship because he studied well, so I thought that was why he made the speech. He doesn't really brag about himself.\"\"...Well, seeing as how strong you are, I guess he could think like that.\"Raywin said in a tone of understanding. Thanks to this, the guilt of being indifferent to my brother was relieved a little.So what does he wants to say?As soon as I got curious about the main point, he began to talk.\"Ellet, your skills seem to be more than enough to become a knight. Do you have any titles?\"\"No, I don't.\"\"It thought so. That's why...I want to help.\"\"Oh, that means...\"Although the military academy functions as an institution that certifies knights' qualifications, there are other ways to become a knight.Taking the Vinchester Kingdom as an example, royalty and nobility above the marquis have the power to appoint knights. In fact, if the only purpose was to become a knight, Raywin did not need to go to the military academy.What Raywin wanted to suggest to me now was clear.\"I will speak to my mother, the Duchess of Wallenstein, and ask you to be knighted.\"Figures!I clapped my hands.\"Wow, little duke! Thank you so much!\"\"Hm-hm, why are you reacting like that? So when do you plan to come to the estate? My training trip will be over in a month, so going with me...\"\"Oh, but it's okay. I have a Duke I know. I'll just accept your heart with gratitude.\"Raywin looked perplexed.\"Oh, you know of a Duke?\"\"yes.\"\"Who is that?\"Who do you think? Of course, my grandfather, the first sword of the Serentra Continent and the Prince of Hispenril Principality.\"It's a secret.\"\"Ah, yes.\"I waved my hand because it seemed like this was the end of the business.\"It was nice to meet you. Have a nice trip back.\"\"Well, Ellet.\"\"Yes?\"\"My proposal is still valid, so let me know if you change your mind. And even if it's not for the title...I would like it if you visit Wallenstein at least once. Because I want to repay my benefactor.\"\"Yes. I'll definitely do it when I get the chance, Little Duke.\"\"Thank you. I'll be on my way, stay healthy.\"I saw him pass through the gate with a face full of regret.Now there is only one person left.Inside the silent dungeon, I took a deep breath, exhaled, and called him.\"Ash.\"\"Yes, Sister.\"Ash, who made his entrance like an assassin, appeared ruthlessly and answered.\"I'm the last one. I'm nervous because I feel like I'm being treated like a special person. So what do you want to ask?\"\"Oh, it's nothing.\"I approached him and warned.\"Don't touch the child.\"\"...What are you talking about?\"He made an excuse, but I didn't miss the moment when his expression hardened.\"You don't have to hide it, I know you're an assassin.\"\"....\"\"Did you say that the subjugation unit you belonged to was annihilated before you joined the Pure Gold Apple team? It was probably your job.\"\"Well.\"He grinned as he stroked his smooth chin.\"Did I get caught? So, is that all you have to say?\"\"No, it's just the beginning.\"I smiled face to face.\"When the mission is over you guys usually go home. So why would the assassin have to step into a party weaker than him? Come to think of it, there is only one answer.\"\"......\"\"You are still on duty.\"It is clear that his second assassination target was in the party he had been with so far. The expression on Ash's face was discolored, but above all, it was an honest answer.\"I hope the target isn't Freje.\"\"What if I say it's that little child?\"\"You can't get out of here alive.\"\"Scary. But sister, if you're going to threaten me like that....\"Shh!A dagger quickly rushed in and I tilted my head to avoid it.Puk.The dagger was deeply embedded in the rock wall behind me, on the left side of my face.<How dare you? Ellet, smash him to the ground!>['The Spoiler Inspector' shouts for you to pierce his head immediately.]Agnes was expected, but the Inspector? He must have forgotten that Ash is an important character in the original story.Ash leaned his face against me without pulling out the dagger stuck in the wall.\"...You should at least have a weapon with you. Don't you think so?\"The smiling face crooked in pride. I must have looked funny because I had my sword in my inventory...I laughed with my nose.\"No weapon?\"\"What?\"\"Look around.\"\"......!\"\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Cough!\"Ash, whose throat was pressed down, coughed.If I put my mind to it, I can cut his carotid artery as well as the bone.Looking at Ash's trembling eyes, he seemed to know everything, so it took away the effort of explaining.Even though he was sweating in a cold sweat and his vocal cords pressed down, he spoke steadfastly.\"Sc-scary...You're carrying a weapon. You can...even work as an assassin.\"\"Would you mind not swearing in front of me?\"\"You're too harsh. There should be...no discrimination in jobs.\"As soon as he finished the joke, his expression changed completely.\"Stop it. I know you've never killed anyone. A killer's eyes are different.\"\"Everyone has a first. I think that's going to be you now.\"\"Murder is never easy. I am speaking from experience, so please listen.\"\"Can I live in such a tough world without such determination?\"This was sincere.I poured aura into the spirit king's harp string. The wire pierced the flesh a little, and Ash's neck was covered in blood.\"...If I die, I will haunt Sister's dream every day.\"\"Didn't you see me clearing out ghosts earlier? I'll make sure your soul is not annihilated in the exorcism. If you are reincarnated, live as a good little bug.\"!\"......\"At last, it looked like the battle was over. After a moment's silence, Ash changed his strategy.Changgang.A dagger fell from his hand. It was a sign of surrender.\"Sister......I swear to God it's definitely not Freje. In the first place, I tend to pick up quests where I don't have to touch children. Can you please spare me? Please?\"I almost laughed at his very pitiful expression and earnest tone of voice.\"I'm afraid I'm quite offended that you swung a knife at me earlier.\"\"You know it too, right? I attacked knowing you would avoid it.\"\"So what if I know? The attack itself was the problem.\"\"Ah, Sister, please. I was just pretending, there was no killing intent. I have not given up on my life enough to seriously attack my lifesaver, right?\"\"Now you're pretending to know grace after doing everything you wanted, it's quite pathetic to look at.\"\"Trust me just once. I'll show you what a grateful assassin I'm. I'll never touch the people around you. Please. I want to live, sister.\"\"Hmm.\"After making Ash's heart pound for a while, I said.\"All right, I'll let you go this time.\"I retrieved the wire that was wrapped around Ash's neck.Killing Ash here might turn the entire Night Eagle, the strongest assassination guild, into an enemy, and increasing the difficulty in my survival was not welcomed.In the first place, I didn't have the sweet potato obsession to save everyone. How could I take care of everyone in this terrifying world?This was just a puny baseline I could set to make sure any little kids that I knew didn't get hurt. It didn't matter if it was small.Then Ash asked.\"Aren't you curious as to who my target is?\"\"Not at all.\"I refused, but he let me know anyway.\"There was one person who had a lot of resentment around him because of his usual behavior.\"It's Joachim.\"Anyway, thank you for turning a blind eye. I wondered what would happen if Sister was a tight-knit person like Ray, but I'm glad.\"It was a bit bizarre to see him grinning broadly, with blood dripping from his neck.\"Okay. Go before I change my mind.\"\"Yes, I will. The longer I delay, the harder it is to follow the target.\"He waved his hand as he pushed his body halfway into the gate.\"See you again, Sister!\"Ash left without waiting for my reply.No one wants to be associated with an assassin, because everyone knew there was nothing good to reap from it.I also stepped into the gate. I had a different destination from the other people because of the restrictions on my range of action.Whoosh.As I passed the gate, an old-fashioned hall greeted me and as soon as I returned to the tower, a message popped up.[<System> Congratulations! Defeated the 299th floor boss of the Tower of Trials, the 'Random S-class boss'.]<You worked hard, Ellet. Let's go.>\"Yes, Agnes!\"I gave a vigorous answer and I fixed my satchel bag. As we crossed the hall, messages from the Inspector popped up one after another.['The Spoiler Inspector' lets out a deep sigh and says that there are less than a few months left until the tutorial is over but another accident just burst from nowhere.]['The Spoiler Inspector' says that this incident was a force majeure, so he will take it into consideration.]['The Spoiler Inspector' says you did a good job anyway, and now asks you to go out of the tower and quietly focus on your training...]At some point, while the nagging continued.['The Spoiler Inspector' jumps from his seat in confusion as to why you are going upstairs.]['The Spoiler Inspector' shouts to stop immediately because it's the 300th floor!]'It's natural to go to the 300th floor.'I climbed the steps leading upstairs.There's only one floor left so I will get rid of it stat. There is not much time left in the tutorial to wait for another update and come to challenge it then.['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' stops writing the letter and looks back at you with empty eyes.]It has also been revealed that there are problems in the tower anyway.After going up the last steps of the tower and walking along the carpeted corridor, I reached the front of the arch-iron gate.The door on the 300th floor of the Tower of Trials was decorated with more splendor and grandeur than the doors I've seen before.I can't just open this one like this. I didn't know what kind of enemy would come, so I took out Serpens in advance and equipped it on my waist.['The Spoiler Inspector' grabs the back of his neck asking how much more you want to twist the original.]['The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials' is already writing his apology and mumbles to do whatever you want.]['The Spoiler Inspector' pounds his chest with acute pressure, asking if that's what an official God of the Transmigration Bureau should say.]The Inspector general tends to think only on the negative side.'Oh, please. Would there be another coincidence such as meeting important people one after another?'It doesn't matter whether I twist the original or not, I spoke easily and pushed the door.Squeeak.As the arched iron door split left and right, a feeling of floating enveloped me.After a while, I opened my eyes to a new place, and what unfolded in my sight...'Ugh.'It was the boundary between deep blue and deep red.Under the deep blue sky, as if cobalt paint was thrown on the roof, bloodstained land spread out to the horizon.On a hill made of recently dead corpses, two beings were confronting each other since some time ago.One was a young black-haired young man with a black sword.He was wearing the uniform of a paladin, but instead of divine energy, demonic energy was emanating from his body.The culprit seemed to be the assimilated with a demonic sword that took root in his hand.And the other was also a young man in a paladin uniform.He looked tired as if he had been fighting a long battle with the person controlled by the demon sword.It was hard to control his body, so he was holding out with his sword embedded in the floor. However, the young man's appearance was somehow familiar. Especially his silver hair.\"Huh......\"The moment I raised my voice, he turned around.\"Thesilid?\"\"E...... Ellet...?\"\"......\"\"......\"They finished checking each other's identities in silence.A system message appeared at the same time as the wind mixed with blood blew.[<System> You have entered the S-level dungeon 'The Hill where the Sword of the Celestial Demon is Sealed']And a message from a bitter and anguished God also came.['The Spoiler Inspector' said he knew it was going to be like this and hit the ground while lamenting.]It was indeed an amazing coincidence.I reunited with Thesilid Argent after 10 years.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u27209 hours ago, Vatican.The Cardinal Council decided to urgently organize a subjugation squad. The reason was the dungeon sink that occurred in the northern part of Elpenheim.The name of the dungeon was 'The Hill where the Sword of the Celestial Demon is Sealed', and it had two very unique features.The first characteristic was that the dungeon is periodically generated within the territory of the Holy kingdom.A splendid dungeon that opens with a large-scale sync every 60 years.It was already the 5th cycle, so it was a fortunate era where they had ways and methods to attack the dungeon!The second characteristic was that the level of difficulty varies from one extreme to another depending on the initial response.If done well, it could be closed more peacefully than the already subjugated D-class dungeons. However, if you do it wrong, you could face a tragedy of S-class or higher calamity.In fact, the subjugation records of the last 3rd and 4th cycles were markedly different.Thousands of lives were lost in Cycle 3, while Cycle 4 ended with no casualties.The Vatican assumed that the difficulty of the dungeon was a standard S-class and prepared as such. Thus, at present, a considerable number of people were urgently summoned to the conference hall.They were the cardinals, the core of command of the Vatican, and the commanding ranks of the three knight orders who were in charge of this subjugation.The meeting had yet to start. In a place like an amphitheater, murmurs that went here and there did not stop.\"Is it true that the orders participating in this war are the Mandate of Heaven, Holy Spirit, and The Blessing? They are the orders who boast the most power in the denomination.\"\"Will Sir Maximus, the Knight Commander of the Order of the Blessings, take command? He's a great man with old hands in the field, so he's reliable.\"(Note: Old hands in a field = lot's of experience)\"Besides, if the Mandate of Heaven is also deployed, wouldn't that be Sir Eleon's knights? It will be possible to finish in this cycle as a D-grade dungeon as well. Ha, ha.\"\"Yes! If it's the Knight of the Blue Fame we can trust it!\"Perhaps thanks to the success of the fourth cycle, everyone was optimistic about the results. Around the time when the aspect of the conversation flowed into small talk that praised a particular person.\"I heard that the Heretic Judgment Bureau will send personnel too.\"\"Hahaha, there would be no battle it's basically a waste of manpower. Who is joining?\"\"Only one person has been confirmed. You know, that paladin who killed the heretics to stop the ritual to summon the demon?\"\"Ah, you're talking about Thesilid Argent!\"\"Talking about it.\"As if waiting for the talk to get to the topic, the main character of the gossip appeared in the conference hall.For a moment, people who saw him for the first time in a long time couldn't take their eyes off him in surprise.His beauty, which had been regarded as a living divine work of art since his childhood, had been wonderfully transformed under the blessings of God.Thesilid Argent, who has just turned twenty, has grown into an unrivaled young man.Pure silver hair that was not mixed with other colors, a white face like plaster, and a white paladin uniform created a holy atmosphere.It was not simply good-looking, but God-given good-looking. Indeed, he was the favored child of god who received the privilege of 'Strict order and Goodwill.Thesilid stretched out his tall legs and sat down with a graceful and modest movement. Even though he had done nothing to stand out, the gaze that stuck to him continued.Awe, envy, a little jealousy.Thesilid Argent was a special existence by all accounts.Silver hair that symbolizes God's blessing, the overwhelming divine power awakened by stigma engraving, and the inherent talent of Aura.He was an overwhelmingly strong figure among the stigmata, called the final weapon of the Vatican.At this rate, it was self-evident that within a few years he would become the most powerful paladin in the Holy Kingdom.Besides, what about external fame? Recently, he had been raising his stock price by a large margin.A few months ago, he alone accomplished the feat of preventing a catastrophe.There were heretics who were hiding in a dungeon and secretly performing special rituals. They struggled to complete the final ritual, even offering themselves as a sacrifice.It was a crisis in which the dungeon could be annexed to the territory of the Demon King Carpeus increasing his power. There, Thesilid showed determination.He stopped the summoning rituals by taking their lives before the heretics sacrificed themselves.Judgment of heretics while blocking the increase of power of the demon lord. The Vatican was very pleased with the achievement of killing two birds with one stone and praised Thesilid for his contribution.Naturally, his fame spread throughout the kingdom of Elpenheim. However, he himself did not like to mention it.When the conference hall was quiet for a while due to Thesilid's presence, a cardinal in red vests came out and announced the start of the meeting. It was Cattleya Gillette, who was selected as the head of the State Council this year.\"I understand you have received all the information. But it's important, so I'll tell you again.\"Key explanations followed. It was an official event and her words were formal.\"The boss of the dungeon is the 'Sword of the Celestial Demon'. If the right person to be the owner wields it, it functions as a holy sword. The hero, Lord Valkus O'Drek, was able to do so.\"In other words, he's a person who is clearly qualified, but unfortunately, he passed away 15 years ago.\"The problem is when an unqualified person touches the sword of the Celestial Demon. If that happens, the sword uses him as a host to slaughter. It becomes a demon sword. The more blood it drinks the stronger it gets and the longer it takes to subdue it, the more terrible it will be.\"If the explanation was clear to this point, the strategy of attack was already decided.Only one person needs to be selected properly. The first person to touch the Celestial Demon's sword.Cattleya opened her mouth more sternly than ever.\"A person with qualifications and conviction must draw the sword. The person who will take on such a role.......\"\"I'll take it.\"A determined voice resounded through the hall.The person who cut Cardinal Cattleya's words and stood up was a fine young man in his late twenties.A roar spread throughout the conference hall.\"Oh, Sir Eleon O'Drek!\"\"As expected, he came forward. I believed he would!\"\"If it's the Knight of the Blue Flame, it's a qualified man.\"\"By the way, isn't Sir Eleon a descendant of Sir Valkus?\"Everyone seemed to agree with him holding the sword of the Celestial Demon.What made it understandable was that Eleon O'Drek was a well-known paladin of the Vatican.There were many words of praise for him.The first sword of the Vatican, the agent of God, the incarnation of chivalry, the perfect paladin, the prince of the church, etc.His swordsmanship skills were outstanding, and he rose to the rank of knight commander at a young age, and as he always treated women with manners, his followers overflowed.He even has a fairy-tale-like appearance of blonde hair and blue eyes!Eleon has long been known as the best groom among the women of the church. He himself was well aware of his status. Therefore...\"The next master of the Holy Sword will be Sir Valkus's sucessor.\"\"He will soon be called the Knight of the Holy Sword, not the Knight of the Blue Flame.\"He was very satisfied with the atmosphere of this kind of praise.'Master of the Holy Sword.'A modifier that will further solidify his reputation. What a reverberating echo it had.The corner of his handsome lips swung up.Cardinal Cattleya looked at Eleon with profound eyes for a long time before opening her mouth.\"Sir Eleon. The splendor of the Lord is recognized by everyone, including myself. Outstanding swordsmanship skills, noble character, and righteous beliefs. You are being evaluated as having everything.\"\"I'm flattered. I will make sure that this mission doesn't fall short of expectations.\"But Cattleya's words were not over.\"However, since the lives of many people are at stake, the denomination wants to make a safer choice.\"\"What?\"\"Sir Eleon, you can sit down.\"\"......\"Eleon stood in place with a face that just didn't understand what he was hearing. Meanwhile, Cardinal Cattleya's gaze shifted to someone else.\"Sir Thesilid Argent.\"\"......\"At this point, the called name had no choice but to cause a great repercussion.Because he was chosen over The Knight of the Blue Flame.In the midst of the murmur, Thesilid himself widened his eyes as if a little embarrassed. Then he slowly got up and bowed in manners.\"Yes, your Grace the Cardinal.\"\"You shall draw the sword of the Celestial Demon.\"\"I will obey the orders of the denomination.\"Obedience is the virtue of a paladin. Thesilid accepted it plainly without saying a word.Meanwhile, Eleon had forgotten to sit down.'I was deprived of my role.'As they stood side by side at both ends of the conference room like a comparative mirror, a deeper sense of resentment and defeat overtook his whole body.However, there were many eyes to see, so he didn't do anything outwardly stupid.He just stared as if he was going to pierce Thesilid. The inside of his eyes, the source of the nickname Blue Flame, seemed to be on fire.Thesilid rolled his eyes and looked at Eleon.'Hostility......'Even if others didn't know, Thesilid, the target of the attention, could clearly feel it.'The Knight of Blue Flame' may be a character with a very different nature from the public opinion, he thought.\"We ask Sir Maximus, the commander of the Order of The Blessings will be in charge. Departure will be in an hour later. Get ready, complete your mission, and come back safely.\"Cattleya's hand drew the sign.\"May the protection of 'Strict order and Goodwill' be with you.\"When the meeting broke down, people flocked to Eleon as if waiting.No matter what anyone says, he was the most promising young man in the current denomination. There was nothing bad about scoring points for consoling him on a day like today when he was likely to be depressed.\"Sir Eleon, don't take it too seriously.\"\"Everyone knows that you are qualified. But Lord Thesilid is such a sure and safe choice.\"\"Yes. Because silver hair symbolizes God's blessing, so...\"These words were meant to comfort him, but to Eleon, they had the opposite effect. His stomach twisted.However, he could not lose the external image he had built up so far. At times like this, Eleon wore a courteous smile on his lips.\"Isn't it an old myth that silver hair proves divine blessings? It is a little difficult to accept that the standard for judging a person is the color of their hair. When I look at people, I tend to look into their eyes.\"\"Cof, hm.\"There was nothing more that embarrasses people than refuting an old-fashioned theory.\"Of course, this does not deny that Sir Thesilid is a great paladin. Sir Thesilid is a paladin with eyes that reflect green nature and a kindred heart.\"It was a good evaluation, but it included a subtle blow that only Eleon knew.'His eyes are nothing but green compared to mine.'He took great pride in his looks. Blonde hair, and blue eyes.That was then.\"Sir Eleon.\"A voice with a deep resonance that was hard to forget once you hear it rang.People's attention shifted at once from Eleon to the master of the voice.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I'm Thesilid Argent, a paladin from the Inquisition Office, Heretic Judgment Bureau. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\"\"...I'm Eleon O'Drek. I look forward to your kind cooperation.\"Looking at the hand asking for a handshake, Eleon had to pay all his attention to managing his facial expression.He was uncomfortable with Thesilid.He wields the sword with as much skill as himself and is a young man as handsome as himself. The only thing he lacks is that he was a kid younger than him.Eleon felt an instinctive fear that he might lose his place.Meanwhile, Thesilid's eyes dimmed as the handshake took longer than necessary.\"......\"Eleon was concentrating on his expression, so he didn't seem to know that he was putting strength in his hand.\"Then, I'll see you later.\"\"Yes.\"The dreary face-to-face was over. The two immediately turned their backs and left the conference hall.Thesilid walked alone down the corridor and looked down at the hand that he held out for the handshake.'This mission......'He didn't have a good feeling. Thinking about it, he soon laughed at himself.In the first place, has he ever felt good, had good results, or felt welcomed?It would be just a chronic ominous feeling that doesn't mean anything. Thesilid decided to believe so.\u2720As expected, the ominous foreboding was of no use to anything.If he wanted to get a hint at any meaningful information for the future, he should have felt a disaster rather than an ominous hunch.Everything was definitely going smoothly up to some point.There was no problem in wiping out the army of Spirit Knights protecting the sword of the Celestial Demon and guiding the victims caught in the dungeon sink to the gate to escape.However, when there was no one on the hill of the Holy Sword as the rescue operation was in full swing, Eleon, enthralled by greed, climbed the hill as if possessed. The moment he grabbed the handle of the sword, the catastrophe began.\"This...It's my sword!\"The clear blue jewel embedded in the hilt flashed light and was transformed into a blood marble.The sword, having found a host full of evil, took root in Eleon's right arm, blackening the flesh.\"I...!\"His proud blonde turned black and the inside of his eyes was stained red.<I am the hero!>A voice that was no longer human shook the hill.Eleon, who became the host of the Demon Sword, scattered demonic energy and cut people down indiscriminately.There was no way to prevent a sudden tragedy.The civilians who could not escape, the three orders of knights who boasted the highest power in the denomination, and the precious healers were wiped out in an instant.This was because the man, whose nickname was the First Sword of the Kingdom of God got a demonic sword, and there was no tanker who could withstand him properly.Eleon, who even the whites of his eyes ripped open, ran towards the last remaining prey.Unlike the bugs that have helplessly died so far, he didn't like how this one resisted his attacks.Eleon willingly sacrificed his life to the Demon Sword, amplifying his body's abilities, Aura, and his demonic energy.\"Kuh! Sir Eleon!\"Eleon, who succeeded in pushing his opponent, laughed madly with flashing blood-red eyes.<Ha ha ha! Look! I'm much stronger than a green-eyed kid!>\"......!\"<I am the first sword of The Vatican, the master of the holy sword, and the hero of this era! Thesilid Argent! You can never take my place!>Eleon, who let out his ugly desires and insidious nature, pushed Thesilid back and forth as if playing with a toy.Thesilid clenched his teeth and struggled to survive each strike at a time.After six hours of a non-stop fierce and devastating battle. Thesilid's body was driven to the limit.His heart was pounding as if bursting from his ribs and the taste of blood-like iron rushed up his throat with a heavy breath. The muscles all over his body felt like they were about to burst, and his hand holding the sword trembled.His vision was also intermittently blurred and shaky, as if he had shed too much blood.Not only it was against a demonic sword, but he was also fighting a battle that ate up his vitality. He knew very well that in fact, it was no use holding on.News may have been heard outside, but reinforcements are not coming. No, they cannot come.It wasn't just because of the time it took to assemble a rescue army.When the boss battle starts, the gate closes. The 2nd subjugation squad can enter the dungeon only after the battle is over after Thesilid is dead.The moment the gate is closed, hope is also lost.Thesilid thought with his slightly dazed head.Would this be enough? He endured this far with a weary body full of wounds. Isn't this the right time to face a gruesome death and a peaceful rest?\"......\"He lifted his blurred eyes and looked straight ahead. Eleon, standing tall on the opposite hill, could be seen overlapping a black aura over the demonic sword.Yes, it seems to be an inevitable end now.He did not expect salvation or miracles. 'Strict order and Goodwill' was not a god who would give such things.At the moment he was about to close his eyes as he was kneeling with his sword plunged on the floor.\"Huh......\"The presence of a third party pierced his ear like a lightning bolt.'There are still survivors...?'His life was again shackled. What he saw when he turned his head with all his might.\"Thesilid?\"It was a pink-haired woman who knew his name. A name immediately came to mind.\"E...Ellet...?\"Silence replaced affirmation.His sea-blue eyes shook in confusion.'Why? No, how?'How can she be inside a dungeon where the gate is closed?No time was given to answer the question, as Eleon's eyes lit up when he saw Eyelet.<You just happened to show up at a great time, lady! Watch this duel and tell the world of Eleon O'Drek's achievements!>At the appearance of a woman, Eleon displayed a shallow degree of chivalry. And that's how bad it got for Thesilid.<Thesilid Argent! In front of this lady, I'll will end your unsightly being!>Kwagwang!The moment Eleon hit the ground, there was a roar.\"......!\"Explosive speed as fast as it sounds. Thesilid, who was soon to give up, had an intuition.'I can't avoid it.'At that moment.Kaaaang!The sound of metal clashing shook the air, and Thesilid's eyes widened to the limit.'......!'Before he knew it, long pink hair and a straight back occupied his view.<La-Lady?>The resonance of the swords stopped. A relaxed voice rang in the place where a long cry of steel had passed.\"What if you try to kill a kid who can't return yet?\"\"......\"What does this mean?Seeing that it was difficult to understand the meaning of such simple words, it seems that he was very tired and confused right now.Still, one thing was certain.A miracle happened.\u2720\"Hey! What if you try to kill a kid who can't return yet!\"I was so flustered that I shouted out loud.['The Spoiler Inspector' jumps up and down giving strong warnings.]Oh, sorry.I glanced at Thesilid while confronting the host of the sword.He had barely escaped collapsing while relying upon his sword. The whole body was in tatters and the injuries to the right arm and sides seemed particularly severe.The paladin uniform, which should be as white and clean as snow, was dyed red.It was a total wreck.\"Terry.\"I suppressed the desire to heal right away and focused on the enemy in front of me.Human swordsman-like bosses were more demanding than monster types. I had to deal with it with my full attention.I left only one word towards Thesilid behind my back.\"Take a break for a while.\"At the end of the request, I put strength in Serpens.Chae-Ae-Aehh!The moment when Serpence collided with the demon sword and rang out cries of bumping metal.[<System> The chance of inflicting a fatal wound on the enemy increases due to the passive skill 'Reversal of Predation'.]The system defined the demon sword, which lusts for human blood, as a terrible predator.Whoohs!I smashed the demonic sword with the greatest force I could put out. I kicked off the ground and caught up faster than the host could back off.And swung the sword again.<Kuh!>The host's body continued to be pushed back. I didn't stop and kept pushing with my strength, speed, and aura.I pushed him to the rear, back, and then a little further!<This is okay. This is far enough.> (Agnes)This succeeded in keeping the enemy away from the immobile Thesilid.The host was astonished.<You weren't a lady!>\"You are the lady here, jerk.\"I was taught to do the same to those who made fun of their mouths during the battle. I provoked him by exchanging sword strikes.\"Why do you have someone else's sword? That's Thesilid's.\"<What are you talking about! This is my sword! Look carefully! I became the master of the Holy Sword!>\"No, you are not the master of the holy sword.\"We distanced ourselves from each other for a while and prepared for the next charge of attacks.\"You are the host of the demon sword.\"\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The host rushed at me with an explosive speed.However.Kwagwag!<......!>The place where the demonic sword fell was an empty spot.Shh!I leaped into the air and caught the host from behind. At the same time as I turned half a lap back and took the steps, Serpens drew a wide arc.Push!Blood gushed out with an eerie feeling of flesh being cut.<Aaaaah!>The host groaned in pain. However, the red marble embedded in the hilt of the demon sword flashed and the wounds on his back were healed in an instant.<What, does the demonic sword also heal?>I recited the contents of the original to Agnes, who was surprised.\"It's about using the blood of murdered sacrifices to heal.\"Of course, that was an option exclusively for the Demon Sword. There's no such thing with the Holy Sword.Around that time, the host who had finished regenerating went mad and rushed at me.<You dare!>Chaeeng! Kagang! Kaaan!I focused and searched for gaps while averting or blocking the host's attacks.During the long neck-to-neck battle, the necklace rang.<There are hundreds of corpses in sight. If it's like this, there will be no end to healing right?>\"If it's a simple injury.\"<Then either blow the head or the right arm off, one of the two seems to put an end to this.>\"Let's try the right arm.\"It's not because I'm afraid of murder.<Yes, he's a slaughterer that caused people to die because of his excessive greed. We can't let him go comfortably.>\"Right. If we hand it over to the Inquisition office, they will show him hell.\"<But, Ellet.>Agnes's voice was further lowered.<It's strong. You can get hurt while trying to finish without killing.>\"Don't worry.\"As we were finishing the conversation.<What are you muttering to yourself!>Demonic energy exploded from the host.Blood vessels swelled from the eyelids around his red eyes, and twitched with the pressure. Black hair fluttered high and soared.White and black auras formed thickly on each other's swords. The host's sword cut vertically and my sword cut horizontally.The Aura's collidedKwagwagwagwang!I stepped out of the crater and dug head-on as if taking another leap. It was in the middle of the dust that had arisen in the aftermath of the explosion, but I did not hesitate.Pakijiji.The moment the swords touched again, the aura burned impurities in the air around them and cleanly opened the view.The host became even more powerful after exchanging his life a while ago.The speed was equal, but as he overtook me in strength and aura, the battlefield prevailed over him.<I'll end you!>The magic sword pierced, aiming at my heart at a terrifying speed.I opened my eyes and twisted to the right.It was by a narrow margin.Shush!'Ugh.'I felt pain in my left shoulder. It looked like a deep cut, but it was tolerable. More than that, it was a moment to focus on.I had reached a distance that can be said to be right in front of the host's nose. It was even immediately after an attack and his vital points were defenselessly open.I hit Serpens in a diagonal uppercut.<Hck!>A shuffling sound was heard.The host managed to get farther than Serpens' range. Immediately there was a roar of laughter.<Haha! Where the hell are you aiming your sword...!>But there's something he doesn't know.That my sword is a whip sword.Whiririk, shunk!<...That...what...ah...?>Pshuushot!A fountain of blood erupted from the host's shoulder.<K-Kuaghhhh!>Degururu.The right arm holding the demonic sword rolled far on the floor. The whip sword chased and shattered it to pieces like a predatory snake.That was then.The demonic sword soaked in blood and flesh moved spontaneously and flew to the host.Although the host clenched his teeth in pain, he held the magic sword with his remaining left hand.<Oh, we overlooked the characteristics of a Binding Sword. You have to cut off both arms.>\"I can do it from now on.\"But it wasn't as easy as it sounds.The blade of Serpens, which stretched out like a whip, aimed at the host's left shoulder, but the host struck it off with the demon sword, turned around, and ran away.<Eat this!>He didn't forget to bind my feet in a mean and effective way.The aura attack was not aimed at me, but at Thesilid.<Ellet!>\"Right.\"Quarreung!I intercepted it with my aura and a flash of light exploded in mid-air, offsetting each other. In the meantime, the host, who had fled, disappeared over the ridge of the hill.<Don't chase him.>\"I didn't mean to.\"Even if he runs, it's inside a closed dungeon anyway. Besides, it's impossible to completely regenerate his right arm unless he slaughters thousands of people. There were no more humans to be sacrificed to the demon sword here, so there was no need to rush.Instead, there was something urgent.I turned around in a hurry and ran to Thesilid.\"Terry!\"He was holding on without losing his mind. His weight was pressing down on the sword embedded in the ground, and that posture was barely supporting his upper body.Thesilid struggled to raise his head and look at me. His sea-blue eyes were out of focus.\"Ellet...\"\"Don't talk. Stay still.\"It seems that the only intact part was his head. As if baptizing, I placed my hands on his silver hair and cast healing.[<System> Passive skill 'Healing for the Beloved' increases the 'Healing' effect by 400%.]Come to think of it, there was this.A skill for a healer learned by smashing Rodrigo Orsche.It was a fraudulent passive in which the effect of healing skills increased five times only for Thesilid.Healing at level 67 was amplified. Thesilid's body healed in an instant after taking a healing shower.This put out the urgent fire, but he was still a patient.Excessive bleeding, exhaustion, and thirst were physiological problems.I took a potion bottle from the satchel bag and put it in Thesilid's mouth. I slowly looked around, waiting until he emptied the bottle.\"We need a place to lie down.\"The whole area was a mountain of corpses vibrating with the smell of blood.It would be better to move Thesilid somewhere else by supporting him, holding him up, or giving him a princess hug.But before that, there was something to be done.\"Wait a minute.\"I remember hurting my shoulder earlier. I can't get the wound to burst while applying strength, so I need treatment...\"Huh?\"There was no wound on my left shoulder.What?Was my wound healed while using the healing skill? I don't think that's the case?To enhance the effect, I even made contact and intensively poured it directly on Thesilid.Then I suddenly realized that even before I started using the healing skill, I didn't feel much pain compared to the injury I got.That means.\"Don't tell me...\"Thesilid's left shoulder soaked in blood caught my eye. Even though the uniform was not torn, it was as if a wound had spontaneously formed from within.It became clear.Rodrigo dropped two skill books. Another skill formed a set with the Healing of the Beloved.It was a skill for tanks that takes the wounds in the Healers instead, 'Guardian of the Beloved'.As if confirming the answer, Thesilid laughed weakly.\"All I can do is...it's this much...\"\"Oh, come on, you...\"This sweet potato!You were on the verge of dying from excessive bleeding and you do that?The moment I was about to challenge his sanity, Thesilid escaped the situation with a cheap shot.\"Terry...!\"His body leaned. As his tension relaxed, the balance of his body, which he had managed to maintain by relying on his sword, was broken.I quickly supported his torso as he fell. It was heavy because it was the body of a grown man big enough to cover me.\"I'm sorry... I'm so sleepy all of a sudden.....\"He closed his eyes with a tired but relaxed expression on his face. A defenseless state that comes from the conviction that he's safe.\"......\"With anger fading away like a lie, I leaned him on my shoulder.Right, is that really important?\"...Good job.\"It's good enough to have endured so far.So for now, I wanted to give a rest and comfort him thoroughly.\u2720It was impossible to rest in the middle of a field of corpses. I opened the map and searched for a suitable place nearby.Just over one hill, there was a group of trees along a stream. I moved Thesilid, who had lost his mind there, and laid him on a blanket.I sat next to him and poured potions into his mouth from time to time to help him recover his energy.Thesilid's body and mind, which had been abused to the limit, seemed to have been switched off, and he didn't even show any signs of waking up.The embodied Agnes looked down at Thesilid and clicked her tongue.<He managed to withstand an S-class boss.>\"It looks like he's been fighting for at least half a day.\"<If it wasn't for you, he would have died. He looks like an advanced Aura Expert, but at this level, an A-class boss is the limit to fighting alone without a healer.>As expected of The Vatican's 1st Hell Instructor. The evaluation was correct.In the first round of his life, Thesilid was weak as the protagonist of the slow-growing overpowered character setting. He was just at the right level that he could solo A-class dungeons.But without my intervention, Thesilid would somehow have survived.Now it's before starting the original. If the main character dies, the story does not proceed.At the same time, I remembered the setting of the original work.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In short...'Yes, he survived through sheer luck.'Even if all conditions were equally matched, it was impossible to guarantee that the same result would be obtained. It was nothing more than an unusable setting at this point.The Inspector also pointed that out and protested.['The Spoiler Inspector' says the original has been twisted by your intervention, so he asks you to take responsibility and keep the main character alive.]I thought so from the beginning.The Inspector made unnecessary threats because he thought I was not trustworthy.['The Spoiler Inspector' warns that if the main character dies here, something very terrifying will happen.]['The Spoiler Inspector' scares you that even if you have listened in one ear and thrown it out the other, nothing has happened to you until now, but this time it will be different.]['The Spoiler Inspector' threatens not to ignore the warning if you don't want to regret it.]Unlike usual, I earnestly listened to the Inspector's words without wasting time. Because the Inspector was giving a really sincere warning.This is a regression world. It is like a giant clock board that revolves around the main character that works as an axis.If the protagonist dies before he gains the ability to return, the origins of this world are shaken.A broken clock will creak and malfunction, which will cause an uproar in this regression world.Unexpected events can be nothing, or catastrophic, depending on the person. But in my case...Immediately after looking back at my memories for a moment, I shuddered.'No! I have to stop it no matter what!'In my case, it's a disaster!['The Spoiler Inspector' after seeing your reaction says that you seem to have read the original work diligently.]The Inspector was very satisfied and no more threatening nagging was heard.<Why? Are you not feeling well? Your face suddenly turned white.>\"No, Agnes. It's alright.\"<It's okay. You should rest too.>\"After I take care of Thesilid.\"I wiped the cold sweat from my forehead and looked back at Thesilid. I felt obligated to save him, so I carefully fed him the potion again.As I watched his handsome face gradually improve in color, I felt my startled heart calm down.'No, I don't think it's because of my mood.'It really seemed to have a calming effect. So I looked at Thesilid's sleeping face.I looked and stared again and again.I keep watching without taking my eyes off him.If it wasn't for Agnes who came into my sight, staring time would be much longer.<Hey, it's going to wear it out. Why are you staring at him like that?>\"...Isn't it amazing, Agnes?\"<What?>I pointed to Thesilid and admired seriously him.\"How can a person look like this? Isn't he too handsome to be real?\"<......>Undoubtedly believing she gave a silence of agreement, I looked at Thesilid's face again.His silver hair shone as if he had spun the white daytime moon with thread, and his features, including a sharp nose and deep eyes, were as delicate as a masterpiece of a craftsman.Red lips with beautiful curves might look decadent. Nevertheless, as if plaster was spread, his white face exudes holy energy, creating a strangely even more fatal atmosphere.Such a handsome face and such a handsome atmosphere were unique in this world.Thesilid Argent. The setting value of our push-over free pass is......'The most handsome man in the world!'That was the moment.['The Scales that Judges the Soul' comes running after receiving the keyword 'the most handsome man in the world'.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' asks where is the main character.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' finds the main character and is moved while covering her mouth because of his handsomeness.]I followed Sister Libra, no, Ma'am Libra, and naturally brought my hand to my mouth.\"Really handsome...\"<......Huh.>Whether Agnes made a ridiculous expression or not, I watched to my heart's content, wondering if I would ever be able to stare at his face if it wasn't this time.Are you really human? If you look at his shoulder blades, maybe we can see traces of wings being cut off. I'll try to see his back later...cof. I almost became a pervert.It was then that Agnes made a meaningful snort.<Oh, I remember. Is he him? The first love you were going to find as soon as you could leave the County.>\"No.\"I was genuinely pissed off.<No?>\"Yes.\"<Even if you are still staring at him like that?>\"He's handsome. It's instinctive to look for handsome men and beautiful women.\"<Huh, what if he asks you out?>It is a nasty prank peculiar to superiors who try to roughly weave people together. I laughed it off.\"It's an unnecessary assumption. He is a sweet potato to the bone, and he has a bad taste for being attracted to women who hit him in the back of the head.\"The original story, in which the woman who everyone thought was the heroine stabbed him in the back three times in a row, proves it.['The Spoiler Inspector' snorts, asking if you can guarantee that, being the original's destroyer yourself.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' scolds you for feeding sweet potatoes in this way as a Ropan transmigrator yourself.]['The Spoiler Inspector' comes to think of it and is restless about what to do if he falls in love with you, who saved him twice.]['The Scales that Judges the Soul' shouts to buy a genre change ticket right away!]Right.

I'm not doing it.'['The Scales that Judges the Soul' to give up love for money....]Oh, stop it.It felt more tiring than when I was fighting the host of the demon sword.<Oh, do you even know his taste in girls?>\"Agnes.\"<Okay. I won't make fun of you. I'm just curious.>\"What?\"Agnes' tone became serious.<Because it's not even your first love. Why do you need to be so concerned for him?>\"......\"<What is his identity?>The atmosphere was instantly evoked thanks to her poignant question.This would not be only because of the sincere nursing I gave him. I have publicly said that I will go to Thesilid first thing first when the system's prohibition is lifted.I did not hide that I was very conscious of the character Thesilid Argent.I contemplated for a moment, confirming that the Inspector didn't say anything.Unlike others, Agnes was relatively free from restrictions from the Inspector.While having no influence in the outside world as she was in the state of a soul, she was a being who shared all experiences with me.'For example, she entered with me inside the Tower of Trials.'It was safe to say that she's almost a set with me.Instead of glossing over, it was necessary to clearly tell the important truth.At least until the point of regression.But right now it's a bit uncomfortable. No matter how unconscious he was, Thesilid himself was right in front of us.\"I'll tell you later.\"<Are you sure?>\"Yes.\"At that point, the conversation ended.Occasionally, I moistened Thesilid's lips with a potion and took care of him in my own way. A few hours went by, but in reality, it was a long time after the sun had set.\"Oh.\"I fell asleep and was startled when my head dropped.<Ellet, you must be tired. You faced three S-class bosses today.>\"Yes. I worked so hard today.\"<Now you should close your eyes too.>\"That would be nice. After all, the host of the Demon Sword is also seriously injured and will not be able to move for a while.\"Yawning, I flipped through my satchel.I took out snacks and drinks and put them down by Thesilid's bedside in case he woke up while I was asleep.As soon as I took out my share of the blanket and curled up, I fell asleep.\u2720<Cadet Ellet! Wake up! It's a big deal! The paladin!>\"......!\"Hearing Agnes' urgent alarm, I jumped up.It's a big deal? Is it an attack?I grabbed my whip sword and looked around. However, no danger was detected.Instead, Thesilid was not seen. The blankets were neatly folded and the food was thoroughly cleaned up, but he suddenly disappeared.Agnes said embarrassedly.<Ugh, I thought he was going to take care of nature callings, but he hasn't come back for a while.>\"How much time has passed?\"<About 30 minutes?>\"......\"I was silent with my sword clenched.Let's think. What would he be doing with the habit of a Pushover free pass?<What if he went alone to deal with the host of the Demon Sword?>\"That's the most sweet potato-like development in the current situation, but I don't think so.\"Because Thesilid isn't the kind of guy who charges recklessly without any countermeasures.I sighed and packed my bags.\"Let's go.

The destination was the place where Thesilid fought the host of the demon sword.As I climbed the hill, I could see the scene of the tragedy at a glance. Hundreds of corpses lay on the ground that had turned red.As expected, Thesilid was in the middle of the hill of corpses.<Oh my God......>Agnes continued as if she had seen the ultimate weirdo she came across.<What kind of Saint is that guy? How can he still do that in this situation?>Thesilid lay the corpses upright and closed their eyes one by one.That's what he chooses to do as soon as he wakes up with a body that hasn't fully recovered yet. It was only natural for Agnes to become dumbfounded.<There might be something wrong with his personality. I think it would be better if he was to be hypocritical.>\"He's not that inhuman. He's doing that because he needs it.\"<Need?>What Thesilid is doing now corresponds to 'charity' among the Seven Holy Virtues. He was now farming divine power in his own way.I roughly summed it up.\"He has a buff that makes him stronger when he does good things.\"Without interrupting, I leaned against the tree on the hillside and waited for Thesilid. He came to me after he had offered his requiem prayer for the lost souls.\"Ellet.\"He continued with an apologetic face.\"I was going to go right back before you woke up, but you came looking for me first. Have you been looking for me for a long time?\"\"I found you at once.\"I glanced over the organized corpses, and then there was a look of perplexity on Thesilid's face.He was concerned about my reaction because he was aware that his behavior was not universally understood.\"This is...\"\"It's probably because of your duty. Good job. Drink this.\"\"......\"I offered a potion to quench his thirst and boost his energy. He accepted it in a daze and opened his mouth.\"Come to think of it, I'm late to say something.\"\"What?\"\"Thank you for saving me, Ellet. I survived thanks to you.\"\"It was nothing.\"\"I also enjoyed the Ciabatta Sandwich you left at my bedside. Your cooking skills went nowhere.\"\"Do you want more? I have a lot.\"While I was looking through my satchel bag, Thesilid smiled.\"You're still trying to constantly feed me something.\"I lightly cleared my throat.\"Did I?\"\"You did. Thanks for this potion too. I will gladly take it.\"Thesilid slightly shook the bottle and then swallowed the contents. I collected the empty bottles that he had finished.I think this was quite the natural atmosphere for a 10 years reunion. But I talked about it even though I knew it was strange to mention it.\"Long time no see, Terry.\"\"Yes, really. Long time no see, Ellet.\"As if a question had suddenly come to mind, Thesilid asked me.\"How did you get here?\"\"It's hard to explain, but I think you can classify it as a dungeon sink.\"\"Dungeon Sink? That's an amazing coincidence. If I had not been familiar with 'Strict order and Goodwill', I would have believed that a miracle had been granted.\"Agnes coughed awkwardly at his bone-filled words.<Well, our god is a little strict.>While suppressing the desire to encourage conversion to the World God denomination, Thesilid asked another question.\"Back there, how come you were using Aura? I thought that divine power was your main ability.\"\"Divine power is my main power. I kept thinking that divine power alone was not enough, so I decided to learn the sword.\"\"You have mastered the sword to this level...Did you become an Aura Expert?\"\"Yes. To be more exact it is the upper level of Aura Expert.\"At this point, Thesilid's eyes fluttered slightly.If divine power forcibly awakened by his stigmata is left out of the discussion, his main power is Aura. That's why he was able to become an Aura Expert.\"The little kid who had a hard time running away while playing tag in the toy mansion...how can you...\"\"Yes, I had a bad time then. Because of that, I was quite shocked and started training in swordsmanship.\"\"The swordsmanship was also unique. Isn't that Saint Agnes' whip sword swordsmanship?\"\"Oh, you got it right. My necklace is a relic of Agnes, isn't it? Agnes' soul was contained here, so I was able to learn swordsmanship. She's right next to me. She's waving at you.\"\"...Really?\"\"It really is. Are you doubting the words of your lifesaver now?\"\"No! That's not it.\"\"Right? Then say hello to Agnes.\"\"Well, I am honored to meet the hero of the continent. My name is Thesilid Argent, a paladin from the Inquisition Office: Heretic Judgment Bureau.\"<Nice to meet you, brother. But that's not the way. Look at the other side.>After Thesilid greeted her again, the conversation naturally led to Agnes.As I explained that the fame of The Vatican's 1st Instructor was not in vain, I also opened up about my training life.After listening to how I lived, Thesilid said with a smile.\"You seem to be doing well.\"\"Yes. I worked hard and had a good time.\"My story is over. Now it was his turn.\"I.\"\"......\"\"I've been well, too.\"That's a lie.I was someone who have read the original dozens of times, it was impossible to buy such a flat lie.Recently, he must have been through hell in a dungeon called the Valley of the Heretics.Even there, he must have wandered among the corpses alone while closing the eyes of those who died under his sword. Surely, that must have looked a little hypocritical.Those corpses belonged to those who Thesilid killed to prevent the Demon King's rituals. It was an occasion that won him great recognition in The Vatican and made his reputation as a famous paladin.Thesilid's activities spread to the kingdoms beyond the borders of the Holy Country.Anyone who doesn't know his real struggle would talk about it even in passing to pretend to be close, but.....\"Really? I'm glad you're doing well.\"I pretended to know nothing.Thinking that we had exchanged enough regards, I pulled my back from the wooden pole.\"Terry, how are you feeling?\"\"As you can see, everything is fine. Thanks to you.\"\"Good. Then let's go deal with the host of the demon sword. I want to finish it before the backup force arrives.\"The host will now be eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Salvation Army of The Vatican. Because he needs an offering to regenerate his right arm.Thesilid said with an apologetic look.\"You have no choice but to step out because The Salvation Army can be ambushed. Thank you for being willing to lend power to the denomination.\"\"I'm lending it to you, not the church.\"\"......\"\"Why are your eyes wide open? Don't worry, I won't ask you to repay the loan. Anyway, let's go find that sword.\"Having decided on our plan. Thesilid and I began to move over the hill where the demonic energy was spreading in abundance.\u2720<Kuh...uh...>To the far west of the dungeon 'The Hill where the Sword of the Celestial Demon is Sealed'. Eleon O'Drek was recovering in a swamp full of Spider Lillies.Eleon grabbed his throbbing right shoulder. The more he thought about it, the more his body trembled.<Dare you...how dare you cut my arm...! The arm of the master of the holy sword...!>His right arm showed no signs of regenerating. Hundreds of humans were killed while holding the demon sword, but the number of sacrifices was insufficient to regenerate a severed body part.He had to kill more, but now, in this dungeon, there were only Thesilid and the woman Both were not even nearly enough. Besides, Thesilid apart, he doesn't know about that woman...<Kuh....>Recalling the moment when Ellet cut off his arm, Eleon trembled in a different sense.He was scared.Is this how he's going to be subjugated?By the hands of that scary woman?Around the time when fear swept over Eleon's whole body.<Do you want power?><......!>He looked around in surprise. There were no signs of presence, instead, black energy like ashes was rising everywhere in his field of vision.Eleon suddenly looked down.From the bottom of the submerged wetland, a red summoning circle radiated a magical light.<I asked if you wanted power.><Who are you?>Piiing-.At the same time as the tinnitus rang in his head, an illusion entered his mind.In the pitch-black darkness, someone was sitting on a rocky throne with crossed arms.A young blonde-haired person that hard reddish hair towards the end of his locks. The moment their eyes met, blood-red eyes flashed.<I am the master of Sanarak, Carpeus. Lowly cattle, bow your head before this King.><Kuh?! Guabububu!>An irresistible force made Eleon fall face down and bow his head. He struggled as his face fell to the bottom of the water and he couldn't breathe.<I will ask you one last time, cattle.><Hubbub...cof...><Will you make a contract with me to attain the strength to go beyond your limits?><......!>Power beyond limits.He felt the brutal threat of drowning in knee-deep water, but the words were clearly pierced in his ears.He had nothing to ponder about. Eleon clenched his only remaining fist.<It's a smart decision for livestock.>A bloody smile crossed Carpeus's face.Black energy like ash that was scattered throughout the wetland was lifted and wind blew in the clear sky.It was a rough wind mixed with sand.\u2720Around the time when we crossed over the fifth hill, I and Thesilid felt the abnormality\"Huh? What kind of wind has that type of sand...?\"\"Ellet, over there.\"A strange phenomenon occurred in the direction of the sky Thesilid pointed to.The day quickly set and night came. It was because a red moon swallowed the sun and caused a solar eclipse.As if to prove that this was not in the human world, the moon dripped red blood. It was like a surrealist oil painting.Bloody red moon. There was a demon that it symbolized.\"Carpeus...\"The Demon King of the Abyss of Sand. Thesilid, who had his name in his mouth, bit his lips.Meanwhile, I couldn't help but be embarrassed when I saw the symbol of Carpeus.'I can't believe in this unexpected interference by the 2nd place in the Demon Rankings.'This was not in the original!['The Spoiler Inspector' says that this is all karma caused by your reckless intervention.]In the midst of this, the Inspector insisted on the theory of responsibility and again repeated that the weak protagonist had to be protected.<What? What's going on?>Agnes asked in dismay and just in time, Thesilid explained to me.\"The ritual of expanding the Demon Lord territory has begun. Someone has made a living sacrifice to the Demon King of Sanarak, but the only offerings here, except for you and I, is Sir Eleon. He gave himself up.\"\"Ha, seems like it's true that if you became the host of a demon sword, your intelligence would decrease.\"Perhaps he was blinded by power and made a foolish contract, no, at this point it was obvious.\"Ellet, if this goes on, this place will become a desert and become a part of Sanarak.\"\"I don't want to see Carpeus's face yet.\"\"......There is only one way. We must kill Sir Eleon before the ritual is complete.\"Thesilid's voice was filled with anguish.The information he is unraveling now was based on the hellish experience he had in the 'Valley of Heretics'.I put my hand on Thesilid's shoulder without saying a word.Agnes anxiously asked.<If he received the power of the Demon King, he must have gotten really strong. Ellet, can you handle this alone?>\"That......\"At that moment.Whhiizzss.A gust of wind blew. It was weak enough to be mistaken for a breeze.But when I saw a mixture of sharply formed blades, I shouted in haste.\"Mercury's Barrier!\"\\n\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a riot outside the barrier where an onslaught, of an aura at the same class as my divinity, was pouring in.As the two powers of 8th rank collided, the field of vision flickered loudly.Thesilid said in a voice of disbelief.\"Level 8 aura......don't tell me...\"Light that seemed to burn the retina and noise that seemed to tear the ears subsided. I withdrew my barrier. The surroundings revealed after the dust cloud lifted were horrendous.The hills of the meadow turned into a wasteland. All living things except me and Thesilid seemed to have been annihilated.No, there was one more being that breathed. The person responsible for the attack.A foreign voice rang out from a distance of ten or so steps.<I can't believe you stopped this.>The host of the demon sword had changed as if it had gotten stronger.Black hair curled like seaweed stems soared into the air and muscles and tendons wriggled on the naked upper body. The inherent power seemed to want to run out of his body. However, there was something else that caught the eye more than the transformation of his body.There were five swords behind the host. The presence of floating aura blades spread out like a fan surprised me.\"Wow...he became a Master?\"Until a while ago, he was barely floating above the line of the upper level of an Aura Expert. But, by leaping beyond the wall at once, he was using the Thousand Swords I dreamed of learning.\"It's worth a contract with the Demon King.\"<Cadet Ellet.>\"Ellet.\"I was half joking, but severe scolding returned from both sides.It wasn't just the two of them.['The World-building God' senses the signs of your corruption and runs to you.]['The World-building God' shouts that you must never go down the path of such a delinquent believer!]'Yep. sorry.

The host of the demon sword was troubled with an uncomfortable face.<What's going on? It's normal for people to fall like dust at the face of my aura.>There is a stark gap between Aura Expert and Aura Master. From his point of view, it wouldn't make sense that I and Thesilid were still alive.'If it wasn't for the ultimate barrier, we would have died.'However, with a brain entrusted to the demon sword, it seems complicated to come up with an answer.<Not aura, it seems like it was blocked by Divine power. If that's the case...>\"......\"<I think the green-eyed brat blocked it. Stigmata, you seem to have awakened divine powers by a ploy and can now use special skills.>(Note: for those who don't remember, Terry can't use most holy skills. But this guy is so dumbed down, he thinks it was Terry who cast the barrier. And Eleon likes to call Terry, Green-Eyed Kid even tho his eyes are a blue, because green can also mean, imperfect or half-baked.)Thesilid's trembling gaze reached me.\"There is a serious misunderstanding.\" (Terry)\"Let's leave it to another time.\"(Ellet)Surreung.I pulled out my whip sword, Serpens.\"Terry, step back.\"\"I'm more advanced than you. Will you be all right?\"\"I'll try it once.\"I stepped forward buffing myself with 'Holy Hymn', but the host tried to provoke Thesilid, not me.<Are you cowardly still hiding behind a woman?>\"Hiding behind a strong person is not cowardly. Don't waste my time barking. Just come at me so I can blow your left arm already.\"The host's face contorted. As if recalling the pain of having his right arm cut off. Unfortunately, my baseline suppression did not last long.<Strong? Can you still argue about strength in front of me?>\"......\"<This body has now reached the limit of human beings, the ultimate state.>Five aura blades soared high into the sky as if to show off.<Look, this is......>High in the sky, their sharp blades were pointed at me.<The power of Lord Eleon O'drek who was reborn as an Aura Master!>Shhhh!Aura blades came rushing in a spiral. I immediately kicked the ground and ran.Whooss! Thump! Phow!Explosive sounds came about with a beat of time of delay while huge craters formed wherever the swords missed the target.<You wriggle your way out very well.>The Aura Blades that were chasing split up. Thinly, but countless small blades formed. The next moment, a merciless rain of aura poured down.Shhh!\"......!\"I lowered my posture and picked up the Serpens in reverse. The aura of the sword wrapped around my head like a shield.Kwagwagwagwang!It was a small area, but it was possible to cover my body. Thanks to this, I could block the attack from the front.\"Ugh.\"Instead, gravel and dirt bounced off the bombed ground on my surroundings and scraped across my body. It was an instant before my whole body ached.<Become a beehive>The rain from the aura grew even stronger. Pebbles and soil that bounced off came to cover the surrounding area like a mist.'Now!'I ran with all my might while my vision was disturbed. Breaking through the rain of aura and fog, I leaped towards the host.As soon as I jumped out of the muddy mist, I swung Serpens towards the silhouette with all my might.Wheeeew!However.<How dare you try to make small tricks with the sword while being a lowly Expert?>\"Huk!\"Whoohss!The host repelled my attack with the demon sword. Blown away by the tremendous force I flew backward.\"Serpens!\"Tcharararara!The whip sword stretched like a whip. While flying backward, I fired a combo attack on the host. However, the already recovered five aura blades blocked all trajectories of my whip sword.Because of the protection of the aura blade, the attack does not reach. It feels like a 6-to-1 fight.'This is the Aura Master....'Agnes, who couldn't stand it, also said.<I'm afraid the odds are slim at this rate, Ellet.>I clenched my teeth and managed to land with a fall method.A creepy voice pierced my ears.<I'll finish you now.>\"......!\"There was no time to correct my posture. Aura blades crossed the air and surrounded me faster than raptors.Harpoons were shot at me from five directions. Time was running out to chant holy spells. This could not be completely prevented or avoided.\"Ellet!\"Kwannng!A roar covered Thesilid's cry and shook the air.\"Ugh...!\"Instantly raising my aura, I surrounded myself. The aura, which I had raised to the limit, and the host's aura blade collided.The result was......Throbbing pain, burning across my body.\"Kuk...! Cough...!\"Blood gushed out of the mouth as a result of internal injuries. But it wasn't my blood.\"Are you...okay?\"\"......\"Thesilid, who used 'Guardian of the Beloved', took my wounds again. Seeing him smiling foolishly with blood-stained lips made something in me move.Even if Thesilid could handle all the injuries, the pain was halved. Enduring the pain and drenched in a cold sweat, I stared straight ahead.Agnes sternly said.<Match your opponent, Ellet.>\"...Yes.\"It's disappointing, but my aura falls short. Then, there is only one way.At that time, the host's eyes, which even the whites of his eyes turned red, flashed bizarrely.<That's strange. I attacked a woman, but it was the green-eyed brat who vomited blood.>His thinking was simple and childish.<Ohhh, look at this. You guys are not in a normal relationship.>\"......\"<Good. I will tear this woman to shreds in front of you, brat!>The red eyes glowed with mad excitement, and at the same time, the five aura blades flashed intensely. It looked like he was about to launch a blow with all his might.The blades swirled in a spiral and rushed towards me.It was a critical situation, but I thought of a way to reverse it.There was only one answer.\"Thesilid!\"The moment I shouted loud enough for my throat to burst, a solid back cut into my vision.Kagagaga!Thesilid, who slashed the aura Blade in an instant, dug into the host.Chae-Ae-Aeng!His sword aura, which confronted the demon sword, was the whitest and purest white light in the world. It was a special aura unique to the main character combined with divine power.<You......!>Despite his terrible internal injuries, he firmly faced the host with his sword.\"Sir Eleon, I will deal with you again from now on.\"<You are the weakest, who do you think you are to interrupt?>\"It's a strategic intervention. I'm afraid that our strategy has changed.\"<That's funny! What a brat like you can do? With such a tattered body... not?!>At that moment, a divine white light appeared all over Thesilid's body. It was a level 67 healing light amplified five times.\"It's a healthy body.\"<How......>At that moment, the host opened his eyes to me, who was behind Thesilid.<You were a healer?!>\"Not just a simple healer.\"I immediately cast an ultimate divine power skill.\"Divine Punishment!\"Thunderbolts struck down from the dry sky. The thunderstorms did not stop in one place but moved above ground.Of course, the host was not hit, I didn't even expect him to be hit.What I wanted was..<Damn it.

My fingertips pointed to the host.\"Vanquish of Evil.\"Distance and obstacles are ignored because this skill sticks to the existence itself.<Kuh!>He was in the realm of a master, so the resistance was strong. But for now, this was the most effective skill. This is especially true if the tank is engaged in a close-range battle.I continued to cut through the air with my finger, slashing Eleon O'Drek's existence.Thesilid was holding out in front of me, so I had enough time to use my divine skills. It was simply an all-you-can-deal buffet.(Note: Deal is the game slang for dealing damage)\"Vanquish of Evil! Vanquish of Evil! Vanquish of Evil!\"<Kuh, Gha! Uwagh!>Scratch-like wounds appeared here and there on the host's body, and opened up, creating cracks. The host, who felt the collapse of existence, howled in agony. Veins rose from the nape of his neck to the corners of his eyes, wriggling like an earthworm.He poured killing intent at me.<I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you first......!>Kaaaang!A dull iron screech cut off the host's words. Thesilid's sword stood in front of him.<Don't disturb me, little punk!>Thesilid didn't even budge.\"From here on.\"<Get out of the way!>\"Not a single step of yours.\"<I have no time for you!>\"Will go forward.\"<Shut up!

Instead of returning to Eleon, the demon sword flew away and landed on the ground.<M-my sword!>Demonic energy was quickly removed from Eleon's body, which was separated from the demon sword. His blonde hair and blue eyes came back to normal.\"My holy sword......!\"Although he had regained his human form, Eleon was still in the process of having his body broken apart.

Even that was not enough, he knelt down on one knee and had a moment of silence for a while.<Dear lord. Isn't this guy beyond saving?>Around the time when Agnes was dumbfounded by Thesilid's behavior once again.Whirrik!Suddenly a tornado of sand swirled and swallowed Eleon.\"Terry!\"I hurriedly pulled Thesilid away from the tornado and right the next second.<Oh.

Then he let out a small mumble.\"New Moon......Chaos and Evil....\"Agnes said to me.<Ellet, don't worry about it. This is what the second most vicious being in the world said. If you listen to it, it will only confuse you.>As expected of a devout believer.Instead of answering, I put my hand on Thesilid's shoulder, called his attention, and said.\"Let's start with the sword of the Celestial Demon first.\"\"Yes.\"Thesilid approached the sword stuck on the floor.The sword of the Celestial Demon was still in the form of a demon sword.The black blade seemed to have been smelt while pulling out the snake's long poisonous teeth, and the red beads embedded in the hill glistened as they stared at the Thesilid like a moving eyeball.Thesilid, standing in front of the sword, looked back at me and smiled softly.\"If I become like Sir Eleon, please take care of me.\"\"Don't worry, it won't happen.\"\"Do you trust me?\"\"Yes.\"\"I must repay your trust.\"After a deep breath that seemed to fill his rib cage, he grabbed the handle of the sword with a severe face and pulled it off the floor.Shuink......Thesilid's holy aura wrapped around the sword. The black blade was heated to white. The red marbles swayed wildly. It looked like the pupils of an eyeball that trembled in panic.Paaaah!The sword of the Celestial Demon was reborn in the light. A fine sword with an impressive white and smooth blade, gold hilt, and blue square jewels.After completing his mission, Thesilid exhaled a long breath and said:\"The name of the holy sword...is Libra.\"It was meant to be a balance between good and evil and like my swords, it was named after a constellation.['The Scales that Judges the Soul' commends this title worthy of the world's strongest sword.]The god of the same name boasted aloud.(Note: Libra is also a scale.)\"Congratulations, Terry.

Whatever you need, ask him.\"\"Thank you, Mr. Epiden.\"Clattering!\"If there is a communication problem, you can solve it through Helverus. And Helverus is a vegetarian devil, so please take that into account.\"\"We are on your hands, Young Helverus.\"<I will be in your care.>After completing the handover, we had a conversation over tea given by Epiden, and Mom asked in a serious tone.\"So, your decision hasn't changed?\"\"Yes. I want to go on a training trip like Brother.\"There's nothing better than traveling after spending a long time only inside the house.Mom nodded her head.\"That's true, you've spent too much time only inside this Castle. It's time for my daughter to see the world, too.\"\"Right. I'm a frog in a well. I need to learn the world.\"\"That's a great attitude. Did you say you're leaving in late spring? May is the perfect time to travel.\"Mom readily agreed, but Dad said as if he couldn't help but feel sad and regretful.\"Wait, Elthea. I'm a little worried. What if she goes out for nothing and the child comes back with a guy......\"\"Leo. That's my case you are talking about.\"\"I think it would be great! Go ahead, Eli!\"\"Yes, Dad. I will definitely bring a man like my father.\"Thanks to Mom, who is a strong ally, I succeeded in persuading Dad.I had a sudden thought, so I carefully brought it up.\"Oh, Mom.\"\"Yes, my daughter.\"\"I wanted Grandpa to help me with travel arrangements. Would that be okay?\"\"Why are you asking permission for that? You can do as you like.\"It was like I was asking something really useless. The valley between Mom and Dad seemed to have been filled a lot.I can comfortably ask Grandpa to get the things I need because now I can't get out of the Castle yet.At that time, Mom brought up an unexpected suggestion.\"When you go on a trip, you should stop by your Grandpa's house.\"\"Yes. I will, Mom.\"Dad also said something.\"Until you leave, let's drink tea as often as we do now, Eli.\"\"Yes, Dad.\"I nodded vigorously with a smile.For the next three months, I plan to enjoy my precious time with my family.\u2720I have completed all the handovers so that the Rodel Potion Company can run smoothly without me. Then I wrote two letters.The first letter was addressed to my best friend, Bianca, who is now in the Kingdom's capital.Bianca has been confined to the royal palace since she was selected as the exclusive maid of the 1st Princes. Because of this, we haven't seen each other for years and only communicated through letters.I informed Bianca about my travel plans.It wasn't very long, but seeing that I wrote 'I want to see you' seven times, I felt a little embarrassed.['The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things' says its perfect in spelling and content and urges you to post it right away.]The recipient of the second letter was Grandpa.I told Grandpa about my decision and asked for some necessities. I also thought about writing a letter to Frintz, but stopped because he was on a training trip anyway, so it didn't seem like it would be delivered well.\"I wrote all the letters. Now, let's try alchemy and cooking.\"I decided to make a bunch of potions and lunch boxes by type and store them in my satchel bag. The subspace inventory was very convenient because it ignores the expiration date.First of all, alchemy.Taking out 'Mermaid's tears', which came from catching Undead Ciel, the boss of the 298th floor of the Tower of Trials, I tried to process it to make the best potion.Agnes asked as I was concentrating.<Why make a potion when you can use Heal?>\"When bleeding is severe, healing is not enough, it is essential to help blood production with potions. And also......\"<Also?>\"There might be no one to heal me when I get hurt.\"<Oh, that's true.>What if I am seriously injured and pass out because of the aftereffects of Descent?No matter how much I leveled my Heal, it would be of no use.After finishing cooking, I went to the backyard suitable for training. If I get lazy just because the closed training is over, the tip of my sword will become dull.The training was mainly focused on aura response.\"I want to be a master...I also want to use a thousand swords...\"<Don't fret. An anxious mind is the biggest obstacle.>\"Yes.\"Such a monotonous daily life was repeated for about a fortnight.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Or is it just my mood? >\"I don't think it's only because of your mood.\"Just then, the voices of the maids were heard.\"Did you hear from the Head Maid? Cardinal Cattleya is coming tomorrow.\"\"What? The Matron? Is it a special day tomorrow?\"\"I don't know. Anyway, let's clean the chapel first.\"Agnes clapped her hands together and rejoiced.<Oh, Cattleya is coming. It's been a really long time!>\"That's right. I guess she's going to spend this holiday in the Castle.\"<Holiday? Ah! Come to think of it, tomorrow is the first day of the new year.>The first day of the New Year.The first day of the first month of the New Year was a very important holiday in a church that values the lunar calendar. On this day, a large number of offerings for atonement and prosperity were burned in a ceremony.'New Year.'I brooded over the word. A very special event day was approaching.\u2720<Ellet, wake up! You should exercise in the morning!>The sun shone through the windows that I forgot to close the curtains last night. It was quite late in the morning considering the fact that the winter's sun had a later rise.I wriggled under the covers.\"I want to sleep more...\"<Don't do that, look out the window! It rained last night and a double rainbow appeared. Come on, let's go outside and sweat in the light of the rainbow!>\"unh......I'm sleep......\"<How can you become a Master with that spirit! Cadet Ellet, wake up!>\"Don't wanna......I'll sleep......\"I rolled the blanket over my head and curled up like a slouch.<Gee, why is this kid who usually doesn't oversleep like this today?>\"There are days like this......\"<Wait, are you sick?!>Agnes poked her face inside the blanket. It was an excellent horror effect straight from a movie.\"It's not like that. I just want to rest and do nothing today.\"<Hmmm, you have a firm will.>\"yes. See you later, Agnes.\"I turned to the other side and tried to sleep. I fell asleep quickly thanks to the warm and cozy bed.\"Hmm.\"It was around 10 am when I woke up again.After lounging around for a while, I came out of the blanket to get my first meal. Even after I finished eating, I just sat around in the room.Agnes put both hands on her waist, looking at me who had no intention of going out at all.<Are you really not going to practice?>\"Yes.\"<You won't even make potions?>\"Yes.\"<A kid who lived so faithfully? Are you in late puberty?If I gave a positive answer, she had the momentum to immediately start a face-to-face pep talk.\"It's not like that.\"That was then. The voices of the butler and the maids came from outside the window.\"Look, maid! The Matron just arrived!\"\"Al-already?! Oh my, the Madam probably hasn't woken up yet!\"\"There's no more time! Hurry up, wake up the madam and help her in the morning preparations!\"Upon hearing the news of the arrival of a close friend, Agnes' eyes lit up.<Cattleya is here! Let's go say hi, Ellet!>\"Yes, we should.\"I finally got dressed and went out of the room.It was obvious where Cardinal Cattleya, who had just arrived, would be. I stepped into the chapel on the first floor of the main building. It was easy to find a middle-aged woman praying in the middle of a reverent space with lit candles<It's Cattleya!>I waited for Cardinal Cattleya's prayer to end and approached.\"Hello, your grace the Cardinal.\"\"What's up with this church-like greeting? Just calm me Matron as always. How have you been, Ellet?\"\"Good.\"A soft smile crept across Cardinal Cattleya's face as she looked at her granddaughter's friend. Like a lie, her usual coldness was fading away.Soon, her gaze turned a little away from me.\"Agnes too?\"<Yes, yes. Leya, how are you? Are you feeling pain anywhere?>It was revealed earlier on that Agnes' soul was with me thanks to the necklace of relic.Although they could not hear each other's voices, Agnes and Cardinal Cattleya looked at each other with warm eyes. The scene of friendship that transcends life and death was heartwarming.\"She said she's been well. She also asked about the health of the Matron.\"\"My health? Please tell her I'm still healthy, so I have a long way to go to her side.\"\"Yes. Did you hear that, Agnes?\"<Sheesh. This girl, the way she talks is always......>\"She's grumbling right now about the way I talk, right?\"<......>\"Pffff......yes. You two must have been really close.\"After that, I helped the two of them communicate for a while. Suddenly, there was someone's well-being I was curious about.\"How's Thesilid?\"\"If it's a Thesilid...not long ago he became the owner of the holy sword. He's making a name for himself. He's growing well accordingly to the Vatican's expectations. Today, Thesilid will be in charge of the torch relay for the burning offerings in the Vatican\"\"I see.\"\"You care quite a bit. Wasn't your only point of contact the dungeon sink that occurred 10 years ago?\"\"I happened to meet him again recently.\"\"Really?\"The eyes, filled with time and wisdom, looked deeply into me.\"Ellet.\"Cardinal Cattleya opened her mouth.\"Thesilid Argent is unlikely to lead a normal life.\"\"......\"\"So, being involved with him......\"As the words continued, I could see that Cardinal Cattleya's jaw tightened.\"Matron.\"I cut off her words.\"I'll keep that in mind. Don't say anything more.\"\"......\"Thesilid must have been abnormally reflected in her Eyesight of Vitality, which can see the lifespan that has been lived and the rest of the lifespan to live.Cardinal Cattleya was trying to warn me even by breaking her ban.<What is it? Even Cattleya seems to care about Thesilid?>Agnes muttered as if she was dying to know Thesilid's identity.\"Thank you for your kindness, Matron.\"\"......Come to think of it, I think I said something unnecessary. You are not an ordinary child either.\"Cardinal Cattleya smiled kindly. I replied with a smile face to face.\"Oh, Mother! You came earlier than expected!\"The Countess appeared just in time, it was a good time to leave.\"Then I will go my way.\"I politely bowed to Cardinal Cattleya and the Countess and left the chapel. As soon as I left the place, I turned to the library, borrowed books of literature from the continent, and spent time reading them.It is convenient to see it in the integrated study, but then Agnes will be bored.<Wait, don't turn the pages yet. I mean, I didn't finish reading it.>\"Agnes reads the sentence while savoring it.\"<You read too fast.>\"There are readers like Agnes, and there are readers like me.\"When I had finished reading a few books and exchanging opinions with Agnes, I noticed that it was getting dark outside the window.Soon the sun was going down.['The World-building God' announces that the time has come]Shrrek.Without hesitation, I pushed the chair back and stood up.\"I have work to do, Agnes.\"<Work? You said you were going to play today.>\"It's important. Let's go.\"The early evening sky was as dark blue as the deep sea. I sent my eyes near the western horizon.A crescent moon as thin as a nail mark. The new moon was hanging there.I went up to the Count's roof to avoid the eyes of the servants.<You are weird today. Why do you keep doing things you've never done before?>\"Everything has a reason. Agnes should also take a good look.\"It is now January and February approaches. The breath that came out of my mouth was shattered white. It was quickly swept away by the cold wind of a winter night.I opened the system. After a long time, I turned on the 'Ranking' notification setting and looked up at the sky again.It was when I waited for about half an hour.Paaaah-!A star fell with a flash of light from the western sky. After a brief moment, I took a deep breath.<A shooting star? Were you here to see that?>\"Yes.\"<I see, did you make a wish?>Agnes playfully introduced superstitions. However, my expression was stiff.\"Agnes, that's not such an auspicious sign.\"<Huh? Then?>That was the moment.[<System> Your ranking changes.

This is the beginning.\"\u2720Meanwhile, where the stars fell.There was a being in the center of the crater where ash powder and sparks were flying. A man with long, black hair like a crow's feather, surrounded by corrupted energy.There were several names for him.Newborn Chaos and Evil.The Darkness conceived by light.An exiled from the regressing world.But there was another simple name that he himself preferred over such long monikers.That's right, 'Reed'.\"......\"Reed opened his eyes.The body, which had been curled up as if torn apart while begging for God's mercy, rose slowly.He lifted his head towards the deep-sea night sky. His face, revealed through the pouring long black hair, was demonically beautiful.\"Aah......\"Reed found something in the eastern sky.The light of a lighthouse visible only to him.\"Descent of the Divinity....\"A dark smile quickly appeared on his face, which had been grimacing in displeasure.\"It's a warm welcome.\"\u2720At the same time as the system was temporarily down, something strange happened in the world.<Oh my God.>There was no such thing as a catastrophe as great as the end of the world.The wind just went backward and.<The moon....>The celestial bodies moved in reverse. The stars and the moon in the night sky moved very quickly from west to east.<E-Ellet, what the hell happened?>\"The world is broken.\"<The world......broken? What does that mean?>There is a story that needs to be told before Agnes could understand that concept.\"I promised to explain before. What is the identity of Thesilid Argent?\"My gaze was fixed on a cluster of stars moving in a huge arc from left to right. I said without doubt that Agnes would listen.\"He is a regressor.\"<A regressor...?>\"A person who turns back time from the future and returns to the past. Not right now, but in 3 months he would become so. He is also the protagonist of this world. The world we live in is a 'Regressing World' that requires him to regress.\"<What? Regression world?

That's...\"I clenched my fist.\"When the main character is dead.\"That was the moment.My field of vision darkened. My consciousness flew away as if someone had forced the switch off.\u2720\"......\"When I woke up, I was in the bed in my room.It was a time later than usual. The sun shone brightly through the window I forgot to close the curtains the night before yesterday.<Ellet.>Agnes was looking down at me with a stiff face. As if waiting for me to wake up, she brought the topic up.<I can see why you wasted Descent without hesitation.>\"......\"<And why you didn't do anything but just sit around doing nothing yesterday.>An expressionless face looked out the window. There hung an auspicious double rainbow in the sky. What is the probability that a double rainbow will appear at the same location and at the same time for two days in a row?A loud voice came from outside on behalf of our silence.\"Look, maid! The Matron just arrived!\"\"Al-already?! Oh my, the Madam probably hasn't woken up yet!\"\"There's no more time! Hurry up, wake up the madam and help her in the morning preparations!\"The butler and the maid delivered the same good news as 'yesterday'.A perfect d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.However, there was no Agnes whose eyes twinkled in anticipation of meeting a close friend. Only purple eyes which trembled slightly.<The day...went back.>\"Yes.\"A loop occurred.Since time has gone back to yesterday, the Descent Penalty was also gone.Note that this loop is not a regression. Since it was a completely different phenomenon, even the main character is not aware of such anomalies.However, I was able to recognize the loop because I am a transmigrator from outside this regression world, and Agnes was influenced because her soul was bound to me.Agnes, who experienced a phenomenon that went against any providences she knew, could not hide her shock.I thought I should calm her down, so I explained the situation in a calm voice.\"Because the protagonist died before he even became a regressor, the world turned back a day before the main character died.\"This is a tutorial period that is still before the original begins. Far from awakening the ability of infinite regression, the protagonist was even unaware of his fate as a regressor, which will heavily weigh on him.He was still just an ordinary human.However, from the point of view of the regression world, he was a precious part that forms the basis of this world Dying after becoming a regressor is a natural step, but dying before that is not welcomed.Therefore.\"The death of the protagonist who did not become a regressor is nullified.\"Making it something that never happened.This loop phenomenon is a huge crime of deception committed by the regression world. That's what I and Agnes witnessed now.<The word 'Protagonist' is so strange. Does it make sense that a human being, not a god, becomes the center of the world?>\"It's possible. Because that is the will of 'Strict order and Goodwill' that governed this world. Thesilid Argent was chosen by God.\"<......>Originally, this world was destined to quickly perish as 'Strict order and Goodwill' abandoned it. However, the world rejected that, and 'Strict order and Goodwill' arranged the means for it to survive, albeit as a temporary measure.It was an infinite repetition of the timeline using the regressor as a base.Agnes seemed to have lost her will to refute when the god she believed in was mentioned. She changed the question.<Who killed Thesilid? That shooting star?>\"Yes. To borrow the words of Carpeus, the 'Newborn Chaos and Evil'.\"<Haa, it wasn't just nonsense cursing, it was real. From what I've heard, it seems that this being in higher in ranking than a Demon King.>\"Yes.\"Chaos is in its name. It is not difficult to guess its status as it's directly opposite 'Order and Goodwill'.A newborn demonic vessel.<By the way, can such high-ranking demon use their power outside the dungeon? Weren't demons able to come out into the world only through dungeon bursts? The higher the dungeon's owner, the more stringent the conditions for a burst to occur, right? Is 'Chaos and Evil' a special demon?>The answer was simple.\"No. He is not a demon.\"<What?>\"He is human. He possesses the power of a demon, but for now, he's human.\"<......>Agnes couldn't close her mouth.\"His purpose is only to destroy the world. There are no concessions or compromises with him.\"There is no other way but to confront such an existence by force.<No way, is that stronger than you?>\"Yes.\"I clenched my fist. It's painful to stay in second place even after using Descent of Divinity.<Oh my God...>Agnes seemed quite shocked by the arrival of a great evil.

He definitely remembers sleeping on the bed as usual. However, his body was in a state of despair, as if he was struggling in battle.Cold sweat was on his forehead, and his heart was beating so fast that it pierced his rib cage.'It was....a nightmare.'After panting for a while, he raised his upper body and looked down at his hands. The dim light from dawn was enough for his eyes, familiar with the darkness.To his surprise, his hands were trembling.\"......\"Even in front of Eleon O'Drek, with who he had an overwhelming gap in power, he never dropped the sword his hand was holding.But now, it was trembling.Just because of a nightmare?Around the time a sense of incongruity ran through his mind.\"Cough...!\"Suddenly, he hastily covered his mouth. It was because of a terrible, inexplicable pain that came over his whole body. It felt as if his whole body was being slowly crushed by a wall that came down on him. His lungs compressed by phantom pain refused to breathe.Is this a nightmare? What kind of nightmare could engrave such fear and pain in my body?\"Who...what have you done to me...\"At that moment, it may have been wiser not to know.\"......!\"A vision flashed before his eyes.In front of the Altar of Atonement for which the burnt offering was to be held today.

But now salvation was not with him.\\n\\nChapter 16. 2nd Major Update\\n\\nThe Loop's disaster ended in a week as the original.From the day uncontrollable regression was normalized, I returned to my usual diligent and sincere Ellet Rodellaine routine.When I was taking notes of things to do when I went outside the County, I had a sudden idea and called on God.'My Lord, don't you have any plans to sell an Aura Master 3-month short-term training package?'['The World-building God' hands over the question to the head of the Business Division.]['The Creative Business Manager' answers that it is still a long way from selling grinding tickets for the ultimate level of classes.]Tsk.['The World-building God' shouts that you shouldn't make a contract with the Demon King!]'I won't. For me, our Lord World God is the only one.'I volunteered to reinforce my ideology after complaining a little.It was also in line with the reason why I wanted to quickly attain the Master's state.'The last boss. He was described as being in the celestial class in the original work, but even with Descent, he can't be beaten.'['The World-building God' says that such an expression as \"celestial class\" is a paradox in the sense that he is not really a God.]Oh, come to think of it, that's right. That's an encouraging remark.Although he can't awaken followers as Masters, our World God comforts us with his words.'I believe in you. Amen.'['The World-building God' smiles happily.]World God and Mr. Economy Manager went straight back to work. There was a large-scale update to happen soon, so they seemed to be quite busy.Come to think of it, there will be a VIP point shop in this update.I remembered the 'VIP Point Shop Ticket' and '100,000 Point Coupon' that I received as a reward for completing the conquest of the Tower of Trials.I hope to be able to use these soon.The cash shop exclusive to transmigrators sold job change packages, growth buffs, skill books, training weapons, lower-level healing potions, and other additional services.These are products often supplied for transmigrators.Will the point shop sell something different from the cash shop? Something special that's not available for supply?'The name is for VIPs only, after all.'As I was filled with anticipation, a question suddenly popped up in my mind.What was added in the first major update was the 300-story Tower of Trials. On the other hand, isn't the point shop too simple of content to be added in a whole update? Besides, it's exclusive to VIPs, so it's not something everyone can enjoy.'The point shop is not the main thing.

At the end of the narrow street, a store was lit up.

I was actually looking at it too.\"God Grandma intervened in time.\"It's a luxury inventory bag. Because it is 3306 m2, it is good to use as a logistics warehouse.

But these sunglasses are non-removable once used, right?\"\"How did know? That's right. It's not active, it's passive, so it gets quite a lot of critics since it sometimes lets you know what you don't want to know.\"I agreed. It was easy to understand just by looking at the agony of Cardinal Cattleya, who had the Eyesight of Vitality.Other products also caught my eye.\"What about this luxury watch?\"\"Hoho, I knew this would also catch your fancy. This is an artifact that can return you once to any point in time.\"\"Wow. Is it possible to do a second round in the Transmigration afterlife choice office?\"\"Of course. All you need is money.

It was a place where the sky, which was covered with dark clouds, and the rocky terrain met on the horizon.Quarreung! Quarreung!Thunderstorms vertically hit the ground throughout the dark clouds. It's like using Divine Punishment. The sky was angry at something.My gaze focused on the place where lightning was gathered. At that moment, my eyes widened.\"Oh my God.\"There was a huge pit about 100 meters in diameter. I drew closer and looked down.There was an indescribable darkness. It looks like the abyss of the underworld.

Due to the geographical enclosure, there were hardly any visitors from outsiders except for the peddlers who came once a week.But recently, there has been an unexpected change here.The women who were doing the laundry by the well chattered.\"A lot of priests and knights came this morning, right?

The village will develop!\"It was time for the happiness circuit to run wild, with no doubt that peace would continue as always.\"Hmph! What happens if we develop? The church would extort us in the name of donations. After all, they are a denomination that is only after money!\"An old man barged into the talk. He had a great sense of disparity mixed among the women, but his arms movements using the bat were skillful.\"The chief is too much. The church was always like that, right? Don't get angry.\"\"That's right.\"\"By the way, why did you come out to do laundry today?\"\"My wife strained her back while plowing the field yesterday, besides, I do laundry better than my wife anyway\"I think that was enough appreciation of a peaceful rural laundry scenery. At this point, I stopped looking at the system map and approached them.\"Hello. Can I ask you a question?\"\"Oh my, what a surprise! An outsider?\"\"It seems that adventurers are coming because rumors of a dungeon have spread!\"\"Welcome to Greenwall!\"Seeing the kindness of the people, I thought it would be easy to ask questions.\"Where is the church in town?\"\"Church? Go straight down the right road and you'll find it.\"\"It's a brick building, so it's easy to see.\"\"But the priest also ran away and there's no one there, it was not maintained at all, so it's more like an abandoned house.\"Three women amicably shared their answers. The Village Chief Grandpa also helped with a word.\"Now it's being used as a storage for junk.\"That's why it didn't show up on the map.It's possible to understand the piety of this village in one second seeing that the church was not functioning at all.['The Creative Business Manager' says it's a niche market.]['The World-building God' eyes shine with anticipation.]\"Thank you for letting me know.

Then I will go my way.\"\"Wait a minute lass!\"Chief Grandpa caught me in a hurry. I wondered if he was going to ask for more samples, but he wasn't.The village chief rummaged through his arms and held something warm in my hand.\"You don't have this in your house, do you?\"\"......\"\"Well, it's been a long time since an outsider has come. I have nothing to give you but eat this. My wife cooked it for me.\"The softly ripe potatoes had a fragrant smell.\"Thank you.\"\"What. It's nothing, Lass.\"The favor must be repaid.\"Sisters, Grandpa, it would be better to finish the laundry quickly today. It will be dangerous for a while.\"\"What? Lass, what does that mean...\"I smiled and turned back.Walking along the road taught by the villagers, I ate potatoes little by little. By the time the potatoes had all disappeared into my stomach, I arrived at a building believed to be the church.The wall was torn down and the ceiling collapsed to the extent that the wooden beams could be seen bare. There was not even a cross, the symbol of the church.<It's miserable.>\"At least the bell looks fine.\"<Are you going to use that?>\"Yes. Beware of the noise, Agnes.\"I immediately climbed the three-story tower and frantically rang the giant bell.Deng! Deeng!

Why does it keep ringing so loudly?!\"\"Oh my, my back hurts to death, but I can't lie down because it's so noisy!\"\"Who the hell is doing this!\"Villagers flocked to the front of the church.\"Hold on, Lass!

You ate the potatoes well, why are you doing something like that! Come down now!\"\"It's no use, Chief. She looks like a crazy woman.\"They whispered, but I heard everything. I almost felt a little ashamed, but Agnes comforted me.<It is an honor that will soon be restored anyway. Continue.>\"Yes.\"I decided that I should start soon because I didn't have time. I stopped ringing the bell and shouted.\"Everyone, are you all here? It will be dangerous from now on, so come into the church!\"\"What?\"\"What are you talking about?\"Everyone was dumbfounded as I was already defined as a crazy lass from the outside.Fortunately or unfortunately, the time for my sweet potatoes was not long.['The World-building God' gets nervous.]['The Spoiler Inspector' is focused.]BOOM!Koo!Woo woo woo!A drumming sound that strikes the heartbeats was similar to giant steps.

It looked like a black avalanche. But unlike natural disasters, this one roared.Kuaaaaaaag!Kyeeeeeekk!Thanks to that, it was clear what was happening now.\"Hi-Hiik! Be-beasts!!\"\"Maybe, don't tell me......!\"\"Du-dungeon! The dungeon has exploded!\"Dungeon Burst.The faces of those that encountered calamity turned beyond pale.'The final scene of the Last Boss in this timeline was flashy from the start.'Before long, the monster avalanche came down to the village entrance. Swallowing the village like crushing clay, it approached the church by the minute.In a place that was directly hit by a dungeon burst, even an awakened person would scream, and even more so for ordinary people, as their chances of survival were slim.As a matter of fact, in the original, Greenwall disappeared from the map.\"Hic, n-n-n-no... ... .\"In a short period of time, fear and despair occupied the whole area like a plague.Now was the time to destroy the original.\"Mercury's Barrier.\"The ultimate barrier transformed into a silver fortress and wrapped around the surroundings.\"Huk!

They looked at me on the roof of the church with doubt in their eyes.While in the spotlight, I said.\"Come into the church. It is safe here.\"The first person to come to his senses was the Village Head Grandpa.\"Are you going to eat a fly with those open mouths?! Can't you hear the Young Priest?! Hurry in!\"\"Y-yes! Chief!\"Less than a hundred villagers quickly entered the church. I watched it all through the broken roof and then reduced the size of the barrier to fit the building.Kuaaaaaaag!Kyeeeeeekk!All of a sudden, an army of demonic monsters surrounded the church.Due to the ultimate barrier, the building became an impregnable fortress, but the broken walls and windows revealed the situation outside, stimulating people's fear.Kyhee! Kikiheye!The beast-type ones greedily opened their mouths and fluttered their forearm-sized tongues.\"Hiic!\"\"Ugh!\"\"Aww!\"\"Everyone calm down!\"I looked ahead, believing that the village chief would take care of things inside.Under the blue sky, the earth was polluted with black. Because of the very clear weather, it felt like the disaster on the ground was highlighted.I pulled lighting out from this deceptive dry sky.\"Divine Punishment.\"Skills were cast in succession to clean up the surroundings. There was no fear of missing or need to aim, because everywhere in sight was black thanks to the avalanche of monsters.Kuarreung! Kuarreung!Kyeeeeeekk! Kuaaaaaaag!Hundreds of meters in radius turned into a thunderstorm, frying and burning an army of monsters.Kyhee!However, a Dungeon Burst's offensive in volume was more than imaginable. Still, the enemy showed no sign of diminishing due to the endless flow of magical beasts.Was I too greedy for a clean-up?'I can't drag this on.'In frustration, I looked in turns at the likely location of the dungeon and the people in the church.On one side, there will be Thesilid approaching death by the minute, and on the other side, there are people I saved. The latter was also in my immediate sight.When I enter the dungeon, the barrier is no longer maintained. However, it's not possible to stay here forever because there is no time.Should I make a choice?I clenched my fist. That was then.['The World-building God' stops breathing.]World God?<E......Ellet.>Agnes also called me with a trembling voice.\"Agnes?\"<......Above.>I raised my head following the words that seemed to have been barely spat out and found something in the blue sky.There was a being with long black hair fluttering in the distant sky and looking down at this side.\"......\"A handsome man who looks down on the world with an arrogant face.I knew who it was.\u2720Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I had to hurry.When I enter the dungeon, the barrier I put on the church will disappear.After consecrating the entire church so it can be able to endure to a certain extent, I ran into the dungeon.I put all my strength on my two legs and went up the hillside. All the beasts I encountered were wiped out. When I finally arrived, the source of the disaster was waiting for me with its black mouth wide open, and without hesitation, I threw myself into the dungeon gate.[<System> You have entered the A-Grade dungeon 'Sculptor's Atelier'][<System> warning. Since the dungeon is currently in a burst state, the difficulty level will be upgraded to S grade.]If you imagined something like an art studio because the name of the dungeon was Atelier, you would be mistaken. The owner of the dungeon was a high-ranking demon. Naturally, the art of demons was of bad taste and not done in an ordinary way.The sculptures here were made through the process of slowly petrifying the victims alive. In other words, the material of the sculpture was a living organism.Evidence of that was found in the system map where it says 'Material Storage Room'.All kinds of living things, including humans, beasts, demons, and monsters, were trapped behind iron bars, and most of them were chimeras synthesized from two or more.Aww!Kewaaaagh!The living creatures shed tears of blood and wailed nonstop. Get me out of here or kill me. As this was after the burst occurred, most of the iron cages were empty.'Thesilid is......Where's Thesilid?'Episode 17 of the original, which is only three pages long, does not portray his death well. There was a shortage of information.It was around the time when I was looking around impatiently.\"Oh my!

You defeated, the owner of the dungeon, 'Sculptor Silevan,' 799th in the Demon World.]Khowwww......Kyekekek......Most of the monsters shared the same fate with Silevan, but there were some trapped in the cage who had not stopped breathing yet.Tcharararara!Keeek! Kikikiki! Kguohhh!After giving them rest with my whip sword, I ran down the hallway.<Where are you going, Ellet?!>\"The silver angel the boss mentioned earlier is probably Thesilid. I'm going to the workshop where he collected harpy wings.\"<Do you know where it is?>\"Yes.\"Because it's on the map.As if to let us know that this was the right way, the statues of angels increased in the hallway. Angels holding hands in prayer, ones with arms open to receive revelation, or kneeling down while weeping.There was so much piousness in them it was hard to believe it was the work of the devil.\"Clean up.\"Ptsusosususu! Pukpukpuku!I smashed them all and put more strength on both legs. In the meantime, we were almost at our destination.A huge arched iron gate blocked the front and beyond that was Thesilid.Kiiiing!I opened both doors with all my might. The light from the hallway penetrated into the dark room, revealing the interior.\"......!\"['The Scales that Judges the Soul' is astonished.]A scene that the original did not show was unfolding before my eyes.There was a man in a place that looked like a circular altar.Kneeling down on his ragged knees, his broken arms hanging from chains, and with the wings of a huge white beast nailed to his back. Wires that had dug into his body or had pierced his flesh were also seen. Perhaps those were for the purpose of fixing the posture.\"Te......\"I took a step forward without thinking and was startled by the sound of liquid splatting. Blood was flowing down all the way to the front of the door.<Ellet, I'm afraid it's already.......>I went to him without listening.\"Thesilid!\"I just poured out heals first. The sight of wounds healing signaled that he was not yet dead.<He was still alive......even like this?>\"Leed.\"I said the name as if chewing on it and stopped healing. He should not be fully treated now. I removed the myriad of wires embed in his body one by one.The intention was clearly felt. I clenched my teeth and continued my cursing.\"......He wanted Thesilid to suffer for a very long and then die of madness.\"<Crazy......>I carefully tilted Thesilid's head back and poured a potion into his mouth. It couldn't even properly pass over his throat, but I poured ten bottles down.The arms hanging from the chain of the ceiling had not yet been released, as there was something to be done before.I took my hand behind his back as if hugging him. Swallowing the cursing that was about to rise to my throat, I made a gentle voice with all my might.\"It will hurt a little. I'm sorry.\"Pshuugok.I tore off the harpy wings from his back.\"Kugh......!\"Thesilid, who had completely lost his mind and didn't twitch even a muscle so far, let out a painful groan.I hugged him in a hurry and poured heals on his back.\"Good job. You held it in well. It's alright now. It's over. It's alright.\"I don't know if I'm talking to him or me.Agnes looked around one last time while I was releasing the chains.<By the way, what about the other subjugation members who came with this guy......>\"You don't have to look for it.\"It was an unexpectedly cold voice that took even me by surprise. As if feeling something, Agnes didn't ask anymore.\"Let's move.\"As soon as I left the dungeon by opening the closing gate, I broke the teleport stone.

So I had to make one based on the Kanjis based on the Hanguls of the name. Ugh.)The order of the Pillar of Light was truly the worst.The leader was a self-righteous officer drenched in incompetence with a habit of ordering everyone around, the vice-leader was garbage possessed by a sense of inferiority, and the rest of the members were gray molecules without self-asserting powers and easily manipulated.While there, Thesilid died three times because of the leader\u2019s foolish ventures, once because of the vice-captain\u2019s tricks, and three times because of the mistakes, betrayals, and coerced sacrifices for his colleagues.It wasn\u2019t until the 8th episode that Thesilid came to his senses and tried to change the Order by himself, but his life was still a sweet potato road.Until that point, it was possible to blame others, but there was an incident where he was the only problem.It happened when he ran into a band of thieves staying in the village he was dispatched for a mission.The bandits took the villagers hostage and threatened Thesilid, saying, \u2018If you don\u2019t put down your weapons, I\u2019ll kill them all!\u2019How did our protagonist deal with this?It\u2019s painful just trying to explain. I\u2019ll just say that because of this anecdote, Thesilid\u2019s nickname became Pushover Free Pass.In the next round, he increased his strength, ignoring the hostage play and wiping out the bandits. However, it turns out that the village chief he saved was also one with the bandits, so he was lured into a trap and died.In the next round, he subdues the village chief and survives, but is summoned back to The Vatican, disciplined, and demoted on the grounds that he fought the bandits while ignoring the hostages.There were many other frustrating anecdotes.He goes to the Magic Republic as a diplomatic envoy, but gets caught by a crazy perverted princess and is subjected to a biological experiment.In the kingdom, readers wondered if he would finally be able to find some heart-warming family love, but blood ties were bullshit. A full-length tragic drama was ready to be shot.The main character had lived such a rough life 16 times.His 16th death was to die with his chest pierced in heavy rain while in the wilderness. By his brother\u2019s sword.The 17th life came right away. There was no time to look back on the betrayal and death that engulfed him in his previous life.As soon as he returned, he was captured by the Final Boss and had to die again.Slowly, terribly and painfully.\u2026As helpless as a worm.The greatest episode of all time, which ended in only three pages, was the most confusing episode for the protagonist.As soon as he opened his eyes after finishing a particularly difficult episode 16, he was brutally murdered by an unidentified assailant without knowing why.Maybe that\u2019s why the last paragraph finishing the 17th round was impressive.\u2013 He thought as he dragged into the pitch-black void. It seems that the whole world hates him and wants his death.No matter how many times he tries, the results will always be the worst, and no matter how hard he struggles, it always ends in death. Is not for nothing that this was the moment when the protagonist first felt disillusioned with life and the world.<\u2026\u2026Born under an unlucky start.>Agnes\u2019 words were not so different from the readers\u2019 impressions at the time of the serialization.Thesilid Argent was a person you had no choice but to pity.Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.The vegetables were cut neatly in my hands.I was talking to Agnes while I was cooking.\u201cYes, it was one hell of a destiny. But there are up to 99 episodes of this strange life and the further you go, the worse it gets.\u201d<To what extent?>\u201cHe dies after being stabbed in the back by the woman he loved with all his heart. And that\u2019s no less than three times in a row.\u201d<What\u2026\u20263 times in a row?>\u201cThat\u2019s how much it meant to him. Had he not known the truth, he would have died more.\u201dMy voice was very low even to my ears. As expected, it\u2019s an unpleasant story I\u2019d better stop.Pouring the ingredients into the pot I stirred them with a spatula. Clam meat, bacon, and various vegetables were cooked in a hot and thick cream sauce. It wasn\u2019t long before the delicious smell spread through the little wooden hut.\u201cThesilid hasn\u2019t woken up yet?\u201d<Yes. He isn\u2019t opening his eyes at all. I\u2019m nervous because he\u2019s sleeping without making a sound.>\u201cI\u2019m worried, I\u2019ll take a look at him in a while.\u201dThe place where I took Thesilid was the cottage where my parents lived.The house was located at the foot of a remote mountain, so the surrounding environment was quiet and idyllic. It has been a while since all the residents left the village, and there was no one to encounter. It was a good place for a comfortable recuperation for Thesilid, who had a striking appearance.It was a good thing I asked my grandfather to take care of the house a little earlier. The hut had an assortment of clean and pretty appliances, making it easy to stay on upon arrival.Curtains and bedding were soft, household items were cute, and the bookshelves were full of books, from fairy tales to alchemy theories.Even the garden in the yard was meticulously cared for.Perhaps this is what it looked like when Mom and Dad lived together.squeaky.I quietly entered the bedroom through an unlocked door.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA handsome man with sculptural fine features was asleep on the bed.A plaster-like face, pure silver shimmering hair, bright sunlight, and white bedding.Perhaps because everything was pure white, the moment I entered the bedroom, it felt more sacred than any other chapel.\u201cThesilid.\u201dAgain, there was no answer.The chest wrapped in the shirt regularly moved up and down. His breathing and pulse seemed normal, but there were no signs of him getting up.It\u2019s true that he went through a lot of things, it was a damn rough path. The shock will be severe. Besides, when he opens his eyes, his disillusioned life just repeats itself, sleeping would make him happier.I don\u2019t even want to wake him up.\u201cYes, get a good night\u2019s sleep while I\u2019m around.\u201dI turned around and left the bedroom. Looks like I\u2019ll have to eat alone for the time being.\u2720It was a week after that Thesilid opened his eyes.There was nothing to do after making strawberry jam, basil pesto, beet pickle, etc. with the things I harvested in the garden.It was when I was reading a classic novel titled \u2018Love After Marriage between the Demon King and the Hero\u2019 that I found on the bookshelf.I heard the rustling sound of cloth. I immediately put the book down and went to the bedroom.It was as expected. He sat with his upper body upright.\u201cAre you awake?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven after a long time, there was no answer, so I was worried about his condition.I dragged a chair to the side of the bed and sat down. The moment I faced him up close, I was a little startled.His sea-blue eyes were horribly empty.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI realized it again when I saw him expressionless, speechless, and emotionless.The main character of episode 17 was very tired and broken.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The growth is already slow, but the power that was there has disappeared.\u2018That\u2019s one sweet potato I\u2019ve never imagined!\u2019[\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 likes it because the dry sensibility of the original was kept.][\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 clicks his tongue saying the wrong guy ate the nerf.][\u2018The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials\u2019 says this is a reset beyond what a nerf can do.]Then, after finishing his meal, Thesilid got up from the bed.\u201cIf you move suddenly\u2026well, you walk well.\u201dHe went out of the bedroom and slowly looked around as if exploring the inside of the house. I and Agnes observed him doing so.He put the bowl of soup he ate in the kitchen and went to the table.There, there was a novel book \u2018Love After Marriage between the Demon King and the Hero\u2019 that I was reading just before.Slip.Thesilid showed interest in the book and turned the pages. But after a while, he frowned slightly and put it down.<What? How much fun is that!>Agnes trembled at the humiliation that her tastes were not respected.It was then that Thesilid found the bookshelf and began to pick out books that fit his taste. His pick was\u2026\u2026<A fairy tale book?>Thesilid sat on the floor, pulled out all the picture books, and began to flip through them slowly.I hoped this was not the case\u2026\u2026While I was in heavy silence, Agnes spoke out of absurdity.<Oh, my god, he\u2019s in no position to ignore other people\u2019s tastes.>\u201cAgnes, that\u2019s not it.\u201d<Huh?>I kept my eyes on Thesilid and continued.\u201cHe\u2019s lost the language and he\u2019s trying to learn it again.\u201d<\u2026\u2026>The sea-blue eyes that skimmed the pictures and letters in the children\u2019s book were infinitely inorganic. It was like a scanning machine.By the time he read the tenth book of fairy tales, a strange gleam flashed in his eyes in a circle. That was the moment.Tip tip.This time it wasn\u2019t tears, it was a nosebleed.\u201cThesilid!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I think that was my name.\u201dA calm voice echoed through the air. While I paused, Thesilid opened another children\u2019s book.It was a scene where animals sat around a large tree stump and ate.\u201cThank you. It was delicious.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis kind smile made my stomach sting for some reason.He hasn\u2019t changed. Even when the world was so harsh to him, his goodness was still the same.His hand turned the pages of the fairy tale book a little further. It was a scene where a squirrel and a rabbit greeted each other.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYes, that\u2019s the question I expected.Each episode was short-lived, however, he lost decades of time until the 17th round.I wasn\u2019t even in the world he lived in. My existence would be completely erased in the other episodes.[\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 says that it would have been good for his mental health to forget about it.]As my silence grew longer, his sea-blue eyes narrowed slightly. He seemed a little embarrassed as to whether he was asking a question he shouldn\u2019t have asked.It\u2019s okay if you can\u2019t remember\u201cEllet. Ellet Rodellaine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026It sounds like a name I\u2019ve heard. Have we ever met?\u201dSuddenly, another storybook was opened. On the page I glanced at, the wolf gentleman was playing a trick on the naive lamb lady.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThesilid hurriedly closed the children\u2019s book.\u201cConversation, a little later.\u201dHe arranged the picture books on the bookshelf and pulled out other books.\u2720For a few days, Thesilid spent time devouring books.He pulled out books one at a time, from top to bottom and from left to right of the bookshelf, without choosing according to his taste. He didn\u2019t even seem to read the content. His eyes quickly rolled from side to side, scanning only the letters.Truly like a machine.It didn\u2019t feel good to see him silently working on his own language rehabilitation training without anyone\u2019s help. Even more so, as he occasionally had a nosebleed but never stopped reading.<But is aphasia usually treated like that?>\u201cIt\u2019s unusual.\u201dI asked Thesilid out of curiosity. Having considerably recovered his language skills thanks to his efforts, he said:\u201cIt\u2019s not a condition worthy of being called aphasia. I simply forgot the words and now I\u2019m working on bringing knowledge back from my memory.\u201dI don\u2019t know what he was talking about, but I pretended to understand. Because other things were more important.\u201cBut why are you using honorifics?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I originally use honorifics?\u201d\u201cYes, but you didn\u2019t use them with me. It\u2019s very awkward.\u201d\u201cI see. I won\u2019t use it anymore.\u201dHe changed to informal speech in a second.<He must have forgotten everything about you.>After that, I let him read again to his heart\u2019s content. There were three little things I learned about Thesilid while observing him.The first was that a handsome man was handsome even with double nosebleeds, the second was that he was very common-sensed and exemplary, and the third was that he didn\u2019t like the dark very much.The first one is something that everyone knows. Pass. The second, I found out because he was sneaking around as if he was trying to do the dishes, cleaning after eating, and even weeding.Indeed, as soon as he got out of bed the first thing he did was clean up the soup bowl he had used.Finally, and thirdly, I realized that he slept at night by looking at the moonlight, candles, or nightlights that were shining.[\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 is surprised that there was no such detailed setting in the original.]I was curious too. I thought I knew the main character well.It had been the third day since Thesilid had awakened. As I was arranging the harvested herbs on the table, Thesilid approached me.For some reason, he spoke first.\u201cI remember. Ellet Rodellaine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDescent.\u201dEven the subject used was unusual.Glancing at him, there was no longer a book in his hand.I paid attention again to the trim of the herb and happily replied.\u201cI\u2019m glad you remember me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing. You seem to save me every time we meet. How many times does this make? Third time?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cRight. Three times.\u201dThe way he recited the numbers was plain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The half-exposed side was so distorted I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was smiling or crying.Somehow, I feel like I\u2019ve seen something I shouldn\u2019t have.

It was bittersweet, but it even made me laugh.He was like a sweet potato that grew up eating a lot of sunlight, this potato might have high sugar content.\u201cDo you know how to restore power?\u201dTo my question, Thesilid rolled up his left wrist and showed it to me. There was a mark that seemed to have several layers of black lines wrapped over his white stigma.It looked as if they were tied together like barbed wire.<That\u2019s a forbidden seal of power. It\u2019s holding down the Holy Power and Aura.>Thesilid continued without a doubt that I would have recognized it.\u201cThe way to solve the ban is usually good deeds.\u201d\u201cHow did this happen?\u201dThere was no such thing in the original.\u201cI had some bad thoughts for a while.\u201dThesilid avoided the details by making a rough pass.\u201cBy the way, what about Ellet? Are you going back to Count Gillette now?\u201dNo, I\u2019m going to follow you.Of course, saying this would sound like a stalker.Thesilid took the initiative and slightly choose the words he would say.\u201cAre you traveling by any chance?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, you haven\u2019t been ordained a priest yet.\u201dHm? If you are starting with that\u2026don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s\u2026?\u201cIf you want to work as a healer while traveling, it would be better to put your name on the list of the denomination. I will prove your identity, so how about if you accompany me to The Vatican? I\u2019m going to go around a little bit first.\u201dOh, I didn\u2019t expect it, but he really suggested it first. What is this sleek dialogue compared to his old-dry talking skills? Is this Thesilid Argent?As I squinted my eyes, Thesilid added words, seemingly misunderstanding my reaction.\u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I\u2019m weak right now and I need someone\u2019s protection. It could be said that it\u2019s a relationship to use each other.\u201dFor use\u2026\u2026It\u2019s a word that really doesn\u2019t fit him.\u201cOk, fine.\u201d[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 finds it uncomfortable to register with other people\u2019s denominations no matter how nominal.]\u2018I can not help it. Just think of it as getting a license.\u2019After appeasing World God, I asked Thesilid.\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t go to The Vatican right away. Where are you going?\u201d\u201cFirst of all\u2026\u201dHe smiled. The plan that followed was to my liking.\u201cLet\u2019s go make money for traveling expenses.\u201dChapter 18. The Returnee and The Transmigrator\u201cI want to live a good life this time.\u201dIt was something that came out in the middle of the story. I don\u2019t remember very well, but in the shared coach, Thesilid expressed his aspirations like that.\u201cYou\u2019re going to be nicer than you already are?\u201d\u201cThank you for thinking highly of me.\u201d\u201cIs there anything else you want to do?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dHis side face dyed in the sunset light was as beautiful as a sculpture. But his sea-blue eyes were empty, and his light smile was inert without emotion.He continued, looking as if he would disappear at any moment.\u201cIf you help me, I might think about it.\u201dThe tone of voice that has no enthusiasm at all conveyed his sincerity.He doesn\u2019t need anyone\u2019s help. Because all those who helped him had a bad end.\u2720In any world, there are people who want to make a living through illegal acts rather than proper labor.The Hegelix Mountains and the Panabel Forest form the border between the Holy Country of Elpenheim and the Republic of Ragneif.The bandits who settled there were just like that.While waiting at the roadside, they robbed travelers who had no money to buy a teleport stone and even used a village in a mountain valley as their base to dig a trap to lure travelers out.Thesilid and I were currently searching for the hideout of these bandits and smashing them down one by one.\u201cHiic! Monster\u2026\u2026it\u2019s a monster!\u201d\u201cWatch out for the pink-haired girl!\u201d\u201cSa-save me! Guaaha!\u201dAt this point in time, they were still people who made hideouts in caves like primitive humans.As expected, the collection of gold and silver treasures was scarce. If they had collected it well, they would have moved from this hideout.While I was picking up the travel expenses, an emotional voice came from the side.\u201cThank you! Thank you very much, knight! You saved my life!\u201d\u201cAh, knight! How to repay this kindness!\u201d\u201cSobbing! I was so scared, knight!\u201dIt was Thesilid\u2019s responsibility to free the hostages. The eyes of the female hostages chanting Sir knight were dazzling.After all, the most handsome man in the world was popular wherever he went. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s nothing better to add the benevolent tag than a situation of rescuing hostages like now.[\u2018The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials\u2019 is satisfied with the specialized buff for a harem.]It\u2019s something we\u2019ll have to see more often in the future. Let\u2019s get used to it.Thesilid, who I had long thought would soothe women by exercising his chivalry spirit, came to me unexpectedly quickly.\u201cYou worked hard, Ellet. You were the one who cleared out the thieves, but I\u2019m sorry that I was the only one who got thanked.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cNext time, let\u2019s go to the bandits with many male hostages.\u201d\u201cWhat, why\u2026\u2026 \u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cNo, I like it.\u201dHonesty is a virtue, of course.[\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 asks if you are pursuing a reverse harem?]No. I just thought it would be better than watching the Pushover Free Pass manage his fishing grounds.We handed over the bandits to the guards nearby and moved on. Thesilid walked the mountain path on foot towards the place where the destination was chosen.I asked.\u201cWhat do you think? Do you think the ban loosened up a bit?\u201d\u201cAll I did was free the hostages, so it\u2019s insignificant.\u201dIt is not effective to do good deeds without strength.There\u2019s no way I can\u2019t feel what Thesilid was thinking.He rolled up his wrists and lowered his eyes. A look of concern crossed his face as he stared at the stab-like marks that covered his stigma.\u201cEllet, what is the best good deed that a powerless person can do?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I think you know the answer, but I don\u2019t want to answer.\u201d\u201cRight, it\u2019s a sacrifice.\u201dDude.Thesilid continued his words as if reciting them.\u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t work, so I think I should do something close to dying and barely surviving.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a joke.\u201dI know it\u2019s not, this sweet potato.\u201cCome this way, Ellet.\u201dIt took half a day to arrive at a village deep in the mountains. Shabby wooden houses could be seen in the background filled with rice paddies and fields.As the sun was still shining, everyone was busy with important labor.The images of the women plowing the fields and caring for the livestock was peaceful and quiet. But men were not seen.Nefiro Village. It was one of the main stages at the beginning of the original work.\u201cDo you have any plans?\u201dThesilid smiled at my straightforward question.\u201cLooking at your direct question, you seem to know what kind of village our destination is.\u201d\u201cYes, roughly.\u201dA mysterious village where a young man disappears whenever he steps in.On the surface, it was kidnapping and trafficking by a huge band of robbers, but in reality, there was something behind the simple gang of evildoers.\u201cYou saved me the trouble of explaining.\u201dThis smile looked a little happy.\u201cI am not currently dispatched by order of the denomination. In a way, it\u2019s a situation where I\u2019m out on an unauthorized mission. I wish we could go quickly.\u201d\u201cEfficiency? It\u2019s my favorite.\u201d\u201cI thought you would like it.\u201dWe continued talking a little more about the plan.At that time, the woman in the nearest field was horrified to see us. She came this way, savagely grabbing the dup-up potatoes in her hands.\u201cWh-why did you come here?! Get out of here! You can\u2019t come into this town!\u201dAlthough she shouted with a shrill voice, the eyes that kept looking around were very anxious.\u201cWhat are you doing? Go on already! It\u2019s dangerous to be here\u2026\u2026!\u201dThat was then.\u201cHey, traveler?\u201d\u201cOh my!\u201dA middle-aged man with a virtuous and benevolent impression suddenly intervened. The village woman was surprised enough to drop her potatoes.\u201cCh-Chief\u2026\u2026\u201dThe village chief said with a friendly smile.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen travelers to a town like this. Nice to meet you. Oh, Leah. Grandma Phoebe was looking for you, so go ahead.\u201d\u201cWhat? Y-Y-Yes, Chief.\u201dShe left with a terrified look on her face. Still, she looked back at me and Thesilid several times.It\u2019s just a very dubious sight to see. It\u2019s a situation where you have no choice but to be vigilant and suspicious.\u201cAre you the Chief? Greetings. I\u2019m Thesilid Argent. This is Ellet Rodellaine.\u201d\u201cHello, Chief. I think the sun will set soon. If you know about a good inn, would you recommend it?\u201dHere we are, the Returnee and the Transmigrator.\u201cHoo? You mean, you need a place to stay\u2026\u2026?\u201dHis eyes widened, revealing his wretched pupils. These were the eyes of a cat that has found its prey.\u201cYes!\u201dThis is the village of Nefiro, where there is a gang of bandits and a two-face village chief.It was the stage of a monumental episode that gave the main character the nickname \u201cPushover Free Pass\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We\u2019re short of one tribute!\u201d\u201cMy god, I\u2019ll be damned! There are only a few hours left! I don\u2019t want to die, boss!\u201dAs a result, the village chief, who was virtuous and kind, revealed his original character.\u201cShut up your snout! I told you to call me Chief in the village!\u201d\u201cSo-sorry!\u201dAlthough it is an area where it was difficult to see men, there were dozens of them in Conkill\u2019s house.They were the elite members of the bandit gang \u2018Ducks and Drakes\u2019. The remaining personnel was stationed in a hideout that has recently moved deep into the mountains.(Note: The original name is \ubd88\uc218\uc81c\ube44, Bulsujebi. Translated as \u2018Ducks and Drakes\u2019\u00a0also known as a game of throwing flat stones so that they skim along the surface of the water. Popular name, Skipping Stones. The link goes on to explain what it means. The more you know!)Ducks and Drakes were a gang that had never been subjugated and maintained its legacy until the third generation. Thanks to this, they were able to increase their power large enough to dominate the Hegelix Mountains.But now these rugged men were trembling with fear.\u201cWe need to quickly fill in the one that\u2019s missing! We don\u2019t have time!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ll all die if we don\u2019t give it or if we don\u2019t have enough numbers!\u201d\u201cN-no! I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d\u201cI want to see Mom! Guhhh!\u201dJust around the time squeaking noises began to be heard, a bearded thief scrambled out.\u201cThat\u2019s why I told you to move out from there while we were alive! It was not a good place to begin with! What kind of hideout is made in a dungeon?\u201d\u201cShut up, you ignorant bastard! How do you get rid of the place you inherited from your predecessors?! Thanks to that, we\u2019ve been able to avoid search and subjugation with success, just because the situation gets a little bad why do you start to talk nonsense?!\u201d\u201cThis is not just a bad situation!\u201dThe large thief huffed and puffed taking off his hood as if tossing it on the ground. On his exposed forehead, a wing-shaped stigma radiated a mysterious red light.It was a sign of being a slave to an S-class boss.It was nice to use an empty dungeon as a hiding place to avoid search networks while catching money and riches as if eating a piece of cake.But they didn\u2019t know one thing. A new owner is bound to appear in any dungeon that was left open for a long time without a proper heir!Their nightmare began when a huge egg hatched from the crater of an extinct volcano.\u2013 You are my slaves from now on. If you don\u2019t want your brain to melt and die, then once a month offer ten young men!One month was based on the dungeon and on the outside world, it was a week.In order to survive, The Ducks and Drakes diligently abducted and sacrificed villagers and travelers. The fate of the men who became tribute was cruel. If it was not to \u2018It\u2019s\u2019 taste, they were eaten on the spot, and even if the men were to \u2018It\u2019s\u2019 taste, they suffered a terrible disgrace.To the point where the majority of men would rather beg to be killed.Of course, it was none of the thieves\u2019 problems. It\u2019s all about making ends meet. What can they do?\u2018It\u2019s a sin to be weak! Who told you to be born weak? Or, if you had enough money, you can cross the mountain range with a teleport stone!\u2019But recently there has been a problem. Rumors of the kidnapping began to spread and the number of travelers passing by dried up.To make matters worse, scary rumors were circulating among the bandits. What kind of Sword Master is attacking the entire mountain range and wiping out the bandits?After the dungeon had a new owner, The Ducks and Drakes moved their hideout to an ordinary cave. This means that they came to an easy-to-detect location. For the time being, they also had to take care to not get caught by the Sword Master.\u2018Damn it. Why would a Sword Master come and rob weak bandits for nothing!\u2019Cornkill felt like he was going to be bald from stress.\u201cThere are no more men in the village to catch, what are we going to do now, boss?! If you become a boss, take responsibility!\u201dHe was already getting annoyed, but the young man was striking his nerves. It was time to show the dignity of the boss.\u201cHey, catch that bastard. Fill in the tribute numbers with that punk.\u201d\u201cWh-what\u2026 \u2026 !\u201d\u201cOkay, boss! Tie him up!\u201d\u201cHng?! Whoopm!\u201dThere is no loyalty between thieves.As if they had been waiting for such orders inside their hearts, the others rushed in, tightly tied the scapegoat, and put him on a cart at the back of the house.\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m barely surviving this week. Let\u2019s move to the hideout.\u2026what?\u201dCornkill\u2019s eyes suddenly widened as he was giving the instructions. Because he saw something amazing through the window.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026!\u201dA handsome man with silvery brilliant hair and an even more dazzling face was walking into town!Cornkill exclaimed in disbelief.\u201cTribute! The tribute came on its own feet!\u201d\u201cOoooooooh!\u201dUpon closer inspection, there were two people entering the village. One woman and one man, both were very beautiful.It was a special product in the eyes of Cornkill, who had done some human trafficking in his past years.Cornkill tried to gauge the strength of the two strangers.\u201cNeither of them has weapons. They are not even wearing a priest\u2019s uniform.\u201d\u201cMaybe magic?\u201d\u201cNo, if you know how to handle any of the three powers in the first place, you wouldn\u2019t walk by foot over the Hegelix Mountains.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They would have made some money to buy a teleport stone!\u201d\u201cYes, so they must be poor travelers!\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cHmph! Whoopmmm!\u201dIt was a very subjective and hopeful judgment. But the bandits applauded and chanted false accusations.Cornkill smiled wickedly as he looked at the two travelers.\u201cHehe, don\u2019t blame me too much. This side is also trying to make ends meet.\u201dIf you feel wronged, be born strong or rich in your next life.With the usual rationalization he always did, Cornkill got up from his seat like a boss.\u201cRelease the guy who was tied up and loaded earlier onto the cart. Say it was a joke.\u201d\u201cYes! We\u2019ll follow your orders and then we\u2019ll be hiding.\u201d\u201cCheer up, boss!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Chief damn it!\u201dCornkill screamed and ran out of the house.Catching travelers was his specialty.It was enough to pretend to be a humble person from the countryside, let them stay overnight at the village chief\u2019s house, and then feed them food with plenty of sleeping pills.Occasionally, there were travelers who were wary and refused the provided room and board, but if he gets all emotional and shed crocodile tears while talking about a dead son, they would all fall over.This time, it was even easier for the kitties who walked in on their own because they were naive and ignorant of the world.They were happy to hear that he would put them to sleep in his house because there was no inn in the village, and drank honey milk with sleeping pills well.It was very smooth to carry the sleeping ones on the cart and move them to a mountain hideout.The bandits, including Cornkill, were excited and chattered throughout the journey.\u201cLet\u2019s put the guy in as a tribute as planned and since the girl is pretty, so she will cook and do laundry in the new hideout. It was a mess because there weren\u2019t any women, this is great!\u201d\u201cOh! As expected of the boss! You are wise.\u201d\u201cI will teach her how to cook!\u201d\u201cHeehee! I\u2019ll teach her laundry!\u201d\u201cWhen you guys scream and the girl cries I\u2019ll comfort her!\u201d\u201cWow, the boss knows something!\u201dThe winding mountain road was filled with mean laughter.In a good mood, the rotten Cornkill, who was so dirty that other insidious men looked cute, shouted.\u201cI\u2019m in a good mood! Let\u2019s have a drinking party at the hideout after work!\u201d\u201cWow! Boss is the best!\u201dHowever, this promise could not be fulfilled, for their smoothness ended the moment the cart arrived at the hideout.Screeching.\u201cWe are here. Everyone, get off with the luggage!\u201d\u201cReally? Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hm?\u201dThe boss gave orders to his subordinates, but a woman\u2019s cold voice stuck in his ears. And.Kwagwagwagwang!The cart shattered into pieces and his body floated in the air.\u2018What? What happened?\u2019Unable to find an answer, he plunged to the floor.Thud!\u201cCough!\u201dPerhaps because it was the middle of the night, the stars were shining in front of him. He managed to get up and open his eyes.Then what he saw was pandemonium.Bang! Aww! Quarreung!\u201cAwwww!\u201d\u201cKu-gha!\u201dThe hard-earned hideout broke, cracked, and exploded in the midst of a lot of chaos. The men who came with him screamed and were thrown everywhere. The personnel waiting in the hideout heard the commotion and ran out, but they could not wield the weapon properly even once and were thrown around all the same.\u201cWh-wh-what happened\u2026\u2026\u201dAt that moment, a cold white light flashed in the cloud of dust. It was after images of swordsmanship.Patch, patch.A silhouette walked out of the muddy field at a leisurely pace. The moonlight illuminated the face.It was the pink-haired woman who had been soundly sleeping in the cart just a while ago.\u201cThank you for the ride. Thanks to you, I saved the trouble of finding the hideouts.\u201dSaaaah.The blade of the sword she was holding shone stronger.\u201cHi-Hiiic! I-It came!\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s the S-Sword Master!\u201dThe terrified scream of his subordinates helped him understand the situation. Cornkill stuttered open his mouth.\u201cDo-Don\u2019t tell me that\u2026\u2026th-th-the sword master who is said to be clearing out bandits these days\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes. It sounds like me.\u201dCornkill knew his fate.I\u2019m screwed!Kwaang!White aura flew here and there and crashed.Although they were the two outsiders whom the bandits had looked down on, the woman was never to be taken lightly.Not only she was able to freely handle Aura Sword, but she also used Aura Blade, she would at least be of expert level in terms of handling technique.\u201cHic!\u201d\u201cKuk!\u201dThe bandits were terrified.In their foolish minds, the delusions of food and clean clothes provided by a beautiful woman evaporated in an instant.\u201cSi-sister, d-don\u2019t do this, let\u2019s talk\u2026\u2026Cuckoo!\u201d\u201cSa- save me! I just did what I was told\u2026\u2026Kook!\u201d\u201cYou guys are too weak to use swords.\u201dWhoops! Puck puck!\u201cGuaaaa!\u201dThose who were trying to get away with bullshit were thoroughly stepped on, little by little.\u201cHey! It\u2019s a monster! W-We must run away!\u201d\u201cWhere do you think you are going? Not a chance.\u201dThose who run away were tied with the Spirit King\u2019s Harp String and dragged back.Whoops! Puck puck peck! Puck puck peck!\u201cKguh\u2026\u2026ugh\u2026\u2026\u201dThey were gently beaten up until foam was spewed from their mouth.\u201cHu-Huk\u2026.\u201dCornkill, who had been unable to move since the first time he flew and landed on the muddy floor, had to watch all of this from a first-seat position.\u201cOh, dear lord.\u201dThe venerable bandit group, which has maintained its legacy for three generations, was destroyed by only one person. It was terrifying.Then a shadow fell over Conrkill\u2019s head.\u201cHuh?\u201dFrom where he looked up, a silver-haired young man was looking down at Cornkill.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe silver hair shone like the moonlight and the beautiful face was gentle and holy. But why?\u201cH-Hik!\u201dThe sea-blue eyes that faced him were deep like an abyss, instigating his fear.\u201cShh.\u201dThesilid, who lowered his pose, only rolled his eyes and looked to the side where Ellet was. Making sure he was in her blind spot, he reached his hand.\u201cKaaah-ghuo!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you very much\u2026!\u201d\u201cI will never forget the grace you showed for saving us. Hic\u2026\u201dAs desired, I received many thanks from the male hostages.With this, it seems that the hideout has been cleaned up. As I was shaking my hands, Thesilid approached.\u201cEllet, I think you should see this.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs I left the cave prison, I saw thieves who had been tied in groups of three and five with the harp string of the king of spirits.They were on the verge of death.\u201cI don\u2019t want to die! I don\u2019t want to die! Aww!\u201d\u201cHot, hot! Help me! Aghhhh!\u201dThe skin surface was burning around the red mark on their forehead.<What? What happened?>\u201cThe time has come.\u201dI gave a short answer to the puzzled Agnes. Thankfully, Thesilid gave me a more detailed explanation.\u201cThe original hideout of The Ducks and Drakes was inside a dungeon without an owner. But not long ago, an S-class boss was born and claimed the seat of the new owner, and they were branded as slaves.\u201d<Self-delivered karma. So what exactly did the boss tell them to do?>\u201cIf you don\u2019t sacrifice ten men a week in the time of the human world, your head will burn to death.\u201d<Only men?>\u201cThe reason why only men are accepted as sacrifices is\u2026\u2026because the boss is the Queen Harpy. For a more detailed explanation\u2026\u2026well, I don\u2019t want to say it myself.\u201d<Ah, I know. It is said that half-human half-bird harpies are only female, so they use human males to breed. Conversely, there were other individuals that used human women to do the same, but what was it? I can\u2019t seem to remember which ones.>\u201c\u2026\u2026Orcs are the counterparts.\u201d<Yes, Orc.>At first glance, the two seem to be talking, but they were not. Thesilid cannot detect Agnes\u2019 presence.I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s even kind to an invisible being. What a great specimen of a knight\u2019s manners.I quietly approached the dying bandits. The light of divine power drifted in my hand. Thesilid and Agnes, who had an intuition at what I was going to do, said one by one as if they were surprised.\u201cEllet, don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026\u201d<They are trash that doesn\u2019t even deserve a calm death, but you want to save them?>Removing the stigma by using an ultimate skill is no burden at all. But I wasn\u2019t the kind of person who did fair deeds to trash either.Good deeds for the sake of is not even hypocrisy. It\u2019s evil.I looked back at the two of them and smiled.\u201cDo you think I would?\u201dContrary to my words, a healing light poured from my hand. The tanned skin was restored and the red stigma disappeared. The thieves who were rescued from the claws of near death had tears in their eyes.\u201cI-I lived\u2026.\u201d\u201cTh-thank you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have nothing to be thankful for.\u201dPainful screams could still be heard around. Because I only saved ten people.The number ten had a specific meaning.\u201cAww!\u201dThe bodies of the thieves were wrapped around with The Spirit King\u2019s Harp String and stitched together. Like dried yellow Corvina.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go see the Harpy Queen.\u201d\u201cHiiiic!\u201d\u201cNooo!\u201dThe bandits who understood my intentions cried out.\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I will never do that again!\u201d\u201cPlease forgive me! Anything but dragging me to the Harpy Queen, please\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather you kill me!That\u2019s why putting yourself in someone else\u2019s shoes is so important. Aren\u2019t they finally shedding tears and having runny noses of regret only when they are made to be sacrificed as tributes themselves?I smiled kindly and showed mercy.\u201cDon\u2019t give up. If you hold out until I catch the boss, you can live.\u201d\u201cNoooo!\u201d\u201cArghhhh!\u201dOops, I forgot to switch off my killing intent because they were so contemptuous.Pulling the rope, no, The Spirit King\u2019s Harp String, I looked back at Thesilid.At that moment, he was staring at me.\u201cLet\u2019s get in, Terry!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cTerry?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dIt was as if he had been dazed and then came to his senses.\u201cThe dungeon is this way.\u201dThesilid smiled and took the lead. Somehow I thought he looked happy for some reason.The entrance to the dungeon was located deep in the cave and was used as a prison. At the end of the road, the gate opened its wide mouth.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cSave me\u2026kwah!\u201dI pushed the thieves into it first, and put one foot forward inside. Then held out one hand towards Thesilid.\u201cCome on.\u201dIt\u2019s a way to escort a gentleman I learned from my mother.\u201c\u2026\u2026I\u2019m openly being treated like an underdog.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that you are weak now. Anyway, catch it, gentlemen.\u201dThesilid no longer complained and took my hand.As usual, the field of vision was surrealistically squashed and then opened again, changing into a new environment.[<System> You have entered the S-level dungeon \u2018Hatching Nest\u2019.]A field-type dungeon with a rugged mountainous area. Half-human and half-harpy beasts flew around the mountain peak.Kieee, kiee kiee!Kieee, kiee kiee!The thieves were astonished at the number, which was reminiscent of a flock of migratory birds.\u201cHey, what are all those things? Why are there so many!\u201d\u201cI-It wasn\u2019t like this when I came here before! What happened!\u201dAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know?\u201cLooks like the Harpy Queen\u2019s eggs just hatched. It\u2019s all thanks to your hard work.\u201d\u201cArgggh!\u201dA month is enough time for freshly hatched harpies to grow into adults.Beasts have a strong instinct for slaughter and breeding, especially the Harpy. The next expected situation was obvious.Kyaaaah!Kyaaa! Kyaaa!Harpies flew this way, howling as if they were excited. And\u2026Swish! Whik!\u201cSa-save me! Argh!\u201d\u201cN-Nooo! I hate it!\u201dOne by one, the bandits were whisked away.It was an instant before the tribute to the Queen was sold out on a first-come, first-served basis.\u201cOh, dear.\u201d<Oh, dear.>After letting out a \u2018sad\u2019 exclamation without an ounce of feelings, Agnes and I explored our surroundings.Among the many mountain peaks, there was one that looked like the top had been cut off. It looked like a crater, just right for a nest.\u201cThat one looks like the Queen\u2019s nest. What do you think of Agnes?\u201d<Yes, I can feel strong energy there.>\u201cTerry, Agnes says is right there.\u201dThesilid, who received the message, said with a very nice and handsome face.\u201cYou must hurry. There must be hostages still alive in the Queen\u2019s nest.\u201d\u201cThe question is, how do we get that far very quickly\u2026\u2026\u201d<How about riding a harpy? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem to ride one if you had the skills to balance the boat when you caught the Undead Ciel, right?>\u201cThere was that way! Ah, if I had known this would happen, I would have grabbed them when the harpies came down to snatch the bandits.\u201dIt was a time when I regretted being a little bit late. Thesilid said as he adjusted the sea-blue eyes.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. There are still things left to lure the harpies.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt just so happens that one is coming over there.\u201dI saw the silhouette of a harpy flying in this direction with its back to the setting sun.But how come it seems bigger than the other harpies?As the distance drew closer, the darkness of the silhouette faded, revealing the harpy as it approached. It had by far the largest size, wings more colorful than a peacock\u2019s tail, and even a Crown worn on the head of a human woman![<System> Dungeon owner, 780th place in the Demon World, \u2018Queen Harpy Pignellis\u2019 has appeared!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We can deal with the boss first and take care of the hostages slowly.I glanced at Serpens\u2019s blade in my hand. The white light added vigor to the blade.

Whirick!\u201cAh.\u201dThesilid let out a soft exclamation.\u201cHuh?\u201d<Huh?>I and Agnes were dazed.Flap! Flap!The Queen finished her business and flew away without any regrets.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMy dazed eyes were fixed on the Queen\u2019s claws.Because Thesilid was hanging there.In other words, the current situation is.\u2018The weak protagonist was kidnapped by the boss!\u2019My face went pale.\u201cTerry!\u201dThe Queen Harpy was so fast that the silhouette was already small and seemed to melt in the sunset.<No, why can\u2019t he avoid that?! Even if he\u2019s empty now it\u2019s a body that went to the expert level!>\u201cI know!\u201dWere his reflexes nerfed, too? If that\u2019s the case, you should have told me in advance!<Ah, anyway, don\u2019t attack first. The altitude is too high.

All right, I decided it\u2019s going to be you.Shiiiiwwww!The Spirit King\u2019s Harp String extended out of my hand and wrapped around the harpy\u2019s neck, legs and wings.Kyeh?\u201cCome down.\u201dKieeeeee!Thud!I poured heals on the harpy who had fallen and was bleeding on the floor. I wrapped the string around its neck to make a rein and got on.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, fly to your mother\u2019s nest.\u201dKyoo!Thanks to the harpy who listened well, I was able to quickly pursue the Queen Harpy.

I jumped off the harpy\u2019s back, which had landed like crazy, and looked around.Colorful eggs laid by the Queen. A wooden prison where weary men were imprisoned.It ran past them to the center of the nest.Thesilid\u2019s silver hair was reflected in my vision. He was in a close face-to-face confrontation with the Queen Harpy.\u201cThesilid, are you alright-!\u201dBy the way.\u201cYou\u2026what\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe scene in front of me was completely different from what I was worried about.\u201cKihihi, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen a pretty male like you.\u201dThe Queen Harpy blushed, as she cozily sat Thesilid on where her five-colored feathers were fluffy.\u201cI won\u2019t force you.

The waiters felt sorry for her, but they heard that she had purchased the after-life insurance full-package, they changed their attitude. lol![FFF-level Physical Skills]: Oh my. Full package. Awesome.[No.1 Hunter\u2019s daughter]: I wonder what she\u2019s doing right now. If you\u2019re watching the chat, please send something![Attention Seeker with Hidden Power]: If she didn\u2019t show up until now, I think she\u2019s just dead. S-class is different. Less than 10% chance of survival.[Cider Pass 381]: A personality that makes people dead because they don\u2019t get attention; where else did that 10% come from?[Attention Seeker with Hidden Power]: ?? It\u2019s true. There are estimated to be at least 10 S-class people, but I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s active in the chat room.[FFF-level Physical Skills]: Huh. So, the only S-class alive now is Mister Hidden Power?[Attention Seeker with Hidden Power]: Y.[FFF-level Physical Skills]: Crazy. Hyung, how about a friend request\u2026\u2026.[Cider Pass 381]: You are proud of making unfounded claims.[Daddy\u2019s Girl]: That\u2019s enough. It\u2019s ugly to see an S-level flipping.The quarrel ended with the victory of the \u2018Attention Seeker with Hidden Power\u2019.A social consensus was made in the chat window not to be rude to a precious ranker. It was then.[Notice]: Congratulations! \u2018Kill Hill\u2019 has accomplished the achievement of \u2018Completing the first SS-level Transmigrator Tutorial of the Transmigration Bureau\u2019!As soon as Ellet received the tutorial reward, the achievement advertisement function hidden in the chat system lit up.[A Successful Fan]: OMG.[Monster Chef]: OMG.[Cider Pass 381]: What.

As expected, this one is a real master.[Tyrant\u2019s Daughter 5]: Mister Hidden Power is suddenly quiet. Hahaha!![Cider Pass 381]: That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t brag. Come over and tell us how you feel about it lololol.

After taking a proper bath after a long time, I was happy to lie down on the bed with a refreshed body.[\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 complains about having separate rooms.]Knock, knock.\u201cEllet, it\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cYes, come in.\u201dI greeted Thesilid while lying down on my back.He was startled as soon as he opened the door but soon spoke as if nothing had happened.\u201cI\u2019m thinking of going to church.\u201d\u201cWhy would you go to church? Do you want to make a confession?\u201dThesilid picked up the blanket hanging from the chair. He opened his mouth only after he showed his dutiful manners to cover my legs exposed under the gown.\u201cSince I have a sinful body, that would be a good thing to do. But not for that purpose.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. You\u2019re trying to get news from the Vatican, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dI couldn\u2019t let the weak protagonist go alone.\u201cLet\u2019s go together. Wait outside for a moment.\u201dI sent Thesilid out and searched my satchel. The clothes I usually wear were washed and laid out, so I\u2019m thinking of wearing other clothes.[\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 shines her eyes asking to wear pretty clothes.][\u2018The World-building God\u2019 hopes you will wear the order\u2019s costume at this time.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 says that one is too much and prefers a beige outing dress.]Since I was going around town anyway, I thought I could wear the clothes Miss Libra had chosen.I went out with a shirt on a slightly Apron-like dress.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Terry.\u201d\u201cIt feels like I should escort you.\u201d\u201cYou, me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhile exploring the village, I walked toward the place where I could see a cross. The church, which we arrived at not long after, was larger than expected.I murmured as I scanned the exterior near the entrance.\u201cIt\u2019s a big one, but since it\u2019s a remote village, I don\u2019t know if there are any church officials who have news about The Vatican.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry about that. Look over there, Ellet.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2026huh.\u201dJust then, I saw a group of people entering through the back door of the church. The white uniform adorned with light blue in a bias cut and gold epaulets was like a symbol of the Holy Knights.Thesilid immediately recognized their affiliation.\u201cThe Knights Templar.\u201d\u201cAh, Templars.\u201dIt was the name of the knights Clovis Argent, Thesilid\u2019s stepbrother, was in charge of. Was his primary mission search for relics?Thesilid pondered for a moment, then said as if he had realized something.\u201cAh, it seems that your existence has not been erased from this episode. Then he will have a hard time finding you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe mission of the Knights Templar is to search for Saints. I think Clovis has been looking for you for about eight years.\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026\u2026\u201dIn the 17th timeline, my existence is recognized by the denomination as a Saint. Therefore, it seems that the role of the Knights Templar has changed with the appearance of a Saint who was not in the original.[\u2018The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials\u2019 tells that since you\u2019ve been stuck in the tower for 8 years, Clovis has never been able to make any progress and was often chastised in the church.][\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 urges you to feel guilty saying that a young man\u2019s career was ruined because of you.][\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 is totally on your side, saying that hiding is not a bad thing because you are considered a heretic over there.][\u2018The World-building God\u2019 It\u2019s ridiculous that you should pretend to be a Saint that belongs to other churches in the first place.]The Critic and World God were right. Besides, I probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to go outside the Count\u2019s Castle because of the tutorial anyway.Thesilid also commented.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel sorry about it. You were twelve when Clovis took on the mission to search for the Saint. At that time, if it were revealed that you were a saint, you would be put under the protection of the Order.\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d\u201cYou would be forcibly separated from your family, and you must have been forced to serve and sacrifice from a young age. Because the duties placed on the name of a Saint are heavy.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u2026Thanks, Terry.\u201d\u201cAll of a sudden?\u201d\u201cThe Commander of the Temple Knights, it\u2019s your older brother.\u201dThere are no real blood relations and they are not really friends, but\u2026\u201cThank you for keeping the secret.\u201d\u201cI just did what I thought was right.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t know how to take credit, that\u2019s why he\u2019s always living at a loss.\u201cThen, what shall we do now? Do you want to contact Knight Commander Clovis?\u201d\u201cNot really because we\u2019re not close.\u201d\u201cDo you even have a close friend?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I have.\u201d\u201cOh, who?\u201d\u201cYou would know. Hestio and Ephael.\u201dAnother amazing fact.Aren\u2019t they friends with who we broke into the boss room together in the toy mansion 10 years ago?At that time, the sandwich that I fed them, with my parents\u2019 heart wishing them to get along with Thesilid, seemed to be still working.Of course, the reason for the surprise lies elsewhere.\u201cAre they assigned to the Knights Templar?\u201d\u201cYes. Look over there.\u201dJust in time, two tall young men with black hair and blond hair were seen walking at the end of the group.A priest with a scruffy face with long black hair in loose braids.A knight with a playful impression, who grew blonde hair just enough to cover the nape of his neck.The images of young boys in my memories were superimposed on their faces.\u201cWow, they\u2019ve grown up. Those two.\u201d[\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 is satisfied with the great visuals.]I\u2019m glad I saved them. The world would have suffered a great loss if it had gone as the original story unfolded.While I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off Hestio and Ephael, Thesilid said thoughtfully.\u201cSo, it would be nice if I could contact them separately. How to call\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh? Terry, look over there. Only the two of them are going to another place alone.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThesilid had a blank face when Hestio and Ephael left the Knights Templar and went down to the semi-basement.<I think they must be going to the private prayer room. The soundproofing there is very good.>Agnes explained the crispy structure of the church. If she knows about it, Thesilid will know, too.\u201cIt\u2019s strange that things are going so well in my life.\u201d\u201cCome on, Terry.\u201dI grabbed his arm and pulled him away so that his thoughts wouldn\u2019t deepen.\u201cBut why are Hestio and Ephael going to the prayer room? They are not very religious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a private space with good sound insulation. Maybe they\u2019re going to take a nap.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible.\u201dThey took advantage of the brief absence of the priest who guarded the prayer room and went inside. There were prayer room doors, both right and left, all the way of the hallway in the semi-basement.It wasn\u2019t particularly difficult to find where Hestio and Ephael were in the dozens of rooms. because.\u201cAh! Thesilid, you pathetic bastard! What if you go in vain like that? Ugh!\u201d\u201cSniff, calm down, Hestio. They will hear everything.\u201d\u201cHey! Yesterday was a friend\u2019s funeral. Do you think I\u2019m going to calm down?! An idiot who went away without leaving so much as a finger behind\u2026\u2026uh huk.\u201dHestio\u2019s weeping voice revealed their location.The noise pollution that causes soundproof walls to shake in places that should be quiet was indeed out of scale.I immediately went to the prayer room there and opened the door.Bump!\u201cExcuse me.\u201dA narrow room with nothing but a cross and a cushionI pushed the Thesilid into it, went in, and closed the door.\u201cOh, my god! What suddenly\u2026\u2026! WHAT?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Wow, Hestio. I must be seeing shit right now. The ghost of a dead Thesilid is right in front of me.\u201d\u201cYou too?\u201dIt\u2019s kind of funny how they blink their wide-open eyes. However, since it was a reunion after a long time, I tried to hold back my laughter and make a good impression.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Hestio, Ephael.\u201d\u201cUh, you, I think I saw you somewhere\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That pink hair\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t completely forgotten. I\u2019m Ellet who was dragged into the toy house with you guys. Would you remember if I told you that I was the one who was going to go to Count Orsche with flowers on my head?\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cAh!\u201dIt\u2019s a satisfactory response. I was so proud of them that I thought I would give them snacks one by one.\u201cThen are you dead too?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHestio, a young black-haired priest, suddenly spoke nonsense.\u201cLooking at you coming with Thesilid, you look dead. What do you think, Ephael?\u201d\u201cYes, Hestio. She must have gone first and guided him back so that we could say our last goodbye to Thesilid\u2019s soul\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHey. I know you\u2019ve come to your senses. Stop it\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dEphael and Hestio meekly nodded their heads and shut their mouths. Thesilid had a very bewildered look on his face.\u201cIsn\u2019t 10 years supposed to be a long time? You guys look so natural.\u201d (Terry)It was the first thing he said after going inside the room.\u201cDid you hear, Hestio?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHe speaks. It\u2019s not a real ghost.\u201d\u201cHey, Thesilid. It\u2019s nice to meet you, but can I hold you by the neck?\u201dOf course, Thesilid\u2019s will didn\u2019t matter. Hestio\u2019s hand immediately grabbed his collar.\u201cThesilid you bastard! If you are alive, you must report to the Vatican that you are alive! What are you doing here?! I didn\u2019t know you were fine, and even left flowers at your funeral yesterday!\u201d\u201cMy funeral is a piece of interesting news. Can you tell me more?\u201dHestio flinched at his calm reply, then looked back at Ephael and asked for an opinion.\u201cDon\u2019t you think this punk\u2019s personality has gotten a little weird?\u201d\u201cI know. Has something changed?\u201dIt\u2019s because he\u2019s a regressor.I decided to gloss over\u2026.\u201cIt\u2019s because he came back from the brink of death.\u201dHestio, convinced by my words, released Thesilid and began to interrogate more calmly.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dThesilid replied.\u201cI almost died because of a dungeon burst, but Ellet here saved me. It hasn\u2019t been long since I came to my senses, so I\u2019m about to return to the Vatican.\u201dWhat was contained in the calm voice was a very refined summary. The horror of being tortured by Reed and the misery of being abandoned by the Knights of Pillar of Light were also filtered out.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dAt that moment, Hestio and Ephael let out a sigh. It felt like they were choosing something to say.I intervened.\u201cWhat did the Vatican announce about Terry\u2019s death?\u201d\u201cThat is\u2026.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201dThesilid needs to know.Hestio, who was exasperated, did not dare to speak and huffed. As if he couldn\u2019t help it, Ephael swept his blonde hair and said to Thesilid.\u201cThey said that you believed in the Holy Sword, went into the dungeon alone, and caused a burst. Of course, we didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA really great sweet potato. I immediately looked at Thesilid.He stayed still with his eyes closed, then spoke a word after a while.\u201cWho?\u201d\u201c\u2026All the Knights of the Pillar of Light.\u201dThe name of the Knights to which Thesilid belongs.The dead don\u2019t speak.The Knights, who had saved their lives by abandoning him, tried to cover up their disgrace throwing it away together with the scapegoat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Meanwhile, Ephael and Hestio exchanged glances at each other while looking at Thesilid like that.They seemed eager to hear what exactly happened in the Dungeon Burst.It was the same with Agnes.<When we rescued Thesilid from the dungeon, there were no sights of the knights from the Order of the Pillar of Light. What happened?>I was conflicted.It\u2019s Thesilid\u2019s business, so it\u2019s right for him to say it himself. However, isn\u2019t it violence to make him say such horrible things out of his own mouth?And one more thing. To be honest, I wondered if he even properly remembered what happened in the dungeon. He is in relatively good shape right now, but there must be a lot of trauma left.I think I\u2019d better step up here.\u201cThe claim of the Knights of The Pillar of Light is not true. Those guys used Thesilid to escape from the Dungeon Burst\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThey threw me away.\u201dA heavy voice cut me off. In the direction to where I turned my head, there was a face with no expression to the point of being inorganic.\u201cTo be more exact. Should I say I was sold?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026He seems to have remembered everything.Gloom was added to the silence. I\u2019m sure the air in here, right now, is heavier than Thesilid\u2019s funeral.Hestio and Ephael did not ask any further questions. Instead.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dThe cautious question did not hide the concern for a close friend.It was truly one of the few healing moments in the life of the protagonist. What would have happened if I hadn\u2019t saved those two?\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI already knew they were like that. There\u2019s nothing to be disappointed about just checking their worst once again.\u201dIt sounded like a self-convincing statement.When the three people, including me, did not answer, Thesilid tried to evoke the atmosphere.\u201cWell, of course they didn\u2019t come to my funeral, did they?\u201dHestio pretended to be absurd and matched the beat.\u201cWould they have the balls to? Those bastards, it\u2019s been a long time since they got a mission and left.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s a shame.\u201dNow, at this point, it\u2019s better to try and predict the flow of the 17th\u00a0Episode, where the fate of the main character has changedThesilid opened his mouth.\u201cWhen I go back, the Vatican will be in a riot.\u201dEphael nodded vigorously.\u201cLet\u2019s turn everything upside down, get back at the bastards of the Pillar of Light, and restore your honor. It will be fun.\u201dHestio suggested a plausible direction.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us to come back together? Even if the Commander is a bystander, he will at least protect you because you are a godson of the Argent family.\u201d\u201cGood idea, but there is a problem.\u201d\u201cWhat problem?\u201d\u201cI lost my strength.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cI have become a civilian because I have neither divine power nor aura. I can\u2019t even take out the holy sword.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Really? How come?\u201d\u201cShock from a near-death experience.\u201dSince \u2018The Commandments\u2019 did not judge \u2018Honesty\u2019, an outspoken lie came out.Thesilid spoke about his plans.\u201cRight now, I feel like the Vatican is in the middle of enemy territory. I can\u2019t show up without power.\u201d\u201cThen isn\u2019t that more reason to go with us? You are weakened.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Ellet has business to do in the Vatican, so I decided to accompany her.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Are you okay with her?\u201dTwo pairs of very unpleasant gazes were fixed on me.It seems that they did not understand the part of the explanation that I was the one who saved Thesilid, who almost died because of the Dungeon Burst.Figured as much. They will only remember me as an alchemist kid, so they would only think of me healing an injured Thesilid with a potion.When I was about to open my mouth to correct the misunderstanding. Suddenly, Thesilid touched my arm as if holding it.Agnes interpreted the meaning.<Keep still.>Shi-. Why?[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 says that it seems to be his taste.]But it soon turned out that it wasn\u2019t a matter of taste.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will recover soon. Rather, where are the Knights Templars going?\u201dEphael replied.\u201cGreenwall Village. We were on our way to what is known as your grave. Rumors are circulating that it was a Saint who closed the Dungeon Burst.\u201dOops.I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t reveal that I was the one who went directly inside the dungeon, found the Thesilid, and killed the Boss.I thanked Thesilid with my eyes. He smiled kindly and finished the talk.\u201cAs expected, we\u2019d better go separately. It\u2019s a place where I was on the brink of death, so I don\u2019t really want to go back.\u201d\u201cOkay\u2026.\u201d\u201cPlease keep it a secret for a while that you have seen me.\u201d\u201cOkay. Take care of yourself.\u201dAfter saying goodbye to the two of them, I and Thesilid quietly left the basement prayer room.\u2720The next day, I resumed traveling with a refreshed body thanks to sleeping well in a good bed.The destination Thesilid pointed out to regain his strength was a village hidden deep in the valley.I didn\u2019t want to stay overnight, so we went the shortest distance and the problematic hiking course continued for a long time.I, who believed in the system map, took the lead and Thesilid looked at me as if he was watching a walking good-luck charm.\u201cYou know the way very well.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because God is guiding me.\u201d\u201cThe places to where I get guided are always either a dead end or a trap. Are we serving the same God?\u201dAbsolutely not.Of course, even as a joke, I did not confess heresy in front of a Heresy Judge.\u201cWell, I can\u2019t compete with a Saint who can use Descent.\u201dHe convinced himself.\u201cCome to think of it, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you use it.\u201d\u201cYou know, if I use it, I will fall ill with a fever. I will be defenseless for two whole days.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t use it if you don\u2019t have someone you can trust with you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cAm I trustworthy?\u201dHold on, why are you throwing a left hook like this?\u2026\u2026But, If you think that I will be surprised, bewildered, or embarrassed, you are mistaken.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t believe me? Shall I use it now?\u201dOn the contrary, Thesilid\u2019s eyes trembled as if he was the one in embarrassment. Then, as if scolding me, he added.\u201cYou think too highly of me.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m looking closely.\u201d\u201cSometimes you talk as if you know me well.\u201dI looked at his expression in case he was offended, but Thesilid was only smiling lightly.\u201cBy the way, can I ask you one question?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDo you know who was trying to kill me in the Dungeon Burst?\u201dThis question was definitely a bit disconcerting.\u2018Newborn Chaos and Evil\u2019The final Last Boss, Reed.His presence in my mind made my mood subside on its own. My answering voice may have reflected my condition.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I see.\u201dThesilid, who I thought was going to ask for something more, bit his mouth. His mind didn\u2019t seem ready enough to hear the detailed story.\u201cWe have arrived, Ellet.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWe stopped in front of a monument that read \u2018Creco Village\u2019.Whishhhh.Caw. Caw.It was the chilly wind and the crows that greeted Thesilid and me.It was a bleak village. Ruins of houses that could be called shabby shacks were seen, and the streets were strewed with people. It was no exaggeration to say that it looked like a slum or plague village. In fact, the condition of the people was not good either.\u201cHa, ha\u2026. I\u2019m going to kill them all. I won\u2019t let them go\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHic, Hun, hic, hic, sniff, sniff, unh, hick\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSa-save me\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to die\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of that wench\u2026\u2026if she wasn\u2019t there\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all over\u2026.\u201dEveryone was talking nonsense, captured by various evil emotions. It looked like a painting of a crazy town.<What the hell happened?>Agnes seemed shocked by the miserable appearance of the village. I opened my mouth.\u201cHave you ever heard of a phenomenon called Dungeon Leak?\u201dThesilid\u2019s gaze touched me and then fell. He seemed used to me muttering to myself while talking to Agnes.<Dungeon Leak?>\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon in which toxic substances from Dungeons leak out. It\u2019s mostly poison and demonic energy.\u201d<Then are the people here mad because of the influence of demonic energy?>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You must be at least an Aura Beginner or have divine power at the level of a Normal Priest to survive. There is a low probability that such strong opponents like that exist in a place like this.\u201d<Wait, then, isn\u2019t this dangerous for Thesilid?>\u201cAh.\u201dThat was a good point. I immediately turned to Thesilid, and he immediately understood the meaning of my gaze.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. If I were affected by something like this, I would have gone crazy long ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a sour and salty answer.Back to the explanation.\u201cIf we close the dungeon to stop the leak of demonic energy, people will be fine soon.\u201d<What is the grade of the dungeon?>\u201cClass A.\u201d<It\u2019s easy. Isn\u2019t that only a fistful for you?>\u201cWell, about that\u2026there are no bosses in this dungeon.\u201d<What? How do you close it when there is no Boss?>Thesilid responded as if he had heard Agnes\u2019s bewildered voice.\u201cNo worries. I can handle the Dungeon here by myself as I only need to complete a simple mission.\u201d<Really? That\u2019s a relief.>\u201cAgnes, don\u2019t believe Thesilid. It\u2019s not that simple.\u201d<\u2026\u2026>Before I could give you a proper explanation, I need to go over a few things.\u201cRemember the words people mumbled at the entrance of the village?\u201d\u2013 Ha, ha\u2026. I\u2019m going to kill them all. I won\u2019t let them go\u2026\u2026The man who glared at everyone who met his eyes, was angry.\u2013 Hic, Hun, hic, hic, sniff, snff, unh, hick\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The woman who was constantly crying while hugging a piece of firewood wrapped in a blanket, was sad.\u2013 Sa-save me\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t want to die\u2026The boy who ripped his hair out in the corner, was terrified.\u2013 It\u2019s because of that wench\u2026\u2026if she wasn\u2019t there\u2026.The young woman who scratched the wooden door with her fingernails, was jealous.-It\u2019s all over\u2026.The grandfather, who looked up at the sky with wide eyes, despaired.\u201c\u2026\u2026There exists a famous box that was sealed with Plague, Death, and Hope.\u201dThe deeper we went into the secluded alleyway, the darker the purple smoke became. Eventually, we arrived at a dead-end alley surrounded by black gates.\u201cThe depths of the Dungeon was full of plagues that are nothing less than poison. Holding out there and finding the box. That\u2019s the way to close the dungeon.\u201dWe went inside the gate. As the environment changed, a great plateau of wasteland unfolded.[<System> You have entered the A-level dungeon \u2018The Bottom of Pandora\u2019.]But there were people who came in before us. They were wearing the same white uniforms we saw yesterday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He used dark-type transcendental magic that activated without casting or chanting, a presence that made people feel like they had to kneel and bow their heads.The black-haired man seemed to be the embodiment of a Demon God.The Knights, who had been overwhelmed, did not dare raise their heads to look at his face.Shivering in that state, they heard the dungeon owner, the \u201cDemon Sculptor,\u201d bow to the man.-I can\u2019t believe the first place \u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019 would award with his presence would be my territory! To honor the glory, I will create and dedicate a work with the fresh ingredients that came in today!The Knights, referred to as fresh ingredients, trembled. Whether they lived or not was already out of the question. It was a matter of how they would die, and looking at the \u2018workpieces\u2019 decorating this dungeon, they could intuit that their death would be terrifying.The spirit of the Knights was completely defeated.They squatted down, making unspeakable sounds like beasts, slapping their faces, hurting themselves, or leaking filth between their legs.\u2013 How you dare to do this in the presence of \u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019!Just when the demon sculptor revealed his true nature in anger.\u2013 It would be better to choose the materials before using them.The voice of the man called \u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019, seemed to shake their souls. It was an unbelievably beautiful voice for an evil being.-Do you want to live?The Knights realized that the man was speaking to them.They reflexively raised their heads, but the man\u2019s face was not visible because he wore a dark-colored mask. There was, however, a feeling of decadency and beauty to the point of being awful.He offered a deal.-If you hand that over to me, I will spare you.In the direction his graceful fingertips pointed to, was the Thesilid argent.In an instant, a vibrant comfort rose in the eyes of the Knights. It was an honest and crude glimmer of hope.Taking advantage of their hesitation, \u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019, Reed, spoke encouraging words. In a very playful tone.-Is it too much to give it away? Then it wouldn\u2019t be bad to sell it.Clink.\u00a0Gold coins matching the number of people rolled on the floor.-Oh my, \u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019. Good ingredients should be paid their price! That\u2019s a great idea!The moment they heard the demon sculptor\u2019s flattery, the knights\u2019 eyes flashed with sharpness.A contract is absolute to a Demon, and a \u2018deal\u2019 is the most basic and simple type of contract, tantamount to a symbolic meaning. In other words, if they picked up the gold coins and handed over the Thesilid, the life of the Knights was guaranteed.So, what did they choose to do?\u2013 I-I\u2019m sorry.\u2013 Pl-please, Thesilid.-Only you! All you have to do is sacrifice!-It\u2019s better than everyone dying!Hope turned into madness.They turned away from Thesilid\u2019s fragile sea-blue eyes and obeyed the demands of evil. With their own hands, they dragged their comrade and offered him to the demon.The hands of \u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019 raked into the silver hair of Thesilid, who was kneeling on the floor.-Lent me a studio. I want to draw a picture.Susususu.\u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019 walked into the room while grabbing his hair. Thesilid\u2019s body, which had forgotten to resist due to the shock, was dragged along.Through the gap in the door of the studio that had not been closed, they could see the man drawing his picture. As a result, red splashed in the atelier, and the sound of the \u2018canvas\u2019 tearing apart reverberated in the air.The Knights turned a blind eye to it.\u2013 \u2018Chaos and Evil\u2019 seems to be excited, so don\u2019t disturb him and get lost.Shortly after, a Burst Gate opened in the dungeon. The knights were also dumped outside of the dungeon mixed with the pouring beasts.The ferocious monsters were engulfed in a destructive instinct, but somehow they did not attack the Knights right next to them. It was only later that they found out that it was because of the existence of the gold coin they dearly held in exchange for selling a companion.Greenwall Village would be devastated, swept away by a black avalanche.They had no intention of worrying about other people\u2019s lives at a time when they barely survived themselves.\u2013 E-Everyone, return!The Knights broke their teleport stones and fled to the Vatican.Captain Gadville and Vice-Captain Lecto were under investigation. They couldn\u2019t directly reveal the fact that they had abandoned a companion and returned with their lives alone.The fact that they had signed a contract with the Demon would be judged as heresy and heresy judgment was worse than death.They had finally survived, how could they walk into hell with their own mouths?So they thought.\u2018Those who survive must live.\u2019Matching their opinions with all the other knights, they put everything on Thesilid.They testified that he believed in the power of the Holy Sword and caused a Burst after entering the dungeon by himself.There was not even a feeble clamor in their conscience. Since Thesilid sacrificed to save the lives of the knights, wouldn\u2019t it be better to build up one more good deed until the end?Rationalizing in that way, what they were doing seemed to be a legitimate action that followed Thesilid\u2019s legacy.And that\u2019s how it went.The denomination did not believe it at first, but the dead did not speak, and the closed dungeon left no evidence.The investigation was over, and Thesilid\u2019s funeral was held. The Knights did not have to attend the funeral because they were given a new mission that had to be dealt with urgently.Everything went smoothly.It can be said that \u2018Strict Order and Goodwill\u2019 provided forgiveness for the suffering knights.It felt like they could make a fresh start and live on.They were determined to live a good life, even the portion of Thesilid, who was sublimely sacrificed.But there was one problem.\u2018Coins\u2026\u2026the Gold coins were never thrown away!\u2019No matter how much they tried to throw away the tokens of the transaction they received from selling Thesilid, the coins always returned to them.It felt like having a nightmare they couldn\u2019t shake off every day.Around the time when their nerves became extremely sensitive because the place they were dispatched for a mission was a crazy village.Something that shouldn\u2019t have happened, happened right before their eyes.\u201cHello, Captain Gadville, Vice-Captain Lecto.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dHe was aliveThesilid Argent.\u2018How?\u2019\u2018Why?\u2019Captain Gadville and Vice-Captain Lecto felt their heads empty.Regardless of their state of panic, Thesilid\u2019s calm voice kept ringing in their ears.\u201cNice to see you again.\u201d\u201cN-Nice?\u201dCaptain Gadville asked back with a pale face.\u201cWhen I opened my eyes, I was alone, deep in the mountains. I couldn\u2019t remember what happened after entering the dungeon, so I blamed myself a lot, wondering if I was the only one who survived. I am glad that everyone is safe.\u201d\u201cMemory\u2026\u2026you don\u2019t remember?\u201dThe same dull light of hope they had in the dungeon dwelled in his eyes.\u201cYes. However, it\u2019s slowly coming back. Do not worry too much.\u201dHe immediately fell into despair.Cold sweat ran down the bodies of all the knights.General Gadville thought.\u2018It\u2019s a big deal. The day he regains his memory and returns to the Vatican\u2026\u2026 Everything we did will be revealed!\u2019Vice-Captain Lecto also thought about it.\u2018If it goes like this, we can\u2019t escape heresy judgment! We\u2019ll be tortured to death in jail! I\u2019m going to die!\u2019So, the thoughts of the two ended up as one.\u2018I must not let Thesilid Argent alive!\u2019Once is difficult, twice is easy, and just in time, this dungeon was perfect for killing stigmata.Because it was a dungeon of plague where a person could not even breathe without the ability to heal.\u2720<Look at how ugly their bloodthirsty is. It\u2019s scary.>\u201cI know, right.\u201d<They got their eyes open to kill, these dogs.>I was watching from a little distance as the Knights surrounded Thesilid.The atmosphere was sharp enough to immediately draw a sword at someone\u2019s signal. However, the knights were still trying to smile, contorting their faces as they firmly believed that they were hiding their true intentions well.<What are you going to do?>\u201cFor now, I\u2019d like to try doing what Thesilid asked me to do.\u201d<Huh\u2026\u2026.>I understand her laugh because that\u2019s how I feel in my heart.Agnes changed the question.<Then what about those knights?>\u201cThe knights.\u201dI grinned.\u201cI can do whatever I want.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that he received an extra from the knights.\u201cEllet.\u201dA handsome man in a crispy uniform called out my name. I searched through the satchel without answering.\u201cTake it.\u201dWhat I brought out were three bottles of healing potions. Only the best ones in terms of effectiveness.\u201cI have enough with me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary.\u201dI have no choice but to show off a Transmigrator\u2019s knowledge.\u201cWhat do you mean not necessary? Even if you are lucky enough to have recovered your strength to the level of a beginner, you can only survive in the depths of this dungeon for less than 20 minutes. Drink it when you need to.\u201d\u201cThen I will be grateful.\u201dSmall potion flasks were captured in his arms.\u201cSeeing that you are taking care of things like these, are you going to follow my plan?\u201dBefore I knew it, a ridiculous request was planned. I didn\u2019t like it though.\u201cYes.\u201dYet, I didn\u2019t complain.Yes, do whatever you want, our Push Over Free Pass. Wasn\u2019t that what I transmigrated to see? Sigh.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cIf you are grateful, will you also listen to one request of mine?\u201d\u201cAnything, if I can do it.\u201d\u201cEven if this episode is particularly difficult, let\u2019s not give up.\u201dThesilid looked as if he had heard something he had never thought about.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. I really enjoy this episode.\u201d\u201cAre you happy?\u201d\u201cThanks to you.\u201dWhoa, that\u2019s another fantastic thing to say.[\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 is fluttering, saying that a strange mood has just flowed between you two.]It was good to be able to motivate a returnee suffering from burnout syndrome.Before we could have a more heartwarming conversation, hierarchical culture hindered the talk.\u201cSir Thesilid, return to your seat. Start marching.\u201dA man in his late twenties, with brown hair tied back like a horsetail, ordered so in a cold voice. Did he say his name was Vice-Captain Lecto?Thesilid returned to the group after being silent. He seems to be standing side by side with a guy named Captain Gadville in the front.Now, the problem was how to manage the weak alchemist, who was left alone after Thesilid, who was in her party, returned to the Knights Order.Vice-Captain Lecto said to me.\u201cI\u2019m Lecto Poid, the Vice-captain of the Order of The Pillars of Light. I heard from Thesilid that you are an alchemist, but what is your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is Ellet Rodellaine. Nice to meet you, Sir Lecto.\u201d\u201cI will accompany Miss Ellet and take care of you. Because of the rules of the knights, we ask for your understanding that we separated you from Thesilid.\u201dAs expected.I made up a face that seemed to be greatly relieved.\u201cThank you very much, Vice-Captain. When Thesilid returned to the knights, I thought I would be left alone, but I am relieved that the Vice-Captain is with me.\u201d\u201cHaha, you were worried for no reason. No knight would leave a lady in a dangerous dungeon.\u201d<Pretending to be a knight. Let\u2019s give this trash twice back.>\u201cOh, I see!\u201dThe Knights began to move. Me and Vice-Captain Lecto followed from behind.Not even a single grass grew on the land filled with disease and poison that leaked from underground.Still, there was no energy of plague in the breathing air so far.While I was walking through the wasteland of the plateau where only stones were kicked at my feet, Vice-Captain Lecto questioned me.\u201cExcuse me Miss Ellet, but what is your relationship with Thesilid?\u201d\u201cA benefactor. I took care of him when he was down.\u201d\u201cThe injury must have been considerable, could it be cured with only potions?\u201dA stupid gap. What if I ask back how he knows that Thesilid was seriously injured?\u201cHe was not that badly injured thought?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere were no injuries. He just seemed to have no energy, so I helped him eat well and rest well. It\u2019s very unusual to want to repay such simple favor. Are all paladins like that?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean with he didn\u2019t get hurt that much? \u2026. Don\u2019t tell me, the Saint\u2026\u2026?\u201dVice-Leader Lecto accepted my lies by linking the information that the Vatican had to what I told him about. But he never doubted my identity. Because no one on the knights could recognize my status.He came to his senses and moved on to the next question.\u201cBut how did you come to be with Thesilid?\u201d\u201cI have business in the capital of the country. I asked him to accompany me on my way back.\u201d\u201cThen why did you enter this dungeon\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI stopped by because I was curious. I thought it would be okay with Terry.\u201d\u201cTerry\u2026\u2026?\u201dHe repeated what I said in the shadiest voice he could ever do.At that time, a system message appeared.[<System> warning. You have entered the \u2018Plague Zone\u2019. Currently, the concentration of \u2018Pandora\u2019s Plague\u2019 dissolved in the atmosphere is level 1.]The zones were clearly split. It was a huge canyon leading to the depths of this dungeon.From the deep canyon that seemed to connect with the abyss, a dark green plague energy rose like a stream. So far, the concentration was extremely low, so there has been no physical reaction even when breathing.In fact, the first stage was at a level that a healthy person could overcome with immunity alone.The knights turned sideways. After traveling in parallel along the long valley, they found traces of civilization in this pristine, raw land.A large black triumphal arch.An evil arch structure was erected close to the valley. Directly beyond the entrance was a dangerous cliff.At first glance, it is a choice of a location that seems to be a door through which sacrifices are pushed down. However, if you look closely, you can see that there are stairs to the left beyond the door.Crude and narrow stone stairs as if carved out of the cliff surface. It was the only way down to the bottom of the canyon.I saw Captain Gadville, with a clogged and stubborn impression, leading the Knights toward the Black Arc de Triumph.Vice-Captain Lecto stayed with me instead of joining them.\u201cFrom now on, we will close the dungeon. But don\u2019t be afraid. It\u2019s a dungeon with no boss, so there won\u2019t be any battles. All we have to do is go down to the bottom of the canyon and find the core of the dungeon.\u201d\u201cThe canyon looks very deep.\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s so dark that you can\u2019t even see the floor.\u201d\u201cGreen smoke is coming up. I don\u2019t think you should keep inhaling this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s very harmful to the body.\u201d\u201cWill the knights be alright?\u201d\u201cHaha, are you worried about us, Miss Ellet?\u201dI turned my head away with a smiling face pretending to be a good person.The Knights, including Captain Gadville, were retreating far from the Black Arc de Triumph.However, Thesilid stood right in front of the cliff beyond the Arc, as if he had received another order.A muffled voice rang in my ears.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Miss Ellet. There are certain people who will go down to the depths of the canyon.\u201dVice-Captain Lecto\u2019s hand slipped to the left side of my waist. And.Swish!\u201cThesilid Argent!\u201dThe deafening cry caught everyone\u2019s attention.Thesilid, who was standing ten steps away beyond the Arc de Triumph, turned around.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis eyes were on me. To be precise, the sword of Vice-Captain Lecto pointed at my neck.\u201cIf you want to save this woman\u2019s life, go down alone and get the core of the dungeon!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing, Thesilid! Are you going to let your benefactor die?\u201dI didn\u2019t take any action and stood still.[\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 points out that your expression is not like a hostage at all.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 expects you to call the protagonist in a pitiful voice.]\u2018I wish I could have listened to you guys, but I don\u2019t want to do that.\u2019That\u2019s right. Thesilid whispered a request in my ear\u2026-Be the hostage.It was ridiculous, but there was a reason.Thesilid opened his mouth.\u201cThe sacrifice I make for a lady is noble.\u201dSacrifice. The most efficient action Thesilid can do to break the ban.<It\u2019s true. He has already regained some strength.>Thesilid looked around. This cowardly hostage play must have been a plan improvised by the Captain and Vice-captain. However, there was no objection from the other members. On the contrary, everyone\u2019s desire for Thesilid to descend into the canyon was easily shown.Everyone wished for Thesilid Argent\u2019s death. How does he feel when he sees this?\u201cAll right. I will go.\u201dIt was then that I felt something strange.Thesilid stepped back without turning to the side of the stairs.One step.\u201cEllet.\u201dTwo steps.\u201cI will be back.\u201dThree steps.\u201cYou do not have to worry.\u201dAnd.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dShhwish!Thesilid\u2019s body fell off the cliff.\u201cThesilid!\u201dHe disappeared from sight. I didn\u2019t think of anything at that moment.\u201cStay still\u2026\u2026Cuck!\u201dI forgot my duty as a hostage and ran towards the Arc de Triumph.I looked down at the bottom of the cliff, but all I saw was abyss-like darkness and dark green smoke.The gorge of unfathomable depth had long since swallowed Thesilid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s just\u2026\u2026just wait for him to come back.\u201d<What are you going to do?>\u201cI\u2019ll feed him the sparrow poop-flavored pill.\u201d<It\u2019s a good punishment.>While planning a desperate revenge play, a bewildered voice came from behind.\u201cYou, you, what are you!\u201d\u201cYou said you were an alchemist!\u201d\u201cHow did you get away from the vice-captain\u2026 ?!\u201dThe main tank, Vice-Captain Lecto, was quite an ace in this order.The face of the Knights, who had built a siege around me, was full of vigilance.<What are you going to do, Ellet?>\u201cI\u2019ll have to deal with these guys first.\u201dThe Captain and the Vice-Captain were provoked by the cold voice they heard.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Who\u2019s going to do what?\u201d\u201cGet rid of the woman! We must not keep the witness alive!\u201dNow, it seems that they are trying to attack in droves without even playing pretend to be knights.\u201cYou have to go to the Vatican to testify, so I\u2019ll give you a chance to live. Be grateful.\u201dI took out Serpens and covered it in white light.\u201cA-Aura user\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou said you were an alchemist!\u201d\u201cRight, even if she is, beginner level is\u2026\u201dCharararara!Because of the unfortunate misunderstanding, I immediately deployed my whip sword. My beloved sword flew like a devouring snake, causing a blood storm in the area.\u201cAww! My legs, my arms\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cWh-what! This absurd swordsmanship\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cNo-Not a beginner at all! A-Aura Expert! E-even higher than that\u2026!\u201d\u201cHey! W-We are not opponents! Te-Thesilid! We need to call Thesilid\u2026!\u201dThey were in so much panic that they finally called out for Thesilid, which they had stabbed in the back more than once.Annoyed, I swung my whip sword more fiercely like a whip.\u201cAaaah!\u201d\u201cKuh huh!\u201dThere were less than twenty people and it took less than five minutes for them to be out of combat.The Knights couldn\u2019t move an inch because of the major cuts and broken legs.\u201cOuch, gasp! Wh-what the hell are you\u2026\u2026!\u201dGeneral Gadville, who was violently crawling on the floor, shouted, wiping out his tears and runny nose.Clink.Serpens\u2019s blade went into the scabbard.\u201cThesilid\u2019s a temporary guardian. Why?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u2026Ghu, ahhhh!\u201dI can\u2019t kill them, so I slashed them with a scabbard. Of course, the body of an aura user is hard, so aura was loaded in an appropriate amount.Puck! puck! puck! puck! puck!\u201cReflect on yourself while being hit.\u201d\u201cOuch! Aww! Sp-Spare me, please! It hurts! Whoa! I-I was wrong\u2026\u2026!\u201dPuck! puck!\u201cWhat did you do wrong?\u201d\u201cOuch! The-Thesilid..\u2026arghhh!\u201dPuck! puck! puck! puck! puck!\u201cYeah, what about Thesilid? Why aren\u2019t you talking?\u201d\u201cPl-please have mercy\u2026ugh, sniff!\u201d\u201cMercy?\u201dI laugh on my own. The expression I had went straight out of my face.\u201cThis is mercy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026?!\u201dI focused all my attention on controlling the aura.Don\u2019t get excited. I can\u2019t kill them.As I calmed down, my voice that followed was also extremely cold.\u201cHey. Do you know what I saw in the Burst Dungeon?\u201d\u201cKuk! Cough!\u201d\u201cEven if Thesilid divides the pain he suffered there by the number of your heads.\u201d\u201cCough! Argh!\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be compared to anything like this.\u201d\u201cArghhhhhh!\u201d\u201cSo, this is kind of merciful. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cUgh, agh\u2026\u2026\u201dIt is obvious that the main character of the 17th episode, who is bound by discipline, will not be able to dream of revenge with his own hands. So, now that I have become a guardian, wouldn\u2019t it be okay to meddle with this level of physical interference?If it\u2019s not me, who else will do it?Puck!\u201cCough\u2026\u201dSadly, Captain Gadville did not last long. I grabbed the back of his neck and threw him away.\u201cHi-Hiiick!\u201dThe location I threw him away was next to Vice-Captain Lecto. Terrified, he stumbled on the floor and tried to step back.<Don\u2019t forget that one we decided to double up.>\u201cDo you think twice as much will do?\u201dI continued talking as if to let him listen.\u201cHe dared to put a knife to my neck.\u201d\u201cHic!\u201dMy gaze went from top to bottom of the Vice-Captain. In the original, he was the main tank who was jealous of Thesilid.\u201cSince you are a tank, I guess you can last a little.\u201d\u201cFo-Fo-forgive me! I won\u2019t do it again\u2026\u2026arghhhhh!\u201dAs expected, he endured well. Thanks to this, it was good to be able to beat him as much as possible, but there were also drawbacks.\u201cSt-Stop it! Stop it, please!\u201dI thought his words were getting shorter and he suddenly raised his head. His puffy, swollen face was filled with evil.\u201cW-we! We just wanted to live! Do you think you would have been different in that situation?!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI paused for a moment.<In the midst of all this, is he still rationalizing himself?>My eyes went cold.I lowered the scabbard slowly. At this, Vice-Captain Lecto grinned as if he thought he had hit the nail on the head.\u201cLook, you admit it, right? You too\u2026!\u201d\u201cWhat do you think is the reason I keep you lot alive?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe excitement of making eye-level contact with the worm was gone. I put the Serpens back on my waist and got up. I looked down at the bewildered bug and said.\u201cIt\u2019s about keeping you guys alive to go to court and testify. But you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you are going to testify how you should, it seems like you\u2019re just going to talk nonsense.\u201dIn other words.\u201cYou look useless.\u201d\u201c\u2026..!\u201dAs if hearing his death sentence, the worm\u2019s eyes widened in astonishment. I lifted my index finger and placed it on Vice-Captain Lecto\u2019s forehead, right between his eyesPeeing-.\u201cWh-what are you doing\u2026\u2026Huck?!\u201d\u201cShh.\u201dHispenril\u2019s Aura technique, which was passed down from my mother, began to take control of the body of the worm.From hearing to touch, the senses and nerves of the whole body except for sight were sharpened with extreme sensitivity.\u201cUgh\u2026uh\u2026\u2026arghhhhh\u2026.\u201d\u201cVi-Vice\u2026\u2026Captain?\u201d\u201cArghhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cV-V-Vice-Captain, sir\u2026\u2026!\u201dHis body was already covered with scars, so I didn\u2019t need to add anything more.\u201cGuok\u2026\u2026\u201dThe veins ruptured and his eyes were stained red. Instead of screaming, he collapsed, moaning and drooling.\u201cWh-What did you do with the Vice-Captain\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not dead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be more painful than death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dDeath would rather be liberation. However, it was difficult for an aura user in a tank position to die from shock. So if left like this\u2026<He\u2019s going to become a wreck.>[\u2018The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things\u2019 cover its eyes in fear.][\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 clicks his tongue, asking why you are doing what the Heretical Judgment Bureau is supposed to do.]\u2018I think taking Lecto to the courtroom would be counterproductive.\u2019I almost forgot, but Vice-Captain Lecto had a history of driving Thesilid to death in the original work. Because of his trashy inferiority.Vice-Captain Lecto was an evil human by nature, and his inferiority complex, which is the prime motive for murder, remains the same.A person who has nothing to lose has no hesitation in dragging others down to the abyss.Vice-Captain Lecto was about to be burned at the stake anyway, so while burning himself he was more than capable of blatantly framing Thesilid in the courtroom.So, why should I give the villain another chance to do the wrong thing?[\u2018The Creative Business Manager\u2019 appreciates the choice that leaves no chances for regret.][\u2018The World-building God\u2019 says that punishment is inherently harsh.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 agrees as a worker of the industry.]Around the time I was watching Vice-CaptainLecto.Suddenly, I felt a sign of uneasiness next to me, so I turned my head. It was seen that some of the members were trying to secretly use healing by raising their insignificant divine power.I muttered quietly.\u201cPerform silence.\u201dA haze of light flew like a butterfly from my fingertips. The target was the mouths of the Knights.\u201cUnh! Huh?!\u201dTheir snouts were sealed with an advanced debuff skill. The knights who could not chant their divine spells were astonished.\u201cI want you to take this opportunity to feel the sad feelings of stigmata that has no healing powers.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dIt had an unexpected additional effect of profuse bleeding.\u201cCough\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cCof, cof!\u201dSome knights started bleeding from the nose and mouth.<What\u2019s wrong with them?>\u201cI guess their body is reacting to the first stage of the plague because the immune system is low.\u201dAlthough they could resist by using the divine power inside their bodies, there was no one who had enough concentration skills to do this in the Order of the Pillar of Light.<Then is Thesilid okay? In the depths, the concentration of plague is much higher.>I was worried about that too.\u201c\u2026Thesilid, how much strength do you think he regained?\u201d<Aura Beginner Intermediate Level.>\u201cThen 20 minutes is the limit. Even if he drinks the potions I gave him, it\u2019s 30 minutes top.\u201d<I think it\u2019s been about 15 minutes now.>The dungeon should only be closed by Thesilid efforts alone. Only then will he regain his strength.So I tried not to intervene as much as possible.I did\u2026\u2026\u201cOuch, uh\u2026.\u201d\u201cKuh huh\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe knights continued to vomit blood. Occasionally, I walked to give them a little bit of healing, but their condition was only getting worse.I think there\u2019s about five stages of toxicity? So what\u2019s the state of the Thesilid who is wandering in the depths of the Canyon?I waited, fiddling with the pendant on my necklace.<\u2026\u2026Ellet.>Agnes\u2019s voice calling me was lower than usual. It was when I focused my eyes that had been released in the air on the necklace.<30 minutes have passed.>\u201cSigh\u2026\u2026\u201dA sigh spontaneously went out.\u201cI knew it.\u201d<Right? I felt the same way for some reason.>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Agnes. To find the lost child.\u201dLeaving the knights wriggling like worms, I strode towards the Black Arc de Triumph. and.Shhwish!<Ellet!

As I fell to the depths in an instant, my field of vision was engulfed in darkness.\u201cPure Light.\u201dShaaa!A ray of light shone down on the floor.However, the darkness of the canyon had a predatory nature and the light of the ultimate skill was swallowed up in pitch-black darkness.\u201cWell, that was expected.\u201dI couldn\u2019t tell the distance to the bottom with my eyes, but I wasn\u2019t too embarrassed.Because there was another way.[<System> Warning. \u2018Pandora\u2019s Plague\u2019 has reached stage 2.][<System> Warning. \u2018Pandora\u2019s Plague\u2019 has reached stage 3.][<System> Warning. \u2018Pandora\u2019s Plague\u2019\u2026\u2026]The more I fell, the faster the message was updated.Gradually, the air inhaled through my nose turned into poisonous gas. A fever vigorously rose in my airways and esophagus.<Ellet!>I didn\u2019t have time to answer because I was holding my breath.More. A little more. Just a bit more![<System> Warning. \u2018Pandora\u2019s Plague\u2019 has reached stage 9.]Yes, now!Kwajik! Quadduck!I cleaved Europe, which I had taken out after a long time, into the cliff face and set it as my brake. My arm muscles screamed as I resisted the staggering speed of the fall.Dudududud\u2026\u2026dut.Soon the fall stopped. Having roughly estimated the height with my gut feeling, I pulled out Europe and landed on the floor at the same time.Tak.\u201cWhoa, it was doable wasn\u2019t it?\u201d<\u2026\u2026Yes, indeed, my disciple.>[<System> Warning. \u2018Pandora\u2019s Plague\u2019 has reached the highest stage.]With every breath I took, I could feel the aura of the plague trying to corrode my respiratory organs.If I don\u2019t pour regular heals, I might end up with a ruthless show of bleeding my guts out.\u201cHeal.\u201dOriginally, Holy Power would emit a holy white light when cast, but that effect was removed due to the darkness of this light-eating canyon.It was really dark. It was so dark that even if I outstretched my hands in front of me I could not distinguish them.<Even if you can avoid obstacles with your gut feeling, how can you find Thesilid in such a dark place?>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t worry.\u201d<Huh?>\u201cI\u2019ve used my hands in advance.\u201dI raised my left hand.I can\u2019t see it because of the darkness, but now my fingers had a string wound around them like a thread.One end of it extended all the way to the other side of the canyon.\u201cWhen Thesilid was free diving, I wrapped the Spirit King\u2019s Harp String around his wrist. We just have to follow this.\u201d<Wow, you did a good job.>[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 commends you for your cleverness.]\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 admires that all Transmigrators have plans.]I pulled the wire with my fingertips and moved in the direction I felt the tension.Suddenly, a thought crossed my mind.\u201cAh. Come to think of it.\u201d<What?>\u201cRight now, I\u2019m connected to Thesilid by the string, right? Then wouldn\u2019t this be possible?\u201d<What would?>\u201cHeal!\u201dI could feel the healing power expressed in my hands flowing through the string.Is it working? I think it\u2019s working. It will, right?[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 tells you that things are flowing well.][\u2018The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things\u2019 says that the skill level is high and the ability to deliver is incredible.][\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 argues that it should be nerfed.]\u201cIt\u2019s a success. I cured Thesilid.\u201d<Oh, that\u2019s great. Clap, clap, clap, clap!>Agnes applauded with her mouth.\u201cI should have used heals from above the canyon.\u201d<He would be glad enough if you used it even now.>\u201cRight? In the first place, people feel more gratitude when they are on the brink.\u201dWhen I was convinced that I had prevented Thesilid to bleed his guts out, my steps relaxed a bit.I shouted as I walked across the pitch-black darkness.\u201cTerry! Answer me when you hear it. Terry!\u201dRight then, a fine vibration was transmitted to the fingertips connected to the string.\u201cEllet\u2026\u2026?\u201d\u201cTerry!\u201dI immediately ran in the direction the voice was heard.When I thought I had gotten close enough, I put a brake in my legs and stretched out my hands in the dark.\u201cEllet\u2026\u2026\u201dI touched soft hair at the height of my waist.He seemed to be kneeling on the floor. I lowered my posture to match Thesilid\u2019s.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dThe only senses that could feel his presence in the dark were hearing and touch. While waiting for an answer to come, I did not let go of my hand that had touched him.And I slowly swept my hands down from his cheek to his shoulder\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026what?Embarrassed, I lifted my hand a little.<What\u2019s wrong?>I just felt like his hair was running through my hand\u2026\u2026With a puzzled heart, I brought my hand to his face again. It felt a bit cold as if it were frozen, but the smooth texture of his cheeks was felt.\u2026\u2026Was it an illusion?The momentary sense of incongruity quickly evaporated.It was because Thesilid tilted his head and put his left cheek deep into my hand.\u201cEllet\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was a muffled voice.<He doesn\u2019t look very good.>\u201cYou said that you could do it alone.\u201d<Well, it looks like he did find the core of the dungeon.>It was only after listening to Agnes that I realized it. There was a small metal box in Thesilid\u2019s hands.I gave him a small scolding.\u201cIf you found the box, come up quickly. Why are you spacing out here?\u201dIn fact, I can guess why.\u201cBecause it\u2019s dark.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI thought that falling asleep with the lights on at night was just because he liked bright things. But now I see that he was afraid of the dark.\u201cSo, I thought I was going to die while vomiting blood like this\u2026\u2026but you came.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re thankful, right?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u2026\u2026What?[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 snorts, telling you to throw him away right away.][\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 likes the iron wall of the main character.]\u201cPlague, Death, Hope.\u201dIt was then that Thesilid spoke of the key keywords that made up this dungeon.\u201cYeah, hope\u2026\u2026vain hope.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cEllet, are you a vain hope?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t know what to say to the sudden question. But one thing was certain.\u201cCalm down, Terry.\u201dDarkness was consuming his mind.\u201cYou have to get out of here. Get up right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t walk? Do you want me to carry you?\u201d\u201cNo, thank you.\u201dI was relieved to hear his serious voice. He seemed to be much more spirited than before.\u201cI was acting ugly a while back. Forget it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn the dark, I could hear him sweep his face with one hand. I patiently waited for him to regain his composure by washing his face dry.Soon he brought up the story in an orderly voice.\u201cYou must have come to find me because I was late.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe shameless reply of not thanking me earlier would also be included in the ugliness, so I forgot about it with my broad generosity.\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ellet, but to get out of the canyon, I have to do it myself. That\u2019s the only way the hard work so far becomes meaningful.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very frustrating.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be right up.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cYour string, can I borrow it for a moment?\u201d\u201cSure, I guess?\u201dI gladly handed the Spirit King\u2019s Harp String. Thesilid took it over with his free hand.Having recovered his aura to some extent, he had no problem handling the string.Shh!I could hear the wire cutting through the air. After a while, he spoke in a slightly embarrassed voice.\u201cExcuse me, Ellet.\u201d\u201cYes. I know roughly what you are asking for.\u201dI hugged the neck of the most handsome man in this faithful and conservative worldview.\u201cLet\u2019s go up, Sir Thesilid.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dSoon after, the wire contracted and pulled us up. After feeling the motion against gravity, I could see light soon after.Whirlik.As we came up to the ground, the dying Knights of the Pillar of Light greeted us.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dStill with their snouts sealed, they found Thesilid and their eyes widened in astonishment.\u201cWow, hoops?! Cof! Whoops!\u201d\u201cKoo-eup, cof\u2026\u2026Kueup! Hmng!\u201dIt seemed like they were voicing evil remarks about how Thesilid came back alive, not believing it, telling him to die, why didn\u2019t he die, and so on.It was fortunate that the Push Over Free Pass filtered it out because of the silent debuff.Thesilid, who was looking into the face of the Knights, opened his mouth.\u201cEllet, I knew you were going to use your hands, but I didn\u2019t expect this much.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s a bit unfair to say that. It\u2019s not my fault that their immune system fell due to bleeding from wounds and they got sick.\u201d\u201cI said this after seeing Vice-Captain Lecto.\u201dLecto had all of his senses maximized due to the Hispenril\u2019s Aura operation method.He was now wriggling on the floor and groaning. He seemed to be \u2018savoring\u2019 the pain.I pretended not to know and changed the subject.\u201cMore than that, Terry, you should close the dungeon.\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201d\u201cGo on. I\u2019ll be taking care of these guys.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThesilid obediently nodded and headed towards the Black Arc de Triumph.If you look closely at the center of the arc, there was a small groove. It was a kind of puzzle hole, and the puzzle piece was none other than Pandora\u2019s box.The dungeon is closed by simply inserting the box into the groove. It was a simple task, but it was time-consuming because of its slow progress.From now on, Thesilid will be held up in the closing ceremony for a few minutes. In the meantime, I had work to do.They couldn\u2019t die, so I approached the 18 members of the Knights, who were still holding their breath.The silence debuff that had been on them was lifted with a single gesture of stirring my hand.I said in the coldest voice I could make.\u201cNow that Thesilid has come back alive, all you guys have left to do is go to the Inquisition.\u201d\u201cHick \u2026!\u201d\u201cTh-the Inquisition\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cGo and confess that you have dishonored Thesilid with false testimony, and reveal what happened in the dungeon in detail. Understand?\u201d\u201cOh, no\u2026I can not\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. When the case of that dungeon is made public, your trial will be supervised by the Inquisition Office, more precisely, the Heretic Judgment Bureau. Because you guys made a deal with the devil.

They started pulling at their hair or scratching their cheeks.\u201cN-no, t-the way things are going\u2026\u2026I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u2026ah ah ah ah ah\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, oh, no\u2026\u2026never\u2026\u2026 anything but he-heresy interrogation\u2026 \u2026 !\u201d\u201cS-Sir, I don\u2019t like it\u2026.I, I don\u2019t want to be tortured\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2019Strict Order and Goodwill\u2019, please! please forgive me\u2026!\u201dTheir wicked tongues reinforced each other\u2019s despair and fear. They hurt each other and screamed in pain.It\u2019s time to wrap this up.\u201cThen, since we all have to go to The Vatican together, shall I fix your legs?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dDivine power seeped into my hands. Just before I could heal everyone with an area heal.A mad glow shone in the eyes of the Knights. As if they had made a promise beforehand, many jumped up.\u201cAaaaaaa!\u201dWith a shout to raise their spirits, their legs kicked the ground, and in the direction they ran at full speed with all their strength\u2026\u2026\u201cQuaaaaaagh!\u201d\u201cAaaaaagh!\u201dThere was a cliff.The screams receded from the dimly-lit bottom of the canyon. Dozens of Knights of The Pillar of Light chose to flee to death.[\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 clicks his tongue, saying that the Inquisition was that terrifying.]The necklace rang.<You watched their suicide from the sideline.>I could\u2019ve stopped it if I wanted to. But I didn\u2019t.I gave them a choice in the first place. Well, in fact, it was practically close to aiding and abetting, still, there were six members of the Knights in front of me.Excluding Vice-Captain Lecto, who had become a disabled person, the other five people who were trembling because they did not even have the courage to escape were enough witnesses to stand in the courtroom.I was stunned when I looked at one of them.\u201cIf you pushed others to death, at least you should have the courage to kill yourself in the same way.\u201d\u201cHick, suck\u2026\u2026I, I\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all the same, Captain Gadville. I wouldn\u2019t have let you die anyway. Because you are the most important witness.\u201d\u201cUhmm\u2026hic\u2026uhhh\u2026\u201dI turned my gaze away from Gadeville who was in tears.At the same time, I felt a presence that was getting closer. After finishing inserting the box into the Black Arc de Triumph, Thesilid approached me.\u201cEllet.\u201dIt was a softer voice than expected.While he was tied up in closing the dungeon, I did my own thing. He wouldn\u2019t be very angry, but I knew he would at least nag a little.However, it seems that my interpretation of his character was wrong.\u201cI finished closing the place.\u201d\u201cH-Hm, I see.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you. Now that the ban is being lifted, I think I will regain my strength in a little while.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dHe smiled lightly. It was a smile that somehow felt bittersweet.\u201cIs it because you\u2019re a Saint? You\u2019re merciful, giving them a chance to end their life in comfort.\u201dI didn\u2019t expect this misunderstanding.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not really like that.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThis Order had no future other than to be tortured and then burned at the stake, I thought that you at least had allowed them to choose the method of death for themselves\u2026\u201d<Is this the same guy that saw Vice-Captain Lecto earlier and said it was too harsh?>As if he had heard Agnes\u2019 blunt remark, Thesilid hurriedly added more words in an apologetic tone.\u201cVice-Captain Lecto \u2026\u2026I thought you did it for me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s true.\u201dI only confirmed what he said, but his sea-blue eyes widened.Did he say that in half doubt?A bit more of an excuse followed.\u201cAnyway, I didn\u2019t mean to criticize you earlier. I just thought it was too much for me to receive\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIt seems that the experience of having someone come forward in his instead is very embarrassing.I ended the conversation because I thought it would be awkward if I continued to listen. I have to start by clearing up the misunderstanding about my overrated benevolence.I took out a polished stone from my satchel bag and showed it. It was a space transition stone that warped to the capital of Elpenheim, where The Vatican\u2019s central government was located.\u201cSince this is for eight people, now the numbers are just right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I see.\u201dI felt awkward for breaking his expectations.While putting back the space transition stone, I took out a food flavor pill.\u201cWant some?\u201d\u201cEvery time you do this, I feel like I am being treated like a child.\u201dHe complained but did not refuse. However, he did not eat it right away and put it somewhere in his bosom.<He avoided the punishment of sparrow-poop flavor.>It\u2019s a shame.It was time to tie the six remaining members of the Knights with the Spirit King\u2019s Harp Strings and prepare to leave the dungeon. Thesilid called me indirectly.\u201cBut Ellet.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI forgot to tell you earlier, but I can\u2019t see to open the closing gate.\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201d\u201cDid you forget to say something, too?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThere was one more reason for letting the members of The Pillar of Light jump the cliff.Rumble\u2026\u2026!Just in time, the Black Arc de Triumph began to vibrate.[<System> Warning. The seal of the A-class dungeon \u2018The Bottom of Pandora\u2019 will be unlocked by satisfying the \u2018sacrifice of 10 or more fallen believers\u2019.][<System> Warning. The difficulty of the dungeon is upgraded to S-class.][<System> The hidden master of the dungeon, Sentinel of the Apocalypse Grelius, 791th\u00a0\u00a0in the Demon World, has appeared.]The darkness of the canyon came together to form a gigantic shape.A giant reaper with a scythe. Whenever it fluttered its black robe, corrosive dust, red flames, and a dark green plague scattered wildly.The boss named Sentinel of the Apocalypse was the lord of the Grim Reapers.He was a king in his own way, and the skull shaped like a crown was studded with colorful jewels like a tattoo. The skull moved its jaw joint.<I will give you rest.>[\u2018The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials\u2019 is looking forward to the performance of the hidden boss.][\u2018The Creative Business Manager\u2019 complains about using the expansion pack without purchasing it.]\u201cHic\u2026\u2026\u201dThe knights who were overwhelmed by the appearance of an S-class Boss had trouble breathing. I spoke to Thesilid without much tension.\u201cIt was a pity to just leave, so I called the boss.\u201d\u201cYou really know everything. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not to the point of admiration. Let\u2019s get rid of it quickly, loot, and leave.\u201dMy hand gripped the handle of the whip sword, but Thesilid gently blocked the sword with one hand.\u201cEllet, step back and rest.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dHe walked towards the Lord of Grim Reapers with his straight back turned to me.<Oh wait, Thesilid is still\u2026\u2026?>I could see a dark energy rapidly dissipating from the edge of Thesilid\u2019s left arm. Along with that, the energy he radiated changed.Tesilide\u2019s power had been restored.Shaaaaaa.As he walked, a sword was summoned in his right hand. It was Libra, the beautiful holy sword of judgment studded with impressive dark blue square jewels.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dHis modest steps stopped ten steps away from the boss.It was within the area of ashes, flames, and disease created by the fluttering of the Boss\u2019 black robe.Grelius, the gigantic god of death, looked down at Thesilid, who was approaching.The scythe, which was slowly lifted, cast a shadow over Thesilid\u2019s head.<Mortal creature, worship and accept true rest.>\u201cIf it\u2019s true rest, you mean death.\u201d<Yes.>\u201cSweet words, but unfortunately.\u201dDivine aura dwelled in Libra\u2019s straight blade. A special aura that only the main character can handle emitted the purest light in the world.\u201cYour scythe gives me no true rest.\u201d<Cheeky.>As if in response, Grelius\u2019 scythe was filled with black and evil energy.In the next moment, the holy sword and the sickle of death clashed.Chizuzuzuk! Kwaaanng!The ground could not withstand the collision of forces and gave out.Thesilid removed his body before the gorge collapsed and swung his sword in succession.Following the path of his sword, aura turned into dozens of blades of light and fired at Grelius.<Arg! Rude being\u2026\u2026!>Grelius\u2019s black robe which was bombarded by the divine aura became tattered.\u201cOh\u2026\u2026\u201d<Oh\u2026\u2026>Agnes and I were amazed. The performance of the main character, who has reached the highest level of Aura Expert, was excellent.I was even surprised inside.The main character in episode 17 is much stronger than I thought![\u2018The World-building God\u2019 is pleased to say that he will make a great tank shuttle for you.]It might take some time, but I felt like he was going to catch the S-class boss with ease.It was possible to watch comfortably, so I chatted with Agnes.\u201cHow many minutes will it take? Fifteen minutes?\u201d<Same bet.>Agnes, who was examining Thesilid through the eyes of an instructor, spoke.<Anyway, it\u2019s a pity.>\u201cWhat?\u201d<Sacred sheep always awakens divine power first, but if his main ability was aura, he would become an even bigger vessel.>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Growth on the aura side will continue.\u201d<Really?>Thesilid\u2019s divine power would stop at the cardinal level, but aura would reach the level of a master.The fact that his secondary ability surpasses his main ability is understandable given that he is a Sacred sheep.\u201cI guess he\u2019s an exception because his divine power was forcibly awakened through the stigma.\u201d<I see. I\u2019m glad.>It was then.\u201c\u2026Cough.\u201dA low, distant coughing sound caught my nerves.Thesilid was bleeding from his mouth.He seemed to have internal injuries after inhaling the air of corrosion, flames, and plague created by Grelius\u2019s robe.Stigmata, who had no healing power, were vulnerable to such physical damage caused by afflictions. In other words, the compatibility was bad.It seems that the ability to withstand using the aura and divine power within the body was also at the limit.Thesilid ran his thumb over his mouth, glanced at his sword, Libra, and spoke to himself.\u201cA Holy Sword doesn\u2019t help at times like this.\u201dThen it was time for me to step out.\u201cCure.\u201dUsing a wide range skill, I poured heals on Thesilid, who was far away.Thesilid, whose body had been restored in an instant, turned to me in surprise.\u201cHealing during a battle, how long has it been since?\u201dIt is a fraudulent heal that has even been amplified by five times at level 67. Taste the thrill to your heart\u2019s content.But a little problem arose.<\u2026\u2026Was there a healer?>Grelius\u2019s empty eyeholes flashed at me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Caang! Can-can!\u201cOh.\u201d<Oh.>It was a time when I admired his wonderful performance.Shiwwwsh!The last remaining chain turned left and aimed at me.Thesilid immediately snatched it up with his left hand and at that moment.Chararara! Clap!The end of the chain twisted and wrapped around his neck.Kwak.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe strangled man\u2019s handsome face frowned slightly, but instead of groaning, his lips let out something else.\u201cBlue Torch.\u201dA bright blue divine flame rose from the left hand holding the chain.The chain became a fuse that carried the torch to Grelius.Whoaaaa!<K-Kuuuuuaaagh!>Grelius, who was been executed as if he was at the stake, struggled in agony.When his left hand broke the chain, Thesilid was immediately freed from the stranglehold.Grelius, who had been hit hard by the torch, was furious.<I can\u2019t forgive you! You will no longer be given a merciful rest!>Thesilid kicked the ground after confirming that Grelius\u2019s target had returned to him. It was a frontal breakthrough.Chararara! Charara!Dozens of chains attacked Thesilid at different times, obstructing his path. He could only dodge them by stepping swiftly on the ground letting the chain stuck in vain at the place where he had passed.Thesilid climbed onto one of the chains. With an amazing sense of equilibrium, he stepped on the chain and approached Grelius at high speed.<How dare you, a puny mortal creature.>Swiiiishhh!The scythe of the reaper swung wildly towards Thesilid, who raised his holy sword without slowing down his approach.Gugugugugu!The blade of the sword made the sickle\u2019s blade slip out of the way.<No\u2026\u2026!>Thesilid managed to burrow into the gap of the scythe. From there on, Grelius was defenseless.Thesilid leaped high and stretched out his right hand.

Thesilid had stepped back just before the explosion and landed in a safe place.<He killed death. That\u2019s pretty good.>I approached Thesilid.\u201cGood job. Are you hurt somewhere?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean there isn\u2019t?The marks on the neck where the chain had been wound were clear and red. I immediately reached out and healed him.Thesilid flinched briefly, perhaps because his throat was sensitive. Then he soon relaxed his expression and smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a healer.\u201d\u201cYou know?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cActually, I became a healer to heal you.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you so much.\u201dThe smile couldn\u2019t get brighter than this. However, apart from the positive visual effect, his inner mind was read.<This guy, he doesn\u2019t seem to believe you?>\u201cIt\u2019s because he lived only being deceived by others.\u201dUpon hearing my crooked reply, Thesilid briefly opened his eyes wide.I didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore, so I told another story.\u201cBut it\u2019s true that you and I are a good combo.\u201dBecause Thesilid became a tank-dealer, and I became a dealer-healer.He agreed and measured the combined strength of us two.\u201cYes, if I\u2019m with you, we might be able to subdue SS-class dungeons alone.\u201d\u201cYou look confident after completely regaining your strength. It\u2019s good to see.\u201d\u201cCompletely\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNo. Rather than that, you can go loot now.\u201d\u201cMe? Do you want me to have it?\u201d\u201cYes, because I owe you a lot of things.\u201dWithout hesitation, I picked up the shiny things from the edge of the cliff.The loot was a skill book and one item.[<Skill> \u2018Dance of Extermination\u2019A useful swordsmanship technique for digging into the middle of enemy defense lines and slaughtering enemies. It is graceful as if you were dancing, hence the name \u2018Dance\u2019.Note: This is for women and has the added effect of improving dance skills.][<Item> \u2018The Scythe of Harvest\u2019The sickle used by the god of death was improved for farmers. It doubles the yield probability.]\u201cWhoa!\u201dAs expected of a hidden boss, the rewards were great.The Dance of Extermination was a skill not for sale in the Cash Shop. As it happened to be for women, I learned it right away without any hesitation.I\u2019m already feeling stronger. Good, good.Thesilid, who was looking at the loot together, asked.\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201cYes. I think this swordsmanship skill seems to be useful in many-on-one battles, and this sickle is perfect as a gift for someone I know.\u201dWhen I was thinking of the joy of increasing the harvest by giving it to the dungeon farm manager, Epiden.\u201cWhat kind of guy is he?\u201dThesilid showed interest.\u201cEpiden is a guy as tall as you, with a pretty skull, shoulder blades, and iliac bones.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why do you look like that?\u201d\u201cShoulder blades aside, how do you know that the iliac bones are pretty\u2026?\u201dFor reference, the iliac bone is below the waist.His blue eyes seemed to sway slightly.Apparently, he was showing off his wild imagination, so I hurriedly explained.\u201cEpiden is an undead. It\u2019s a skeleton, so you can only see bones.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Ah.\u201d[\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 wonders what the main character would have imagined.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 laughs mischievously.]Averting his eyes to the side, Thesilid swept his face as if to wash it dry, then covered his mouth. True to an inexperienced, conservative, and faithful paladin.Wanting to make fun of him, I deliberately picked on him.\u201cIt\u2019s the 17th episode of your life. Show me your years of experience.\u201dThesilid retorted as if it was a bit unfair.\u201cThat\u2026\u2026It has nothing to do with the number of turns. Maturity is not about the quantity of experiences, but the quality.\u201dIt\u2019s a wonderful line, but if you translate it, it\u2019s like a confession from a natural-born soloist.[\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 says that the Transmigrator speaks like it\u2019s easy, but has not done anything formidable.][\u2018The World-building God\u2019 defends that the Transmigrator didn\u2019t do it because she didn\u2019t want to, it\u2019s that she couldn\u2019t do it.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 encourages you to change the genre quickly.][\u2018The Creative Business Manager\u2019 says it\u2019s a good idea to help sales.]Right before I could tell the gods to stop watching from somewhere in the sky.\u201cAnd.\u201dIt seems Thesilid still had something to say. When our eyes met, he spoke something like a whisper.\u201cI probably can\u2019t keep my cool like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThesilid didn\u2019t say anything more, he just stared straight at me.I was embarrassed for nothing, so I coughed instinctively.\u201cShall we go to The Vatican?\u201d\u201cYes, Eli.\u201dThe affectionate air from a moment ago had disappeared and the gate opened at Thesilid\u2019s gesture.\u201cLadies first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt\u2019s a national rule that the person who closed it, is the last to leave the dungeon.I woke up the stunned Knights, pushed them into the gate like throwing garbage away, and entered myself.\u2720After Ellet exited the dungeon, Thesilid remained alone in a desolate space.Out of sight of anyone, he rolled up his left sleeve.A white stigma was engraved on the inside of his sturdy arm and black lines like barbed wire wrapped around it.The prohibition had been greatly reduced, but it still existed.\u201cHalf\u2026\u2026Is the rest a problem that time will solve?\u201dWith a strange noise, he turned his head. There was a canyon in the place where his gaze, that crossed the air, was directed to.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis eyes darkened as he recalled the place that seemed like an abyss.He has been weak against darkness since a long time ago. In particular, darkness that came along with silence was fatal to him.The bottom of the gorge met those two conditions.In a space where sight and hearing died together, his mind was on the verge of being eaten by darkness.So he thought he was moving on to the next round. But.\u2013 Terry! Answer me when you hear me. Terry!She returned the sound to him. That alone awakened his spirit, which seemed to be buried in death.Ellet Rodellaine.Why do you always appear in the form of salvation?Over and over again.How long has it been since the last time he relied on humans? It was so funny that he could almost cry.The ending of the people he trusted or cared for was always the same.Betraying him in the most wicked way, or lost by his side in the most grievous way.At some point, he became numb to many things.However, only the threshold of what could shake him had risen, but there would still be room for twisting and breaking him.He thought Ellet Rodellaine\u2019s existence was one of two things.Either a rare reward that \u2018Strict Order and Goodwill\u2019 gave to him who was tired.Or a vain hope arranged to effectively despair him.If it\u2019s the latter.If \u2018Strict Order and Goodwill\u2019 was to play with me again.\u201cNo.\u201dHe swung the holy sword.Kwakwagwagwang!A powerful aura swept across the land like a tidal wave and crashed into the gorge. Due to the tremendous power, the cracked ground was filled with spilled debris.The bottomless pit ceased to exist.\u201cEllet Rodellaine.\u201dHe chanted.\u201cI hope you won\u2019t betray nor be lost.\u201dThe back of the handsome man chasing hope disappeared into the gate and the shadow that dragged along was as dark as a disaster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard he entered the dungeon alone trusting only the Holy Sword, then caused a Burst and died?\u201d\u201cI heard that he captured six Knights from the Pillar of Light and came back.

The Ministry of Doctrine took the Knights side with such zeal, even trying to hold Sir Thesilid\u2019s funeral in haste, but it might backfire on them.\u201d\u201cThat is what I think. There is no way that the Minister of Prosecution and the Pope would miss this opportunity.\u201d\u201cSir Thesilid seems to be holding a public trial just to restore his honor, but the repercussions of this incident can\u2019t be weighed.\u201dThose in power above the bishop rank exchanged political talks based on information power.\u201cBy the way\u2026\u2026\u201dAt the sound of a cardinal\u2019s voice, the atmosphere in the room suddenly changed. There was a story that everyone wanted to talk about.\u201cIs it true that Sir Thesilid came with a woman from outside?\u201d\u201cI saw her. She was a pretty girl with pink hair.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the absence of Sir Thesilid more than a fortnight? I heard that he caught the Knights today\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, then Sir Thesilid has been alone with a woman from outside for 15 days\u2026\u2026?!\u201d\u201cOh no! How could an unmarried paladin behave so promiscuously? It\u2019s something I couldn\u2019t have imagined when I was young!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m afraid to even hear such things.\u201dThe conservative officials rattled all over the place.On the other hand, in secret places, there were those who showed outright hostility to the news of Thesilid\u2019s return.\u201cFather, did you hear? Older Brother\u2019s enemy is said to have returned alive. What kind of woman did he bring along?\u201d\u201cI know, Helcion.\u201dFather and son were talking in a well-soundproof confessional room.They were Cardinal Carnoil O\u2019Drek and his son Helcion O\u2019Drek.Because of Eleon, who became the host of the Magic Sword, the O\u2019Drek family suffered hardships.At least, the prestige of Valcus Odrek, the previous owner of the Holy Sword, and Cardinal Carnoil\u2019s position as the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Doctrine prevented the family from being punished.Otherwise, he might have been sentenced to death for having an apostate son.It has already been four months since the loss of his eldest son Eleon. He had enough self-reflection, so he was about to resume his activities.The news of Thesilid Argent\u2019s return came just in time.\u201cI thought \u2018Strict Order and Goodwill\u2019 would have handed fair punishment, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAre you just going to watch, Father?\u201d\u201cAs Chief Resident, don\u2019t act rashly, Helcion.\u201dThe Ministry of Doctrine was in charge of one of the two pillars of The Vatican\u2019s power structure.Befitting of a person serving as Vice-minister there, Carnoil was cold-hearted.\u201cDo not view him as your brother\u2019s enemy, but as Argent\u2019s godson.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, Father.\u201dFor the O\u2019Dreck family, the most important thing was the fight for power rather than revenge for the eldest son.As the denomination formed a nation, the Vatican was not free from politics. Its power structure has been divided in two and has long been at odds.To this day, it has continued to be divided into factions based on which line they took between Doctrine or Prosecution.The current pope hails from the Ministry of Prosecution, which advocates judgment on heresy, and Cardinal Vesalius Argent was a representative from the pro-papal faction.As an opposing faction, the Ministry of Doctrine prioritized missionary work and church expansion, and Cardinal Carnoil O\u2019Dreck was on that side.As is often the case with political battles, both groups could not be classified as good or evil.One side dreamed of extreme doctrinal enforcement and exclusion, and the other dreamed of pragmatic and secular expansion of power.Which is the worst and which is the lesser depends on the point of view.However, one thing was clear to all. The pro-Doctrine sects had many regrets about the Sacred Sheep.Under the leadership of the Pope, it was only natural that the children were raised to become Heresy Inquisitors who collaborated with the Ministry of Prosecution.\u201cThe arrested knights will be under an inquisition. It\u2019s not enough that Argent\u2019s godson was brought back to life, and if his honor is restored, the Ministry of Prosecution will rise again.\u201d\u201cThe bastard is growing up too fast. It would have been nice if our side had raised some useful orphans from long ago.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late to regret it now.\u201d\u201cAt this rate, the power balance will be completely tilted to the Ministry of Prosecution. Are there really no means of checking them?\u201d\u201cThere is. Don\u2019t you know?\u201dCardinal Carnoil\u2019s old eyes flashed.\u201cThe Saint.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have to find the Saint before they do.\u201dIn fact, the Doctrine sects have secretly searched for the Saint for quite some time.The knights to which Helcion belonged also pretended to be dispatched to subdue dungeons several times while gathering information about the Saint from the villages Clovis stopped by.Helcion spoke rather skeptically.\u201cThe last time Descent of Divinity happened was 10 years ago. Is she alive?\u201d\u201cAs long as there is no evidence of death, she is alive. So\u2026\u2026\u201dHope shined in Carnoil\u2019s eyes as strong as his desire for power.\u201cFirst, we must find the Saint and bring her to our side. By all means.\u201d\u2720Currently, Thesilid and I were waiting in front of the main gate of the Holy Church.\u201cI waited for over two hours. How long do they plan to make us wait?\u201dAt my dissatisfied words, Thesilid couldn\u2019t hide his apologetic expression from his handsome face.\u201cIt\u2019s my negligence. I didn\u2019t know they wouldn\u2019t let me in until a decision was made from above.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mean to blame you.\u201dIt was within the expected range that the conservative and bureaucratic Vatican fed sweet potatoes to us over the issue of Thesilid\u2019s survival.But no matter how much I expected bad treatment, I didn\u2019t know that we would be blocked from entry like now.[\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 snorts, asking if you had underestimated the dryness of the original work.]No, it\u2019s not a matter of underestimating, but of plausibility right?\u201cDoes this kind of treatment make sense? You are the owner of the Holy Sword.\u201d\u201cThe owner of the Holy Sword that is hated by the world.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis self-objectification gave complicated feelings.Our current location is in front of the flower bed, a little far from the main gate. There was some distance from the guards.Since the Vatican\u2019s garrison took the Knights, no one was seen.It was not possible to estimate how long this wait would be.I was about to sit down on the flower bed, but Thesilid stopped me. He took off his uniform coat and laid it on the base of the flowerbed.\u201cSit down, Eli.\u201dWhat? Is this Rofan?\u201cBecause it is my duty.\u201dWhen I heard the reason that was lightly added with a refreshing tone, \u2018The Commandments of the Seven Holy Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins.\u2019 came to mind.I quickly sat down to help him farm his divine power.Thesilid smiled bitterly as if in trouble.\u201cYou also have a connection with Cardinal Cattleya, so I thought there was no need to prove your identity. If I had known I would cause such trouble for you, I would have gone separate ways when we arrived.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, never mind.\u201dIn fact, this was not the time for Thesilid to care about others, he had to worry about himself first.It is not a good sign that the conversation between the superiors is prolonged because the original has always fed sweet potatoes that are in proportion to waiting.And finally, the paladins belonging to the garrison showed their faces. It had been three whole hours of waiting.What kind of decision would they have received from the upper ranks?The man presumed to be the leader opened his mouth as if he was very sorry.\u201cSir Thesilid Argent, the decision of the Council of Cardinals has been made.\u201d\u201cI will obey.\u201dA prime specimen of a Pushover Free Pass that sticks to obedience first without asking or arguing.At the glance of the garrison leader, two paladins timidly approached and took out something.It was chain handcuffs.The captain said\u201cSir Thesilid is accused of causing a burst in Greenwall\u2019s Class A dungeon by his own will. Therefore, Sir Thesilid, like the Knights of the Pillar of Light, should be investigated and tried as a sinner.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/A Transmigrator\u2019s PrivilegeCH 100Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Vatican was a huge fan of the principle of presumption of guilt!Agnes burst into anger.<What the hell are they talking about? There\u2019s clear evidence that the knights made a contract with the demons so of course they should be arrested, but to arrest Thesilid under the false charges that were laid by those same sinners?!>That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThesilid\u2019s silence made the garrison nervous.They seemed to be aware that it was unfair to treat the owner of the Holy Sword like this.\u201cEli.\u201dThe voice calling for me had subsided a little.\u201cYes, Terry.\u201dAt this point, I just wanted Thesilid to quit everything, so I was willing to punch his way out with all my might if he asked for help. But.\u201cCan you turn your head?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI turned my head to the side. Hearing a clanking sound, it seemed that he was being restrained by holding out his hand.The Captain cleared his throat as if embarrassed.\u201cKu-hmm, I thought Sir Thesilid would understand the decision to be fair. Thank you for sticking to the principles.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cHold on a moment. May I ask you one thing, Captain?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. Please speak.\u201d\u201cI ask for my companion. She is a person who has awakened divine power and came to be ordained a priest.\u201d\u201cI see. Leave it to me.\u201dThe voice of the leader coming from the back of my head shows a strong sense of rejoicing.After completing the request, Thesilid was immediately taken away and quietly disappeared.There were no final greetings because I didn\u2019t want to turn my head.[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 criticizes the \u2018Strict Order and Goodwill\u2019 denomination, saying that it\u2019s full of deep-rooted evil in many ways.]I know, right. It\u2019s a deep-rooted evil that I want to clean up.\u201cYou came to be ordained a priest, right? What is your name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Ellet Rodellaine.\u201dEven if it was my voice, I heard a cold tone popping out. It was only then that I realized that I was feeling pretty low right now.The Captain of the garrison led me to the place where prospective priests lived.As we followed in silence, he explained various things.\u201cThose who have awakened the divine power from the outside will be granted preliminary priesthood qualifications after passing a simple test. Healing, consecration, and purification abilities are checked under the supervision of an initiate. You don\u2019t have to worry too much about the test because these are abilities that can be used as soon as you awaken your divine power.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHowever, we need to keep our body and mind in order to take the test. That is why you are qualified to take the test only after you have been devout in mind and body by eating only bread, wine, and water in solitary confinement.\u201dWhat? Bread, wine, and water? Who controls my diet?That part was the most annoying, but the more important thing was somewhere else.<This is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of a procedure like this. Does it make sense for The Vatican to feed and put an outsider, whose divine power has not been confirmed, to sleep in a room for three days? They have other intentions.>Yes, this is someone\u2019s ploy to isolate me.The mood was completely subdued, but the expression on my face steadily faked innocence.\u201cThanks for the explanation. I will faithfully follow the procedure.\u201d\u201cGood. Now that you have arrived, please go to your room.\u201dI was assigned a small and shabby room for a low-level priest.Lastly, the Captain disappeared, asking not to go outside unless it is unavoidable.A room with an old wooden bed, a wooden stool chair, and a small worship platform for prayer.Agnes looked around and expressed displeasure.<This is a room where apprentice priests are confined to reflect on themselves when they have an accident.>Information was added to reinforce rage.Yes, it\u2019s better to know and suffer rather than be unaware.I sat down on a wooden stool. It was time to take a break and try to control my mood.Tap tap tap tap tap.I heard fast, nervous footsteps coming through the wall. It was clearly getting closer to where I was.Tok, tok, tok! Clack!A young paladin broke into my room.He was a blonde man in his early to mid-twenties, but for some reason, he looked familiar.<What is this guy?>As I watched in silence, he set the heavy basket down on the podium with a thud.\u201cToday\u2019s meal is served.\u201dLooking at the black, hard bread and sour wine, I feel bad again.Then the other person looked at me from top to bottom. It was a judgmental look.He pulled one side of his mouth, laughed, and said.\u201cI came to see because it was a woman brought by Thesilid Argent, but there\u2019s nothing special. I just wasted my time.\u201dAt this point, I thought I should remember the name at least.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cHelcion O\u2019Drek. I am one of those who will be present when you are tested in three days.\u201d\u201cAh, Sir Helcion O\u2019Drek.\u201dO\u2019Drek. With just one family name, all hostility toward me was understood at once.I smiled brightly, as I preferred things that are exact so I can get a clear distinction between things.But the reaction of this guy called Helcion was strange.Suddenly, his face stiffened and he scolded me sternly.\u201cKeep the good manners in order.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat simpleton fool might have been snatched that way, but this doesn\u2019t make me bat an eye.\u201dFor a moment, I almost established a bad prejudice against the people of this conservative denomination.<What is he talking about?>Thanks to the laughing Agnes, I was able to keep my calm.[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 yells at who is this guy to tell you what to do.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 mocks and laugh at the excessive self-consciousness of the ignorant man.]Helcion began to give a speech.\u201cListen carefully. After the confirmation of your divine power in three days, you will receive catechesis for one month. Then you must again serve the order for one more month before you can be ordained. During this service period, you will be taking care of chores along with the Knights of Grace, to whom I belong.\u201d<What? What nonsense is he talking about? There is no service process like that. Most of all, what kind of preliminary priest do you want to put into action and roll like that? >\u201cAs the vice-captain of the Knights of Grace, I will tell you in advance. I hate incompetent healers. In particular, I despise those who want to be treated pridefully like healers while boasting of their insignificant healing power.\u201d<This punk dares?>Eventually, curses came out of Agnes\u2019 mouth.\u201cThat heal, it would be wise to use it on the strongest among the Paladins. If you come under me, you\u2019ll behave yourself. Then I\u2019m done.\u201dBang!\u00a0I stared at the closed door.[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 is indignant at the fact that you have to pretend to be under this underhanded show-off bastard.][\u2018The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials\u2019 beats his chest in frustration.][\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 massages the back of his neck.][\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 is disappointed that you didn\u2019t say a single thing back.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 watches you without saying a word.]I reached into the basket.<What are you going to do now, Ellet?>\u201cGood question, Agnes.\u201dMy hand picked up the wine bottle and opened the lid.Gulp.<E-Ellet?>\u201cHa!\u201dAfter emptying the bottle, I wiped my lips with the back of my hand.\u201cI was originally thinking about two plans. The first plan was to quietly be ordained a priest and, as a healer, follow Thesilid through the dungeons he was going to subdue.\u201d[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 is dissatisfied with the plan of being part of the evil denomination.]<Aren\u2019t you uncharacteristically passive?>\u201cCan\u2019t you say it\u2019s moderate?\u201d<Then is the second plan radical?>\u201cYeah.\u201d<Oh my.>[\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 is looking forward to hot cider.]My eyes sunk.\u201cIn fact, I feel really bad today.\u201dI waited for three hours, witnessed the live-action version of the sweet potato in front of my eyes where Thesilid was treated unfairly, and got into a stupid quarrel that was unilaterally raised by a crazy idiot.Above all, bread, wine, and water. This church was really bent over in crossing the line.This time and experience were enough to radicalize my moderate plan.I laughed by pulling the corners of my mouth.[\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 likes your \u2018I\u2019m going to screw-you-all\u2019 smile.][\u2018The Eyes that watch over the chaos of all things\u2019 likes your eyes filled with energy.]<So what\u2019s your plan?>\u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201dIf you conform to the system and discipline as a low-level person, I will explode with frustration. I felt like I could do something only if I had power.\u201cI should become a Saint.\u201d<Ohh!>[\u2018The Critic who adjusts the balance\u2019 expects an unprecedented Heretic Saint.][\u2018The Spoiler Inspector\u2019 is dumbfounded at the signs of you destroying the original work, asking if you are trying to take the heroine position of the Saint.][\u2018The Scales that Judges the Soul\u2019 welcomes the job change optimized for a +19 reverse harem romance.][\u2018The Troubled Architect of the Tower of Trials\u2019 agrees with your plan, saying that the higher the tower and the higher the position, the better.]As always, the gods encouraged me by making use of their individuality. Except for the most important one.[\u2018The World-building God\u2019 hardens.][\u2018The World-building God\u2019 is shocked and questions whether you are trying to become a Saint of a God who left the house.][\u2018The World-building God\u2019 says this is an act of apostasy and runs away with a broken heart.]\u201cAh, my Lord!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
