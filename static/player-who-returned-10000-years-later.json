He'd been waiting for the guy to react in a completely different manner. Seon Soo dropped his act and turned serious.For some reason, Kang Yu didn't get mad at all.He definitely didn't seem like a psycho on sedatives. Does he always react so calmly to people he doesn't know?'In front of journalists, his reaction should have been more aggressive.' He recalled the order of his own sponsor, the man named Kim Yeong Hoon.As soon as Kim Yeong Hoon had caught wind of the news that the Player sponsored by Chae Young-ju had appeared near the gate, he immediately called Seon Soo and ordered him to publicly humiliate Kang Yu.Mir Guild and Red Rose Guild were always at odds with each other. The plan was to provoke Kang Yu into fighting Seon Soo in front of the media to make the headlines say the Player sponsored by Mir Guild was much stronger.Chae Young-ju didn't seem to know much about this newcomer. She needs help to see just how weak and useless he is.'After all, this is the kind of dirt that, once it's there, can't be washed away for the rest of your life.'Because Kang Yu is still just a newcomer, if he was publicly humiliated, the labels attached to him would never disappear.It doesn't matter how good he becomes in the future. Everyone would always think he's weaker than Seon Soo after today.Reputation is very important.'But if I start a fight now, I'll look pathetic,' Sung Su thought as he noticed Kang Yu's oddly wide smile.'\u0410h?' When he saw his smile, a chill ran through his body and there was an unpleasant feeling. 'What's he smiling for?'Seon Soo, overcome by the sudden feeling of anxiety, began to think of a way to get out of this situation.The sound of his pounding heartbeat was so loud, he could barely hear himself breathe.No matter how hard he thought, nothing came to mind.If he backs out from Kang Yu's offer, he'd put the image of his guild at the bottom.Seon Soo's hands were tied.If only Kang Yu had ignored his jokes from the start, he wouldn't be in such a conflicting position.'Bastard.' Seon Soo turned his head sharply to glare at Kang Yu.Kang Yu didn't seem to realize what they were here for, so he must have agreed to hunt together because he was genuinely scared of the unknown monster.'Well, if that's the case, then we can handle this quickly.'Seon Soo didn't know why Red Rose chose to sponsor this guy, but if he's this cowardly, he wouldn't be a problem at all.\u2014 Well\u2026 Let's go,\u2014 he said to his teammates, staring directly into Kang Yu's eyes.They all followed Seon Soo into the gate.\u2014 Woah! Look, the Mir Guild and Red Rose have teamed up!\u2014 Oh, that's great. Two of the great guilds, united, are entering the gate to capture the unknown monster!For the media, Kang Yu and Seon Soo joining together as one party was a great headline. They watched the people entering the gate with anticipation in their eyes.When they entered the gate, they found themselves in the stone labyrinth, where Minotaurs usually lived.The labyrinth even had a stone ceiling. It seemed that they arrived straight in the monster's den.As soon as Kang Yu arrived, he gestured to the maze and spoke with a shining smile:\u2014 Well, shall we team up and try to capture the unknown monster?Kang Yu's question was so simple and natural that Seon Soo was in disbelief.When Seon Soo fell to the floor, he said:\u2014 Don't you have any pride at all?\u2014 What?\u2014 Huh, you're either pretending not to know what I mean or you really are stupid\u2026\u2014 Seon Soo, just ignore him. We expected a lot from him because he was chosen personally by Chae Young-ju, but he's just a fool, \u2014 said a girl wearing a blue dress, heaving a sigh.\u2014 I think that Chae Young-ju must be fooling around. They say she came to him personally and offered to sponsor him\u2026 As expected, our Deputy Guild Commander Kim Yeong Hoon is the best.\u2014 That's right. Not only did he successfully inherit his family business, he's also a handsome man.\u2014 As they say, 'the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.' He's just as amazing as his father. He's on his way to the World Ranker list now.\u2014 Hha. There's no guild like ours. He's the only rich man who decided to become a Player and create a guild.They had started praising their own guild as if they'd forgotten Kang Yu was there\u2026 or maybe they were just ignoring him.Guild Commander of Mir, Kim Yeong Hoon, and Chairman of the largest corporate organization, Mir Electronics.Five years ago, when the Gates had suddenly appeared, he decided to become a Player and quickly became powerful thanks to the financial strength of his company.That's how the Mir Guild was created.'A guild created by a corporate organization.' Kang Yu's eyes were sparkling as he gazed at the party members. 'They've got a strong financial backing.'Given that large guilds already earn a lot, it was scary to imagine how much money the Mir Guild gets from their Player earnings and the electronics business combined.'What if I start a war between these two guilds?' If he did that, Kang Yu would definitely benefit from both of the guilds.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 While Kang Yu thought about it, he tilted his head.'But I'd feel guilty doing that to Young-ju.' She'd given him so much that it would be dishonorable to start a war between her guild and Mir Guild. 'And it's better to remain allies with Red Rose in case I ever need their help in the future.'Betraying Young-ju for instant gain was like killing a chicken that lays golden eggs to eat its meat.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Where is that unknown monster? \u2014 Seon Soo excitedly asked, wandering through the maze.Trailing slowly behind him, Kang Yu answered calmly:\u2014 First, we just have to keep exploring.\u2014 Do you think I'm asking you? You're so stupid, how could any idea from you be useful?\u2014 Hhha. I'm sorry. \u2014 Kang Yu feigned a smile, playing the part of a fool, and turned his eyes to the party members.'Seon Soo\u2026' Although he had a smile plastered on his face, Kang Yu was raging with anger. His pride was hurt. 'Seon Soo, are you this confident in your abilities?'Lazily following him, Kang Yu used the Observer's power to figure out the location of the Boer.He felt the Boer's presence not so far from them.'It seems he hasn't satisfied his hunger yet.'The monster was on a rampage hunting for food.[Power of Temptation]Applying the Power, a scent that could attract Boer to them wafted through the air.\u2014 What the? Do you smell that?\u2014 I can smell it. And something's drooling incessantly\u2026Seon Soo and his teammates, smelling the scent, started looking around.'It's coming.' Kang Yu could sense the excited Boer rushing towards them, breaking through the walls.Kang Yu took a few steps back, waiting for the monster to approach Seon Soo and his posse.There was a roar.\u2014 Wha\u2026 what the\u2026?\u2014 I think something's coming!\u2014 Get ready to fight! \u2014 Seon Soo shouted, sensing an unknown monster approaching. \u2014 And you stay silent. Don't even think about telling people we caught it together. \u2014Kang Yu looked at Seon Soo, who hadn't forgotten to throw in a nasty remark even in this situation, and smiled.'You can say goodbye to your life.' Kang Yu didn't think that Seon Soo and his party stood a chance against the Boer.A hungry Boer was so strong that even the creatures in the Third Thousandth Circle of Hell could not fight against it.Even if Yeon Ho, with 7th rank, tried to fight it off, it's hard to say if he could even win.Accordingly, Seon Soo, who only became a Player just over three months ago, would never be able to fight it.\u2014 He's coming! \u2014 Seon Soo took out his spear and prepared to attack.'He's like a monster himself.' Seon Soo was the Player who, after attaining a Class A special ability in Rank 1, rose to Rank 5 in three months.It was hard to find 'monsters' like Baek Kang Hyun and Chae Young-ju who reached even higher levels in three months.So, of course, Seon Soo was confident in his abilities.\u2014 It's people like you who die first.Kang Yu and Seon Soo had switched roles.\u2014 What? \u2014 Seon Soo faced Kang Yu's direction with a panicked look on his face.Seon Soo almost thought there was someone else talking. It didn't sound like Kang Yu at all.When Seon Soo turned around, Kang Yu was smiling again, his arms crossed over his chest.But this time, the smile didn't make him look airheaded at all. This time, his smile was full of anger.\u2014 This crazy guy\u2026\u2014 Seon Soo!\u2014 What?\u2014 What are you doing? This is a grave situation, and you still have time for small talk?!\u2014 What\u2026 \u2014 The moment Seon Soo had turned his back on the monster to look at Kang Yu, the wall was broken down by the Boer and his group was attacked.Both the Players and their shields were being swung away in all directions.\u2014 What the\u2026 \u2014 Seon Soo's eyes widened. He hadn't expected the unknown monster to be so strong.The Boer, charged at the Players who had flown away, its mouth wide open.The monster easily bit through their armor, and dark blood poured out of their bodies.Seon Soo, who was no longer interested in fighting Kang Yu, stepped forward and gripped his spear tighter.\u2014 Ahh! \u2014 He focused Maryok at the end of his spear and a blue light came out of his tip.Seon Soo swung his spear once he felt the timing was right.\u2014 The power of Light!The spear, covered with sharp thorns, flew straight to the monster's head.Confident in his own power, Seon Soo stepped forward after throwing his spear to attack.But the Boer easily caught and munched on the weapon.Seon Soo, terrified by such a powerful foe, fell backwards.\u2014 Ah\u2026? Huh? \u2014 Seon Soo looked up and down at the Boer in bewilderment.He was shrouded in the feeling that perhaps, something had gone wrong after all.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sa\u2026 save me!The Boer bit the Player pointing a sword at his throat.The Player did his best to free himself from the mouth of the beast with the sword, but the Boer was too strong.His body snapped in half, and his organs were oozing out bright red blood.\u2014 Aah! Aah\u2026Seon Soo's group watched the Boer's actions with fear.It's a monster.A monster devouring human flesh.It was the first time these Players had encountered a real monster, and the first time they had experienced such terror that shook them to their bones.Kang Yu had also experienced this kind of fear once, but with experience, he no longer felt frightened by monsters like this.Seon Soo's party had raised their levels so quickly that they'd forgotten how terrifying monsters could be.Their greed had overcome their fear. Monsters were now nothing more than a source to earn money and increase their levels.But the Boer easily reminded them just how fearful a monster can be.\u2014 What are you doing? Hurry up and attack it!But Seon Soo had lost his spear. And his teammates could hardly move in their stupor.Fear overwhelmed their minds more and more.The Boer, watching his motionless prey, made a joyous cry and dashed towards them.Each of his five paws had claws as sharp as blades, which he was going to use against the Player carrying the large sword.The Player raised his sword, trembling, hoping it would somehow give him a better chance at survival.The Boer grabbed the sword with his claws, and with a characteristic clash, the metal broke into several pieces. He grabbed the Player by the waist.\u2014 Aaaah!The sharp claws of the monster were digging into the Player's back.The sound of his ribs breaking could be heard, and scarlet blood began trickling down his body.The first thing it did was bite off the Player's head.\u2014 Seo\u2026 Seok Hyun! \u2014 shouted out a Player holding a thin sword. He stepped towards the monster.But he didn't have time to accumulate Maryok, and his sword broke against the beast's thick skin.The Boer, using his long tongue like a lasso, caught the Player.The Player's body easily snapped in half by the Boer's tongue as if he were just a toy.The girl in the blue dress could only watch this eerie scene, unable to use magic, and unable to even scream.She turned on her heel and ran in the opposite direction, screaming: 'Save me!'As she ran past Seon Soo, her dress, unfurling in the wind, brushed past the guy.The Boer slowly turned his gaze to the prey that was trying to get away.Not only did his paws have sharp claws, but they were also quite long, and he easily reached out and sank his claws into the girl's back, tearing her blue dress. He snarled loudly, clutching onto his prey.She, in disbelief at what was happening, turned her head and looked at the claws stuck in her back. Red blood was flowing out of her mouth.And then, the Boer's fifth victim disappeared into his mouth.\u2014 What\u2026 what's going on?! \u2014 Seon Soo, looking at where his teammates were standing just a moment ago, fell to the ground in shock.There was a wet spot between his legs.The guy looked up at the Boer with horror.He knew he was about to be swallowed alive by that monster himself.\u2014 Huh? \u2014 Against his expectations, the monster did not attack.Not only did he not attack, he even yawned, as if the hunt had been successfully completed, and rolling into his own body, he settled down to rest.\u2014 So he's satisfied.\u2014 What the\u2026? \u2014 While looking at the tranquil image of the creature who had just been rampaging around, he noticed Kang Yu approaching it.Seon Soo didn't understand why he was doing that.Kang Yu looked at the Boer lying on the ground, smiled, and brought forth his right hand.'Once he's full, he won't attack. He'll just lie still.'It's very easy to defeat a sated Boer.It only takes one blow.Still, the blow must be strong enough to take his life in one go.Kang Yu concentrated powerful Magi in his outstretched hand.'I'll use a double forked spear.'It was necessary to use a magi spear, as mentioned in the legends.Using the Power of the Dark Spear and the Power of Hellfire at the same time, he could achieve the effect needed.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAt both prongs of the spear was a Hellfire flame.Using the two Powers at full potential simultaneously required time, but with the Boer's hunger satisfied, time was not an important factor.Kang Yu received a notice.[You've improved your skills in using Dual Powers (Rank: S)][Your skills have been honed, the use of this technique will be easier in the future].Along with the message, the Hellfire burst into larger flames as it consumed more of his Magi, and Kang Yu felt a slight dizziness.He threw the spear filled with Magi into the creature.The Boer, being in a state of satiation, did not react in any way to the spear headed at him and allowed it to pierce himself.The two sharp ends of the spear passed through Boer's thick skin, and the flames of Hellfire burned inside him.Even though the Boer was the strongest creature of the Second Thousandth Circle of Hell, he could not resist such a powerful blow.A warning sound was heard.[You have successfully killed a Level B splinter of the rift][Level up by 6 units][When you reach level 40, you get Rank 5.][Bonus point limit raised, you get 7 Magi units][Reaching 60 units of the Magi, you open the first stage of the Devil's Blessing.]\u2014 What kind of Devil's Blessing is this? \u2014 There was one thing among the notifications that Kang Yu could not understand, and he turned his side to the side.'Sounds like the title of a novel.' It was an unusual word combination, so Kang Yu expanded the status window to learn more about it.[Information]Devil's Blessing: The first stage of becoming the devil.Stage One: Getting 60 units of MagiStage Two: ????Stage Three: ????'What a vague description.' Kang Yu frowned when he read the information provided in the status window.It wasn't specified what it was, and it wasn't clear how it would benefit him.INot only that, the next two steps to achieve this Devil's Blessing weren't even indicated.'The first stage of becoming the devil\u2026' Doesn't sound like something too bad.Moreover, Kang Yu thought that achieving this Devil's Blessing could help to gain great power.'I don't think that's what happened back in Hell.'When he was the master of the Ninth Thousandth Circle of Hell, he never received a Power called 'Devil's Blessing' or anything like that.Kang Yu gazed at the information about the Devil's Blessing with interest.'I think my expectations are being met.' He'd thought that by becoming a Player and continuing to grind for power, he could become even stronger than when he was in Hell. Much stronger. 'Perhaps I will become God myself.'This time he had a chance to obtain an even higher position than before.He certainly didn't know the opportunities this Devil's Blessing would open up for him, but his heart was beating faster for some reason.\u2014 I thought my thirst for power had subsided, but I guess it didn't.His demonic part kept craving power.Kang Yu had believed that as he gradually got stronger, his thirst would begin to fade with time, but each time there was a new opportunity to get stronger, he was enveloped in a suffocating desire to get it.'I guess I'll start by eating the Boer's body.' Kang Yu needed the Magi from the Boer's body to quench his thirst at least a little.Since he'd entered the Gate under the guise of a researcher, he should have left the Boer's body intact, but Kang Yu was not prepared to sacrifice an instantaneous gain of power for the government.'I'll leave the head for them. If I tell them that the rest of the body was lost in battle, there should be no problem.'Kang Yu, activating the Devourer's Power, approached the Boer's dead body.Magi wrapped around it in black smoke.Magi began to move from the monster's corpse to Kang Yu's body, with the faint sound of drying flesh.[Magi elevated by 4 units]'As expected, killing creatures from Hell gives much more Magi.'He'd just reached 60 units of Magi, and now he had 4 more. That was proof that the Boer was truly strong and possessed a lot of Magi.'Ah, I forgot to test my new special ability.' He'd been distracted by the Devil's Blessing and completely forgot that he received a new ability when he reached Rank 5.Kang Yu again opened the status window to learn more about the ability.\u2014 You\u2026 who are you\u2026? \u2014 Seon Soo's frightened voice came to him.He was shaking, and he looked at Kang Yu with the exact same look he had given to the monster before.Of course he was in a state of shock. Only moments ago, that terrifying creature had destroyed his entire team, and then Kang Yu killed that same monster in one blow.The corner of Kang Yu's lips raised as he strode towards Seon Soo.\u2014 Ah! Stay back! \u2014 He didn't have the strength to stand, and desperately shuffled backwards with his hands.Kang Yu was approaching him slowly.\u2014 I thought you'd be the first to die. Your survival wasn't part of my plan.\u2014 Don't go near me, I'm warning you!\u2014 You're upsetting me. We're from the same party. \u2014 Kang Yu squatted next to Seon Soo and put a hand on his shoulder.Seon Soo shouted in terror:\u2014 Are you going to kill me?!Kang Yu made his eyes wide, as if to say 'what nonsense.'\u2014 What are you talking about? How could I kill a member of my own team?Seon Soo didn't say anything.\u2014 You seem to have the wrong idea about me. I'm not that bad, Seon Soo. \u2014 Kang Yu put his hand on the guy's head and cracked a smile. \u2014 There's still work for you, you can't die now. \u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When Kang Yu saw that, he swiftly kicked his head like a ball.The guy's teeth cracked and his mouth bled.Kang Yu again put his hand on the shoulder of the trembling man.\u2014 Well, I'll ask again. Who gave you that order?\u2014 Ki\u2026 Kim Yeong Hoon.\u2014 Kim Yeong Hoon? \u2014 As far as Kang Yu knew from previous conversations, that was the name of the Mir Guild's Commander.'They said he's a handsome man with second generation wealth, and he's also talented.'

Because the Red Rose is helping me?\u2014 It's because Mir needs to look better than Red Rose\u2026'Huh, he's dumber than I thought.' Kang Yu dropped his fake smile.The girl in the blue dress had admired Yeong Hoon so much that Kang Yu grew an interest in him, but it turned out he was simpler than expected.\u2014 Do you have a picture of him?\u2014 Yes\u2026 I do. \u2014 Seon Soo pulled out his phone from his pocket and quickly found a photo.The person in it looked very young and attractive.'What?' Kang Yu looked at the photo again and squinted his eyes.It was definitely the first time he saw the person in the photo, but it reminded him of someone.'Kim Si Hoon?' For some reason, the young man resembled Si Hoon. 'Maybe it's because they're both beautiful.'But when it comes to beauty, Si Hoon was superior.Kang Yu didn't brood long about this, and returned the phone to Seon Soo.\u2014 So I was just involved in that idiot's revenge, right?\u2014 Pr\u2026 I'm sorry! I just got the order and there was nothing for me to do but follow it! \u2014 Seon Soo hurriedly said, folding into a bow on the floor.\u2014 You say that, but you really followed that order diligently.\u2014 It's\u2026\u2014 That's okay. After all, life is about helping each other. If you agree to work for me, I'll look past this matter.\u2014 I\u2026 I'll do anything, just say the word!\u2014 Hhha. Don't worry about it. My request won't be difficult. It's rather quite the opposite, it may even benefit you.Seon Soo stared at Kang Yu, confused.Kang Yu just smiled.Meanwhile, in front of the Gate's entrance.\u2014 Shut up, everybody! Quiet, please!The journalists, smelling a great piece for headlines, were gathered in front of the gate.The officers had asked them many times to calm down, but to silence such a crowd was not so easy.A creature that had never appeared at the Gate before \u2014 an unknown monster.What's more, the Red Rose and Mir have teamed up to capture it.The journalists' eyes were burning with curiosity, adamantly staying in front of the entrance to get as much information as possible.\u2014 ! \u0410h?\u2014 They're coming out!Two men came out of the gate.\u2014 That's\u2026\u2014 Kang Seon Soo and Oh Kang Yu!\u2014 What happened to the other teammates?\u2014 Did they die in the clutches of the unknown monster?The crowd excitedly watched Kang Yu and Kang Seon Soo coming out of the gate.\u2014 What happened? \u2014 The reporters were quick to ask Kang Yu while extending the microphone to him.The man ignored their questions and instead shouted loudly:\u2014 Quick\u2026 call an ambulance! \u2014 Kang Yu placed Seon Soo on the ground.\u2014 \u0410h?\u2026The crowd collectively cried out, noticing the strange appearance of the guy.Seon Soo's whole face was covered in blood and his body was covered in terrible wounds.\u2014 Ahh! S\u2026 sav\u2026 \u2014 Seon Soo moaned in pain.He stretched out a trembling hand, as if asking for help.\u2014 It was\u2026 it was like\u2026They began wondering what could've happened at the gate to put Seon Soo in this state.'Terrible.' In other words, it was impossible to describe this situation.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksKang Yu had a frightened expression, and he clenched his hands as if he was gathering his courage to speak.\u2014 We were fighting an unknown monster\u2026 and that's when it happened.\u2014 In that case\u2026 the other Players\u2026\u2014 Yes. Only Seon Soo and I survived. The other Players\u2026 they're all dead, \u2014 Kang Yu said with a serious expression, and bit his lip.When people heard about the death of Seon Soo's party, they began to chatter amongst themselves again.\u2014 Were\u2026 the talented newcomers of the two guilds defeated?\u2014 How strong was that monster\u2026\u2014 Hurry up! We need to tell the whole Hwaran squad as soon as possible, let them send their men in there!Knowing that even the two Players talented enough to be sponsored by the most powerful guilds could not stop the monster was enough to spark fear in their hearts.They understood that if they did nothing about it, the monster would probably break through the Gate eventually.Kang Yu, looking at the frightened people, continued in a low tone:\u2014 You don't have to worry. The unknown monster has been destroyed. But\u2026 victims\u2026\u2014 Woah!\u2014 Kang Yu, did you defeat him?Kang Yu heard the crowd cheering.A shadow clouded over his face as he bent his head down.\u2014 No. It wasn't me who destroyed the unknown monster.\u2014 In that case\u2026\u2014 The hero who destroyed the monster and saved my life is Kang Seon Soo.\u2014 Woah! \u2014 The crowd, listening to Kang Yu, made a brief exclamation.He sighed heavily, put his hand on Seon Soo's body, and spoke in a trembling voice:\u2014 Seon Soo, who fought the monster, realized that the situation was critical when he saw his comrades die. So he told me to run away and was left alone with the creature. \u2014 He continued to act frightened. \u2014 However, I could not escape by myself, so I stayed until the end to help Seon Soo. Even though he was risking his life, he fought boldly to the end and won. It was a very hard and tragic fight. \u2014There was silence.\u2014 After he won, Seon Soo repeated the names of his teammates until he fainted.After hearing Kang Yu's full story, people stared at Seon Soo with looks of pity and heartbreak.The Player who had fought bravely and saved a man's life, now unconscious.The story of him calling out his dead teammates before he fainted tore at their hearts.Journalists adored such stories and could already see great headlines.\u2014 Could you tell us more? \u2014 The journalists, trying to find out more for their articles, moved their microphones closer.They no longer showed interest in the hero lying on the floor.It didn't matter to them at all whether he was hanging on a thread from death, in pain, or asking for help.Now, they were only interested in the heartbreaking story that could become a great story on paper.\u2014 When we entered the gate, we felt a spiraling breath of anger.\u2014 That means\u2026\u2014 That's right. The monster was waiting for us near the gate.The journalists, waiting for Kang Yu to continue, swallowed nervously.\u2014 The moment we laid our eyes on the monster, it was terrifying. There was no way we expected to meet a monster that strong at the Level B Gate.\u2014 What did it look like?\u2014 Just like the officers described it: looks like a lion on the outside, but with five paws. Each player in the Seon Soo party died from a single blow.\u2014 Huh? From\u2026 from a single blow?\u2014 How is that possible\u2026?Everyone knew that the other players were quite strong, even if they weren't as strong as Seon Soo.From the start, the Mir Guild sponsored groups of strong Players, so everyone thought that all Mir Players were powerful fighters.\u2014 We realized we didn't stand a chance at winning and thought about leaving. But if we did that, the beast could have followed us from the Gate, and there could have been human casualties.\u2014 Oh.The more Kang Yu talked, the more tension there was among the journalists. They gripped their microphones tighter and listened carefully.\u2014 At that moment, Seon Soo told me that we couldn't let the monster come out and ordered us to block the passage.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 Seon Soo and I fought hard, but the wounds made it hard to fight. I've already told you the rest. In the end, Seon Soo decided to take all the risk himself and just barely managed to defeat the unknown monster.The reporters exclaimed in admiration when they heard of Seon Soo's heroic behavior.Suddenly, one of the reporters asked Kang Yu a question:\u2014 But it looked to us like Seon Soo was aggressive towards you when you met outside the Gate. What do you think about that?Suddenly, everyone was silent waiting for his reaction, but Kang Yu continued quietly:\u2014 After we went inside, Seon Soo told me the reasons for his behavior. He was worried about a Player who just started getting Red Rose's support, so he tried to keep me from entering the gate alone to catch the unknown monster.\u2014 Ah\u2026 I see.\u2014 I'm sorry that I didn't realize his intentions earlier. \u2014 A warm tear rolled down Kang Yu's cheek. \u2014 He is the savior of my life and the hero of our time.\u2014'The Appearance of a Hero who Defeated an Unknown Monster\u2026''Fighting Emotions. The Reason He Fought to the End\u2026''Newcomer of Mir Guild Kim Seon Soo was immediately taken to the hospital in an unconscious condition.

Humanity never loses its craving for heroic stories.People always remember the names of famous heroes, and Seon Soo perfectly conveyed the heroic image.\u2014 Were your tears during the interview fake?\u2014 Of course.\u2014 What's the purpose of this play?\u2014 To upset them, of course. \u2014 Kang Yu downed a gulp of coffee, leaning against the table, and continued indifferently: \u2014 It was only by introducing them to a hero that I could move the attention away from me. \u2014If people recognized him as a 'hero,' it would cause a lot of problems.If there were benefits to becoming famous, he wouldn't have minded telling the press that he was the one who killed the unknown monster. However, he wouldn't gain any benefits if he became famous now.'On the contrary, it will be uncomfortable.' The more attention he drew to himself, the more limited his actions would be.Besides, considering that Kang Yu often acts outside the rules of law, having the journalists watch his every move would not be good for him.He didn't want to put himself at a disadvantage.'But I won't be able to hide all my life.' If Kang Yu continues to improve at the same pace, it'd only be a matter of time before people will start noticing him. 'When that moment comes, then I'll think about what to do.'If he couldn't avoid that situation, it was better to look at what benefits would come with it.Kang Yu placed his cup of coffee on the table and looked at Young-ju.Taking a deep breath, she asked:\u2014 So what really happened at the Gate?She knew that Kang Yu couldn't have been hurt by the unknown monster at all.He wasn't the kind of person to be easily frightened or hurt.No matter how strong the monster was, it could never have bested Kang Yu so easily.\u2014 It's not a big deal. Seon Soo's guys were the first to fight the monster, and then I killed it when I had the chance.\u2014 Are you sure the monster was the one who hurt Seon Soo?\u2014 That's right.\u2014 It looks more like he hurt himself or someone did it to him.\u2014 You're wrong. \u2014 Kang Yu was calm in answering her questions, which was sounding more like an interrogation.Young-ju looked at the man with suspicion.Every time she talked to Kang Yu, somewhere inside, she felt a stifling pressure.He was a more talented Player than she originally thought.But the problem was that he had more than just 'talent.'For his own benefit, he was willing to do anything, no matter how immoral or unethical. He showed no remorse for his actions.'I don't think I'm raising a kitten, but a tiger cub.'The girl, wary with doubt, shook her head and continued:\u2014 Hmm\u2026 First of all, tell me more about this unknown monster. \u2014 Even if he held the truth of the fight from her, the priority of today's meeting was to learn more about the monster.Kang Yu nodded and told her about the Boer. Of course, he kept quiet about the 'satiated' stage, when the monster becomes completely harmless.\u2014 A monster with this much power in the Level B Gate\u2026 \u2014 She crossed her arms behind her head, staring blankly into the distance.If Kang Yu was telling the truth, the monster was so strong that it was hard to believe it would even appear at the Level B Gate.'It should've appeared in Level A, or even higher.'Even if a monster like that appeared at the Level A Gate, it wouldn't be an ordinary monster but an 'elite' one.Although there seems to be a small difference between the Level A and B Gate, the strength of the monsters actually differ drastically.'According to the news, a lot of strange things have been happening lately.'Starting with the appearance of the Devil's Teachers and now an unknown monster.Ever since that day, five years ago, the world has been looking for stability, and because of what is happening now, the world is being shaken again.'Come to think about it, the appearance of the Player Oh Kang Yu coincides with the beginning of all these strange things.' It's hard to believe, but only a month has passed since then.Around the same time he became a Player, the Devil's Teachers appeared, and monsters with strength beyond their Gate levels showed up.'But this is all just coincidence.' Young-ju shook her head and stared at Kang Yu.Kang Yu's unusual pace of development did not prove his connection to the Devil's Teachers nor the unknown monsters.She couldn't suspect him without good reason.'What's more\u2026' The girl looked at the man sitting in her office blowing the steam from his cup of coffee.Frankly, she didn't think he was a particularly nice person.However, no matter how selfish he was, he didn't look like the Devil's Teacher, who was certainly a real psychopath.'He's not that bad.' At least that's what she wanted to believe. 'Anyway, he and I are in the same boat right now.'Because of what happened, there were rumors about Oh Kang Yu, and how he's sponsored by the Red Rose Guild.Of course, there aren't as many articles about him as there are about the hero Seon Soo, but if you searched deeply enough, you could still find some information.In particular, he was being labeled as a reliable partner of Red Rose.\u2014 What are you thinking so hard about?\u2014 Huh? Nothing\u2026\u2014 I have a question for you.\u2014 You have a question? \u2014 She looked surprised, and tilted her head to the side.He continued quietly:\u2014 Do you know anything about the 'splinters of the rift?' \u2014 Kang Yu wanted to learn more about the notifications that appeared when he killed the creatures from Hell.There was a chance Young-ju would know something about it.\u2014 No, it's the first time I've heard of it.\u2014 Huh\u2026 I see.\u2014 What is this about?\u2014 When I killed the unknown monster, I received a notice that I destroyed a Level B splinter.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 She nodded and her eyes sparkled with interest. \u2014 I'll try to find out about it. \u2014Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksKang Yu nodded his head and continued:\u2014 There's one more thing.\u2014 Tell me.\u2014 When are you planning to tell me about your request?\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju's facial expression darkened as soon as it was mentioned.Kang Yu spoke seriously:\u2014 I think you heard about how they call us reliable partners. However, there is one unresolved issue in our relationship.The girl didn't say anything.\u2014 You've already invested so much in me. Would it hurt if I suddenly refuse to comply with your request?\u2014 Oh\u2026?\u2014 Don't worry too much about it. If your request isn't too unreasonable, I'd like to continue our partnership, too. \u2014 Kang Yu kept talking and leaned over the back of the chair in front of Young-ju's desk. \u2014 So, isn't it time to open the veil of mystery? \u2014\u2014 Ha\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju let out a sigh.When the girl realized there was no way to evade this, she started talking:\u2014 There are some bastards who call themselves the Devil's Teachers.Kang Yu remained silent.\u2014 I can't say how many of them there are or when exactly they came out. But lately, they've been showing themselves.\u2014 Go on\u2026\u2014 These are psychos who kidnap people to sacrifice them. Our guild, united with the government, is trying to track them down.\u2014 So\u2026\u2014 So I was planning on asking you to help us destroy these Devil's Teachers once we catch their trail. We don't have any solid proof yet, but we're sure this pseudo-religion is very strong.A heavy silence filled the room.Kang Yu finally understood why Young-ju was going around gathering strong Players.'She plans to wage war against the Devil's Teachers.' It's no surprise that one of the largest guilds was aware of this situation, considering the government was trying to gather information on them.'Not bad.'No, it was more than just 'not bad.'If Kang Yu, who was initially pursuing the Devil's Teachers anyway, could get the support of a large guild and the government, it'd be great.'The only thing I don't know is\u2026'Kang Yu, with a frown, said:\u2014 Why are you so interested in destroying them?Chae Young-ju didn't answer, and kept her lips pressed together firmly.It was clear why the government is after them.The main purpose was certainly to ensure the safety of the civilians.But such a thing wasn't exactly Young-ju's responsibility.She was no law enforcement officer, so she should have no reason to hunt them.Of course, if a person was acting according to their morals, he or she would want to stop these Devil's Teachers.But Young-ju, as a leader, should first and foremost take care of her subordinates.She couldn't put the guild in danger just to satisfy her sense of justice.'She won't benefit from it either, unlike me.' Kang Yu had already received quite a few Magi through their ritual.Since she wasn't interested in Magi, she had no other reason to go to war with them.\u2014 First of all, I'm not volunteering to do this for free. If we catch them, we will receive decent compensation from the government.\u2014 Oh, so the reward is the rea\u2026\u2014 Besides that, I have another reason. \u2014 Young-ju quietly cut off Kang Yu's words.Kang Yu could feel anger coming from the girl.Her hatred was so strong that it made her feel like her lungs were filling up with fluid.'She really is strong.'Feeling Young-ju's murderous hatred, Kang Yu thought this.It was the first time that he felt her strength like this.'This is why she's at the top of the Korean Players.'He could barely contain himself from inviting her to fight and find out how strong she is.\u2014 At their hands, one of our Players died. I can't let it go on like this. Absolutely not, \u2014 she said in a cold, icy tone.'It must have been someone important to her,' he thought. It was easy to guess from how emotional she was acting.Kang Yu nodded affirmatively and responded seriously:\u2014 I understand. I will fulfill your request.\u2014 Thank you\u2026\u2014 I told you I'd pay you back properly.Saying that, the man changed the subject.\u2014 Did you do what I asked?While Young-ju had called him to find out more about an unknown monster, Kang Yu had come to pick something up.\u2014 Yes. \u2014 Young-ju took a rectangular card out of the drawer.It had a picture of Kang Yu and permission to enter the S-level gate.\u2014 I'll ask you again just in case: you're not going hunting there, are you? If you are, I can't give it to you.\u2014 For the hundredth time, I'm not going to.\u2014 So why do you need that pass?\u2014 There's something there I want to check. \u2014 Kang Yu smiled a little and took the S-level gate pass.After sticking the card in his pocket, he left the Red Rose building.On his way to the parking lot, he opened his status window.'I can finally use it.' He opened the status window and looked at his special ability of Rank 5.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The stronger the creature you call, the more Magi is used.*The called creatures will see you as their master.*This ability can be used every three months.]'I can finally test it.' Kang Yu looked at his special ability of Rank 5 with expecting eyes.A feature that allowed him to summon a creature from Hell and make them his 'pet.'The value of this ability was dependent on the creatures he'd call.'It would be wonderful to make a Boer my 'pet\u2026''A Boer possesses power that only Players above 7th rank could oppose. Or so he guessed.'What a shame.' Kang Yu was thirsty for power. 'I can't use that ability more than once every three months.'In that case, it was important to choose carefully and call on the most powerful and appropriate creature.'That's why I got this card.' Kang Yu took the S-level gate pass out of his pocket.There was only one reason why he didn't test this earlier and instead waited for the pass to be made.'Splinters of the rift appear at the Gate.'And it wasn't just them.When Kang Yu arrived on Earth, the first place he appeared was at the Gate.'The Gate may be the bridge between Earth and the other worlds.' Otherwise the creatures from Hell would've gone straight to Earth, not the Gate.'The higher the level of the Gate, the stronger the creatures who appear.' That was a fact already proven during the Boer hunt.However, by that logic, then it was strange that Kang Yu, lord of the Ninth Thousandth Circle of Hell, arrived in the E-level Gate.'Although it's not completely unreasonable.' His Powers had been sealed when he arrived on Earth.And now, as his level increased, the force sealing his Man Ma Jung was weakening, and thanks to the Devourer's Power, he could gain more Magi and recover his strength. But it was a fact that when he arrived on Earth, he was indeed very weak.From this perspective, then everything would make sense.'Anyway, I'm sure that stronger creatures appear in higher level gates.'Which means Kang Yu needs to go to a high-level gate to call a strong monster.'Level S\u2026' Kang Yu excitedly looked at his gate pass and remembered Young-ju's warnings.The S-level gate was the highest-level gate available in Korea, with only two entrances in the country: Suwon and Pohang.(\u00a0,\u00a0\u00a0)'I heard there is an SS Level Gate and even higher abroad,' Kang Yu thought, 'but that's not possible at the moment.'The areas around Gates at the SS Level and beyond were completely fenced off, denying entry to anyone without a pass. The monsters that lived there were simply too powerful.Some known locations were Hokkaido in Japan and Shanghai in China.Since these two places are heavily populated with monsters, people do not venture there, and the government tries their best to keep those areas separate from the outside world.'In the end, the only one I can gain access to is the S level gate.' Kang Yu headed for the parking lot, thoughts of the remote places with higher level Gates on his mind.'It's so much more convenient to have a car.' Kang Yu, after dealing with the Boer, had asked Young-ju not only for a gate pass but also for a car.Of course, his wasn't as cool as Young-ju's car.'And yet, she said it was worth a few billion won.'Kang Yu had been informed about all the features of the car before he was given the keys, but he had absolutely no interest in brands or such small details; it didn't matter to him what kind of car it was as long as he could drive it.He opened the gate and grabbed the steering wheel.Kang Yu had wasted no time in getting his driver's licence, so he had no problem driving.[The route to Suwon has been laid out.]Kang Yu quickly found the location of the S-level Gate in Suwon with his navigation device, and decided on the best route to get there.'As expected of a Level S Gate.' There were no other Gates or Players in its area.Instead, there were government and military units everywhere, guarding the area.'This is where they say the first squad of Hwaran is based.'The first and second squads guard the gate 24 hours a day in case any of the monsters got out.\u2014 Identity confirmed. Entry permitted.Kang Yu handed his pass to one of the Hwaran Squad gate guards and went inside.\u2014 Oh! \u2014 A cry of admiration came out of Kang Yu's mouth upon entering the gate.Inside the S-level gate, there were many lakes surrounded by rocks from all sides.\u2014 It's spacious. \u2014 Kang Yu couldn't even see the edges of this gate.Kang Yu wasn't sure of the exact size, but compared to a low-level gate, it was enormous.'I think it was said that this gate is the size of Seoul.'Remembering the information Young-ju had told him about this gate, he used the power of the Observer to avoid monsters. Kang Yu reached a remote cliff and prepared to call on a creature from Hell.'Hell Monster\u2026' Kang Yu couldn't stop thinking of the Boer.In some situations, the Boer was much stronger than other demons living in Hell.However, no matter how strong he was, he was still different from the demons capable of thinking and reasoning.Humans are weaker than lions and tigers, but they were the ones who owned the Earth. It was the same in Hell. It wasn't the strong monsters who ruled, it was the intelligent demons.'That's why you can control Hell's creatures.'And if it's possible to subdue their will, then it's also possible to direct their killing force in the right direction.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'My goal is Cerberus.'The Cerberus was the most powerful creature living in the Third Thousandth Circle of Hell, which even demons of the Fourth Thousandth and Fifth Thousandth Circle of Hell could not oppose.\u2014 Well, let's begin. \u2014 Kang Yu closed his eyes and began to focus.Powerful Magi began to emit from his body.He was using as much Magi as he could.Drops of cold sweat trickled down his forehead.Because of how Magi evaporates, wind was circling around him, like a storm about to start.The soil, unable to withstand the power coming from Kang Yu, started to crack.The ground turned red, divided by thick cracks. It became completely dried up, as if all life was sucked from it.'Now!' At the right moment, his special ability began to take effect with all his Magi spilling out.[You used the special ability of the 5th rank of 'Master of Hell creatures' (Rank: S)][Creating a rift to apply the ability]Along with the notices, a blue crack appeared in the air, similar to broken glass.The crack gradually increased in size until it formed a twenty-meter blue gate.\u2014 A blue gate? \u2014 Kang Yu, who was tired and confused, didn't realize he was speaking out loud.Usually, the gate was white, gray, or black.Kang Yu had never heard of a blue gate.'Did I screw up?' Furrowing his eyebrows, he looked at the gate.But he could feel his Magi inside that very gate.Besides, the failure message hasn't come up yet.[A rift has been successfully created][Magi, blending in with Man Ma Jung, has created a wider rift][System error has lost communication with the outside world][Gates will open to RNO]\u2014 What? \u2014 Kang Yu, reading the notices before him, frowned. \u2014 What the hell is RNO?Not understanding what was written, Kang Yu's face gradually grew darker.[Hell Creature Calling commenced]From the 20-meter blue gate, a bright light shone, drowning out everything.Gradually, the light began to fade and a creature crawled out of the gate.\u2014 What\u2026 that's\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu mumbled quietly when he gazed at the monster.Black scales.Two wings.Two bright reptile-like eyes.\u2014 A dragon? \u2014 A dragon was coming out of the Blue Gate, standing at its full height.Notifications sounded again.[The call of a Hell Creature has been completed!][You have called Echidna (Rank: S) \u2014 Half-snake-Half-Female][Player Oh Kang Yu is now the owner of Echidna. If the level of devotion declines, attacks from the called creature are possible.]Kang Yu, after reading the notice, pressed his lips together firmly.The creature named Echidna was looking at her new master, who was standing on a cliff with a serious expression.He was frowning not because he now had a dragon, but because of her appearance.She was breathing so quietly that it seemed like she was about to die.Her wings were so thin that they could be pierced with any sword.Small pieces of flesh were hanging between her wings.Covered with stab wounds, Echidna was bleeding scarlet blood.'What is happening now?' The creature called by his ability was ready to fall dead at any moment.While Kang Yu was at a loss at what just happened and how it happened, Echidna was slowly approaching him, gasping weakly for air.At that moment, people's silhouettes appeared from the blue gate that the monster had just come from.\u2014 Huh? \u2014 Kang Yu looked at the people who came out of the gate in bewilderment.There were five of them.It was as if they had just finished a fight, and they were brushing dust off themselves.\u2014 \u00ab#%:<%\u2116\u00bb@%!!!A young man with golden hair, who appeared to be their leader, noticed Kang Yu and immediately started waving his hands.'Is he talking to me?' Kang Yu squinted, watching the people shouting at him in an incomprehensible language.Kang Yu used the Power of Common Language to understand what the strangers were saying.By using the Power, the language that sounded alien before, Kang Yu could translate their words.\u2014 It's dangerous!

Kang Yu looked at the young man with golden hair who was waving at him.'Are those foreign players?' The leader had long golden hair and a typical European appearance, wearing enviable powerful armor and grasping a golden sword.He didn't look at all like the usual Players he ran into.'Wait a minute\u2026' Kang Yu looked more carefully at the Players, frowning.Each of them held some kind of weapon: a hammer, a shield, a bow, and a staff.The man with the shield and the dark-haired woman with the bow was nothing unusual.But there was a short girl with golden hair, holding an onion\u2026'Dwarves and elves?' Kang Yu thought they were humans at first, but now he realized they were all round-faced dwarves and blond elves. 'What kind of party is this? They look like characters in a novel.'Kang Yu gawked at them with a baffled expression.The elf at the head of the group stepped closer to Kang Yu and loudly yelled:\u2014 Hey?! Hurry up!!!\u2014 Ronald, calm down! \u2014 The elf with a bow stood in front of the blond elf. \u2014 Look at the dragon! He's almost dead! \u2014\u2014 Oh\u2026\u2014 He won't hurt people anymore.\u2014 Phew, thank God. \u2014 The elf with golden hair took a deep breath as if coming to his senses.\u2014 Who are you\u2026? \u2014 Kang Yu asked in their language, using the Power of the Common Language.The elf calmly answered his question in a polite manner:\u2014 I am the third prince of the Arnan Republic, Ronald Arnan.\u2014 The Republic of Arnan?\u2014 Yes. And you are?Kang Yu, confused as to what was going on, was still staring at the group across him with bewilderment.His mind was trying to put the puzzle pieces together: the gates opened through RNO, Arnan Republic, and Ronald.'Did they\u2026 come from another world?'The two facts known to Kang Yu were not enough. He knew the gate was opened through something called RNO, and along with the dragon called out of it, people had come from the gate.What's more, these people were dwarves and elves.The guy was increasingly inclined to believe the theory that they must have come from another world.While Kang Yu was lost in thought, he heard Echidna make an agonizing groan.He lifted his head and saw Echidna watching him, wounded and breathing with difficulty.'Oh shit.' Kang Yu realized that the monster he had just tamed might die immediately.But he had waited over a week just for this moment.'I'll have to treat her.' If he missed the opportunity to tame this creature now, he'd have to wait three months until he was able to attempt calling another one.'That's unacceptable.' Even though three months wasn't a long wait and the absence of a 'pet' wouldn't make him feel deprived, he didn't want to lose the pet he had only just obtained.Kang Yu approached Echidna, who was ready to fall dead at any moment, and extended his hand to her huge body.\u2014 Wa\u2026 wait!\u2014 What the hell are you doing?!As soon as he reached out to Echidna, Ronald immediately screamed at him.Kang Yu turned his head in the stranger's direction and spoke in a serious tone:\u2014 She is my subordinate. I don't know why you're so eager to kill her, but you better give it up.\u2014 You lousy bastard!\u2014 So you're the master of this dragon!Ronald's party immediately raised their weapons and pointed them at Kang Yu.Ignoring them, he focused on tending the dragon's wounds.'She's bleeding a lot\u2026' There was a continuous flow of blood coming from the long cut along her body.Kang Yu used the Power of Blade to produce a small knife, and sliced his wrist with it.[The Power of Revival]Blood flowed from the cut he made.Filled with the power of regeneration, it seeped into Echidna's wounds.'Ew\u2026 phew\u2026 who\u2026?'Echidna's wounds began to heal at a great speed.The dragon that was just ready to fall to the ground raised her head and stared at Kang Yu.As if suddenly realizing something, Echidna mumbled in a calm voice:'Ah\u2026 So you're my master.'Her eyes, as large as a grown man, were filled with tears.'I'm sorry to appear in front of you like this.'Kang Yu didn't hear her the way he could hear people. Her thoughts went straight into his head.He gazed at the dragon with a serious expression.'I don't know what's going on, but like the notice said, she seems to think I'm her master. But this situation is\u2026'Kang Yu turned his gaze to Ronald's armed group.It wasn't difficult to guess who were the ones to wound Echidna.\u2014 You, show yourselves! I'm only going to ask you one question.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksKang Yu couldn't let them kill Echidna. Having to wait another three months would be tedious.It was clear from the group's eyes that they wouldn't leave until they finished what they had started, and that Kang Yu was now their enemy, too. As soon as they'd found out Kang Yu's relationship with the dragon, their speech style changed dramatically and they no longer showed courtesy to him. Therefore, there was no need for flattering conversations.He just needed answers.\u2014 Why are you trying to kill Echidna?\u2014 It's a terrible dragon!\u2014 What did she do? \u2014 Kang Yu started interrogating the enemy group.To be more precise, he was buying time to heal Echidna's wounds.'First, I'll find out what's going on.'All he'd wanted to do was summon a powerful monster from Hell.But he ended up summoning elves and dwarves along with the dragon. It was certainly not part of Kang Yu's plans.\u2014 He brought us drought and a plague! The magic of this dragon has killed dozens of city dwellers! Was that your order, too?! \u2014 Ronald shouted out in a voice full of hatred.'Drought and plague\u2026'There was definitely a lack of detail in his story.\u2014 It wasn't me who did all that\u2026 \u2014 The dragon mustered up the energy to speak.\u2014 Shut up, you dirty dragon! If you didn't do it, then who did?! \u2014 Ronald grew even angrier at Echidna's words and shouted louder than before.Kang Yu frowned and turned his eyes on Ronald's group.'It could have been a natural phenomenon, jerk.'Kang Yu felt like he had plunged into the Middle Ages, a period of witch hunting, when natural disasters were blamed on witches and all girls who looked suspicious were burned alive.'Well, I won't be able to find out the truth behind what happened.' Perhaps Ronald's beliefs were actually true, and the plague and drought was somebody's doing.After all, Kang Yu himself lived in a world where there was magic.You can't blindly think of every strange happening as just a natural phenomenon.'However\u2026'Kang Yu took a deep breath and turned his eyes back on Echidna.He was convinced that the dragon had nothing to do with the drought or the plague.And it wasn't because she gained his trust in the few minutes they'd gotten to know each other, no.Simply: how could she have caused a drought?Let's say the plague really was her handiwork, but in the event of a drought, she'd need\u00a0tremendous\u00a0power to dry the air to the point of causing drought.A force capable of destroying an entire nation.Echidna's power could hardly even be compared with the great demons of Hell, who were capable of much more.\u2014 Is that the only reason you're going to kill Echidna? Just because of this?\u2014 'Just because of this?!' Do you have any idea how much suffering the drought has brought to our people? What about the fact that our state is on its way to death?!\u2014 How should I know?\u2014 For the sake of saving our citizens, we must kill this dragon! \u2014 Ronald declared, his eyes filled with a sense of justice.Kang Yu narrowed his eyes as he stared at Ronald.'I don't like these kinds of jerks at all.'Kang Yu's most hated type of people.Those who justify their actions as 'doing their duty,' while closing their eyes and ears to all else and blindly rushing to end things their way.To put it bluntly, they're idiots with whom it's impossible to come to a compromise.'Hha\u2026 Hha\u2026'Thanks to Kang Yu's use of the Power of Revival, Echidna's lost breath began to recover.Her bleeding wounds had been healing at a tremendous rate while Kang Yu was distracting Ronald's group.'I bought enough time.'Deep wounds took much longer to heal, but at least the dragon was no longer at death's door.'My subordinate.' Kang Yu carefully examined Echidna's entire 20-meter body.Originally he'd planned on calling Cerberus, but the situation turned out different than he expected.Still, it wasn't that bad.'It's a dragon after all.' Kang Yu's ability to summon and conquer a dragon was proof of Kang Yu's power.He didn't know how different Echidna was from Cerberus, but a dragon could be trained, so it was incomparable with other creatures.'Sorry, but I can't let you kill Echidna. I've tamed her.' Kang Yu took his hand off the dragon and headed towards Ronald.Of course, Kang Yu had no absolute proof that it wasn't Echidna who caused the drought and plague.Even if she couldn't have caused the drought, there was still a chance that she might have caused the plague.It's very likely that Ronald really is a brave and righteous hero, and that Echidna is a brutally killing creature.'But what difference does it make?' All that mattered to Kang Yu was the fact that this dragon, by submitting to Kang Yu, now had a special value.It's necessary to take care of everything that can make a difference, and avoid anything that is more harmful than beneficial.That's why Kang Yu didn't care whether she was or wasn't a terrible monster.She had value.Kang Yu wasn't stupid enough to throw a winning lottery ticket in the garbage.\u2014 You devil! \u2014 The golden-haired man shouted out, raising his sword and throwing himself at Kang Yu, eyes burning with justice.Kang Yu grinned and said:\u2014 I really am the devil, dummy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For the weeping children! I, Ronald von Arnan, will execute you myself!Maryok, glowing in a holy gold color, started coming out of his body. His long blonde hair began to develop in the wind, reminiscent of a scene from a movie.Following his example, both the middle-aged man standing behind him with a shield and the dwarf holding a hammer moved towards Kang Yu.\u2014 Hha! Well done, Ronald! If you could catch the dragon, you can handle the devil too!\u2014 We'll have to drink dark beer later with our newcomers,\u2014\u00a0 Ronald said to the middle-aged man and dwarf.Hearing Ronald say these words, the cheeks of the girl dressed in a brown dress puffed into a pout.The elf standing next to her sighed and uttered a sigh:\u2014 Whatever you please. But Ronald, your opponent is the devil. Do you think you can handle it?\u2014 Whether I can do it or not, it doesn't matter! I just have to do it! \u2014 Ronald declared resolutely, and raised his sword to the sky.'Look at him, that's eloquence.' Kang Yu winced when he looked at Ronald's eyes, which seemed ready to burn with real flames.In this situation, he should have been trembling with fear.'What's wrong with these guys? They need to see a doctor.'Ronald and his party were lost in their own atmosphere of passion and excitement.The sharp sword of the golden-haired man suddenly flew towards Kang Yu.He reacted quickly and readied his black blade for battle.To his surprise, the elf's sword split in half and exploded.Its impact was comparable to a real bomb, shaking the ground around him.'I should be more careful.' Kang Yu had no idea that the sword could split into two and explode.'As expected, the equipment is helpful.' If Kang Yu had no equipment, he would have suffered from the unanticipated attack.But thanks to Moon Yeon Ho's armor and a few epic-level items, the blast in the air caused no damage to Kang Yu/While Kang Yu was thinking to himself about the benefits of his equipment, Ronald turned to his companions:\u2014 Get ready to defend.It was time for a retaliatory strike.[Power of Explosion]In Kang Yu's hands, the black smoke began to take on a spherical shape.Once the ball was fully formed, Kang Yu firmly clenched his fists.[Melting Rain]A special technique created by Kang Yu using the Power of Explosion.The sphere that had been the size of a basketball suddenly split into dozens of spheres the size of a billiard ball.Kang Yu lifted his hand slightly and the spheres flew towards Ronald's party.\u2014 Defense! \u2014\u00a0 The middle-aged man raised his shield. \u2014 Ouch! \u2014He screamed as his shield formed a blue wall in front of them.Kang Yu looked at it and couldn't hold back a grin.\u2014 Too bad. You failed.The dozens of spheres flying in their direction changed trajectory sharply and headed straight for the ground beneath them.The young man standing at the front of the party was sent flying by the force of the blast wave.\u2014 Hans! \u2014 Ronald cried out, and whipped his head to look at Kang Yu with hatred: \u2014 How dare you?! \u2014'You started it, idiot.' If someone saw the angry look on Ronald's face now, they'd think Kang Yu was the one who attacked first without warning.Kang Yu stared at the outraged blond man indifferently.\u2014 I'll never forgive you!\u2014 Neither will I, you jerk.The man was acting as if he'd already forgotten that he was the one to attack Kang Yu first.Kang Yu pushed off the ground and flew towards Ronald.\u2014 First rank fencing: Lightning Blade!'Why does everyone rush into battle loudly calling out the name of their technique?' It's easy to guess an attack from its name, so announcing it would only be a setback to destroying your opponent in one blow. 'It makes it possible to prepare the necessary defense.'Kang Yu sharpened his gaze and used the Power of Iron Curtain.As the name implies, the sharp swords flying towards Kang Yu were redirected like a hurricane. Just as they reached him, the blades ran into an invisible wall and rebounded back to the blond man.\u2014 Ronald!!!\u2014 You bastard!The dwarf and elf helped to block the counterattack while Ronald continued shooting attacks at Kang Yu.Kang Yu nonchalantly turned to the side and three arrows whizzed past his head. After successfully avoiding the attack, he swiftly raised his hand in the axe-holding dwarf's direction.[Lightning Strike]The charge instantly hit the target, and the dwarf was thrown far back, choking in pain.Kang Yu moved closer to finish what he started.\u2014 Take this! Fireball! \u2014 At the same time, someone shot at him.It turned out to be the girl standing behind him with the staff.Her attack was so strong that Kang Yu, who felt slight pain even through his armor, thought she posed a higher threat than the dwarf. Deciding to get rid of her first, he turned in her direction.Ronald, who had been thrown back, rushed at Kang Yu again.The golden light exuding from his body was proof that he was strong. The earth around him trembled like there was an earthquake.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'I guess he's not that weak.' Kang Yu glanced at the blond and decided to leave the girl alone for now.Ronald, with his holy power, was a little stronger than Moon Yeon Ho.In this state, he was most likely strong enough to kill a Boer.Kang Yu and Ronald faced each other, both in a fighting stance.Their golden and black forces merged in the air, destroying everything in their path.The golden sword split into two and exploded again.Because the explosion happened right in front of his eyes, Kang Yu's body was sent flying.\u2014 Ha! Did you see that, lousy devil?Kang Yu couldn't believe what was happening right now.'If I hadn't focused on getting rank 5, I'd be in danger.'Ronald's skills exceeded all expectations.Based on strength alone, he might well be stronger than Kang Yu.'Maybe he was hunting a dragon for a reason, though.' When he thought about saving Echidna, Kang Yu clicked his tongue impatiently.'However\u2026' Kang Yu's eyes gleamed coldly. 'He's only physically strong.'As Kang Yu approached Ronald, he screamed out loud:\u2014 Boomerang!Reacting to Kang Yu's scream, Ronald took out his sword and prepared to defend himself.Kang Yu, however, did not use a boomerang at all. Bending low, Kang Yu kicked at his opponent's legs\u00a0hard.Ronald bent over in pain, wrapping his arms around his bruised legs, and bawled.\u2014 You dirty demon! You said 'Boomerang!' \u2014 The man glared at Kang Yu with unforgiving eyes.'You're just stupid.' Kang Yu wasn't one of those fools who screamed the name of the attack in advance.Making use of his opponent's foolish habits had given the Player a huge advantage.\u2014 Ro\u2026 Ronald!\u2014 Ah\u2026 Everyone\u2026 everyone, run. He's too strong!\u2014 It can't be! You're telling me to leave you here?!\u2014 Hurry up! \u2014 Continuing to clutch onto his wounded legs, Ronald screamed.Hot tears rolled from his eyes.\u2014 Good job! \u2014 Kang Yu, as if watching a drama film, smiled lightheartedly and approached the blond man.\u2014 You\u2026 \u2014 Ronald scowled at him with a burning look.Kang Yu understood his anger but didn't hesitate to stand close to him.'This fight is already over.'For a soldier, the most important thing is his legs.If his arm had been cut off or his ribs had been broken, he could have continued to fight, but in a situation where his legs were hurt, everything was different.A soldier who was unable to move could only be compared to a vegetable given an automatic rifle.\u2014 Ah\u2026 h\u2026 hurry up, run! \u2014 Ronald wasn't stupid enough to not know the severity of the situation, so he tried his best to chase away his teammates.More than anyone else, he was aware of the hopelessness of his situation.'It's time to finish this.' Kang Yu, using Klink's power, created a bastard sword to pierce Ronald with.There was no compassion or hatred in his eyes.For Kang Yu, a 'fight' was nothing special.He'd always fought to survive. Emotion was an impermissible luxury.\u2014 Wait a minute!\u2014 Raina\u2026?At that moment, a dark-haired girl ran up and blocked Ronald with her body.Sobbing, she pleaded:\u2014 I\u2026 I beg you! Don't kill him! If he dies, the Arnan people will lose hope!Kang Yu didn't respond.\u2014 And more importantly\u2026 Ronald is the man I love very much.\u2014 Raina\u2026The girl named Raina kept crying and gently caressed Ronald's cheek.\u2014 I'm sorry to confess like this. But\u2026 but if not now, I may never get another chance.Looking determined, she turned to Kang Yu.\u2014 Take my life instead. I'll do anything you say. I'm begging you! Please let him live!Kang Yu listened to her pleas and pressed his lips tightly as he contemplated. Then, he said with a smile:\u2014 You know, that was brazen of you.Kang Yu walked slowly to Ronald and Raina as he kept talking.\u2014 What? With his death, will the people lose hope? What am I supposed to do about that? What does that have to do with me? You were the ones who attacked me first. I didn't do anything wrong, did I? If our roles were reversed and I was the one who begged for mercy, would you let me live? Would you? \u2014 He continued in cold blood: \u2014 No, right? It's impossible. You were armed, too. If you're going to use weapons capable of killing, you should also be prepared to die. \u2014Kang Yu grasped Ronald's hand.There was an explosion, and powerful Magi flowed from his hands.Kang Yu looked at the pair in front of him, screaming and shaking in terror, and continued in a low tone:\u2014 We're in reality, not a TV show.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kang Yu had defeated them fair and square.Even if he had cheated by shouting out a fake technique name, it was Ronald's own stupidity that led him to be fooled by such a childish trick.'What's nasty and dirty about that?'Ronald was the nasty one, for leading a whole group of five people to go against Kang Yu.'I wonder if that manhwa character felt the same way when he had to defend against a party all on his own.'If that was the case, then he must have felt injustice.Kang Yu brushed off the thought, not wanting to lament about it anymore, and formed another spherical charge of Magi to launch at the sweet couple.\u2014 Oh, by the way.\u2014 Uh, what?\u2014 Hmm\u2026Kang Yu waved his hand, and the balloon of Magi evaporated.As soon as the balloon disappeared, hope reappeared in Ronald and Raina's eyes.\u2014 I'm worried about your equipment.It was clear that Ronald's equipment wasn't cheap.Kang Yu would never wear it because of its flashy appearance, but if he sold it through Young-ju, he could make some good money.'Especially that golden sword.' Seeing it in action, it was easy to tell it was a high-end item. 'I wonder how much money I'd get from selling it\u2026'Kang Yu eyed Ronald's equipment and licked his lips eagerly.\u2014 What a terrible person! \u2014 Ronald exclaimed, realizing that Kang Yu was already planning to sell the equipment of someone he was about to kill.Kang Yu could care less about the guy's remarks, and created weapons using the Dark Spear Power.'It's enough to stab him in the throat with a spear.' Kang Yu approached Ronald with these thoughts in mind, when suddenly, a notification sounded.[It's been confirmed that a non-called creature has passed through the Gate.][System will remove now the foreign creatures.]\u2014 Huh\u2026? \u2014 Along with the unexpected notification, the bodies of Ronald and his party members became semi-transparent.Even though Kang Yu hurriedly threw a spear at the guy, it flew through the translucent body and stuck in the ground.\u2014 Oh shit! \u2014 Kang Yu cursed.Kang Yu wasn't happy to look at the notices that came in.'Why now?'How dare the system let the foreign creatures in and make them disappear so suddenly!? The system was at fault.Kang Yu, angry, kicked at the innocent soil and just watched with a sour look as the whole party dissolved right before his eyes.[Foreign creatures successfully removed by the system.]\u2014 Ugh\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu took a deep breath.'Just a second.' Before he could exhale, Kang Yu hurriedly turned his head towards the place where Echidna was.For a moment, Kang Yu thought the system would also bring Echidna back to her place of origin along with the 'foreign creatures.'\u2014 Phew, \u2014\u00a0 Kang Yu breathed quietly when he saw Echidna, still lying there and watching him.Fortunately, Echidna hadn't disappeared.'What kind of 'system' is this?' Kang Yu remembered that on his first day on Earth, he had also encountered the system. 'Some kind of protection from\u2026 the outside world?'It could probably be roughly compared to Earth's atmosphere protecting the planet from meteor collisions.It was the most likely explanation, considering the few known facts.'There was a system error when the gate opened.'Kang Yu definitely remembered that the gate opened to some place called RNO, which caused a system error that prevented closing the gate to the outside world.'I wonder if this has anything to do with the recent appearance of Hell's creatures at the Gates.'The appearance of unknown monsters began only recently.Judging by the timing\u2026\u2014 Huh? \u2014 That's when Kang Yu had a theory.'The moment Hell's creatures start appearing is about the same time I returned to Earth.' The probability that other monsters entered the gate because of the system malfunction he created was quite high.\u2014 If that's true\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu paused in perplexity. \u2014 Is it me who's causing the system malfunction? \u2014Based on the timing, that theory was possible.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu, baffled by these thoughts, put a hand on his head.It was making him feel a little uncomfortable.'Isn't there any way to restore the system?' In the current situation, the best thing to do was correct the error.But he didn't even know what the 'system' is or where it is, so it was impossible to come up with a plan.'Right now, the only thing I can do is catch as many Hellcats as possible.'Even if what he was doing was merely bailing water from a sinking ship, there was no other method at the moment.Kang Yu concluded it would be a good idea to ask Young-ju what she knew about the system, and went to Echidna .\u2014 Stay still a little longer, you need to be treated properly. \u2014 The healing power Kang Yu had used to stop her bleeding was nothing more than an emergency fix.It'd take a while longer for her to recover to a state where she can move around on her own.Kang Yu sliced open his wrist again and let the blood drip into Echidna's wound.She could hardly lift her head to look at him.\u2014 It's not me. I wasn't the one who caused the drought and the plague.\u2014 Okay.Tears flowed out from her large eyes.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 I said it wasn't me, that I had nothing to do with disasters, but nobody believed me. Will you believe me?Her voice was shaking.She had the look of an abandoned child wanting to find a loving person.Kang Yu knew that look very well.'It's the same as me.' His parents had left him early on in his childhood.He'd spent his entire childhood in an orphanage. He never even considered meeting his parents and being in their arms again.But he wanted to be loved by someone. He wanted to be taken care of and valued. He wanted his existence to feel needed.Echidna heavily reminded him of himself as a child.'We're in reality, not a TV show.' Kang Yu felt his chest tighten with pain and smiled bitterly.The words he'd just said to Ronald sharply returned to Kang Yu like a boomerang.Sad memories surfaced in his mind.'I have to answer her.'Echidna was a creature whom he had tamed, so she was destined to spend her life with him.But he wasn't going to give the following answer just because of that.\u2014 I believe you. Even if the whole world condemns you, at least I'll be on your side.Now Kang Yu was fully responsible for her.And he wasn't going to hide from this responsibility.He was not going to throw his 'pet' out on the street and only use her for his benefit.\u2014 You\u2026 \u2014 Echidna looked at Kang Yu in awe.She lightly licked at her wound with Kang Yu's blood dribbled over it. There was a cure in his blood that could help Echidna.Beads of sweat ran down his forehead.'I think I'm a little overwhelmed today.'A summon, a battle, and a cure.No matter how strong he was, even with the 5th rank, today's events were very tiring for Kang Yu.'I want to go back and get some rest.' For the first time, Kang Yu was eager to get rest.'But\u2026' The guy looked at the large, 20 meters tall Echidna. 'How do I get her out of here?'Bringing Echidna out of here like this would cause chaos in the world.In the worst case, Hwaran Squad will get involved and kill her.'Even if I explain everything, I still don't think they'd let it pass.'To present her as a 'pet' and get her out of the gate without any problems, she'd have to be at least as small as a human in height.'I've heard about some Players who tamed monsters.'But even then, Echidna was too big.She couldn't exactly roam around unnoticed by the Hwaran people.\u2014 Echidna, would you happen to know how to resize yourself?\u2014 Resize?\u2014 Yes, to the smallest possible size.Kang Yu wondered if she, like many other dragons, could transform.He looked at Echidna with anticipation.\u2014 I know how to do that.'Excellent!' When Kang Yu heard her answer, he nodded approvingly with a big smile.\u2014 Change to the smallest size possible.\u2014 Okay. \u2014 Echidna, with her wounds partially healed, nodded and started to whisper something in an incomprehensible language.Glowing brightly, her size began to shrink more and more.Kang Yu's eyes shone as he watched her transform to about 30 centimeters.'Oh, what a cutie.'A giant dragon in a small form gave off a very different impression.Now she looked even more like a pet.'I wonder if she can turn into a human?' While Kang Yu thought about it, he wrapped both arms around her small body to carry her.\u2014 It's okay, I can fly on my own.\u2014 Don't rush, your wounds haven't completely healed yet. \u2014 Kang Yu hugged Echidna closer to him and headed for the exit.Echidna raised her head and stared up at him. She murmured softly:\u2014 You\u2026\u2014 Mm-hmm?\u2014 Tell me your name.\u2014 Oh, right, I completely forgot to introduce myself.With the intense events that took place one after the other, he never got around to introducing himself.\u2014 Oh Kang Yu. My name is Oh Kang Yu.\u2014 Oh, Kang Yu\u2026 \u2014 Echidna, snuggled comfortably in his arms, whispered his name several times. \u2014 I'll remember that. \u2014\u2014 Hm?\u2014 Your name. I will remember it, \u2014 Echidna said confidently.Kang Yu smiled a little and nodded his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Echidna, having shrunk in size, aroused affection rather than annoyance.\u2014 I don't know what you mean\u2026 \u2014 Echidna answered, frowning.If an earthling had been asked, 'What is Earth?', he probably would have reacted in the same way.\u2014 Mm-hmm\u2026 Well, are there any countries where you're from? And what do people do there?\u2014 Ah\u2026 First of all, Arnan is the biggest country. And then\u2026 \u2014 Echidna continued her story.By her description, the RNO seemed like a fantastic place to Kang Yu.A world where swords and magic are used, where dragons live\u2026'Do the monsters at the gate come from the RNO?'There were no goblins or trolls in Hell. Those were monsters that exist thanks to Maryok, not Magi, unlike the Demons.The main difference between ordinary monsters and Hell's creatures like the Hellhound or the Boer appears to be their superior power. But that's not exactly true.'When the Boer appeared at the Level B Gate, it made a fuss and caused a problem. If it had appeared at least at the Level A Gate, it wouldn't have been such a big deal. After all, if you compare S class monsters to ordinary ones, the latter would seem much weaker.'Sooner or later everyone will be able to compare them, as they get to the higher level gates.Turning the wheel, Kang Yu continued:\u2014 Echidna, tell me about yourself.\u2014 About\u2026 me?\u2014 Yes. How did you live? How did Ronald find you?\u2014 I\u2026 I lived with my dad. But one day he went somewhere and disappeared.\u2014 Disappeared?\u2014 Yeah. After that, all I did was read. But one day, somebody came to me\u2026\u2014 Ronald.Echidna nodded her head. Kang Yu continued quietly:\u2014 You must have been lonely.\u2014 Yes. Very, \u2014 Echidna said in a sad voice.Kang Yu couldn't fully understand her feelings.He didn't understand loneliness.Since he was abandoned right after birth, he didn't have a single person he was close to. So he'd always been alone.It was the norm for him. How could he feel lonely if he'd never experienced having friends or family?\u2014 And how did the summon happen?\u2014 When I was fighting Ronald, I got the feeling that someone was calling me. And then suddenly there was a gate.\u2014 Mm-hmm.Kang Yu didn't know how the creature calling mechanism works, but it certainly didn't work by the caller's wishes.\u2014 Here we are.They'd arrived at Han Sol's shabby house.\u2014 So that's where your nest is\u2026\u2014 No, the word 'nest' isn't exactly right\u2026 And it's not my house. \u2014 Kang Yu felt awkward when he parked his car in the parking lot.Among the cheap domestic cars, Kang Yu's car stood out.'Maybe we should look for a new house?'At this point, Kang Yu didn't want to be separated from Han Sol and her mother.But they couldn't accept the fact that their house was too small and long worn out.It would have been nice to save some money and move into a new, whiter, and more spacious house.'As close to Red Rose's office as possible, to make it easier to get to them.'It was more important now than ever because he and Chae Young-ju were partners now.Kang Yu was more than satisfied with their current relationship, and he wanted to keep that friendship going. That's why he thought it would be a great idea to buy a house in that area.'We should go to PC Bang together sometime.' Kang Yu laughed when he remembered the image of Young-ju losing her temper.\u2014 Let's go.\u2014 Yes, let's go.Kang Yu and Echidna went inside the house.\u2014 Aah!There was a shriek in the living room.\u2014 What a cutie! \u2014 Han Sol was squealing, pulling Echidna out of Kang Yu's arms.She waved her wings and helplessly wiggled her short legs in the air.\u2014 Sa\u2026 save me, Kang Yu! \u2014 Echidna cried out.Watching Han Sol hug Echidna to her chest, Kang Yu gulped.'I envy you.'He had no idea that Echidna might not be happy being in Han Sol's arms.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu\u2026Echidna whined like Han Sol was putting her through torture.\u2014 Did you say her name was Echidna? Oh, look how cute she is!\u2014 I couldn't have imagined that your reaction would be so positive.\u2014 What do you mean? How could anyone resist such an adorable creature? \u2014 Han Sol's jaw dropped.Kang Yu grinned and continued:\u2014 It's still a monster.\u2014 It's cute, though. And friendly! \u2014 Han Seol exclaimed and pressed Echidna even harder into her chest.Kang Yu, who had always seen only the serious side of the girl, smiled at her behavior.\u2014 Sa\u2026 save me\u2026\u2014 It's a little hard on Echidna, so loosen your grip.\u2014 Oh, excuse me. I didn't realize that I squeezed her so hard.The girl relaxed her hold on Echidna and the dragon immediately flapped her wings and flew to Kang Yu, leaving behind a pouting Han Sol.'It seems that along with her size, her strength decreased.'If she had her original strength, she wouldn't have to ask Kang Yu for help.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Kang Yu, I'm afraid of her.\u2014 Don't worry, she doesn't have any bad intentions, \u2014 Kang Yu talked to her like a small child, stroking her head calmly.Echidna glanced at Han Sol again with fear, and then, giving in to Kang Yu's petting, she calmed down and rested her head on his arm.'She really is cute.' Kang Yu continued stroking Echidna's head with a gentle gaze.It seemed that the emotions he had forgotten in Hell were beginning to manifest themselves again.\u2014 Han Sol, how are you feeling? Is hunting going well?\u2014 Ah! Yes, of course. Our levels are going up pretty fast, so we'll soon move to the Level C Gate after we get rank 3.\u2014 That's good, \u2014 Kang Yu said quietly and nodded his head.Kang Yu wasn't at all surprised by the rapid growth.'After all, Kim Si Hoon is always with them.'He's a gifted player with a special ability of SSS class.Thanks to him being there to lead the party, each of them were developing rapidly as planned.'And Dae Su and Han Sol have basic skills that are not bad.'Even Eun Bi was much more capable than regular Players.They had the talent and ability to drive them forward, and Si Hoon was a capable leader. Kang Yu would have been more surprised if they were being promoted at a slower pace.\u2014 We're improving so quickly\u2026 It's amazing! It's all thanks to you, Kang Yu.\u2014 I didn't do anything.\u2014 You've done so much! Your hints from the first day of hunting really helped us out! And also\u2026 if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have dreamed of such a life\u2026 \u2014 The girl beamed at him.Her smile made Kang Yu feel warmer inside.'The desire to be loved.' Meeting Echidna had resurfaced the feelings he had long forgotten.The way he wanted to be loved as a child.'It's not a bad feeling,' Kang Yu thought. It felt pleasant to have someone treat him kindly.Kang Yu felt a strange feeling in his chest as he sat down on the sofa.\u2014 Ah! We should have a party to celebrate Echidna being with us. Tonight will be my treat!\u2014 Are you sure?\u2014 I managed to make some money from the hunts with Dae Su, Eun Bi, and Si Hoon. So now I can easily afford it, \u2014 said Han Sol with a big smile.She was no longer tormented by poverty like before.'Liberation from Tae Hyun must have played a big role.'Nevertheless, now she was smiling brighter than ever.Kang Yu nodded approvingly and said:\u2014 Okay, then let's start with kimchi\u2026\u2014 No kimchi jjigae.\u2014 But\u2026 why? \u2014 Kang Yu looked at the girl with puppy dog eyes.Han Sol huffed and continued:\u2014 You've been eating kimchi jjigae every day!\u2014 Well\u2026 yeah?\u2014 Isn't it starting to bother you?\u2014 It could never be annoying!She just put two incompatible phrases in one sentence: 'kimchi jjigae' and 'bother.'That could never happen.Kang Yu's genuinely confused gaze made the girl rub her temple like she had a headache.\u2014 Anyway, let's eat something more expensive today.\u2014 Something more expensive?\u2014 Tda! Look at this, Kang Yu! \u2014 She showed the guy a package with a gold sticker on it. \u2014 It's Hanu! The supermarket was selling this at a discount today!(P.P.: Hanu is the meat of a Korean cow. It's believed to taste better than imported and therefore more expensive.)\u2014 Hanu\u2026\u2014 Tonight we'll have delicious beef loin! \u2014 She cheerily headed to the kitchen with the packet of meat, a grin on her face.Kang Yu said sadly:\u2014 You can just put it in kimchi\u2026\u2014 It would be an abuse of such good meat! Do you understand, Kang Yu?\u2014 Okay\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu looked to the ground with a disappointed sigh.\u2014 It's time for bed.After Kang Yu's merry meat party, he got tired and laid down in bed.Echidna got up from the floor with a flap of her wings and laid down next to him.\u2014 Was it good?\u2014 It was wonderful. \u2014 She thought of the fragrant meat they'd just eaten and her body shivered in delight.Kang Yu grinned and laid her on his chest.\u2014 Today was a hard day, so let's get some sleep.\u2014 Okay. \u2014\u00a0 Echidna nodded her head and curled up.She quickly fell asleep, and he glanced at her, noticing her wounds were not fully healed.'If she transformed into a human, we wouldn't be able to sleep together like this,' he thought. Right now she just looked like a big lizard with wings, and it didn't make much difference whether she was a boy or a girl.If she could turn into a human, it would make things harder.'It's not bad the way it is now.' Kang Yu petted Echidna, who fell asleep on his chest, and closed his eyes.The fatigue he had accumulated over the course of the day plunged him into a deep sleep.The next morning, Kang Yu woke up from the bright sunlight grazing his skin through the window.\u2014 Huh? \u2014 At that moment, he felt something heavy on him.'Echidna?'If it was her, she seemed to weigh much more than yesterday. Kang Yu determined it was a little under 30 pounds of weight.The guy raised his head to look at what was on his chest.He saw a girl with waist-length black hair sleeping on his chest.\u2014 What in the\u2026? \u2014 Kang Yu was perplexed.She pulled at Kang Yu's shirt with her tiny hands and peacefully fell asleep.'What's going on?' Kang Yu frowned while staring at the girl he didn't know.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Breakfast is almost rea\u2026Kang Yu didn't know how to react, so there was a terrifying silence hanging in the room.The situation in which Kang Yu was lying down with a naked girl looking at herself looked rather strange, and Han Sol frowned.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026\u2014 This is a misunderstanding.\u2014 Why\u2026 she's\u2026 so small\u2026\u2014 I'm innocent, \u2014 Kang Yu said with injustice in his voice, looking at Han Sol, who was staring in shock.This was an unfair situation.How could he have known that E\u0441hidna would turn into a human in his sleep.'Judge, I'm not guilty.'It took Kang Yu a long time to explain everything to Han Sol.After Kang Yu finally explained the situation, Han Sol spent some time with E\u0441hidna in the living room.They put Han Sol's baby clothes on E\u0441hidna.\u2014 Any idea how that could have happened?When Kang Yu asked this to Echidna, she put her hands in front of her while trying to remember.\u2014 Last night\u2026\u2014 Last night?\u2014 Last night when I slept on Kang Yu, I felt some warm energy pouring into my body.No one knew how to respond.\u2014 I'm sorry, what?Kang Yu had a frown on his face. Han Sol, unsure what to make of this situation, looked at Kang Yu.E\u0441hidna continued:\u2014 Very warm\u2026 and strong energy\u2026'E\u0441hidna\u2026'\u2014 The power was spreading through the body\u2026 and I felt like we were becoming one.'Why are you doing this to me?'\u2014 It hurt at first\u2026 but then it felt good.'Did I do something to you? Is this revenge? Huh?'The longer she kept talking, the hotter Han Sol's accusing glare at him felt.\u2014 Kang Yu, you wouldn't happen to have\u2026\u2014 Nothing happened, \u2014 Kang Yu said after a heavy sigh.\u2014 You can turn back into a dragon, can't you?Kang Yu wasn't sure of her strength right now.When Kang Yu saw her strength shrink with her size last time, Kang Yu was scared that she wouldn't have the power to become a dragon again. That would be a problem.\u2014 I think I can, \u2014 she said, and swung her left hand to transform it into a wing.It was strange to see a person with wings instead of hands, but Kang Yu needed to make sure she could still return to her former state.\u2014 That's great.It would be beneficial if she could turn into a dragon or a person when the situation calls for it.After all, being a dragon, even a small one, she'd attract quite a lot of attention.'Although, maybe she would attract even more attention with that appearance.' Kang Yu glanced at E\u0441hidna.She had inhuman beauty. You'd think it was a doll that came to life and learned how to move.'I believe she will be able to handle herself.' At least she can transform whenever she wants.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu thought about the reason why E\u0441hidna was able to become human.He recalled the words she had said again.'Is it because she was tamed?'It's very likely that by using the Power of Revival on E\u0441hidna, some of his human energy was transferred to her through his blood.'Anyway, it doesn't matter as long as she can be a dragon again.'While Kang Yu was leaning back on the sofa, E\u0441hidna came up to him and sat down on his lap naturally.\u2014 What are you doing\u2026?\u2014 It's very comfortable.The feeling of soft skin on his knees stirred him up.'There will be problems if she continues to sit on my lap in human form.'When she sat on his lap as a dragon there was no problem, but in this situation, he felt like he was committing a crime.So Kang Yu lifted E\u0441hidna up and sat her down beside him.She looked up at the man with the gaze of an abandoned puppy.\u2014 You don't like it when I'm human?\u2014 That's not true. No matter how you look at it, you being in human form is much more convenient.\u2014 Then why won't you let me sit on your knees?\u2014 Um\u2026 How do I put this\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu felt sweat roll down his neck.He didn't know how to best explain the situation to her.Han Sol peeked out from the aperture, interrupted their conversation and called them to the table.\u2014 Breakfast is ready!With a sigh of relief, Kang Yu called back to her:\u2014 Yes! That sounds great.Avoiding giving Echidna an answer, the man headed for the set table.E\u0441hidna, watching Kang Yu retreat, puffed her lips out in a hurt manner.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Hmm\u2026 Today, we have to pick up some clothes for her.\u2014 Clothes?\u2014 Yes. My old clothes are very shabby, and the size is wrong. She needs new clothes.\u2014 Oh, that's right.Kang Yu looked at what E\u0441hidna was wearing. She didn't fit in Han Sol's old clothes.'Especially in the chest area.'Kang Yu coughed and turned to Han Sol again.\u2014 Where should we go?\u2014 There's a mall nearby. Will you be coming with us, Kang Yu?\u2014 No. I have some things to do, so I can't go with you. I'll leave Echidna in your care.\u2014 Kang Yu, you're not coming with us\u2026? \u2014 After hearing his response, E\u0441hidna gripped the ends of her shirt unhappily.Kang Yu gently stroked her on the head and said:\u2014 Stay with Han Sol today. I'll be back tonight.\u2014 Okay\u2026 \u2014 She nodded a little and bit her bottom lip.When Kang Yu looked at her again, he thought for a moment.'For E\u0441hidna to exist as a human being, she'll need an ID card.'If she didn't have an ID, they may face a lot of problems in the future.Kang Yu thought about how he'd make identification documents for Echidna when he remembered Young-ju.'I was going to meet her anyway.'Now he had another reason to meet with her.'I need a permanent pass to enter the S-level gate.'The pass he received before was temporary, and it won't work a second time.That's why Kang Yu was planning to find Young-ju and ask her for a new pass.'The S-level gate\u2026'Originally, Kang Yu did not plan to enter such a high gate so quickly.He was going to hunt at the Level A and Level B Gate, gain some experience, and then move on to the Level S Gate after gaining Rank 6.But with E\u0441hidna's domestication, his plans changed dramatically.While picking at the food with his fork, Kang Yu glanced at E\u0441hidna.'With the help of E\u0441hidna, I can hunt with ease at the Level S Gate.'No matter how you spin it, she was a dragon.She could easily fight against a couple of S-level monsters.In fact, Kang Yu himself could handle such monsters.But the problem was if he was caught in an unexpected situation.A couple of S-ranked monsters is nothing, but if he was attacked by more monsters, even Kang Yu would have a hard time coping with them.It's in this kind of situation that E\u0441hidna's strength would greatly help him.\u2014 I'll give you a lift to the store.\u2014 Thank you, Kang Yu.After everyone finished eating, Kang Yu called Young-ju on his way to the store to let her know he was dropping by her office.E\u0441hidna made a sound of disappointment as they went separate ways.\u2014 Don't make such a moody face. I'll see you tonight.Echidna was stubbornly clinging to him. Once Kang Yu convinced Echidna to let him go, he headed straight to the Red Rose office.After entering the building with a pass from Young-ju, he went to her office, like always.\u2014 It's me.\u2014 Ah, come in.Kang Yu opened the door and walked into the spacious office.\u2014 So, what business did you come in for today?\u2014 I have a request for you.Kang Yu told her everything that had happened at the Level S gate.\u2014 You're saying there were Players from another world?\u2014 Yes. They say it's called RNO.\u2014 Hm\u2026 \u2014 Chae Young-ju squinted her eyes, hardly able to believe her ears.Not knowing how to continue, Kang Yu asked her with a baffled voice:\u2014 You really don't know anything about the system?\u2014 I don't know anything about it at all. This is the first time I've heard of it.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 I see\u2026\u2014 And the creature you tamed came from RNO, too?\u2014 Yes, it did.\u2014 Can I take a look at it?\u2014 I came alone today. I'll introduce you a little later. But there's not much you can learn from it.After Echidna's father had disappeared, she lived all alone.So it was likely that she knew almost nothing about the world she came from.\u2014 It would be nice if you could help her make an ID.\u2014 Huh? You're asking me to make an ID for a tamed creature? \u2014 She looked at Kang Yu, stunned by this strange request.Kang Yu had to tell her more about E\u0441hidna.\u2014 Oh, so it turns out you tamed a dragon\u2026 Seriously, who are you, anyway?\u2014 Isn't it a little late for you to ask that question?Young-ju, who wasn't happy with Kang Yu's answer, rolled her eyes.\u2014 You can make an ID, can't you?\u2014 Huh\u2026 Well, I don't know. Send me her photo first.\u2014 Thank you. There's something else I wanted to ask you.\u2014 What? \u2013 Young-ju looked tired from having to fulfill Kang Yu's numerous favors.\u2014 It's about the S-level gate pass. This time\u2026Kang Yu was interrupted by a knock at the door, and they both turned to look at the door.\u2014 I have something to say.The girl who entered the room was tall, and her long, silver hair was tied in a ponytail.\u2014 Baek Hwa Yeon?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 1)Editor: CherishThird Division Hwaran Squad.Unlike the first and second divisions that were designed to guard the gates in Suwon and Pohang, the third division is involved with overseeing Players' illegal actions.'So she's the commander of the third division.' Kang Yu looked at the girl with shiny silver hair.The silver hair looked quite unusual with her Asian appearance, but she was beautiful and it suited her.'She must be strong.' Kang Yu scanned the girl from head to toe.While she looked fragile on the outside, Kang Yu could tell such a term didn't apply to her at all.Her behavior and habits appeared majestic.Above all, there was something in her that exuded resilience.It was difficult to assess her level of training and real skills from just a single glance, but she was definitely someone with a unique character.\u2014 Ah, you have a guest with you. I'm sorry to barge in unannounced. Oh, could it be\u2026 is this the rookie you picked out personally? \u2014 Baek Hwa Yeon looked at Kang Yu.\u2014 That's right.\u2014 Is he part of the Red Rose now?\u2014 No, he's not with us. We have a partnership.\u2014 Oh. I'm surprised you're giving so much support to a man outside the guild.\u2014 He's a very valuable Player.Hwa Yeon looked at Kang Yu with interest and extended her hand:\u2014 It's nice to meet you. I'm from the third division of Hwaran Squad, Commander Baek Hwa Yeon.\u2014 Oh Kang Yu.\u2014 Oh Kang Yu\u2026 \u2014 When she heard his name, she squinted slightly, going over everyone she knew. His name sounded familiar. \u2014 Ah! That guy at the Level C Gate! \u2014When she remembered they'd previously met each other, Hwa Yeon's eyes were bright as she shook the guy's hand.Young-ju, tilting her head sideways, asked her in surprise:\u2014 Have you guys met before?\u2014 Yes, I remember him well. He was a very friendly and mannered guy. Hey, turns out you really do know a lot about good Players.\u2014 What\u2026? \u2013 Young-ju's face twisted like she had eaten something sour when she heard Hwa Yeon's description of Kang Yu. She looked at him skeptically.'Friendly and good manners? What kind of nonsense is that?'Kang Yu wasn't exactly the type of person she would describe with those words.'Is he even capable of that?' The guild leader looked at Kang Yu with doubt.He scratched the back of his head and feigned innocence.\u2014 Oh~ You're overreacting. Seriously ,you're flattering me too much.\u2014 Ugh.\u2014 What's wrong\u2026? \u2014 Hwa Yeon stared at the guild leader with surprise.\u2014 I'm sick of it, \u2014 Young-ju muttered. \u2014 Well, I can't agree that he's friendly and well-behaved, but he certainly has great abilities. \u2014\u2014 Um, I see. \u2014 Hwa Yeon nodded and sat down on a chair.Young-ju turned her eyes back on Kang Yu and asked:\u2014 So what kind of favor were you going to ask for?\u2014 Um\u2026 \u2013 Kang Yu glanced at Hwa Yeon.Taking his hint, she continued:\u2014 Don't worry about Hwa Yeon. She and I have a very close relationship.\u2014 Hmm. If that's the case, then I'll just say it: Make a permanent pass to the S-level gate for me.\u2014 Huh\u2026? \u2014 Young-ju was bewildered, not expecting such a requestLooking at the guy, she squinted:\u2014 Are you going hunting there?\u2014 That's right. Didn't I tell you about my 'pet?' If I was hunting there alone, it would be dangerous, but there are two of us, so I'll be safe.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014\u00a0 Young-ju thought it over.His words were not meaningless. From what she knew about him, he wasn't the kind of person who would risk his life just to show off.It's more likely that if he says he'll hunt at the S-level Gate, then he really will.\u2014 You do know about the monsters that live in that gate, don't you?\u2014 Giant orcs, mountain giants, and\u2026\u2014 That's where El Quero lives, \u2014 Yeon Ju quietly said the boss's name. \u2014 If you're going to hunt there, don't go near the lake. Do you understand? \u2014\u2014 I got it. \u2014 Kang Yu nodded affirmatively with a serious expression.At the Level S Gate, there was a huge lake occupying more than half the surface.But strangely enough, almost no monsters lived in that giant lake.The very reason was the monster El Quero.A creature that looks like a stingray, just over 30 meters in size.Its wide fins were covered with tens of thousands of poisonous needles, and its body emits electric current.He had eaten almost all of the other monsters living in the lake, and the rest had moved to land to escape.It was for this reason that only small monsters remained in the lake, so small that El Quero does not even consider them as food.The lake was beautiful on the outside, but, because of a single predator, it turned into a deadly, frightening place.\u2014 Oh\u2026 I'll apply for a pass with a longer period, so you can go to the gate tomorrow.\u2014 Thank you. \u2014 Kang Yu's eyes immediately shone as soon as he heard that he could use the pass tomorrow.\u2014 Wa\u2026 wait! \u2014 Hwa Yeon exclaimed, bewildered by what she heard. \u2014 What's all this nonsense? How can he go to a Level S Gate if he was only at a Level C Gate a few weeks ago? \u2014\u2014 Ah\u2026 How should I put it\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju smiled a little and took a deep breath.Like Hwa Yeon said, he was merely a Class C Player just a few weeks ago.But now\u2026'He's a monster who can defeat S-level gate creatures.' She looked at Kang Yu with narrowed eyes.Young-ju knew very well that he was a talented Player.She thought he was probably even superior to the best Player in Korea, Baek Kang Hyun.However, he surpassed all her expectations.His leveling speed couldn't be explained in any way.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'He can only be compared to the First Lady.'First Lady Grace McCobbin.The strongest Player in the world and also the #1 World Ranker, top of the top.'He's even faster than Grace.'It's been a month since he became a Player.It's been a month since he rose above even the strongest rookies.No matter how fast the First Lady developed, Kang Yu had done it a lot faster.'What kind of monster will he end up as?' She looked at Kang Yu with an expression filled with both anticipation and awe.\u2014 He has things to do there. You can trust his abilities.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 Still, the S-level gate\u2026 \u2014 Hwa Yeon looked at Kang Yu with an incomprehensible look.Even the country's most powerful Players, which weren't so many, avoided hunting alone at the Level S Gate.Of course, the main reason Players didn't want to go there was El Quero, but even ordinary monsters weren't on a level where you could just ignore them.'Maybe he got a special S-level ability at rank 3?' Hwa Yeon took a look at him and cocked her head to the side. 'Even if he did, it's impossible to jump from a Level C Gate to a Level S Gate in a matter of weeks.'Which means his special ability is much higher than S.\u2014 You seem to have gotten a great Player\u2026\u2014 Well, that's how it is. \u2014 Young-ju shrugged her shoulders and smiled.\u2014 I'm going to go now. \u2014 Kang Yu stood up. His business here was finished.An ID for Echidna and a Level S gate pass.After solving both problems in one day, he no longer had any reason to stay in this place.'Besides, Hwa Yeon came in for some business, too.' He turned to the door after taking another glance at the Hwaran Squad's third division leader.\u2014 Be careful. The S-level gate is a really dangerous place. I hunted there once too and almost ended up paying for it with my life.\u2014 I'll keep that in mind, thank you. \u2014\u00a0 Kang Yu left the office with these words.Once Kang Yu left, it was like the office became empty.Young-ju looked at Hwa Yeon, who had moved into Kang Yu's seat.\u2014 So, what's your question?\u2014 It's about the Devil's Teacher.The moment she heard the 'Devil's Teacher,' her expression grew dark, and the hatred that just couldn't be concealed came out.\u2014 Did you find their trail?\u2014 Not yet.\u2014 Phew\u2026 \u2014 When Young-ju heard this, she felt exhausted.\u2014 But this time, there's a clue.\u2014 Do you have a lead?\u2014 Do you remember the last time our man got close enough to the Devil's Teacher?\u2014 Yes, I do.\u2014 Last night, he, Kang Dong Hong, sent us a secret message. He got video evidence and said he could pass it to us at a secret meeting.Hearing this, Young-ju's eyes gleamed.\u2014 He says he has proof?\u2014 That's right.\u2014 Then he could just send the video file, no? Why put himself in danger and go to a private meeting?\u2014 All the equipment that could help in this case is prohibited where he is. He says that even simple messages can't be sent from there.\u2014 These bastards have thought of everything.\u2014 That's why the meeting is necessary. \u2014 Hwa Yeon frowned as she thought about it.Psychos who kidnap people for rituals.A crazy act.And so far, no one knew how much wilder things were done at their secret hiding place.\u2014 The place your man has infiltrated is their headquarters?\u2014 No, it's just a branch, I'm pretty sure. We haven't figured out where their headquarters are yet, or if it's even in Korea.\u2014 You think they exist all over the world?\u2014 It's quite possible, given their size.\u2014 Oh. \u2014 Young-ju felt another wave of exhaustion hit her . \u2014 What kind of monsters are these\u2026? \u2014A pseudo-religion, sacrificing people, capable of spreading around the world\u2026Such a ridiculous notion that she couldn't believe it was the 21st century.\u2014 We still haven't confirmed anything for sure. Don't get your hopes up just because of my speculations.\u2014 Where's the rendezvous point?\u2014 In Suwon.\u2014 Suwon?\u2014 We agreed to meet tomorrow at Hwaso Station.Hwaso in Suwon was a place everyone's heard about.It's one of two places in all of Korea where an S-level gate is located.\u2014 He'd like to ask for the support of your guild. If possible, don't let this get out, just in case of an emergency.\u2014 Okay. \u2014 Young-ju nodded without hesitation. The Devil's Teachers were her priority right now. \u2014 I'll go, too. \u2014\u2014 Because of that child?When she heard Hwa Yeon's question, her face twisted into an anguished expression.\u2014 Don't mention Hae-young.\u2014 Sorry\u2026 I get it. If you come in person, I'm sure he'll be safe. \u2014 Hwa Yeon smiled bitterly and patted Young-ju on the shoulder.\u2014 Hwaso Station in Suwon\u2026Young-ju suddenly remembered that Kang Yu was going hunting there.'We're not going to face each other, right?'All she had to do was meet the spy and get the video.There was no reason for him to get involved.

Does it look good on me? \u2014 She looked up at Kang Yu with anticipation.The guy smiled and stroked her on the head.\u2014 It looks great.\u2014 Heh heh! \u2014 Echidna, excited by Kang Yu's praise, gently clenched her fists and jumped on the spot.Then, as she approached Han Sol, she tilted her head to the side.\u2014 Thank you, Kang Yu liked it!\u2014 Oh, you're beautiful no matter what you wear. \u2014 Han Sol pet Echidna on her head with a gentle smile.Kang Yu headed toward the exit.\u2014 Well, Echidna and I will be off to hunt.\u2014 Okay. \u2014 For a moment, envy appeared on her face, but then she tried to smile. Han Sol herself knew very well that her level wasn't enough to go hunting with Kang Yu. \u2014 Have a good hunt, Kang Yu. \u2014\u2014 You're hunting today too, right?\u2014 Yes. I'll be hunting with the crew like always.\u2014 If you come across a monster you don't know, run right away.\u2014 Okay, Kang Yu.\u2014 I'll go with you guys sometime soon, too.\u2014 Really?\u2014 Yes. \u2014 Kang Yu nodded quietly, staring at the surprised look on the girl's face.'It's time to help them with their leveling speed.'Now that they've already accumulated combat experience, it's necessary to push them to promote faster.\u2014 Oh, I already look forward to that day, \u2014 Han Sol said, smiling widely. Her improved remarkably just hearing that the whole team would hunt together again.Leaving a happy Han Sol, Kang Yu headed straight for the Level S gate.\u2014 Okay, it's time to start. \u2014 Kang Yu parked near the S-level gate. It was much easier to get in thanks to Young-ju's newly prepared pass.'There aren't many Hwaran people today, is something wrong?'Usually, the gate was surrounded by a large number of first squad members, but today, there were frighteningly few.'Well, it doesn't concern me.'It didn't matter to him what problems the Hwaran squad had.Spotting the large lake in the distance, Kang Yu said to Echidna:\u2014 Don't go anywhere near that lake. A really dangerous monster lives in that lake.\u2014 That's fine. I'll be right beside you.\u2014 Anyway, I'll attract the monsters, and you'll help me by killing them. But don't turn into a full-sized dragon.Of course, the bigger she was, the more power she had, but her original size was just too big.That would attract unwanted attention from more monsters than they could handle.\u2014 I see. \u2014 Echidna kept nodding her head with an eager look.Kang Yu used the Power of Observation to track the monsters nearby.'Are they giant orcs?'He could sense a giant creature moving on the ground, five meters away.They were the most popular monsters in this gate because they gave a lot of experience points and appeared in large numbers.'First let's try to take them down one by one.'Kang Yu used the Power of Temptation to lure one of the Orcs.\u2014 Echidna, get ready.\u2014 Okay.The earth shook.When he saw the monster approaching, he sat down.The giant was rushing at them with great speed and a terrible scream.[Heaven's Power]Realizing that he couldn't resist the orc without using the Power of Heaven, Kang Yu sped at the monster.Kang Yu's attack didn't even make the orc hesitate, and instead it let out another scream.The guy smiled nervously.'So this is what Level S monsters are like.'Even using one of his Powers, Kang Yu couldn't succeed.'However\u2026' His eyes gleamed.Continuing to use Heaven's Power, he caught the monster's hand and climbed on top, riding the orc.'He's not strong enough to be undefeatable.'He used Magi to create a spear and stuck it through the back of the orc's head, sticking it in as deep as possible.If he had his true strength, he would have cut the monster from the inside with the Power of Blade.'It's going to be hard to do that now.'Now it was hard for him to use even three Powers at once.'Without using the Power of Heaven, I can't stay in the air.'In order to not fall off the orc, he focused even more power to the hand holding the spear.The monster kept twitching, and its blood splattered onto Kang Yu's hand.\u2014 Dark Side! \u2014 At that moment, Echidna came to Kang Yu's aid using magic.Twelve sickles formed in the air and they flew straight into the giant orc.Kang Yu jumped off, and the orc roared with excruciating pain, suffering from the sickles that just pierced his body.Bloody mixed with the tears that flowed out from its eyes, and it started running in a frenzy.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIt tried to counter Echidna, who had attacked from afar.\u2014 I won't let you do as you please, \u2014 Kang Yu said quietly, dissolving the Dark Spear and concentrating all his power into his right hand.Using the Power of a Thousand, he swung his right hand at the orc's head.Punching through, he felt the soft organs inside.[Power of Lighting]The monster's body was struck by blue lightning and it wobbled.Taking advantage of the orc's slowed motions, Echidna sent a few more sickles down his throat.The body of the huge, five meters tall orc fell to the ground.[You have successfully defeated an ordinary Class S monster, a giant orc.][Experience has increased][Level increased by 1 unit]'One monster, one level!' The guy's eyes shone with delight as he read all the notifications.Because Players usually start hunting at the Level S Gate around level 65, their promotion is quite slow even hunting Class S monsters. But Kang Yu came to hunt at the Gate alone with just over 40 levels, so the monsters here would give him lots of points.'This is great.'Even though it was more difficult, coming to the S-level Gate for hunting was a great idea.If he was in a Level A Gate, he wouldn't get half these points for just one monster.\u2014 Kang Yu, did you hurt yourself? \u2014 Echidna came up to the man who was completely covered in orc blood.She looked anxiously at Kang Yu's body.The guy gently stroked her head and answered:\u2014 It's okay. It's just a few scratches.Kang Yu had scratched his hand a little while holding onto his spear to avoid being thrown off the orc.It was a small cut from the handle of the spear. It wasn't serious enough of a wound to use the Power of Regeneration.\u2014 I'll help. \u2014 Echidna, dissatisfied with the wound, licked the scratch on Kang Yu's arm.Her tongue tickled the skin and caused a strange sensation.Kang Yu smiled at Echidna and looked down at her licking his wound.'It's the same hand that was in the orc's head.'Perhaps this information should be kept from her.\u2014 It's okay now. \u2014 Kang Yu pulled his hand away.Echidna, staring at Kang Yu 's hand sadly, asked carefully:\u2014 Kang Yu, was I able to help you a lot?\u2014 Yes. \u2014 Kang Yu had a reason for his affirmative and decisive answer.She really had helped a lot to kill the giant orc.When Echidna heard this answer, she smiled.Looking at her smile, Kang Yu thought for a moment.'She didn't increase in size, but she was still this strong.'Kang Yu wondered if they'd be able to hunt more than one creature at a time if she grew.\u2014 I feel like I've become much stronger since the connection between us began. \u2014 She looked down at her body in wonder.After the day she slept on Kang Yu, she felt a lot stronger.\u2014 Hmm\u2026Kang Yu swallowed. She was still using easy words that could easily be misunderstood.\u2014 Let's find another monster, shall we?\u2014 Okay.Applying the Devourer's Power to the corpse, Kang Yu began to search for the next victim.\u2014 That's\u2026At that moment, likely because of Kang Yu's noisy battle with the giant orc, a pack of wyverns appeared.The wyverns weren't Class S monsters, but Kang Yu heard that they appeared here occasionally, and were more threatening than giant orcs as they moved in packs.'Packs of 30 or even more creatures.'When he saw the pack of wyverns flying at them, Kang Yu frowned.They, in a flock of 30, were so dangerous that they could easily destroy a giant orc.The pack of 30 wyverns were flying directly to Kang Yu and Echidna at the speed of light.Kang Yu hugged Echidna against his chest and quickly dodged the attack.\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 As they were avoiding the attack, Echidna's white dress caught on the sharp wing of a wyvern, tearing it apart.The girl's face turned pale.\u2014 Aah!\u2014 We need to avoid their attacks, \u2014 Kang Yu said, realizing that they were surrounded by wyverns.But Echidna couldn't hear Kang Yu anymore.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu \u2026\u2014 The dress you liked\u2026 \u2014 Grabbing the torn piece of fabric with trembling fingers, a fire lit in her eyes.It was like a bomb exploded, a huge energy burst out of her.\u2014 That was the dress Kang Yu said he liked! \u2014 With an ear-shattering scream, her body was shrouded in blue light.Once again, she turned into such an enormous dragon that the three-meter wyverns looked like tiny sparrows.The wyverns looked at Echidna who had become a dragon, shocked.The roar of the angry dragon could be heard even through the gate.At the same time, the pack of wyverns was ready to fly away, sensing danger.Echidna threw herself at the pack and began a brutal massacre.She easily got rid of the large pack of wyverns that could kill one or two giant monsters on their own.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 When Kang Yu saw this, he made a delightful cry.'Isn't she stronger than me?'Echidna was much more powerful than he thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Finish them all off!' Kang Yu grinned. The angry Echidna's dominance over the wyverns was beyond all expectations.Every time she dealt with one of the monsters, a blue message would pop up and his level would rise rapidly.\u2014 Well, that's lucky! \u2014 Kang Yu's body gave him the creeps when he realized the power of his 'pet.'Boer? Cerberus?Echidna was superior to all the creatures Kang Yu initially hoped to summon.'Even if she requires a little more Magi.' Kang Yu sighed.Every time Echidna made a sudden maneuver, Kang Yu could feel his Magi diminish a little.When Echidna first attacked the pack of wyverns mercilessly, Kang Yu was hesitant.Because she was so strong that he thought there was no way she could have lost to Ronald's group.But realizing that Echidna was borrowing some of his strength in the form of Magi, he no longer doubted her abilities.'She must have become much more powerful with my powers.' Kang Yu finally felt the 'connection' between them that Echidna had spoken of earlier.They were indeed connected in the same way as a demon and his subordinate are connected.'But it's different with Kim Si Hoon.'The source of Si Hoon's power wasn't Magi. Unlike Echidna, who used Magi, he relied on Maryok.Even though Kang Yu and Si Hoon were connected by the same 'master-subordinate' connection, Echidna could borrow many times more of his strength.'Either way, it's going quite well.' Kang Yu's eyes were bright as he glanced at Echidna, who had massacred almost an entire pack of wyverns.If his pet were a Boer or Cerberus, no matter how much energy they took from Kang Yu, they wouldn't be able to reach that level of power.'It's about the difference in potential.'For example, an ant, no matter how hard he tries, will remain an ant, because there is a limit to its development in genes.Although the concept of a Player's strength is not absolute, it cannot be said that there is no limit at all.'Echidna is, by nature, a strong creature.'Kang Yu, observing Echidna's abilities, increasingly wondered if she was stronger than him.She was definitely a better tamed creature than he bargained for.'Besides\u2026'He thought that if she feeds on his powers, he'd also make Echidna stronger with every promotion.'She can evolve.'And given the fact that he's rising incredibly fast, that was a great advantage.It's like self-expanding clothes for a fast-growing child.[Your tamed creature successfully destroyed a wyvern, an ordinary Class A monster][Your level has increased by 1]Another notice came in, and then there was complete silence all around.\u2014 Phew\u2026The battle was over.Echidna, who destroyed an entire pack of wyverns on her own, was breathing heavily.Her body was wrapped in blue light again, and she gradually began to shrink.Echidna looked down again at her dress torn by monsters, and began to cry.Kang Yu stroked her head and said:\u2014 It's okay. It's okay. We can just buy new clothes.\u2014 But\u2026\u2014 All kinds of clothes suit you perfectly.Giving in to Kang Yu's words of comfort, she stopped crying.Kang Yu continued in a more serious tone:\u2014 But I hope it won't happen again.\u2014 Huh?\u2026\u2014 I can't stand people who easily lose their heads.It was more than just Kang Yu's whim.In a battle, losing your head from anger means putting yourself in mortal danger.\u2014 I'm sorry\u2026 \u2014 Echidna's eyes turned downcast.Even though Kang Yu pitied her, he couldn't ignore or support that kind of reckless behavior.'If I don't warn her now, something like this could happen again.'However, Kang Yu was able to determine her power from the battle with wyverns.By turning into a huge dragon, not only was she able to cope with the whole pack of wyverns, but even their reinforcement.Because of that, she wanted to be praised, but Kang Yu believed even that could not justify her behavior.\u2014 Don't do that anymore. Do you understand?\u2014 Yes, I won't get pissed off anymore. \u2014 The girl was worried that she might have made Kang Yu angry, and nodded her head.She already lost her father; she couldn't lose Kang Yu, too. She had never received so much care from anyone before.He kept patting her on the head and continued:Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Okay. I trust you.\u2014 I will try harder and I will become worthy of help for you. \u2014 She clenched her fists with determination and confidently stepped forward to search for the next victim.At that moment, she wobbled on her feet.\u2014 Wah! \u2026Is everything all right? \u2014 Kang Yu was able to catch Echidna from falling.He noticed the drops of sweat flowing down her forehead and her shaky breath.'She overdid it.'Most likely, she wasn't used to the amount of strength Kang Yu was lending to her through their contract.\u2014 It's\u2026 it's okay. I can move by myse\u2026\u2014 We're done here. Get some rest.\u2014 But\u2026\u2014 Rest.Echidna shivered from his decisive tone, and nodded her head.Kang Yu carried her to a huge stone nearby and helped her sit up.\u2014 Stay here.\u2014 What about you?\u2014 I have some business left.With that, he turned his back on her and went into the thick woods.\u2014 Phew\u2026 \u2014 The man exhaled and closed his eyes.There was silence all around him, but he could hear a slight noise deeper in the forest.\u2014 About five?If a 20-meter tall creature makes noise, it'd attract other monsters, too. Echidna's fight against the wyverns must have caught the attention of the monsters nearby.Feeling the energy of five giant orcs approaching him, Kang Yu relaxed his body and braced himself.'It won't be easy.'Without Echidna, it would be very difficult to hold out against five orcs at once.\u2014 Well, I'll have to try.Of course, it's not bad standing aside and letting Echidna earn experience points for him, but he couldn't leave everything to her.If he didn't practise, all his fighting skills could easily be forgotten.Kang Yu used the Power of Hellfire and lit a fire in both hands.The corner of his lips twitched into a smirk, and a villainous expression took over his face.Wrapped up in Magi, there was nothing left of his human image.Kang Yu became a real Devourer and exposed his sharp teeth.\u2014 My level's gone up a lot.After hunting, he examined his status window to sum up the day's achievements.Now he was at level 49.There was only one step left until the next promotion to 6th rank.Thanks to the hunt at the Level S Gate, he was able to climb from level 41 to level 49 in a single day.To the other players, this was an unbelievable rate of increase.If someone found out about such a crazy boost, they would think Kang Yu was mocking them.'Because no one expects a Level 40 Player to hunt at the Level S Gate.'In the end, it was only possible because he already possessed skills and strength that were\u00a0 not comparable to his level.'I got a decent amount of Magi today.' Kang Yu smiled, pleased to feel the tide of Magi in his body.Although local monsters give fewer Magi than Hell creatures, due to their high level at the S Gate, he still earned a lot of Magi.\u2014 I guess I'm done for the day.Kang Yu wanted to go up to level 50 and get the special ability at Rank 6, but realized that he was getting tired.'There's no reason to live like it's my last day.' The number of experience points he received today was already incredible.He didn't have to put himself in danger just to quench his greed.\u2014 Echidna, are you all right?\u2014 I feel a little sluggish, but much better, \u2014 said Echidna, forcing herself to sound energetic.In fact, she didn't look 'much better' at all despite her claims. Kang Yu gently pet her on the head and said:\u2014 Our hunt's over. We can go home now.\u2014 We can continue, don't worry about me.\u2014 I'm a little tired, too.\u2014 Then that's okay. If you're tired, we really should go, \u2014 the girl said with a serene look on her face.Kang Yu removed his hand from her head and started walking to the exit.\u2014 By the way, let's buy you new clothes on the way home.The girl was currently wearing Kang Yu's coat over her tattered dress.Her eyes sparkled and she vigorously nodded her head.\u2014 I'd like anything you choose!\u2014 Okay.Echidna grabbed onto Kang Yu's shirt and followed him.When they came out of the gate, they were enveloped by the cold night air.Kang Yu searched the maps for the nearest clothing store, but there was nothing nearby because of the gate.Once they decided their destination, they proceeded to take the shortest route to the store.The further they went, the fewer street lamps there were to light the path. Eventually, they were walking through a dark and deserted alley.'After passing through the alley, we only have to walk another 300 meters\u2026' Kang Yu kept walking while studying the route.\u2014 Kang Yu. \u2014 Echidna, who had been obediently following the guy until now, tugged hard at the end of his shirt.Kang Yu turned around in surprise, and caught the serious look on her face.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026 It smells like blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His face twisted at the memory of what the Devil's Teachers were doing.They sacrificed living people as if it were the natural thing to do.Worse, such actions weren't just happening once or twice.The Devil's teachers were not just founders of a pseudo-religion, like everyone had thought before. These monsters had much more power than they could have imagined.Kang Dong Hong had slipped in with those fanatics, portraying himself as a madman to gather the necessary information.And in the end, he achieved his goal by videotaping shocking footage.'It's good to have at least this video.'The Devil's Teachers, to avoid information leaks, carefully monitor all followers, and cut off any use of communication means.Even if by some miracle someone managed to sneak something in, they would not be able to use it, because there are jammers all around the area.This was exactly why he had to meet with someone from the squad in person to give away the memory card.Blood spilled from his mouth as he fell to his knees.To get the video out of this place, he'd disguised it as a fake video.A decoder would need to be used at the squad office to see the real video hidden under the fake.By disguising the original as an adult video, which would not be strange for an adult man to have, he was going to leave quietly and head for the meeting place.But that was when the problem arose.'Why was I caught at that very moment?'The same day he was headed to the meeting, one of the Devil's Teachers found the hidden camera installed.All his efforts to conceal the original went to waste.Kang Dong Hong, realizing that it was only a matter of time before the video would be decrypted, took the SD card and ran for it.He was quickly followed and had to fight against his pursuers.With almost no strength left in his body, he finally managed to get out and request for reinforcement from the main office, but the fatal wounds he'd received were making the escape incredibly difficult.\u2014 Oh\u2026 oh\u2026 \u2014 Kang Dong Hong continued to bleed profusely. His vision was growing dark and his breathing was becoming more and more ragged.He realized that he was nearing his limits.If he fainted now, the video would disappear forever in the hands of his pursuers.\u2014 Commander\u2026 \u2014 Gathering the rest of his strength, he reached a dark alley to lay low for a while.\u2014 It smells like blood.At that moment, a pure-sounding girl's voice reached his ears.Dong Hong's eyes glimmered with hope, and he stumbled towards the voice.Heavy breathing could be heard from behind the deserted alley.Kang Yu frowned and turned in the direction where the scent of blood and heavy breathing were coming from.'What is that?'They'd already walked quite far from the entrance of the gate.That's why Kang Yu thought that it was unusual for there to be an injured person in the middle of nowhere.He headed toward the sounds.\u2014 Ah\u2026 oh\u2026Suddenly, a shivering, blood-soaked man who looked a little over twenty years old came into his sight.When he saw Kang Yu, he slowly crawled in his direction.\u2014 Pa\u2026 pass this on\u2026 \u2014 With shaky arms, he reached out to Kang Yu, grasping a memory card in his fist.It was a card normally used in new phones.\u2014 Hwar\u2026 \u2014 The guy had started saying something, but couldn't finish his sentence before falling to the ground and losing consciousness.Kang Yu was confused.\u2014 What's going on\u2026?A bloody guy comes out of nowhere, holds out his fist, and then falls and passes out.Kang Yu looked around and cautiously approached the stranger.'He's dead.'Even before showing up in front of Kang Yu, this unknown guy seemed to have received life-threatening wounds, and only died now.Kang Yu searched the guy's pockets for some kind of ID to find out who this person was.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 But after carefully checking all his pockets, he couldn't even find a phone.A dead young man was lying in front of them with no ID.'Maybe I should check with the Power of Observation?'Remembering how he was able to view Si Hoon's status window, he used the Power of Observation.Magi appeared from his body and slithered to the guy's body.[Status Window]Name: Kang Dong HongLevel: 52Rank: 6'Rank six?'Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThis was a very high-level player. And his latest special ability was class A.'He certainly didn't come out of the gate.'Players were banned from entering the Level S Gate without a pass, which was only granted to Players at Level 60 and Rank 7.'Besides, I didn't see him there.'Kang Yu looked down at the SD card that Dong Hong had desperately struggled to pass on until his last breath.\u2014 Is it all because of this card? \u2014 He inserted the memory card into his phone.There was only one video on it.Kang Yu clicked on it and began watching it.\u2014 This is\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu's eyes were bulged out at the sight of the video.Squelchy sounds.A woman moaning.It was an obscene video.The memory card received from the dying young man contained a single adult video.'It's porn!' Kang Yu, stunned by the events that just occurred, couldn't understand the guy's motives.Why did he use his dying breath to pass on porn?'What happened anyway?' Kang Yu was distraught and rubbed his temples.The situation was so unusual he couldn't even smile.'Why was he so eager to give this to someone before he died?'And it was the only thing he had on him.'Did I miss something?'Kang Yu, not trusting his own eyes, watched the video again from beginning to end.But nothing had changed \u2014 there was nothing in that five-minute video except obscene scenes.Kang Yu bit down on his lip, looking down at his smartphone screen.He wanted to know the true meaning behind this video.He replayed the video from the beginning.\u2014 Hmm\u2026One more time.\u2014 Ahem\u2026One more time.\u2014 Oh\u2026Over and over, he kept watching.\u2014 As a matter of fact\u2026The corners of his lips rose involuntarily.His eyes were peeled to the woman in the video.\u2014 This is great.It had been ten thousand years.He hadn't watched a video like this in ten thousand years.\u2014 This is just great.Honor and dignity? None of that was important to Kang Yu now.Kang Yu didn't notice anything around him, completely immersed in the videotape.His eyes twinkled as he rewatched the slutty content of the video.Kang Yu couldn't stop watching the video, and a feverish blush crept on his cheeks.\u2014 Kang Yu, what is it? \u2014 Echidna pulled at his shirt and tilted her head in a questioning manner.\u2014 It's a very important video, \u2014 Kang Yu murmured as quietly as possible.\u2014 An important video?\u2014 Yes. The mystery of human bodies, the magic of the birth of a new life\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu was trying to explain to the innocent girl, when men began to surround them from all sides.\u2014 Hey. \u2014 They were dressed in black robes and their eyes were burning with madness.Kang Yu, studying the people around him, slipped the phone into his pocket.There was growing animosity among the people around him.'Who the hell are these people?' Kang Yu frowned.One of the hostile people clothed in black robes moved towards Kang Yu.Averting his gaze from Kang Dong Hong's body to Kang Yu's, he spoke in a low voice:\u2014 So you saw this video.\u2014 What\u2026? \u2014 The guy, bewildered, looked at the people around him.One by one, the people dressed in black began to smile ominously.\u2014 You don't have to pretend. We know you watched that video.\u2014 I watched it, but\u2026\u2014 You're dead now.\u2014 What the hell are you talking about?Kang Yu, who had no idea what was going on, heard them laugh amongst themselves.\u2014 Even though he admitted that he looked, he keeps pretending that he doesn't understand anything.\u2014 What?\u2014 Hah, are you stupid or are you just retarded?\u2014 What\u2026?\u2014 One way or another, you're not going to live.'Why are\u00a0 they so attached to porn?' Kang Yu, completely unaware of the situation, shook his head in disbelief.Each one of them pointed a gun at Kang Yu.Kang Yu was still wondering why they wanted this videotape.But he had become their target.His eyes turned cold.Making sure his smartphone wouldn't fall out, he said:\u2014 You pseudo-religion, I can't give you this video.\u2014 You finally showed your true nature.The crowd that was watching him stepped closer and closer.Kang Yu looked at them with flaming eyes.'Whatever happens, I must protect this video\u2026''Even at the cost of my life!'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kang Yu quickly counted his opponents as he prepared to repel their attack.The man leading the attack drew his sword.\u2014 Huh?But when he pointed his sword at Kang Yu, he was thrown back.Unable to believe what just happened, he kept looking between Kang Yu and the black blade that had appeared out of nowhere.The leader wasn't the only one who was amazed at what just happened.With a light semi-circle movement, Kang Yu swiftly dodged an axe flying right at himUsing the Power of Acceleration, he started moving in the alley at a great speed.[Power of Iron Curtain]Kang Yu, who was previously using the Power of Blade, replaced it with the Power of Iron Curtain and began using it with the Power of Acceleration simultaneously.His fist was shrouded in black mist.Fast as the wind and strong as a bomb, he swung at the black-robed people before him.On impact, they flew apart like pebbles under the wheels of cars.\u2014 Aah!The weapons in their hands wound up useless.Kang Yu continued using the Power of Acceleration, striking those who hadn't been hit yet.With a crackling of their bones, their bodies fell to the ground.\u2014 What the hell is that\u2026\u2014 Where did it come from?The moment three of them fell to the ground dead, the others looked at Kang Yu cautiously.They knew for sure the fallen guys weren't weak.Each of them had attained 5th rank, and their leader was at 6th rank with perfect fighting skills.They were all Players who, even without high-class abilities, were gifted with strength.Besides, it was not just one Player fighting against the young man, there were twelve of them.Even if Kang Yu had seven ranks, he couldn't have been this much stronger than the Devil's followers.\u2014 8th rank?\u2014 Come on, that's impossible.The men, still doubting their own eyes, raised their weapons again and charged at Kang Yu.However, it made no difference.No, in fact, compared to the last time they tried to attack, it only got worse.\u2014 Ahhhh!!! \u2014 Terrible screams came from the people whose arms and legs were abruptly torn off, splashing scarlet blood all around.Several others tried to attack Kang Yu, but they met the same fate.In this situation, there wasn't even a need for sophisticated techniques nor extensive knowledge of psychology.With speed and strength alone, he was able to bring them all to their deathbed.The number of uninjured people was now halved.\u2014 Mo\u2026 monster\u2026Their faces were distorted with fear.This was a man with power several times greater than all of theirs combined.Kang Yu's brutal actions terrified them.The leader of the Devil's followers made a stern expression and shouted:\u2014 All of you! Release your power!\u2014 But Commander\u2026\u2014 We're all going to die here one way or another!Hearing the commander's orders, their faces became expressionless.'What are they planning to do?'Kang Yu frowned upon hearing the phrase 'release your power.'Before he could think about it properly, the answer was shown to him.The group was reading mantras in an incomprehensible language, and Magi began to surround the men in black robes.'Magi.' Kang Yu squinted.He couldn't understand why they were using Magi.'Could it be\u2026 they're followers of the Devil's Teachers?'More importantly, Kang Yu still couldn't figure out why they were so desperate to get the videotape.'Does it contain some kind of secret that I've missed?'The guy replayed the five-minute video in his mind again.No matter how much he thought about that video, there was nothing in it but the mystery of a new life.The faces of the men using Magi were distorted, their veins swollen, eyes red.Their skin began to turn black, and their bodies grew in size rapidly.\u2014 Oh! \u2014 Kang Yu watched their transformation with interest.'They're turning into demons.' Kang Yu had thought they were ordinary people up till now, not realizing they were Devil's followers. Now that they were turning into demons, Kang Yu was sure of it.'But\u2026' Kang Yu squinted. 'They're weak.'They were weak. Both physically and morally.The guy couldn't find any other words to describe them.A body that obtains Magi will become demonic.But there was a significant difference between them. He was a demon with the appearance of an ordinary human, while they were humans taking on the appearance of demons.A demonic body is easily tempted, with an undying hunger.Though it may not seem like a big problem at first, it is, in fact, difficult for humans to cope with unfading desires.There will come a time when they become intoxicated with their own power and grow tempted to quench their demonic thirst.'They don't just turn into demons, they become Hell creatures.'Kang Yu looked at the cold eyes of the creatures that were human a second ago, that now had nothing human left in them.A thirsty mind, a body swallowed up by Magi.The black-robed men had turned into creatures that Kang Yu had learned to cope with for ten thousand years. Fighting them was something he'd perfected.'Now that you've transformed, I won't be able to find out why you want this video.' Kang Yu clicked his tongue and gazed at the people who had become monsters.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksBecause their mind was clouded now, even using the Power of Fear, he wouldn't be able to find out any information.After becoming giants with red eyes and black skin, they dropped their weapons and dashed in Kang Yu's direction.In an instant, they were blocked by Echidna.\u2014 Don't you dare touch Kang Yu!Unlike the guys earlier who have already been defeated, these attackers were much more powerful.Following her instincts, Echidna stood in front of Kang Yu to protect him from the monsters, sensing a danger to Kang Yu's life.The demons, catching scent of the girl's great power, shrunk in retreat.\u2014 Echidna.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026? \u2014 Turning to Kang Yu who put his hand on her shoulder, Echidna continued worriedly: \u2014 Kang Yu, it's dangerous. You could get hurt. This time, I\u2026 \u2014\u2014 You just don't know me well yet. \u2014 He smiled and stepped forward. \u2014 I can stand up to guys like this for sure. \u2014It'd been a long ten thousand years.Before becoming Lord of Hell, he'd fought and defeated a colossal amount of demons.That's why there was no one in this world who could handle this better.Kang Yu produced a blade of Magi in his hand, and looked at the monsters in cold blood.In a flash, the men who had turned into demons ran in his direction, ready to attack.'I wonder if it's because of their healthy bodies.'Every time they pushed off the ground, the asphalt under their feet sagged.Escaping their attack, Kang Yu sunk a blade into the space between the ribs of one of the demons.The blade, which was about 30 centimeters long, plunged deep in the demon's chest.For a man, this wound would have been fatal.'But it's different with a demon.'Demon bodies had a very different rate of cell regeneration.He fired another blade of Magi into the demon's chest.The wound swelled up and the body was blown to shreds, blood fountaining to the side.'And this is how he dies.'Kang Yu, ignoring the pieces of flesh lying around, moved on to the next monster.\u2014 Ahhhh!With each movement, each of the monsters cried in excruciating pain.Although they'd decided to 'unleash their power,' the style of battle and the outcome of the battle has not changed a bit.In fact, it was the other way around. Now that Kang Yu determined they could no longer provide any information of use to him, he was even more motivated to finish them off.\u2014 Ahhh!Because of their clouded desire for information, they couldn't even feel the slightest fear.As monsters, they could only continue crying instinctively.They were neither hunters, nor feeders, nor creatures capable of defeating even weaker creatures.They were only followers that obeyed the instructions of a lord far away from them.As they squealed, the monsters began to flee.Kang Yu, watching the demons running in all directions, laughed coldly:\u2014 It's too late to run away.He slowly stretched his right hand forward.The strongest Magi flared up in his body. The ground trembled.[Land of the Blades]Breaking through the asphalt, hundreds, thousands of blades shot up.Like a wave in stormy seas, the blades quickly caught up with the fleeing monsters.Rising from the ground, the dozens of blades ruthlessly pierced the bodies of the fleeing monsters.\u2014 Ugh. \u2014 Kang Yu exhaled and took his phone out from his pocket. \u2014 Seriously, what is\u00a0in\u00a0this video? \u2014Holding up the phone, he played the video again.Yet again, the moans and seductive words of the woman were heard.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu frowned.'No matter how you look at it, it's just porn.'At that moment, while he kept staring at the screen in perplexity, he heard a voice:\u2014 Are you sure it's here?\u2014 That's right! The signal was definitely coming from here\u2026Baek Hwa Yeon and Chae Young-ju were heading in his direction quickly.'Chae Young-ju?'Hearing the familiar voice, he became confused.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026 \u2013 Young-ju's eyes were wide. She hadn't expected to meet him here. \u2014 You\u2026 why are you here? \u2014\u2014 I'm the one who should ask you that. What's going on here?\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Remembering the reason why they'd come to this dark alley, she continued quickly: \u2014 Kang Yu, did you happen to find a memory card with a video here? \u2014\u2014 This one?Taking the SD card out of his phone, the girl's eyes twinkled.\u2014 Yes, that one!\u2014 But why are you looking for a video like this\u2026\u2014 The card contains a very important video.\u2014 What\u2026? \u2014 The guy stared at Young-ju in shock.Young-ju's gaze on him was sincere.\u2014 I need it.\u2014 This card\u2026? \u2014 Kang Yu asked again with a serious tone.Young-ju nodded her head urgently.\u2014 There's something we need to know. Hand it over now and we'll find out Hurry up.The guy looked down at the memory card, and goosebumps ran through his body.The contents of the card came back to light in his mind.'If I give it to them now, they'll find out\u2026?'What could possibly be so important in this kind of video?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, it concerns you, too.'I've already looked at it.'This video was definitely of some value, but Kang Yu was stuck in bewilderment.\u2014 Hwa Yeon, where is your man?\u2014 He's dead\u2026 \u2014 said the girl with a heavy voice as she returned to them, walking through the scattered bodies.Approaching Kang Yu, she quietly asked:\u2014 What happened before we found you?\u2014 I have no idea either. \u2014 Kang Yu heaved a sigh and told them what had happened in the alley, from the moment the dying man gave him the memory card to the moment the girls showed up.\u2014 They appeared as soon as you picked up the card?\u2014 Yes.\u2014 So you got involved by accident\u2026 \u2014 Hwa Yeon clutched her head like she had a migraine.\u2014 I'm also curious. Tell me, what exactly is going on here?\u2014 Let's watch the video first, and I'll explain everything.Young-ju hurriedly inserted the memory card into her phone and started the video.\u2014 Oh, by the way. About the vi\u2026 \u2014 But Kang Yu's warning came too late. The sound of moans filled the air.\u2014 What the\u2026 \u2014 The red haired girl muttered and her face turned the color of her hair.Hwa Yeon leaned in and eyed the video carefully.\u2014 It's a fake video. To see the real video hidden behind it, you have to run it through a decoder.\u2014 Why did he use\u00a0that\u00a0video as a fake video?! \u2014 Young-ju shouted, flustered.Hwa Yeon answered with a serious expression:\u2014 What's wrong with that? The head office advised him to use an adult video as a disguise. Kang Dong Hong only did what he was taught.\u2014 Okay, wait a minute. I mean\u2026Young-ju quickly turned her eyes to Kang Yu.\u2014 You\u2026 you watched it.\u2014 Yes, I did.\u2014 So why didn't you say anything?!\u2014 Because you said 'hand it over now and we'll find out\u2026'\u2014 What were we supposed to find out from this?! \u2014 The girl screamed at him with tomato-colored cheeks.Kang Yu laughed, now realizing it was a fake video.\u2014 That's why I was wondering what we were going to find out from that video.\u2014 Ah\u2026 ahh!She was shaking with shame.But she couldn't retaliate. She was the one who rushed to take the memory card from him.\u2014 So what's going on? Why was there a hunt for that SD card?\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju took a deep breath and explained the situation.Thanks to her detailed story, Kang Yu's questions were answered one by one.\u2014 So, today you were going to meet with your employee who broke into Hell's School to gather information?\u2014 Yes. When we received the first SOS signal, we searched all over the district, but we couldn't find him. After that, we got the last signal coming from here.\u2014 Um\u2026 So this map contains information about the Devil's Teachers.Kang Yu finally began to understand the reason why he was being targeted, and why Hwa Yeon asked him to give them the 'important video.''That's why there were so few Hwaran people around the Gate today.' There was a good chance that the first squad was sent to the man's supposed location as armed reinforcements.\u2014 That's right. I really wasn't trying to look for porn! You know that, right?!\u2014 I got it. Are you that worried about it?Probably because the girl was embarrassed, but she was holding onto Kang Yu's head while yelling at him.At that moment, Echidna walked over and said:\u2014 Don't grab Kang Yu. \u2014 She pulled the guy's shirt towards her and squinted at Young-ju with a look of disbelief.\u2014 That child\u2026\u2014 She's the one I mentioned earlier.\u2014 Oh, the dragon? \u2014 Young-ju was surprised to see Echidna.She didn't look like a dragon in any way; she looked more like a beautiful doll.\u2014 Are you sure it's a tamed creature? You're not doing anything\u2026weird with her, right?\u2014 You really have me mixed up with garbage, don't you?\u2014 Ah\u2026 well, I guess I can't say that about you. \u2014 Young-ju nodded her head when she realized her mistake. \u2014 You're a different type of garbage. \u2014\u2014 Did you just praise me or insult me? \u2014 Kang Yu stared at her in confusion.Echidna, who was watching them this whole time, went to Young-ju:\u2014 Take it back.\u2014 Oh\u2026\u2014 Kang Yu isn't garbage, he's an important person to me.\u2014 It's\u2026\u2014 If you don't apologize, I won't forgive you. \u2014 Magi started to appear around her.Young-ju, seeing the doll-like girl look so angry, scratched the back of her head, feeling sheepish.\u2014 Okay, I take it back.\u2014 Then that's fine\u2026 \u2014 Echidna calmed down and buried her head in Kang Yu's shirt.Rubbing her cheek against him, the guy gently stroked her head.When Young-ju saw the pair's behavior, she laughed.\u2014 How did you make her do that?Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 It's because dragons value honor and loyalty.\u2014 Don't talk nonsense. \u2014 The guild leader's cheeks flushed red and she turned away.(Editor's Note: I think she's embarrassed because Kang Yu is implying the dragon has a better sense of respect than Young-ju. FYI, the original text just says \u201cshe\u201d without specifying which girl says this line and blushes, but it doesn't make as much sense for Echidna to dismiss Kang Yu's words.)Hwa Yeon returned to the place where Young Ju and Kang Yu were, now finished dealing with the aftermaths of the fight.\u2014 First of all, we need to get to the main office. It's the only place capable of decrypting the video.\u2014 Okay. Kang Yu, you're going too, right?\u2014 Well, if that's the case, then we should go. \u2014 Kang Yu shrugged his shoulders and followed Baek Hwa Yeon.They arrived at the headquarters of Hwaran, not far from the scene.Unlike the 'perfect' Players' Control Department, Hwaran's office was decorated with taste, but no frills.\u2014 Commander, you're here!As soon as Baek Hwa Yeon crossed the threshold of the building, Players wearing their trademark clothes appeared from everywhere to greet her.Hwa Yeon nodded firmly and said:\u2014 Kang Dong Hong has died in the line of duty. I'll contact his family. Prepare a reward for his service.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 He is a hero of our country. Make any unworthy information about him disappear.\u2014 Got it!Hwa Yeon looked around and continued:\u2014 Where is Commander Jang Hyun Jae now?\u2014 He's currently in Japan studying the Level SS Gate.\u2014 Huh\u2026Jang Hyun Jae.Her mentor and the person responsible for the first squad.He was such a strong and powerful man that there was not a single soul in Korea who did not know his name.'If only the commander were here\u2026' Baek Hwa Yeon took a deep breath.She thought to herself, if only he was here right now, Kang Dong Hong would never have died.\u2014 We're going to the lab. Get the decoder ready.\u2014 Yes!Baek Hwa Yeon headed to the lab with her guests.After decrypting the video on the SD card, they moved their eyes to the black screen.The first thing they saw was the image of someone unknown wearing a red mask of the devil.'The red mask of the devil.' Kang Yu's eyes glinted with interest as he watched the video.He suddenly remembered what Cho Dok Hyun had said to him recently.'Did he find information about this service?' Kang Yu continued to watch the video carefully.\u2014 Cardinal, if I may speak. \u2014 The video showed another person kneeling in front of the masked man in the dark room. His whole face was tattooed with geometric patterns.He bowed his head at the masked cardinal's feet as a token of respect, and spoke in a trembling voice:\u2014 We are almost finished preparing for the draft.\u2014 How long do we have to wait?\u2014 Four weeks\u2026 if we speed it up, we can make it in three.\u2014 Three weeks\u2026 \u2014 The masked man nodded his head at this. \u2014 Faster than I thought. Are you getting enough support? \u2014\u2014 Yes, I am. Maybe because they're Big Guild Players, but most trained victims had special abilities above Class B.\u2014 That's great\u2026 Hhha. There's not much time left before my wish will be fulfilled. This is incomparable with our first steps. But it's still a long way from our goal.\u2014 But if we successfully complete the last case, we'll get even more support\u2026\u2014 That's enough. \u2014 The masked cardinal interrupted him in a low tone.Even through the mask, you could sense a terrifying expression.\u2014 Be careful with your words until we have completed all the preparations for our calling.\u2014 Yes! \u2014 The man worshipping him at his feet responded politely.That was the end of the videotape.A heavy silence hung in the room.Hwa Yeon and Young-ju kept looking at the blank screen with serious faces.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu, too, frowned, digesting the information from the short video.'Cardinal, Vocation and Big Guild' were the three key points of the video.The first one. Considering the red mask person was called 'Cardinal,' it could be assumed there was someone with an even more powerful position.Two. They are preparing to summon someone or something to Earth.Three. There's a large guild supporting them.\u2014 At this point, we have only one option. We have to check all the major guilds.\u2014 Huh? \u2014 Hwa Yeon was surprised to hear what Kang Yu muttered. \u2014 What makes you think that? \u2014\u2014 First of all, once they find out about the spy, they'll be even more secretive with hiding information about their summon. At this point, we won't be able to find the Devil's Teachers themselves. Which means there's nothing we can do but find their sponsor.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 She exclaimed, impressed by his analysis given the short amount of time he had to think about it. \u2014 Do you work in this industry? \u2014A strategist or an analyst. If a person doesn't belong to one of these specialties, it'd be quite difficult to understand the situation so quickly\u00a0and\u00a0propose a plan of action.\u2014 No, it's just\u2026 he's like that on his own. \u2014 Young-ju made eye contact with him.Ever since they met, they'd only had short conversations, but they'd already grown familiar with each other.\u2014 What do you suggest we do? \u2014 Young-ju, acknowledging his abilities, asked for his advice.\u2014 Well, there's only one thing we can do now, \u2014 Kang Yu said, and continued in a calm tone: \u2014 'Hanul', 'Red Rose,' 'Onnuri,' 'Mir,' and 'Sanalae.' Young-ju, one of the guilds, excluding yours, must be linked to the Devil's Teachers.\u2014 I know. But there's no way to find out exactly which one is connected to them.The large guilds were so strong that even the government didn't dare to bother them.It wasn't easy even for the government to do research on them.\u2014 There is one way\u2026\u2014 Which one?\u2014 That one. \u2014 Kang Yu smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I heard there's been an increase in Team Killers and missing persons at the lower level gates lately. \u2014 Hwa Yeon nodded affirmatively as she listened to their exchange.It wasn't until they caught wind of the Devil's Teachers that Hwaran began their investigation and found out the pseudo-religion's goal was to hunt for 'sacrifices.'In fact, when Hwa Yeon first met Kang Yu near the low-level gate, her squad was there to investigate.\u2014 That's why we have to start a rumor that an incredibly gifted Player has appeared at the lower gates, \u2014 Kang Yu continued quietly.Hwa Yeon arched an eyebrow at Kang Yu's resolute answer.\u2014 Time is ticking. \u2014 He stared into her eyes with a serious gaze.\u2014 What do you mean by that\u2026?\u2014 They've already found out that there was a spy among them. I'm sure they're wary that information about their planned summon may have leaked outside their school.\u2014 Right. But wouldn't that make them even more secretive?In response to her question, Kang Yu slowly shook his head.\u2014 They'll raise the stakes.\u2014 Raise the stakes\u2026?\u2014 If it was necessary to stop them right now, what would you do, Hwa Yeon?\u2014 Huh\u2026 If I was the one in charge of the Squad, we'd be watching the Players with special abilities of rank B and above more closely. That's the way it always works.It's the most reasonable move for Hwaran Squad if they knew that the Devil's Teachers were targeting talented Players.\u2014 And if that's the case, they won't be able to easily hunt Players with special abilities above Class B, since they won't be sure who exactly you're looking out for.\u2014 That's right.\u2014 So they'll devote all their energy to hunting Players with Class S special abilities.Baek Hwa Yeon bit her lip nervously.According to him, the Devil's Teachers will raise their stakes once they learn that they could be caught hunting Players with Class B special abilities, so they'll take a risk and hunt Players with Class S special abilities.However\u2026\u2014 Isn't it possible that they'll just delay their plan and move on to even weaker Players? \u2014 The girl asked Kang Yu cautiously.He smiled smugly.\u2014 No. They'll try to finish what they started as soon as possible. There's no way they'll sink to getting weaker Players.\u2014 What makes you think that?\u2014 Because they're human.Hwa Yeon was surprised by his answer. He continued without a moment's doubt:\u2014 They know that once they've completed what they started, they'll be able to expand and get even more support. That's why there's no way they're going to lower the stakes.\u2014 It's kind of weird. Are you telling me they're willing to put themselves in even greater danger for the benefit?\u2014 That's right.\u2014 How can you be so sure\u2026\u2014 Because all people are the same.Thrown off by his confident response, Hwa Yeon bit her lip again.Kang Yu glanced at her and smiled.\u2014 Do you know about the book 'Don't Pounce on Marmalade?'\u2014 I know it\u2026 \u2014 Hwa Yeon nodded her head.The book was a world bestseller for self-development, which basically says that if you endure temptation, you can gain greater benefits.\u2014 Do you know why it became a bestseller?\u2014 Because it outlines the basic principles that make a person successful?\u2014 No. This book became popular exactly because most people aren't like that.Confronting temptation with temptation.Looking at this simple sentence, it may not seem that difficult.To a third party who watches from the outside, people who are unable to resist temptation look nasty and stupid.But when the third party himself is in the same situation, there is a high probability that he will also succumb to temptation and act 'nasty and stupid.'Only then will he admit how dangerous temptations can be.And through this experience, he will realize that by enduring temporary gratification, he can gain greater gratification later.(Editor's Note: I believe this is a reference to the theory based on the Stanford Marshmallow Experiment\u2014 a kid is given a marshmallow and told to wait 15 minutes alone without eating it in order to get a second marshmallow.You fight the temptation of eating the first marshmallow in order to get more later, thus fighting temptation with temptation. AnywayPeople simply can't give up the sweet marmalade in front of them.It doesn't mean they're stupid or narrow-minded.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe decision is wholly influenced by passionate desire, a mechanism that blocks the ability to make other decisions.'Of course, there are also those who\u00a0are\u00a0able to control their desires.' Kang Yu's eyes gleamed.He didn't believe that all humans blindly indulge in their impulses.However, resisting temptation would be difficult for the red masked man, as it would be for all the Devil's Teachers.'Since they've got Magi.'Anyone who possesses Magi is bound to turn into a demon.And demons, as we know, are always starved for more.Even Kang Yu, who has lived as a demon for so long, often found it hard to resist temptation.That's why Kang Yu was sure that they couldn't curb the thirst, what with their inexperience.\u2014 And who are you thinking of using as bait? \u2014 asked Young-ju, who had been quietly listening to their conversation. \u2014 If it's a low-level player with a high special ability, he's probably already been noticed by the press, or he's joined one of the big guilds. Unless you're saying you want to be the bait yourself? \u2014\u2014 No. That would be hard to pull off because everyone already knows me as a talented rookie sponsored by Red Rose.\u2014 So, you're going to start a false rumor?\u2014 That would just be advertising the bait. It wouldn't work.Listening to Kang Yu's answers, Young-ju bit her lip and frowned.\u2014 Well, then who?\u2014 I have someone in mind, \u2014 Kang Yu said with a confident smile.A player who's at a low level but has a special ability higher than S class.A person who doesn't want to join a guild and is not yet known to the public.Kang Yu knew the perfect person.'Kim Si Hoon.'A man with outstanding skills who was able to subjugate himself.A player who received a first rank ability, not of Class S, but SSS.'A bait that is impossible to resist.'Remembering the unknown man with the red mask, Kang Yu narrowed his eyes.A week has passed since the spy incident.After the girls approved Kang Yu's proposal, rumors about Kim Si Hoon began to spread quietly around the country.His name wasn't in the headlines nor discussed by high-level Players.Instead, his name became the main topic of gossip among entry-level Players.'Unusual.' Kang Yu's gaze was bright as he scrolled through social media.The rumors were on the Internet, sounding like a fairytale fable.'A player at a low-level gate who hides his special high-end abilities.'Not too conspicuous, but enough to spark interest.He didn't know who had a hand in this, whether it was Young-ju or Hwa Yeon, but the information was spreading at an incredible speed.'Even though I thought that neither of them had any talent in this industry.'That Hwa Yeon, a straightforward, cold female general, and that passionate, hot-headed Young-ju both had no talent for falsifying classified information.'But I know who could have done it\u2026' In Kang Yu's memory, there was one face that appeared every time he went to the Red Rose office.A young man who gives the impression of being a calm man.The Head of Human Resources, Park Hyun Woo.'Well, it doesn't matter who handled it, it's all good.'Kang Yu put his phone in his pocket, then turned his head towards the ragged window leading to a room in the basement.Through the glass, one could see a middle-aged woman lying on the bed, and Si Hoon, who was caring for her.'Their house is even worse than Han Sol's,' Kang Yu thought while watching the boy.Si Hoon was chosen as bait a week ago.Kang Yu guarded his house 24 hours a day without going in.After all, he had no idea when the Devil's Teachers would come for him.'I can't lose this guy.'Even though Si Hoon was being used as bait, not once did Kang Yu think of putting him in real danger.Si Hoon didn't know it, but his soul was completely under Kang Yu's control.And Kang Yu wasn't going to let the boy's extraordinary strength waste away as mere bait.'After all, since I made him my subordinate, I should be responsible for him.'He believed that Si Hoon had every right to shout at him and call him names for what he was doing, but that didn't mean that Kang Yu would avoid taking responsibility.'In the future, you're going to be an outstanding person.' With a forlorn gaze, Kang Yu continued watching Si Hoon care for the woman, most likely his mother.He will become more and more powerful. And the strength Kang Yu has put into him will make him even better.Considering that, the rumors will likely spread at an even faster rate.\u2014 Mom, I'll be leaving now. \u2014 Si Hoon opened the door and headed out.He was on his way to the gate as usual, where Han Sol, Dae Su, and Eun Bi were waiting for him.As he walked outside, Si Hoon let out a sad and heavy sigh.Then he stopped, thought for a moment and shook his head, and whispered to himself like he was making a promise:\u2014 Hold on! A little more and you can repay all your debts!Si Hoon briefly touched the sheath hanging from his belt and continued on his way.Kang Yu, who was hiding nearby, smiled:'So he became a Player to pay back his debts and take care of his sick mother.'Kang Yu cocked his head to the side and followed Si Hoon.'Seriously\u2026 is he the main character?'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, surprisingly, Dae Su is\u2026 young. Thought I'd share.)After leaving the subway, he met with his teammates.Their greeting wasn't as awkward as the first time; they greeted each other like real friends now that they've formed a close relationship.\u2014 Did something happen to Han Sol\u2026? \u2014 Si Hoon asked, walking up to Dae Su with a tilt of his head.Han Sol was kicking at the innocent floor with a sad look on her face.Dae Su put his hand on the boy's shoulder, took him aside, and said in a quiet voice:\u2014 Because Kang Yu is so busy, he hasn't been home for a week.\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon made a short cry of realization and nodded his head in understanding.'Han Sol has feelings for him.'Only a stupid person wouldn't notice. Just one glance was enough to tell how she felt about Kang Yu.During their hunting breaks, she often talked about Kang Yu, and when others mentioned him, her cheeks would turn red.\u2014 So Kang Yu hasn't been home in a week\u2026That wasn't particularly surprising. After all, he's a high-level player.There were many reasons why he'd be unable to show up for an entire week.After thinking for a bit, Si Hoon asked:\u2014 She can't reach him?\u2014 No, they keep in contact. He sends her messages everyday and calls her sometimes, but doesn't say why he can't come.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 So he's not at the Gate.For obvious reasons, the radio signal doesn't reach inside the Gate.To communicate at the Gate or send signals from there, you must use a special device made from mana stones.\u2014 He won't answer her, even if she asks\u2026\u2014 Ahh\u2026 Then it's clear why she's so sad. \u2014 Si Hoon gave an awkward smile and looked at the girl. \u2014 Han Sol noona! Don't be too sad. He must have his reasons for doing that. \u2014\u2014 Yeah\u2026 Yeah, I'm sure he does. \u2014 Han Sol took a deep breath and sank her head even lower, continuing to hit the ground with her shoe. \u2014 Maybe my cooking isn't good enough\u2026 Or maybe he found someone else\u2026 \u2014Han Sol tried to be as optimistic as possible, but the more time passed, the more her anxiety increased.They had only met not so long ago, but in that short period of time, things had changed dramatically and she could no longer imagine a life without him.She wasn't the only one who was depressed.Echidna, who was left home alone, missed Kang Yu many times more.Eun Bi suddenly spoke up:\u2014 Doesn't Kang Yu live at your house?\u2014 Yes, he does\u2026\u2014 Hmm\u2026 Maybe he couldn't tolerate it anymore and left.\u2014 Tolerate what?\u2014 Well, Kang Yu is a young man. Being under the same roof as a beautiful girl like you\u2026 Hmm~~ Kang Yu's self-control\u2026\u2014 That's enough! \u2014 Si Hoon slapped Eun Bi at the back of her head, causing Han Sol to jump in shock.He smiled innocently and turned his head towards Han Sol:\u2014 Don't think about what Eun Bi said. I'm sure he has a good reason for doing that. Because unlike us, he's a high-class player.\u2014 Well, yes\u2026 I guess so\u2026\u2014 To get to his level, the only thing we can do is keep hunting.\u2014 Yeah\u2026 \u2014 There was a spark of hope in Han Sol's sad eyes.She kept nodding to herself affirmatively, encouraged by Si Hoon's words.\u2014 Well, let's go, \u2014 Si Hoon said, and started walking towards the Gate's entrance.His teammates followed, and together, they entered the Gate.Kang Yu, who was watching them, thought sadly:'I feel responsible for this.'He was only doing what he had to do, but when he saw the loneliness in Han Sol's eyes, he felt a strange wave of guilt wash over him.'Echidna must be suffering even more.'Han Sol feels sad, but Echidna is strongly dependent on Kang Yu.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksKnowing that, he tried to call as often as possible, but the more time passed, the more she missed him despite the phone calls.'Believe me, I want this to end soon, too,' Kang Yu thought, following them to the gate.He hadn't been able to eat delicious kimchi jjigae or sleep in a cozy bed for a week.They say that if a person suddenly becomes alone, it's very painful.Even for him who already lived alone for ten thousand years, it was hard.'But you can't just throw a fishing rod after spending so much effort and bait.'It wouldn't make things any better.If Kang Yu carelessly leaves Si Hoon alone and goes home to fulfill his desires, he could lose track of both Si Hoon and the Devil's Teachers. If that happened, he'd never be able to forgive himself for such a stupid act.\u2014 Come in\u2026 \u2014 After going through the usual inspections at the entrance, Kang Yu went inside the gate.\u2014 Ooh! They're really strong! \u2014 exclaimed Dae Su, putting up a shield to defend himself against the trolls waving their clubs.As soon as Dae Su swung the shield off the ground, the soil started to tremble.The troll that attacked him wobbled against his shield.\u2014 Han Sol!\u2014 Yes!Si Hoon, making sure the troll had lost its balance, quickly jumped away.Han Sol, understanding his signal, prepared to shout out the name of her magical power:\u2014 Power Boost!At the same time, a white light appeared from her body and headed for Si Hoon's body.Si Hoon's movements became much faster as he fought the trolls. He jumped into the air, then kicked to the ground with force.With a brief shout, he left a clear mark on the ground.'Second position.'Using flight, the power he had spread all over his body.With it, like a dragon, he instantly went up in the air and rushed down on the monsters, cutting them in half with his shining sword.Because of Musin Jeon Tae Hwan's soul, his body was able to move as his ancestor would.He cut them from their chest to their shins.A number of trolls fell to the ground in pain.As expected of monsters, they were more resilient than humans, and even when cut remained conscious.\u2014 Shining Spear!However, no matter how hard they tried to keep moving, they had no chance of surviving.An electric charge from Eun Bi's staff pierced the trolls' hearts.As they fell to the ground, the trolls shook and black smoke began to pour out of their mouths.\u2014 Phew, the monsters at the C Gate are strong!\u2014 We've hunted goblins in packs of five before, but now, if more than three trolls come together, it's already dangerous to handle, \u2014 Dae Su said, stretching his arms after the fight.\u2014 But it's been less than a month and we're on par with the trolls now. Who else is levelling up as fast as us?\u2014 Hhha, it's all thanks to Si Hoon. It all started right from the moment we gathered our party! I was certain we'd be a great group, but I didn't think that in less than a month we would be able to raise our level so much that we could hunt at the Level C Gate.Dae Su, hardly able to believe that they just killed the trolls, recklessly cheered.\u2014 If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have been able to get to the Level C Gate so fast either. \u2014\u00a0 Si Hoon smiled with a tilt of his head as usual. \u2014 Let's quickly gather the mana stones and continue. \u2014\u2014 Oh, I also heard that blood from the heart of trolls is widely used in medications, so it can be sold for a high price.Kim Si Hoon and Party, after collecting Mana stones and blood from the trolls, went to look for their next victims.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu's eyes glimmered with pride, watching his teammates.'They've gotten much better.'The movement and cohesion of the group was on a completely different level.Each one of them understood and accepted the role of their teammates, so their dexterity improved as well.'If Han Sol was only able to heal, it would be bad.'Normally, everyone forgets about the supports in a strong party, because strong Players receive almost no injuries.However, Han Sol could both buff and heal \u2014 a support that could perform two tasks at once.Even in a strong party, it's important not to forget nor underestimate the value of supports.'I'm beginning to think that they won't even need my help.' Kang Yu smiled widely, following the group.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu clicked his tongue and looked around. \u2014 It's time they noticed our bait. \u2014It's been a week now.The Devil's Teachers don't have much time left to complete their summoning plan, so they should be in a panic by now.Now would be a good time to reach out for the delicious bait.Kang Yu used the Observer's Power to find out where Si Hoon's Party was.'What?' At that moment, Kang Yu felt two people approaching the group, thanks to his Power.This gate was popular, and it wouldn't be strange if they happened to run into another party here.However\u2026'They killed trolls with just one blow.'While heading towards Si Hoon's group, they each encountered a troll and killed the monster with one stone. The most important thing to note was that they didn't take any mana stones and just continued to follow the group.'They\u2026' Kang Yu's eyes gleamed.At last, the week-long torment has borne fruit.'They took the bait.' Kang Yu licked his lips and followed the group.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Si Hoon, I didn't expect to see you here!\u2014 Kim Yeong Hoon\u2026? \u2014 Si Hoon frowned when he saw the man headed in the same direction as their next hunting ground.Kim Yeong Hoon.The deputy commander of one of the five largest guilds in the country, namely Mir, and also the son of CEO Kim Jae Hyun.In other words, a child born with a golden spoon in his mouth.The only reason he became famous was because he was a man born into a rich family.Of course, he doesn't actually have anything.Unlike his outstanding father, who was ranked among the top of the country's strongest players, which could be counted on fingers, he had average abilities.However, the fact that he had no talent to become a Player did not prevent him, someone born with money and power, from following in his father's footsteps.After all, thanks to money, he could get out of any situation as the winner.\u2014 Do you know him?\u2014 Isn't he the deputy commander in Mir? \u2014 asked Han Sol and Dae Su, looking at each other.Kim Yeong Hoon leaned slightly towards them and said:\u2014 It's nice to meet you. My name is Kim Yeong Hoon. Oh my, Si Hoon is always in a party with beautiful people, \u2014 the man said, looking at Han Sol with beaming eyes and a happy smile.\u2014 What are you doing here\u2026? \u2014 Si Hoon kept his gaze on him, suspicious.Si Hoon, who is by nature a calm man, was growing very angry.\u2014 Huh? Of course, I'm here to hunt. What else is there to do here?\u2014 In that case, get out of my sight and go hunting.\u2014 Hhha! Aren't you being a little rude to your big brother?\u2014 Are you kidding?! \u2014 Because Kim Yeong Hoon called himself his big brother, Si Hoon started shaking.Angrily looking into the guy's eyes, Si Hoon growled out sharply:\u2014 How\u00a0dare\u00a0you call yourself my big brother?!\u2014 Hhha, yes, we're not ordinary brothers. \u2014 Yeong Hoon smiled and nodded, clearly enjoying the situation. \u2014 Unlike you, I don't have dirty blood in me. \u2014\u2014 You bastard! \u2014 Si Hoon drew out his sword with hatred in his eyes.'Dirty blood.'He'd heard those words before, and they were carved deep into his heart, a wound on the inside.\u2014 What is it? Are you going to attack your brother? \u2014 Yeong Hoon also took out his shining blue sword in return.Even watching from the outside, it was clear that he was excited.Si Hoon shuddered when he saw him pull out his sword.Yeong Hoon was strong. No, he wasn't really that strong. To be more precise, it was the expensive outfit that made him strong.Si Hoon turned silent.\u2014 Hha. That's right. Hmm\u2026 there have been rumors about you lately.\u2014 Rumors? \u2014 Si Hoon frowned and looked at the guy across him.\u2014 They say you have a high-class special ability. At least rank S.Si Hoon looked at him with surprise.\u2014 Huh. I didn't know you'd turn out to be the one who became a high-class special ability player in such a short time.\u2014 What are you talking about\u2026?\u2014 We need a 'victim' like you. \u2014 Yeong Hoon smiled madly and licked his lips.\u2014 A victim\u2026? \u2014 That didn't sound good. Si Hoon frowned at this.Yeong Hoon turned his gaze to his four teammates, his eyes gleaming.\u2014 Oh-ho-ho. And your teammates have good abilities, too. Thanks to you, we've hit the jackpot.Si Hoon didn't know how to respond to a statement like that.\u2014 And of course, we won't use that beautiful lady as a victim. I think there will be\u2026 other activities for her.Kim Yeong Hoon lustfully ogled at Han Sol from head to toe.The girl wrapped her arms around her body like a snake, quivering.\u2014 What are you planning to do\u2026?\u2014 Hha. If you come with me willingly, you'll know,\u2014 Who'd go with a bastard like you\u2026\u2014 Well, if you don't want to, you don't have to. But we'll make you do it anyway.Kim Yeong Hoon raised his sword to his partner on his right:\u2014 And you stay out of it. This is my prey.\u2014 Understood, \u2014 said the guy standing next to him, bare of emotions.Si Hoon was shaken with anger.He remembered the humiliation he faced because of Yeong Hoon, his half-brother from his father's side.Even though they shared one father, their lives were as different as the sky and earth.When Kim Jae Hyun was younger, he had an affair with another woman and that's how Si Hoon was born, who received only contempt and mockery from Yeong Hoon since he was a child.But at some point, Jae Hyun became sick of his passionate love and left Si Hoon alone with his sick mother.They were left to fend for themselves, with no one to help them.That's why there was a huge hole in Si Hoon's heart filled with hatred, now pouring out.'If only I were a little stronger\u2026' This thought had visited him hundreds, thousands of times.He believed that eventually, after going through all this torment, he'll finally achieve it.The spirit of Musin Jeon Tae Hwan. A special ability of the SSS class.Unlike other Players, he was able to level up much faster.'However\u2026' Inexplicable despair was rising inside him.There was still a huge gap between him and Yeong Hoon.Firstly, the latter was already on rank 6, secondly, the difference in their levels was too big.No matter how good a special ability he had, it was unrealistic to compensate for such a big difference in levels.'If only I had a little more time\u2026'If he'd obtained at least rank 4 or 5, then there would have been at least a small chance of beating Yeong Hoon in battle.But it was stupid to hope for.After all, he was a low-level Player only at rank 3.\u2014 Well, perhaps I should teach my insolent little brother a lesson in courtesy! \u2013 Yeong Hoon gripped the sword's hilt tighter and pushed off the ground.He was approaching Si Hoon with great speed.His sharp sword, emitting poisonous energy, was pointed towards the guy.But this attack was successfully repulsed by Dae Su.The sword hit the raised shield with force, and Dae Su, not expecting such power, bit his lip and then declared:Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 I don't know what your relationship is with Si Hoon, but I, Kang Dae Su, won't let you touch him!\u2014 What kind of a muscular pig is this? \u2013 Yeong Hoon, with his face distorted, stared at Dae Soo who hit him back.He repulsed the attack and immediately pulled the shield forward and struck.The big one, Dae Su's height of two meters, was resisting Yeong Hoon.\u2014 Huh? \u2014 A worried cry came out of Dae Su's mouth.As soon as Dae Su's shield touched the black armor covering Yeong Hoon's whole body, it was thrown back with a strong discharge.\u2014 Bastard, why are you interfering?! \u2014 Yeong Hoon, dissatisfied with Dae Su's interference in his fight, pointed the sword at him.\u2014 Dae Su, watch out!He was thrown back from the unexpected attack after using his shield.He fell on the shield and it shattered into thousands of pieces.\u2014 Oh, shit! \u2014 Si Hoon, after swearing, quickly dashed at Yeong Hoon.'Fifth position!'The gap in levels between the brothers was more than 30 units.If he didn't try his best, he wouldn't have a single chance to win.\u2014 Boost!At the same time, Han Sol, feeling that her teammate needed strength, started buffing.In an instant, his body got stronger.'If so\u2026' Si Hoon's eyes glowed as he pointed his sword at Yeong Hoon.As soon as Si Hoon started attacking, the guy raised his sword and countered the attack.Because of the big difference in levels and characteristics, from strength to speed, Yeong Hoon was superior to his brother in everything.But for some reason, he was still unable to repel all the attacks.\u2014 Ignorant fool\u2026 \u2014 Yeong Hoon's face quickly turned red, watching Si Hoon's sword that touched his armor.Although Yeong Hoon was superior to his opponent in every aspect, the fact that he missed an attack from a weaker Player made him feel shameful.\u2014 And you're all in your repertoire. \u2014 Yeong Hoon looked at Si Hoon unhappily.Since he was a child, Si Hoon has always performed better.Yeong Hoon could never get ahead of Si Hoon, neither in studies nor in sports.And as a Player. Si Hoon had talent, but Yeong Hoon didn't.'But!' Yeong Hoon's lip corners were twitching.Talent didn't matter. He had the power and money to replace his lack of talent.Yeong Hoon knocked away his opponent's sword and kicked him on the chest.A bright light came out of his shoes, and Si Hoon flew back with force.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 Hhha! That's right! This is your limit! Can't you see the real difference between us! No matter how hard you try, you can never get to my level. \u2014 He approached Si Hoon lying on the ground and hit him in the face. \u2014 Hhha! So, are you coming with us yet? \u2014Yeong Hoon's rough slapping caused him to bleed.\u2014 Shining Spear!\u2014 Holy Punch!To protect Si Hoon, Han Sol and Eun Bi used magic.\u2014 Ahh! \u2014 Even Dae Su, who lost his shield, ran to Yeong Hoon to attack him with his bare hands.\u2014 Ha, you're all crazy here\u2026 \u2014 Yeong Hoon, with a fatigued look, dodged all the magic attacks.At that moment, Dae Su ran up to Si Hoon and dragged him away.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 Si\u2026 Si Hoon!Si Hoon leaned on his sword and staggered to stand.Han Sol quickly approached him and started healing his wounds.\u2014 Run, everyone\u2026 \u2014 said Dae Su.\u2014 We can't do this!\u2014 This\u2026 this is my problem and I have to solve it. \u2014 Si Hoon walked to Yeong Hoon, wobbling in his steps.He was angry.He was pissed off by the fact that this man still managed to wrap his finger around him.He was angry that he didn't have enough strength to defeat him.He couldn't stand it anymore.He was enraged by his own weakness.\u2014 Do you need strength?That was when someone's rude voice sounded in his ears.'So the Devil's Teachers were connected to the Mir Guild.' Kang Yu's eyes gleamed as he silently watched the battle between Yeong Hoon and Si Hoon.Once he mentioned 'victim,' the guild's connection with the Devil's Teacher was fully proven.'So Si Hoon is that rich man's illegitimate son\u2026'The last time Kang Yu saw a picture of Yeong Hoon, he'd certainly noticed a similarity, but he couldn't have imagined that they were connected in this way.'Time to move out?' Kang Yu had finished calling and informing everyone involved in their plan.He got up from his seat and came out of hiding.At that moment, strong energy started to flow from Si Hoon.\u2014 Huh?'What the hell is that?'Surrounded by the strong energy, Si Hoon raised his sword again, which he used as a cane to stand up with.'Turning point?' Kang Yu stopped and watched the guy.Si Hoon directed his sword at his opponent.\u2014 Yes! I need strength!'I'm right.'\u2014 A force strong enough to kill that bastard! A force that can protect the people I love!'His monologue can be heard all throughout the Gate.'Like a bomb, a force broke out of Si Hoon's body.His blade caught fire with a blue flame Kang Yu had never seen before.He received several notifications.[Your subordinate Kim Si Hoon has received the power of 'Musin.'][Your subordinate Kim Si Hoon has gained new abilities: Dragon Strike and Dragon Walk.]'Okay. I approve if it's you. Be the main character, kid.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 1)Editor: Cherish\u2014 Do you need strength? \u2014 There was a rough voice in his head.Si Hoon intuitively guessed it was the voice of Musin's spirit, Jeon Tae Hwan.'I want it!'He had no reason to doubt it. Nor did he have the time.Si Hoon decided that even if he was going to die today, he would have to get Musin's power by all means.Together with the sound of a notice, a frame warning appeared before his eyes.[You've received the power of Musin Jeon Tae Hwan]['Container' isn't full, you only receive part of the power.](Editor's Note: From our translations it said 'bowl,' I prefer vessel or container, not sure what the correct English equivalent term should really be.)Too busy to read all the notices now, he felt powerful energy bursting in his body.There was so much power that at some point he even worried if it would blow him up..The guy made an agonizing groan.To endure the pain, he strongly bit down on his lip.At last came the moment he'd been waiting for with all his heart.That's why the pain he was enduring was nothing compared to what he'd been expecting for so long.His veins began to protrude his skin, and his body flushed red.The pain made everything before his eyes white.'I must endure.'Si Hoon looked at Yeong Hoon with his burning eyes.The suffering and mockery he'd endured continued to spin in his head.Compared to all the mental suffering he had experienced so far, this physical pain was nothing.[Learning the Ultimate Dragon's Rapid Strike][Dragon Strike and Dragon Walk][Learning the first step, applying changes]Information about learning particular abilities began to pop up in his head.He was naturally learning how to control this explosive power.With all his strength, the guy raised his sword and directed it at Kim Yeong Hoon.\u2014 Kim Yeong Hoon! \u2014 An angry scream came out of Si Hoon's mouth.Managing his power, Si Hoon used Dragon's Walk and rushed towards Yeong Hoon.\u2014 That's\u2026 what the hell is that?! \u2014 Yeong Hoon screamed with a bewildered expression when he saw the guy who was on the brink of death suddenly gain great power.He quickly raised his sword and prepared to repel Si Hoon's attack with swift moves.Si Hoon's sword was shrouded in a haze of light as if a snake had escaped his rival's weapon and walked across his chest.He easily cut through the high-end armor that Yeong Hoon was wearing.Screaming in agonizing pain, scarlet blood poured from his chest.\u2014 Bastard!!! \u2014 Yeong Hoon, who was full of hatred, started waving his sword around non-stop.Thanks to the high-class outfit and high level, the edge of his sword began to gather strong energy.\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon, after being struck by the sword, moved back a bit.Even with Musin's strength, he couldn't beat the Player 30 units ahead of him in level.'But\u2026' Si Hoon's eyes sparkled sharply.Si Hoon was behind him in both strength and speed, but there was something in which Yeong Hoon was worse at.The art of fighting.The perfect sword technique he possesses.This technique is the only way he can surpass Yeong Hoon.'Dragon Punch No. 3 with a sword!'The knowledge about this technique was passed on from Musin Jeon Tae Hwan first to the guy's head and then scattered over his body.Yeong Hoon wrapped himself in a white shroud on all sides, so he couldn't see anything beyond his nose.Si Hoon's sword pierced through the veil, throwing back his opponent.\u2014 Why\u2026 why can a Level 20 Player throw me back?! \u2014 Yeong Hoon yelled, unable to accept what was happening.This couldn't be happening. But it was, and it was happening to him right now.He didn't have any experience in fights or knowledge about any techniques.The only reason he was stronger than Si Hoon was because of his expensive equipment and high level.\u2014 Ahh! \u2014 Yeong Hoon was reaching his limit, choking on shame for being unable to defend against Si Hoon's strikes.With the logic of 'if I die, you should too,' Young Hoon threw himself at the guy with a crazy look.But with such a reckless attack, it was now impossible to defeat or even hit Si Hoon, who had gained Musin's power.At that moment, Si Hoon realized he had a great opportunity and pulled his sword to Yeong Hoon's neck.'Victory!' His eyes shone brightly with hope.But before the sword could touch Yeong Hoon's neck, the air around them darkened and there was an obstacle.The guy who'd come with Yeong Hoon.He countered Si Hoon's attack with a double-sided axe, and then pushed him back.After receiving a powerful blow to his chest, dark blood flowed from Si Hoon's mouth.\u2014 Ugh, what were you doing before?! \u2014 Yeong Hoon yelled at the guy now standing next to him, who was recently ordered not to interfere.Even though he was unjustly accused, his expression didn't change a bit and he bowed deeply to Yeong Hoon.\u2014 Excuse me, Deputy.\u2014 Hurry\u2026 chop him up and bring him to me!\u2014 Yes. \u2014 The man nodded his head without hesitation once he received the order.His name was Jong Myung Ho.He was one of the few talented players in the Mir Guild, and also the chief guard.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksMyung Ho, who was the same size as Dae Su, had a double-sided axe with which he rushed to Si Hoon.\u2014 If you come with us, we'll leave one of your hands intact.\u2014 What nonsense\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon bled as he stood up, leaning on his sword.But Si Hoon himself was also aware that he couldn't defeat the big guy coming at him.[Your internal organs are severely damaged][If you do not take action, your condition will deteriorate]The system's warnings intervened with Si Hoon's thoughts.Collapsing, he knelt on one knee.'No matter what, I can't win?' There was a huge wall of 30 levels between him and Yeong Hoon that he couldn't overcome.No, in fact, he couldn't even reach that wall to begin with.\u2014 Let's face it. \u2014 Myung Ho was getting closer and closer to the guy. \u2014 In the end, you're weaker than our deputy. \u2014The words he said so confidently cut Si Hoon's heart like a sharp knife.But it was true.No matter what he did, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't grab onto Yeong Hoon.From the beginning, this path was too complicated and long.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 A sad tear rolled down Si Hoon's cheek.He remembered the face of his mother who had been abandoned by Kim Jae Hyun.'I'm sorry I gave birth to you,' the words spoken by his weeping mother after that man left their house.'I'm sorry I gave birth to you\u2026' \u2014 is there anything more painful in this world than those words?But he couldn't deny her words, because he hasn't found a single reason for his existence.His existence is filled with pain; there hasn't been a single moment of happiness.\u2014 I'm sorry, guys\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon said, shivering as he bowed his head to Han Sol, Dae Su, and Eun Bi.Though they'd only met a short while ago, they were his first and only friends.He felt responsible for putting them in this situation, and sorry that he could not protect them.\u2014 You have to admit, pain is a feeling only the weak have, \u2014 Myung Ho said as he swung his axe.Si Hoon turned his head towards the large man approaching him. The axe pointed at his leg was already swinging through the air.\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon quickly shut his eyes.When he imagined that his leg was about to be cut off, fear began to take hold of his mind.There was a rattle of metal, followed by Jong Myung Ho's scream.Si Hoon slowly opened his eyes.Someone's back was right in front of him.\u2014 Huh. Wonderful words. \u2014 Kang Yu nodded thoughtfully with a self-assured smile on his face, easily pushing Myung Ho's axe aside.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026? \u2014 Si Hoon uttered in surprise, staring at the guy who came out of nowhere.Kang Yu turned his head slightly to look back at him, and calmly said:\u2014 Let's leave the explanations for later. Get some rest. Han Sol, help Si Hoon.\u2014 Ah\u2026 yes! \u2014 Han Sol nodded her head.After not seeing Kang Yu for so long, her face reflected both joy and discouragement.\u2014 You're from Hwaran\u2026? \u2014 Myung Ho cautiously asked, keeping his eyes on the guy.Of course, they knew very well that the government was investigating the Devil's Teachers.Considering that the government hasn't been acting out lately, waiting for the right time, there was a good chance the man who just appeared was one of their employees.\u2014 If so, do you think I'd come alone?\u2014 Well, in that case\u2026\u2014 You and I are not so close to be asking so many questions. You'd better start attacking.Myung Ho, with a rigid expression on his face, lifted his axe from the ground.Kang Yu was right.In this situation, empty conversation was pointless.\u2014 In that case, I'll make you talk.\u2014 Hhha. That's great. That's the right attitude to have. \u2014 Kang Yu flashed a bloodthirsty smile and pulled his hands forward. \u2014 Come, attack. \u2014Kang Yu's cheeky behavior caused Myung Ho's expression to falter.He put power into his arm with the axe and blue energy from Maryok began to envelop him.Unlike Myung Ho who was preparing for a furious attack, Kang Yu lazily stood, waiting with his arms crossed on his chest.'This self-righteous bastard.' Myung-ho looked at the relaxed guy with hatred and dissatisfaction, who wasn't even preparing for the fight. 'Last time, he was just lucky.'This time, he won't get off so easily.Myung Ho picked up his sword full of Maryok and rushed to Kang Yu.The axe, shrouded in bright blue light, was aimed at the guy's throat.Kang Yu slowly raised one hand at the axe flying towards him.'Crazy!'Without any protection, he was going to stop the two sided-axe with his bare hands.Everything has a limit, even madness.He watched, waiting for the axe flying to Kang Yu to cut him in half.\u2014 What?!The axe he'd put all his power into was easily stopped by Kang Yu.\u2014 What was it that you said earlier? Oh, I remember now.The axe caught by the guy started bending right in his hands.With a charming smile, he continued:\u2014 Was it\u2026 pain is a feeling that only weak people are entitled to? \u2014 Kang Yu nodded his head, licking his lips. \u2014 I agree with you completely. \u2014The axe fell to the ground, flattened like it was squashed under a press.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 2)Editor: Cherish\u2014 Wha\u2026 what the\u2026 \u2014 Jong Myung Ho's pupils were dilated.He was horrified as he slowly turned his eyes to the flattened axe lying on the ground, and his body began to shake.It just couldn't have happened.But it did, and it happened right in front of his eyes.The guy had caught the metal axe with his bare hands and bent it.He wasn't a green monster like in the movies, yet he was doing something unimaginable.(Editor's Note: Likely referring to Hulk.)Myung Ho raised his right fist. The muscles on his hand were visibly protruding.He aimed his fist, strong as steel, at Kang Yu's face.But it didn't change anything.Kang Yu, with a calm expression on his face, stopped the fist approaching him.Although Myung Ho was a big man, in this battle with Kang Yu, he looked more like a helpless little child.Kang Yu pulled Myung Ho towards him with the hand he'd grabbed, and kicked his chest with force.Using the Power of the Thousand, he left a dent on Myung Ho's chest, who was stronger than a giant orc.\u2014 Ah\u2026The large man fell to the ground and threw up. And then again and again, until dark blood spilled out of his mouth.It was clear from his face that he was terrified.\u2014 What the hell are you doing?! \u2014 Yeong Hoon suddenly shouted.Myung Ho, who couldn't stop his body from shaking, lifted himself from the ground.\u2014 I'm\u2026 I'm sorry.\u2014 Oh, this is bad\u2026 who is that?! \u2014 Yeong Hoon seemed troubled, and he started biting his nails nervously.He didn't know anything about that impudent man who just showed up.But one thing he was sure of was that this guy was strong, so strong that even Myung Ho couldn't beat him.'There's no other way.' Yeong Ho squinted.\u2014 Jong Myung Ho, use Magi.The man was hesitant to obey.\u2014 What are you doing?! Use the Magi! \u2014 Yeong Ho screamed again, nervous.The muscles on Myung Ho's face slowly tensed up.A heavy expression showed on his face.\u2014 Understood\u2026He put his left hand over his heart. It's beating. He felt a ripple in his chest. The Magi hidden inside began to burst out.His body was enveloped in dark and dense energy.\u2014 Aah! \u2014 Myung Ho opened his mouth wide and his eyes turned red.Changes began to take over his body as his veins expanded, and his skin started to turn black. Horns appeared on his forehead, and wings, like the wings of a bat, pierced through the skin on his back.The Hellish energy spreading from his heart had turned his body into a demon.At the same time, a desire to destroy everything around him grew.The thoughts began to overwhelm his mind, as his body grew in size.He let out a roar, more like a beast than a human. His spreading wings stretched behind his back.\u2014 Oh-ho-ho! \u2014 Kang Yu's eyes shone and he sighed admiringly as he watched.'Of all the people I've seen, he looks most like a demon.'After returning to Earth, he had already met a couple of people who possessed Magi, but it was the first time he had seen someone who resembled a demon to this extent.'However\u2026' Kang Yu's smile was wide.Even though his opponent had become a demon, nothing had changed. He was still about the same level as Kang Yu at 6th rank, or Young-ju.Becoming a demon didn't give him any advantage at all.\u2014 Come on, hurry up and kill that jerk! \u2014 Yeong Hoon shouted out.A strong energy was coming out of Myung Ho's body.It was pleasing Yeong Hoon's ego.'In the end, it's ME who'll be the winner.'Same as always.He'd never had any difficulties or problems, and only enjoyed life.He was born a winner and never felt the bitterness of defeat.'I will never find myself on your shameful level,' Yeong Hoon thought, smiling as he looked at Si Hoon and his party.\u2014 Ahhh! \u2014 As if agreeing with his thoughts, Myung Ho, who had finally completed his transformation, let out a wild roar.His scary eyes, glowing red, looked at Kang Yu.With a flap of the wings on his back, he flew towards Kang Yu with incredible speed.\u2014 Hhha! Your luck has run\u2026There was a clap.Myung Ho was thrown back right when he neared Kang Yu.Yeong Hoon couldn't believe his eyes; he thought it was an illusion.\u2014 \u0410h\u2026?How could one person throw back a healthy monster?\u2014 Ahhh! \u2014 A shivering howl sounded.This man named Kang Yu had come out of nowhere and confidently walked towards Si Hoon, who had been thrown back by Myung Ho, as if he thought he was stronger than anyone.The black energy emitted from Kang Yu's hands hit the demon lying on the ground.With each of his hits, a sound like the clap of thunder followed.It was as if the monster and the man had switched places.'What the\u2026?' Watching Myung Ho, whom he had high hopes of, get beaten like a street mutt, his mouth dropped wide open.'Who is he\u2026?' Yeong Hoon started shaking, and fear took over his body.He finally realized that something was wrong.'Is he someone at the top?'If he wasn't at least on Chae Young-ju or his father's level, he couldn't be beating up Myung Ho, who was already using Magi, like this.Yeong Hoon turned around, his face pale.It doesn't matter if this guy is at the top or not. All that matters is that when Kang Yu is done with Myung Ho, he'll be the next target.Yeong Hoon started running away, not bothering to look back.\u2014 Hah\u2026 hah\u2026 \u2014 It was getting harder to breathe.The way out of the gate seemed too far away.'Need\u2026 father\u2026 must contact father!'Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThat's what Yeong Hoon always did \u2014 he always ran to his father.Even in this situation, Dad could take care of it, and then victory will be handed to him.He pulled out a machine from his pocket resembling a marble, allowing him to call straight from the gate.He focused on turning it on.At that moment, someone hit him, and he fell to the ground.\u2014 Oh, you\u2026 \u2014 Yeong Hoon turned pale as he gripped the machine tightly.The man named Kang Yu was looking down at him with a smile, a crazed thrill in his eyes.\u2014 Not so fast. Where do you think you're going?\u2014 You\u2026 who are you?!\u2014 So boring, why is everyone asking me the same question? \u2014 Kang Yu sat down, looking indifferent as Yeong Hoon fell. \u2014 Give it to me. \u2014\u2014 Wha\u2026 what?\u2014 Weren't you going to contact Kim Jae Hyun? \u2014 Kang Yu said, pointing at the transparent marble in his hands.Yeong Hoon gave him the machine with trembling hands.When Kang Yu took it, he set up the connection.After a few beeps, the voice he had been waiting for could be heard from the other side.\u2014 What is it? \u2014 A rude voice spat out.When Kang Yu heard it, he smiled.\u2014 Are you Kim Jae Hyun?\u2014 Who is this\u2026?\u2014 Hmm\u2026 What if I told you that I'm the person who took your son hostage?There's a pause.But through the silence, he heard Kim Jae Hyun's breathing grow heavy.'I think he's in shock.'If he wasn't, Kang Yu would be very surprised.After all, no father would be able to remain calm if he heard that his precious child was taken hostage.\u2014 Fa\u2026 Father! That\u2026 that thing!Kang Yu hit Yeong Hoon in the stomach with force.He curled into a ball like an onion and made a groaning noise.(Editor's Note: why an onion, author\u2026)\u2014 Sit quietly.Kang Yu used the Power of Shackles to make a metal chain and wrapped it around a guy.Bound in chains, he looked more like an insect doll.\u2014 Untie me, you jerk! \u2014 Yeong Hoon shouted, wiggling from side to side.\u2014 Ha, so naughty. Acting like a teenager. \u2014 Kang Yu, again, hit the man desperately trying to get out.Along with the dull sound of the punch, there was blood flowing from his mouth.\u2014 That's enough.\u2014 'That's enough?' So you really are worried about your son.\u2014 What do you want? \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun asked rudely.It seems their negotiation will end quite quickly.Unlike Yeong Hoon who refused to give Kang Yu the desired information, Kim Jae Hyun was getting straight to business. He smiled, satisfied.\u2014 If you want to find your son, come to the Level C Gate at Maokdong Station right away.\u2014 Surely you'll tell me to come alone?\u2014 Hhha! \u2014 Kang Yu laughed a little when he heard a question like that. \u2014 If I tell you to come alone, will you come alone? I don't think so. \u2014No response. Kang Yu continued:\u2014 I know people like you very well. Don't ask too many questions and just come.This kind of statement was the same as saying he could take the whole army with him.When Kim Jae Hyun heard this answer, he laughed:\u2014 Are you out of your mind?\u2014 Are you worried about me? In that case, you can come alone.\u2014 I'll make you feel sorry for looking down on me\u2026\u2014 Yes, yes. I'm looking forward to it. \u2014 Kang Yu was nonchalant, playfully lifting Yeong Hoon's leg. \u2014 If you don't come within 20 minutes, I'll chop off your son's hand and if another 20 minutes pass, I'll chop off the other one\u2026 and so on. \u2014\u2014 Hh\u2026 \u2014 Even in the man's breath, you could hear undisguised hatred. \u2014 You're a government unit and yet you're torturing a man, not just anyone, but my son. Do you think you'll be able to return to duty after this? \u2014\u2014 What? The government?Apparently, like Myung Ho, he seems to believe that Kang Yu is part of the Hwaran Squad.Kang Yu laughed, continuing with a cold smile:\u2014 But I don't belong to any unit.\u2014 You\u2026 you're alone?\u2014 Yes, I'm not with anyone.\u2014 You're crazy.The man didn't appreciate the joke about not having a life partner and reacted seriously. This situation wasn't funny to him. He could never have imagined someone coming to the gate to kidnap a big guild's son.\u2014 Do you have any idea who I am? \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun asked, his voice full of hatred.He was CEO of the world-famous Mir Electronics company and Commander of one of Korea's five largest guilds.Simply put, he doesn't just have money.Even the government has no right to interfere with the affairs of his guild.Even ignoring his financial background, he was still one of the strongest Players, on par with Baek Kang Hyun and Chae Young-ju.Money, privilege, strength.In each criteria, he was at the top of everything.So, even if Kang Yu were a World Ranker, there's no way he would do such a crazy thing alone, against someone so powerful.\u2014 Hhha! \u2014 Kang Yu was laughing.He clutched Yeong Hoon's leg even harder while yelling.\u2014 Do you know\u00a0me?The father didn't answer anything.\u2014 You don't know, do you?With the sound of breaking bones, Yeong Hoon's leg twisted at an incredible angle.Burnt with agonizing pain, the guy cried.Kang Yu, who was watching this calmly, smiled in cold blood.His smile was more like a devil's smile than a man's.\u2014 If you don't know, we should get to know each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 3)Editor: Cherish\u2014 Aah!!! It\u2026 it hurts! It hurts! \u2014 Yeong Hoon's sobbing scream flew around.\u2014 That's enough! \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun's worried voice could be heard from the machine.Kang Yu loosened his grip a bit.\u2014 Phew\u2026 Phew\u2026 \u2014 Yeong Hoon, who had never experienced such pain before, grabbed his twisted leg, tears spilling from his eyes.Kang Yu gave a sharp warning to the man on the other side of the call:\u2014 20 minutes. If you don't show up in 20 minutes, the other leg will suffer.A voice that knows neither mercy nor any human feelings.On the contrary, he seemed to be enjoying what was happening and it could be heard in his voice, which angered Kim Jae Hyun.He started giving a speech with blatant irritation in his voice:\u2014 I don't know who you are. And I don't know what you want. If you're doing this for a ransom, you're way out of line. I will find you. I will find you\u2026 and I will kill you.When Kang Yu heard such a frightening speech, he smiled.\u2014 Good luck.Squeezing the marble tightly in his fist, he broke it into many pieces.\u2014 Well\u2026 \u2014 He laughed, turning again to the trembling Yeong Hoon.His face looked like it was painted white as he stared up at Kang Yu.Right now, he was so scared that he even forgot that his leg had been turned upside down.\u2014 Spare me\u2026 mercy! Pl\u2026 please! Do\u2026 do you need money? I'll ask my dad for as much as you want!\u2014 Money is fine, but that's not what I want from you. \u2014 Kang Yu squatted in front of the guy.He looked too calm for a man who had just crushed a bone in someone else's leg.This reaction, or rather the absence of one, scared him most.Yeong Hoon started trembling even harder, and he spoke in a quiet, shaky voice:\u2014 Then, what do you want?\u2014 Peace and tranquility on Earth, \u2014 Kang Yu said without hesitation.When Yeong Hoon heard this, he bit his lip, not believing such words.\u2014 Don't\u2026 don't talk nonsense and just say what you want!\u2014 So you don't believe me\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu looked at the guy with pitying eyes.Leaving all the details aside, his words were true.The Devil's Teachers were the ones who were trying to turn the Earth into another Hell. He didn't want that at all.\u2014 Let's get ready, shall we?Kang Yu extended his hand to Yeong Hoon, who was screaming hysterically.\u2014 Um\u2026 please! Don't\u2013don't kill me! Please!!!\u2014 What, are you making a bastard out of me? I'm not going to kill you, jerk.\u2014 Well\u2026 then\u2026\u2014 We have to get ready to meet your dad.Saliva gathered in Yeong Hoon's dried-up throat and he swallowed it, and there was a ray of hope in his eyes.Kim Jae Hyun.He thought that his father, who was perfect in everything, could still get him out of this sad situation.'I don't know what you want from me\u2026'He was pretty sure Dad would handle this crazy guy.\u2014 Thank God.\u2014 Thank God\u2026?\u2014 Yes.Kang Yu smiled widely and grabbed Yeong Hoon's head.He chose one of his 666 Powers and hit the hostage's head with a strong discharge of Magi.\u2014 Ah\u2026His eyes rolled up, his body quivered, and foam came out of his mouth, dirtying his clothes.When Kang Yu looked at the shaking Yeong Hoon, he continued quietly:\u2014 Thank God that Kim Jae Hyun loves you.A father's love for his son.It was clear from the anger heard during the conversation that Yeong Hoon was loved by his father.\u2014 It's pretty easy to use a person who is blinded by feelingsKang Yu laughed.Kang Yu used a Power on Yeong Hoon, finished preparing the plan, and escorted Si Hoon and his party outside.Red Rose and Hwaran, who'd received his signal, were waiting for him at the exit.\u2014 These people\u2026\u2014 Huh? Isn't that Chae Young-ju from Red Rose and Hwaran's 3rd Division Leader Baek Hwa Yeon?Han Sol and Dae Su looked over.\u2014 I'll explain later. For now, take Si Hoon and take cover in a safe place.\u2014 But\u2026\u2014 Kang Yu! Where did you go after the call? \u2014 Young-ju immediately ran up to them.Han Sol, who'd only ever seen that girl on the news, was shocked when she called Kang Yu familiarly and started talking to him.\u2014 Kang Yu, are you friends with the Red Rose Guild Leader?\u2014 Yeah, I'm forced to be.\u2014 I should be the one saying that. \u2014 Young-ju squinted and stared at him.She turned her head towards Han Sol.\u2014 I think you know who I am. Who are you?\u2014 Ha\u2026 Han Sol.\u2014 Um\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju was looking at the girl.She was scanning the girl until her eyes stopped on her chest.Young-ju shrieked and her forehead was covered in blood vessels. After taking a deep breath, she continued:\u2014 What's your relationship with Kang Yu?\u2014 Huh\u2026 what's\u00a0your\u00a0relationship with Kang Yu? And why are you communicating with him in such a friendly manner? \u2014 Han Sol stared straight into her eyes, not looking away.'She didn't look like a daring girl.'But now Han Sol looked like a wild tiger showing its claws.At that moment, Kang Yu interrupted the girls with their psychological fight.\u2014 You'll get to know each other later. It's not that important now. Han Sol, take our teammates and get out of here.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 When we get this sorted out, I'll come home and explain.\u2014 Okay. \u2014 Han Sol nodded with a slightly disappointed expression on her face and left the gate with Dae Su.Young-ju, quietly watching the girl leave, turned her eyes to Kang Yu.\u2014 So, who is the baited fish?\u2014 Him. \u2014 Kang Yu pulled Yeong Hoon closer and threw him to the floor.Young-ju's eyes gleamed.\u2014 As expected, the Mir Guild.\u2014 Did you expect it to be them?\u2014 I was just wondering if it was them. Thinking about which of the large guilds might have gotten involved in such a crazy act, it could only be their guild.It seemed as if personal feelings were involved in her assumption.'They seem to have a bad relationship.'Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksHe remembered what Kang Seon Soo said. The pieces were coming together now.\u2014 Shall we just interrogate him and get all the information we need?\u2014 No. He's just a pawn. He doesn't know the information that's important to us.\u2014 Then\u2026\u2014 I called Kim Jae Hyun. He'll be here in 20 minutes.It didn't mean anything to Kang Yu, but Young-ju frowned.\u2014 Wait a minute! What do you mean, 'I called Kim Jae Hyun?!' \u2014 She looked at the guy lying on the ground, shocked.A single thought made its way into her head.\u2014 Did you\u2026 take him hostage?\u2014 I heard somewhere that he loves his son very much.\u2014 Do you realize that's crazy\u2026\u00a0 \u2014 Young-ju felt discouraged to look at the person she was talking to.She's made concessions to him hundreds of times, and she's even prepared to accept that Kang Yu is holding Yeong Hoon hostage, but to call his father here\u2026\u2014 Kim Jae Hyun won't let it go.\u2014 He said the same thing to me, \u2014 Kang Yu said calmly.\u2014 Ah\u2026 So that's why you said to bring reinforcements.Young-ju took a deep breath.She had no idea that a war with another guild would suddenly break out like this.'Well, sooner or later this day would have come\u2026'After all, if they found out that Mir is connected to the Devil's Teachers, they would not be able to simply ignore this fact.To catch the Devil's Teachers, they would have to screw up their relationship with Mir even more than it already was.'Perhaps this 'sooner or later' will come today.' Young-ju bit her lip.Because Kang Yu had called very suddenly, she didn't have time to gather a lot of people.It was the same with Baek Hwa Yeon.Right now, most of her people were caught up in some kind of government operation.\u2014 It's okay. Our battle won't be hard, \u2014 Kang Yu assured her.Hwa Yeon frowned and asked:\u2014 I'm sorry, but neither Young-ju or I could bring a large army with us. If we're having a war against the Mir Guild, the battle can't be easy. Don't you think your decision was rushed?\u2014 Hwa Yeon, what do you think the outcome will be if you fight against an enemy who has lost his mind?\u2014 Of course, we'll win\u2026\u2014 That's right, \u2014 Kang Yu said confidently, knowing that they will.Hwa Yeon glanced at him, skeptical.\u2014 Are you saying that Kim Jae Hyun will attack recklessly?\u2014 He loves his son too much. \u2014 Kang Yu shrugged his shoulders.Young-ju shook her head with a frown.\u2014 Kim Jae Hyun is different from that brainless bully Yeong Hoon. He won't run after his captured son even if he loses his mind.After all, he's the cold-blooded and calculating man at the head of one of Korea's largest organizations.In response, Kang Yu laughed a little.\u2014 No, he will.\u2014 Are you going to wave his son's broken leg in front of his eyes? \u2014 Young-ju asked, gazing at the guy's upside down leg.Kang Yu grinned and shook his head.\u2014 Do you think that's enough to drive him crazy?\u2014 What are you going to do?Young-ju looked at Kang Yu, feeling cold with unease.The guy didn't answer her question and instead turned his eyes on the road.\u2014 I think he's here.\u2014 Ah\u2026?There were about 20 SUVs on the road.Thanks to special equipment, all the cars passed through the Gate without falling apart.The door of the leading car opened, and an upright-looking middle-aged man came out of it.This man with brushed back hair was seething in anger.\u2014 Now it's clear who arranged it\u2026 \u2014 Getting out of the car, he gave Young-ju and Hwa Yeon a heated glare. \u2014 Idiots. Did you think I'd give up so easily if you took my son hostage? \u2014At that moment, he realized it wasn't just Red Rose and Hwaran involved.His angry eyes were darting side to side.\u2014 Who was the bastard talking to me?\u2014 I'm here, \u2014 Kang Yu said, and waved as if he were welcoming a close friend.Everyone around him felt the man's rage grow even stronger.\u2014 Thank you for not running away.The doors of all the cars swung open and about 200 people came out.Kim Jae Hyun eyed Kang Yu, and continued:\u2014 Where's my son?\u2014 Ah, here he is, \u2014 Kang Yu said, raising Yeong Hoon from the ground slightly and throwing him in the air.\u2014 Chief!\u2014 It's dangerous!Suddenly, there were two people in front of Kim Jae Hyun, blocking his path to shield him.It looked as if they thought a bomb might be attached to his son's body.There was dead silence hanging in the air.They watched intensely, expecting something to happen now, but nothing happened.Moreover, Yeong Hoon's body did not fall, and instead gently landed on the ground, thanks to the black smoke surrounding him.\u2014 Move over\u2026\u2014 Wait a minute, Chief. We don't know what trap they have waiting for us yet\u2026\u2014 I told you to step back.Ordering his subordinates to step aside, he lifted Yeong Hoon's body from the ground.Pulling his son into his chest, he began to shake with fury.\u2014 I don't know why you did this, but\u2026Like an explosion, Maryok surrounded him.Kim Jae Hyun glowered at Kang Yu.\u2014 By doing that, you no longer have any chance of winning. You will die a very tragic death.At that moment, the unconscious Yeong Hyun came to his senses.\u2014 Yeong Hoon! \u2014 Forgetting what was happening, he gave his son a strong hug.He stroked the cheeks of his son, who slowly opened his eyes.But Yeong Hoon's expression was like he saw a stranger. If this was a movie, all the viewers would be crying now.\u2014 Ah\u2026 ah\u2026Kim Yeong Hoon opened his eyes.He lifted his head and looked around, slowly turning his gaze to the person hugging him.His body began to tremble in fear.But that fear wasn't directed at Kang Yu, the one who had just brutally broken his bone.His fear\u2026\u2014 A man\u2026 who are you?\u2026was directed at Kim Jae Hyun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 4)Editor: Cherish\u2014 A man\u2026 who are you?\u2014 What? \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun's eyes widened.He looked at his son questioningly.\u2014 Yeong Hoon, it's me, your father!\u2014 Man, what are you talking about? \u2014 He stared at the man with suspicion.It seemed as if the young man had lost all his memories of his father.\u2014 Yeon\u2026 Yeong Hoon\u2026 \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun's eyes were shaking.His son was treating him as though he were a stranger.That fact shocked the man so much that his entire body began to shake.\u2014 Ah\u2026 ah\u2026 \u2014 He could hardly close his mouth.Everything inside him seemed to have turned upside down.A little more and he'd puke. The words he just heard made his mind go dark.His son was eyeing him like he was completely unfamiliar.\u2014 What did you do? \u2014 The trembling Kim Jae Hyun turned his head to glare at Kang Yu, who was smiling a lot.Seeing that smile, the man couldn't hold back any longer and his emotions took over him.\u2014 I'm asking you, what did you do?! \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun shouted so loudly that his scream could take away his hearing.His image of a business gentleman collapsed in an instant.It couldn't have ended up any other way. In a situation like this, it's simply impossible to keep a sober mind.His son, his beloved son had forgotten about his father.It caused more shock and fear than the twisted leg.Who knows if he would feel the same way if his son died in front of his eyes.Kim Jae Hyun didn't know.He thought that if his son had died, at least he wouldn't have grabbed onto his hands while saying such heartbreaking things.\u2014 First of all\u2026 let go of me, man! Where am I, anyway? \u2014 Yeong Hoon started to push the man away.Every time his son addressed Kim Jae Hyun as 'man,' like a stranger, his mind would clog up more and more.\u2014 You\u2026 you\u2026 \u2014 He looked at Kang Yu with hatred, trembling.Gently letting Yeong Hoon out of his arms, he got back on his feet.He could feel the world around him collapsing. No, it felt like it had already collapsed.There was unimaginable anger boiling in him.\u2014 Chi\u2026 chief!\u2014 Get it together!The man threw aside his guild members on either side of him.Right now, nothing could reach his ears.Kim Jae Hyun turned his eyes to his opponent's lips.The corners of the guy's lips, raised in a happy smile, were imprinted in his mind. He could almost hear Kang Yu mockingly laugh at him.He finally stopped perceiving the reality around him.\u2014 You bastard!There was an explosion caused by Maryok.The land around Kim Jae Hyun was cracked as if it had dried up.One of Korea's ten greatest players.The man with Rank 8, and about to reach Rank 9.He has four Class S special abilities that he could use against Kang Yu.The earth around him shook. Because of the Maryok explosion, the asphalt on the ground started to shrink.Golden Maryok was burning in both of his hands.The Maryok in his palms was unusual; it looked like one of the celestial constellations.His body was surrounded by a cloud of ordinary Maryok.He threw himself at Kang Yu.\u2014 Wait! \u2014 Suddenly, Chae Young-ju appeared in front of the man, blocking his path.In her hands, she was holding a metal chain with red spikes, which she threw at Kim Jae Hyun.As soon as he clenched his fists, the energy around him rattled the chains.Like a powerful explosion, the wave of energy from his fists spilled around him.With that kind of superpower, he could no longer be called human.His fist, upon hitting the chains, caused an explosion that sounded like a gunshot.\u2014 Out of the way! \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun, who had already lost his mind, shouted out.Young-ju, like a wild animal who wasn't going to let go of its prey, threw her chains at the man again.Just like him, she was among the top 10 strongest Players in Korea.The red metal chains wrapped around his body like a snake.The sharp spikes instantly left lacerations on his skin.Kim Jae Hyun immediately ripped off the chains that were holding him back and threw them aside.Dark blood flowed from his wounds, but he didn't care.Completely ignoring Young-ju, he kept moving to his prey.But after the Red Rose Commander, Baek Hwa Yeon came to block his way.Her snow-white sword was pointed at Kim Jae Hyun's throat.He pulled the sword out of her hands and expanded his cluster of Maryok.Because of the man's enormous strength, the girl was thrown back.\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Hwa Yeon coughed.She was weaker than both Chae Young-ju and Kim Jae Hyun.Hwa Yeon couldn't beat him.\u2014 Hwa Yeon! Get back!\u2014 Got it! \u2014 She nodded and rolled out of the way.Young-ju took her place with her hands wide open.The bracelet hanging from her wrist caught fire in red.A scarlet chain began to appear from the bracelet.They were her 'Bloodthirsty Chains'..Her signature weapon.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAfter creating enough red chains, she made a net out of them and launched it at the crazed man.Unable to ignore this attack, he raised his right fist.If he doesn't step back now, he's bound to get caught. But even knowing that, he didn't stop. He kept going forward as if he couldn't see any of the sharp thorns that were getting closer and closer to him.Eventually his whole body was wrapped in the net.\u2014 Aah! \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun yelped in pain.There were many thorns on each chain, piercing his body.But he could care less about his wounds. With both hands, he snatched the chain off the body with zeal.Meanwhile, the cluster of Maryok was getting bigger and bigger around him.The metal chain that wrapped tightly around him broke like a thin thread.\u2014 I told you to get out of the way! \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun shrieked hysterically.He got rid of the chains and threw them aside. His body was covered with bleeding lacerations.No one would be surprised if he died right on the spot from the numerous wounds he sustained.But at Level 80 with Rank 9, such wounds couldn't kill the man.\u2014 What a psycho\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju was in shock from his wild behavior.'It's no use attacking from the front.'A feature of the legendary weapon, the bloodthirsty chains, was suction of energy.In other words, the moment the spikes pierce the victim's skin, they begin to draw power from them.But the problem was that Kim Jae Hyun wasn't getting any weaker despite that.'Even if he dies, he will continue running amok.' Young-ju frowned.\u2014 Ahhh! \u2014 He wouldn't stop until he finishes what he had started.Baek Hwa Yeon, who had drawn back from the battle, pushed off from the ground to attack him.\u2014 Young-ju! Help me!\u2014 I've got it!Young-ju pointed her hand towards the girl. The red chains lined up in front of Hwa Yeon, creating a strong defensive wall.Kim Jae Hyun crashed into it, the impact leaving cracks on the ground for dozens of meters.Shaken up, he raised his right fist to use one of his abilities.Maryok openly flew from his fist.It flew at Hwa Yeon as well, but she successfully escaped by dodging behind the shield of chains made by Young-ju.The Maryok that collided with the shield opened a hole in it. At that moment, Hwa Yeon drew her sword and swung it from the sky to the ground in his direction, cutting through the charge of Maryok.The man who was already seriously injured grew weaker. Hwa Yeon's eyes gleamed.'Heavy Wind.'She used one of her abilities.A vortex rose around the blade of her sword, spinning at an incredible speed. Even Kim Jae Hyun, who was blinded by his rage, hurriedly stepped back, recognizing danger.However, the blade ruthlessly slashed through his body.Though the sword just barely touched him, he couldn't escape the vortex of wind.From his waist to his collarbone.A fountain of blood poured from the long cut.His body convulsed from the almost fatal wound.Hwa Yeon paused seeing this.Kim Jae Hyun's death would be a problem for them. If he dies, they can't get closer to the Devil's Teachers.Taking advantage of her moment of doubt, he used a Power.\u2014 The Abyss! \u2014 The man slammed both his fists into the ground.With a sound like roaring thunder, a powerful energy like a volcanic eruption poured out.The explosion of Magi hit Hwa Yeon.\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Thrown back by the powerful force, she fell and skidded through the ground.The girl threw up dark blood.Staggering, Hwa Yeon rose from the ground. If she continued to stand around, she'd probably suffer a lot more.However, her fears were for nothing.Kim Jae Hyun wasn't targeting her at all.\u2014 Ahh! \u2014 A scream like a monster's scream.The man covered in blood from head to toe rushed at Kang Yu.The distance between them was reduced to twenty meters.But taking into the account that he was no ordinary Player, it's more like he was a step away from Kang Yu.\u2014 Sighting chains!Young-ju wasn't going to put up with the fact that the man who ignored her could only see Kang Yu.She threw five more chains to follow.15 meters. The chain hit his right leg.10 meters. The chain caught on his left arm, from his wrist to his shoulder.5 meters. The chain clung on his right shoulder.And\u2026\u2014 Hha\u2026 \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun looked down at his stomach, where the metal chain was digging into his skin.He was breathing heavily.Blood spilled onto his chin the moment he opened his mouth.His gaze was directed at the person in front of him.He smiled as if the young man were laughing at him.\u2014 Ah\u2026 ah\u2026 ah\u2026 \u2014 Gathering the last of his strength, he swung his right hand.But there was nothing left in his fists. No Maryok; no special ability.His fist met Kang Yu's chest powerlessly.Kim Jae Hyun's strength was exhausted, and he fell to the ground.Kang Yu bent down a bit and looked at him.Their eyes clashed in the air.The man who was about to pass out could hardly keep looking at him.Kang Yu slowly reached out, grabbed his face and pulled it towards his own.Their faces were so close that it looked like their noses were about to touch.\u2014 Do you know who I am now?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 5)Editor: Cherish\u2014 Kim Jae Hyun has received all the help he needs. So far, he has been hospitalized and all the members of the medical staff, as well as the healers, are involved in his treatment. Fortunately, there are no life-threatening wounds, and he's quickly recovering.\u2014 Okay. When is he due to be fully recovered?\u2014 They say that he will be able to move on his own in a few hours, \u2014\u00a0 said a member of the Hwaran Squad, sounding a little doubtful himself.The man's entire body had been covered with stab wounds from metal spikes, along with a long wound from shoulder to waist. It's hard to believe anyone could recover from that in only a couple of hours.Of course, doctors and healers are capable people, but if he truly heals that quickly, it would be a real miracle.\u2014 Once his vitals are back, escort him to the research room.\u2014 Roger that!Unlike the hesitant employee, Hwa Yeon took the news in cold blood.After all, she knew very well how different the body of a 9th rank Player was from that of a normal person.In a situation where the internal organs were not affected, treatment couldn't possibly take long.'Besides, there's no need to cure him completely.'Rather the opposite; if he was fully recovered, it would put them in a difficult situation.It would be enough if he was in a condition to talk to them.\u2014 Well, I'll take care of him, \u2014 said Hwa Yeon, looking at Young-ju and Kang Yu.Then, her gaze shifted to the soldiers who had lost their Commander as well as some ordinary members of the Mir Guild.After Kim Jae Hyun fell, his men didn't even try to resist them and just gave up.In fact, it was the logical decision. After all, the person leading them was one of the top Players in the country, so it's not strange that his defeat scared them into surrendering.Besides, by quickly yielding, they could have a chance to recover.As soon as Hwa Yeon left, Young-ju turned to Kang Yu:\u2014 What did you do\u2026? \u2014 She wasn't going to stop accusing the guy with her eyes.Kang Yu shrugged his shoulders and answered calmly:\u2014 I just adjusted Kim Yeong Hoon's memories a little.\u2014 Do you have an ability to fake memories\u2026?\u2014 There's a lot I'm capable of.Young-ju bit her lip.It was now that she realized that his powers were beyond her expectations.In this battle with the Mir Guild, they had been able to achieve great results without a single victim from their side.If the man hadn't succumbed to Kang Yu's provocation, a lot of people would have suffered.'However\u2026'In Young-ju's mind, the crazy image of Kim Jae Hyun resurfaced.She could understand the reason for his wild behavior.His own son can't even remember his father's name.It would have been strange if he had reacted in any other way.The girl couldn't imagine how Kang Yu had made him lose his memories.But Young-ju thought that if she did know, she'd become nauseous.She actually felt sorry for the man, despite the bad relationship she had with him.'Even though he doesn't deserve sympathy.'Remembering how much they'd suffered because of Kim Jae Hyun, she thought that this situation could be considered as compensation for everything he did.No, it's not even enough.Given Kim Yeong Hoon's bad reputation, there weren't enough fingers to count all the people who have suffered because of him.And there's nothing to say about Kim Jae Hyun.The more powerful he became, the more corpses he left behind.'Isn't this karma\u2026?' The girl frowned.She believed it was a fact that a person can't get better. Even if he does one good thing for every thousand bad things.Because the evil done only gets worse and worse every time.\u2014 Who are you\u2026? \u2014 She looked at her ally with a childish distrust.She couldn't even figure out who Oh Kang Yu was. Now she wasn't even sure if it was the same person she had collected information about.The person she was looking at responded coolly:\u2014 I'm exactly who you think I am.\u2014 Don't talk nonsense. What you did wasn't just the key to success\u2026\u2014 Chae Young-ju. \u2014 Kang Yu interrupted the girl's words.Their eyes met.Young-ju's heart pounded. A strange feeling enveloped her whole body. She thought she was about to drown in his deep, abyss-like eyes.\u2014 I help you. You help me a lot, too. Isn't that enough?The girl didn't say anything.\u2014 You don't need to know any more than that. Don't bother trying to understand me. Even if you shut your eyes, Mir won't go anywhere. It doesn't matter who I am at all, but what you're planning against them does matter. You want revenge, don't you?\u2014 Yes, I do\u2026\u2014 I'll make sure your revenge succeeds. I'll make the Devil's Teachers disappear from the face of the earth. So\u2026 \u2014 he whispered the rest of the sentence in her ear. \u2014 You can close your eyes. \u2014For some reason, those words sounded very sweet to her.It sounded so magical that, for a moment, she lost her ability to think straight. After all, if it happened just as Kang Yu said, her dreams would be fulfilled.Young-ju remembered a line she had seen somewhere: 'The devil does not make rude words and actions, the devil makes sweet speeches.'(Editor's Note: I've never heard the saying, so I'm not sure. If anyone knows, drop it in the comments! Pretty sure it means that the devil doesn't simply act rude and evil\u2013 which you'd obviously be wary of, the devil wins you over with sweet promises and words you want to hear. Here, she's cautious of him and so compares him to the devil.)She'd never thought about it, but now that line was perfect for the situation.'I didn't raise a little tiger at all.' Young-ju bit her lip.Now she imagined him in a very different way. Two horns like a mountain goat and two wings like a bat. The look of a smiling devil.The girl had doubts about whether supporting Kang Yu would turn against her. Wasn't that a mistake on her part?It hasn't even been two months ago, and he's caught up with Young-ju in development and ability.She had no idea how strong he would become in the future.'It's too late.'No matter how sorry she was, it was too late.You can't collect spilled water.'In that case\u2026' Young-ju's gaze trembled.She remembered the beautiful girl with dark, waist-like hair at night.Jong Hae-young.The name of the girl who trusted Young-ju like a sister.She clenched her fist with force. An intolerable anger began to rise in her chest.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYoung-ju gazed at Kang Yu.She thought about his sweet promise to take revenge.It doesn't matter if he's a tiger or a devil. For this goal, she was willing to shake the devil's hand.Young-ju closed her eyes. After taking a deep breath, she said:\u2014 Anyway, thank you for today. Thanks to you, we were able to avoid casualties during the capture of Kim Jae Hyun.\u2014 You're welcome,\u2014 Kang Yu replied, and after looking around carefully, he continued: \u2014 In a couple of hours, are they going to bring him straight to the research room? \u2014\u2014 Yes, of course. We need to find out all the information he has as soon as possible, \u2014 said Young-ju, grinding her teeth.She hated the so-called Devil's Teachers with all her heart.\u2014 Kang Yu, are you coming too?\u2014 Yes, I should.If he doesn't hear all the information from Kim Jae Hyun in person, then all the effort in catching him would have been pointless.Young-ju nodded and went to the car, and Kang Yu followed right after her.A few hours later, Kang Yu, Young-ju and Hwa Yeon were waiting for Kim Jae Hyun in a research facility.Soon, the door opened and a man in a straitjacket slowly entered the room.Wearing that, he looked like a mentally ill man undergoing treatment at the clinic.Kim Jae Hyun sat down and immediately directed an angry look towards Kang Yu.His hair, once neatly brushed back, was now sticking out in all directions.The dark circles under his eyes and pronounced cheekbones made his bad condition obvious.\u2014 We have a few questions. \u2014 Baek Hwa Yeon started first.In a cold voice, she continued:\u2014 When did you start working with the Devil's Teachers?The man didn't say anything.\u2014 What do you know about the calling?Again, there was no answer.\u2014 What do you know about the man wearing a red devil mask?There was silence hanging in the room.Only Baek Hwa Yeon was talking.Frustrated with not getting a single answer, she hit the man across the cheek with her hand.Kim Jae Hyun, who was sitting in the chair, fell to the floor.The girl didn't even want to look at him.\u2014 Answer the question. You're no longer the CEO of Mir Electronics or the guild commander. You're the culprit behind the next pseudo-religion.But this time too, there was no answer.\u2014 Start talking! \u2014 She grabbed the man by his shredded hair.The corners of his lips twitched, and he smiled.\u2014 Do you think I'll reveal anything?This time, the girl remained silent.\u2014 No matter how powerful the Hwaran Squad thinks they are, you're nothing more than a government mutt. You just follow their orders. Baek Hwa Yeon, have you forgotten who I am? Do you think there are only one or two people behind me? \u2014 He said, smiling in cold blood, and continued: \u2014 You still have no idea? You are dogs, and I am the master pulling the leash. So how can a dog bite its master's hand? \u2014\u2014 What a psycho\u2026Young-ju, who was listening to them talk, got up from her seat.She grabbed Kim Jae Hyun by the throat and lifted him up.From the thin bracelet hanging on her hand, red energy started to flow. The red chains appeared in an instant and enveloped the man.Sharp spikes pierced the straitjacket, and blood soaked his clothes.Kim Jae Hyun made an agonizing groan.\u2014 Speak up!\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 Come on, talk!\u2014 Ah\u2026 ah\u2026\u2014 Talk, you bastard!!! \u2014 Young-ju's scream spread all over the room.The man who could barely withstand the pain that permeated him was laughing.\u2014 Eventually\u2026 you'll lose to him. You can't imagine\u2026 their size or what they're up to.\u2014 Argh\u2026!\u2014 Young-ju, that's enough. If he dies, there will be problems. \u2014 Hwa Yeon pulled her away from Kim Jae Hyun.Young-ju took a deep breath and retrieved the chains.The girls looked at Kim Jae Hyun, not sure how to continue.Neither of them knew how to make the man tell them everything.\u2014 Let's go out and talk. \u2014 Kang Yu, who was only watching before, suddenly spoke up.\u2014 You\u2026The man's face turned into a scowl.\u2014 Tell me everything you know about the Devil's Teachers.\u2014 Ha! Are you deaf? Do you really think I'll tell you anything?\u2014 I think so. \u2014 Kang Yu smiled a little.Looking at Kim Jae Hyun, he continued:\u2014 I'll return everything.\u2014 What\u2026?\u2014 If you tell me everything you know, I'll return your son's memory.The man's eyes bulged open and his body trembled.The image of his son treating him like a stranger flashed in his head.An offer he could not refuse.Or rather, an offer that can't be turned down. Kim Jae Hyun clenched his fists firmly.\u2014 So\u2026 \u2014 He was growing angry.Not only did this man erase his son's memories, but now he has the nerve to sell them.\u2014 You! \u2014 He was shaking.Hwa Yeon and Young-ju grabbed the man trying to attack Kang Yu.His angry shout flew all over the office.\u2014 You! You're going to Hell! \u2014 His voice was raw with emotion as he screamed.Kang Yu grinned.\u2014 I've already been there, you jerk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1/3)Editor: Cherish\u2014 We met with him\u2026 about eight months ago. \u2014 Kim Jae Hyun started telling his story.Kang Yu leaned back on his chair and thought about what he said.\u2014 Are you talking about that man in the red devil's mask?\u2014 I'm talking about the man in the red devil mask.\u2014 You don't know who he is?The man nodded hard. So far, his words didn't seem to be lies.'Even he doesn't know who's hiding behind the mask.'Learning the identity of the masked man was one of the key points in getting information about the Devil's Teachers.\u2014 Go on.\u2014 When I met him eight months ago, I got an offer. If I provide victims for the rite, he'll turn me into a demon.\u2014 You're telling me you agreed\u2026? \u2014 Young-ju looked at the man like he was crazy, hardly believing her ears.Providing someone with sacrifices\u2026What he did and what they were still going to do could destroy the hard-won balance in the new world.But how could they convince him otherwise, if he, wishing to become a demon, did not regret what he did?\u2014 Huh. You're just saying that because you don't know anything about demons, \u2014 he murmured.\u2014 What are you talking about?\u2014 Demons are immortal. They're already dead. Because their hearts don't beat, they won't grow old.Immortality.Eternal youth.For those born to die, there's no offer more tempting.No matter how you try, you'll end up dying anyway.Death is the only inevitable thing that persecutes a man from birth.For Kim Jae Hyun, who has power, money, and an army, the desire to avoid death was quite reasonable.\u2014 Huh\u2026 Immortality, you say? \u2014 Young-ju sounded doubtful.\u2014 Yes.\u2014 How would you know?\u2014 They've already lived with mankind for a thousand years.\u2014 What\u2026?It wasn't just Young-ju who was surprised to hear that.Kang Yu, who had been sitting quietly until now, opened his mouth to speak too. After all, he already knew everything else the man had said.\u2014 You're saying the Devil's Teachers appeared a thousand years ago?It's been five years since the day Players first appeared.That's why Kang Yu thought that the Devil's Teachers must have appeared after that.Kim Jae Hyun shook his head in response to Kang Yu's question.\u2014 They didn't appear a thousand years ago, but much earlier. They were scattered all over the world, and in hiding, they grew bigger. Of course, they didn't begin to be active that long ago, they only started to act about a few years ago.\u2014 Hmm. \u2014 Kang Yu frowned as if he had a headache.If they had been secretly developing for such a long time, it would be harder than expected to eradicate them.\u2014 Is that why you kidnapped Players for the Devil's Teachers? To get immortality?\u2014 Yes.\u2014 What a crazy man. \u2014 Young-ju glared at the man with hatred. \u2014 Were you really hoping to gain immortality? Do you think that if you lived for hundreds, thousands of years, you would stay in good health? \u2014People who only know immortality from books, comics, or movies dream about it and think they can handle it.But one day, the moment will come, where everything collapses.Everyone dreams of immortality, but, after receiving it and living hundreds, thousands of years, they will start to go crazy. That was what Young-ju meant.Kim Jae Hyun laughed as if the girl had just told him a joke.\u2014 You only say that because you don't know anything about demons. A demon's body keeps its mind, only becoming more sensitive to desires.\u2014 What does that mean?\u2014 It means that life will never get boring. A human body, a young spirit, and eternal life. Isn't it great?\u2014 Don't be silly. It's impossible\u2026\u2014 It's possible. Do you think I'd play with fire if I wasn't sure?Chae Young-ju pressed her lips together tightly.She knew that Kim Jae Hyun wasn't a stupid person at all.'If I believe his words\u2026'She immediately thought that the Devil's Teachers must be getting stronger and stronger every day.It's easy to seduce a man.\u2014 That's crazy, \u2014 the young guy muttered in a calm voice.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026Young-ju caught a note of anger in his tone, and she looked at him questioningly.\u2014 Do you think it's great to have a desire that never fades away? \u2014 His eyes were glowing with anger.A longing that knows no boundaries.It could be equated to the desire of three people together.Even that was hardly enough to compare.An unquenchable desire is followed by thirst. A person who had not experienced this thirst before could never understand how terrible it was.It's like constantly looking for a sip of water in an arid desert.Or having no access to oxygen as if you were high in the sky.It's painful to survive.It's a real torment that cannot be described in words.Kang Yu, in order not to drown in overwhelming desire, has learned to restrain himself.However, even he could not always do that.Even though he has lived ten thousand years.Even though he became the Lord of Hell, before whom even the strongest of the strongest bowed down to.'You're the one who knows nothing about demons.' Kang Yu could barely resist saying those words out loud.If he starts speaking like he understood demons now, it would only complicate the situation.\u2014 Well, we've heard enough about your motives. So move on to the next topic. \u2014 Kang Yu confidently changed the topic.Kang Yu thought that if he kept listening to Kim Jae Hyun's story, it would turn him inside out.The man looked at him, anger bubbling in his chest. Biting his lip, he forced himself to continue:\u2014 Following our agreement, we were to kidnap the victims and, through the ritual, hand Magi over to some members of the Guild.\u2014 Magi? Does it look like Maryok? \u2014 Young-ju asked.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 It's demonic power. It looks like Maryok, but it's still different.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 So you have this Magi, too?\u2014 No. I haven't accepted it yet.\u2014 Why not? Isn't this the reason why you made a deal with the Devil's Teachers?\u2014 Yes. But if you hurry to consume Magi, you'd only become a monster who can't curb thirst, rather than a demon.\u2014 Do humans start to change after taking a single portion?\u2014 Yes. He said that if I wanted to become a demon without losing my mind, it would require more preparation.\u2014 Then why did you give Magi to your guild members? Did he order them to be monsters?\u2014 But it made them stronger. Because the members of the guild are the same as soldiers. If they can fight, it doesn't matter whether they're monsters or people.\u2014 Crazy. \u2014 Young-ju's face twisted into a disgusted look.She started to get nauseous from how disappointed she was in him.Compared to this, Kang Yu's cruel actions didn't seem so bad to her.\u2014 What's a 'calling?' Who are you going to call?\u2014 The Devil\u2026\u2014 The Devil? \u2014 Kang Yu squinted.Kim Jae Hyun nodded his head and continued:\u2014 I don't know for sure either. But I'm sure they're going to call the Devil.\u2014 The Devil's Teachers' main goal is to call the Devil to Earth?\u2014 I don't know. But they are doing their best to make it happen.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu nodded.'I haven't absorbed all the demons.'Kang Yu has dealt with more than hundreds of thousands of demons.However, there were still those who haven't been devoured by him.After all, Hell is crazy big.Even Kang Yu, having spent ten thousand years there, did not visit all corners nor meet all the demons.He only ate the demons who threatened his life, or when it was necessary for him to survive.'How strong is the demon they're going to summon?'If they call someone above the Seventh Thousandth Circle of Hell, it would be difficult for Kang Yu, in his current state, to oppose him.\u2014 So far, they haven't summoned anyone else?If the man's words were true, they've been around for over a thousand years.During that time, they might have tried to summon other demons as well.\u2014 I don't know. But they said that this would be the first attempt for Korea.\u2014 First, you say?\u2014 They say the barrier that separates us from other worlds has been weakening lately. About a month ago, I heard it was much easier for them to summon demons now.Kang Yu was frowning.As soon as he heard about the weakening barrier between the worlds, Kang Yu immediately remembered the system error.The timing that the barrier started weakening coincides with Kang Yu's return from Hell.'So\u2026'It is because of the system error that the Devil's Teachers have become active.'It's because of me.' Kang Yu's face twisted.The problem they were trying so hard to solve was because of him.'Maybe it will recover by itself.'Hanging on to this small hope, Kang Yu continued:\u2014 Is this barrier still in a weak condition?\u2014 Yes, and they say it's still weakening.\u2014 Oh, fuck.Not only is it not recovering, but it's continuing to weaken.'Hellcats and demons won't come to Earth to take advantage of this, will they?'Maybe it won't just be from Hell.There's a chance that other humans, like Ronald of RNO could also come to Earth.'Worse yet, there may be other worlds besides Hell and RNO.'The situation was worse than he thought.The problem was that Kang Yu had no idea how to get out of this situation.'What a mess I've made\u2026'This problem could be compared to, for example, a meteorite falling on Earth when it's lost its atmosphere.Kang Yu had no idea what would happen if the barrier fell completely.\u2014 Phew\u2026 \u2014 The guy took a deep breath.It felt like his head was getting heavier and heavier by the second.'Let's handle things in order.'There was no way to solve the problem if he only continued to agonize about the situation.What's important right now is to first understand what the Devil's Teachers are and stop what they are attempting.\u2014 Do you know where the unknown man in the red mask is? I mean the location of his main office.\u2014 I know it, but\u2026 he's probably not there anymore.\u2014 He's not there anymore?Kim Jae Hyun nodded his head affirmatively.\u2014 He's probably getting ready for the calling ceremony.\u2014 Were there enough victims\u2026?\u2014 I'm not sure. I don't know about that.\u2014 Wait a minute, something doesn't add up. You were the one who collected the sacrifices.If there were enough victims, they wouldn't have risked Si Hoon's life to gather more sacrifices.And yet, the person supplying the victims doesn't know how much more is needed? Strange.Kim Jae Hyun began to laugh.\u2014 We're not the only ones who have succeeded.\u2014 Shit\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu frowned.It's not hard to guess what he meant.Young-ju tilted her head to the side and asked:\u2014 What does that mean?To answer her question, Kang Yu answered as simply as possible:\u2014 It wasn't just the Mir Guild that made a deal with the Devil Teachers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2/3)Editor: Cherish\u2014 We're not the only ones who have succeeded.Kang Yu had no difficulty guessing that it wasn't just the Mir Guild that made the deal with the Devil's Teachers.\u2014 Where will the rite of calling be held? \u2014 Kang Yu asked in a low tone.Kim Jae Hyun answered slowly:\u2014 Pohang.\u2014 The place where the S-level gate is located, huh.When Kang Yu heard that this would be their first summoning attempt, he immediately thought of the Level S Gate.If by calling, they mean bringing creatures from other worlds to Earth, then through a high-level gate they will be able to summon a more powerful creature.From his experience calling Echidna, he knew that for sure.\u2014 How do you know\u2026? \u2014 The man looked at Kang Yu with a puzzled look.All he did was name the city, but Kang Yu figured out the precise location immediately.\u2014 It doesn't matter. Young-ju, Hwa Yeon, we should go straight to Pohang.\u2014 Right now?\u2014 Yes. The Teachers probably already know that we're tailing them. They've put so much effort into it; they must be in a hurry to start the ritual as soon as possible.They didn't know if other guilds have managed to kidnap sacrificial victims in the meantime.But Kang Yu was sure that, according to Kim Jae Hyun's words, there was no delay to the Teachers' plans.\u2014 Wait, isn't the Level S Gate in Pohang where the second division of Hwaran is located?\u2014 Let me ask about it. \u2014 Hwa Yeon made a phone call.The line quickly connected. With each answer from the person on the other side of the wire, the girl's face grew more and more serious.She got off the phone and reiterated what she heard:\u2014 A few hours ago, a large party of about twenty people entered the gate.\u2014 As expected, they hurried up. \u2014 Hearing this, Kang Yu's face became grim.Young-ju turned to Hwa Yeon and asked:\u2014 Any information about the people who came in? Can we look at the passes and figure out who's part of the Devil's Teachers?\u2014 It wouldn't help, \u2014 Kang Yu said, shaking his head.\u2014 Why not?\u2014 It's likely that they used fake passes.After all, Young-ju herself easily made a pass for Kang Yu, who shouldn't be able to enter the Level S Gate yet.If they were able to get the support of two large guilds, it wouldn't be strange that they could also obtain forged passes.The girl realized her mistake and let out a sigh.Obtaining an S-level pass wasn't that difficult.Rather than difficult, it was rare, because every Player knows that entering a high-level Gate is dangerous.No sensible Player would want to step into a Gate where they were likely to become food for the first monster they encounter.\u2014 I explained the situation to the second division. They will send people to the gate, but\u2026 not only is the S-level gate vast, the paths are also pretty confusing. I'm not sure they'll make it in time.\u2014 We should move out now, too.\u2014 I'll get some people together, \u2014 Young-ju said, then turned her head to Hwa Yeon. \u2014 Hwaran has their own helicopter, right? Let's use it. It'll take too long to get to Pohang by car. \u2014\u2014 Okay.\u2014 I'll contact the main office\u2026\u2014 There is a better way, \u2014 Kang Yu said, interrupting the girl.\u2014 A better way\u2026?The girls looked at him. He nodded affirmatively.\u2014 It'll be faster on the dragon.\u2014 Kang Yu! \u2014 As soon as the door opened, a dark-haired girl ran up to a guy.Echidna's red eyes revealed that she had been crying.\u2014 I'm sorry. \u2014 Kang Yu stroked her head a little.Even though he'd explained to her that it was necessary to be apart, he hadn't given her any attention for a week already. He was aware that it was inexcusable.Kang Yu had pulled the girl out of her lonely world and became an indispensable person for her.He couldn't even imagine how hopeless she'd felt over the past week.\u2014 Where have you been\u2026? \u2014 asked Echidna in a trembling voice, hugging him tightly.\u2014 I had things to do.\u2014 I didn't do anything wrong, right\u2026? You wouldn't leave me, would you? \u2014 She looked up at Kang Yu with worried eyes.'She said that one day her father just disappeared.'Thinking that he should pay more attention to the girl, Kang Yu assured her quietly:\u2014 There's no way I'm leaving you.Echidna smiled a little and said softly:\u2014 I believe you\u2026\u2014 That child\u2026 \u2014 Hwa Yeon murmured, peeking at the girl in Kang Yu's arms.\u2014 We saw her last time, right? \u2014 Young-ju joined her in staring.The two girls looked at each other and nodded twice in agreement.They glanced at Echidna again, both thinking the same thing: 'Is she really a dragon?'\u2014 On the outside, she looks like an ordinary child, \u2014 Kang Yu explained, noticing their suspicious stares.The little girl grabbed Kang Yu's shirt and said:\u2014 Yes, I'm a dragon.As proof of what she said, she revealed the wings on her back, flapping them once.The wings attached to her back proved that she was definitely not human.\u2014 A girl with dragon wings\u2026 \u2014 Hwa Yeon gawked at the tiny girl.\u2014 What a dangerous combination. \u2014 Young-ju commented in a serious tone.(Editor's Note: I actually have no idea who spoke in the dialogue above for the past seven lines, and made my best guess based on character behavior and context.)Young-ju and Hwa Yeon seemed to forget how to breathe as they watched the girl with sparkling eyes full of affection. Although they weren't close and hardly knew each other, they had a desire to squeeze the child into a tight embrace.Kang Yu released her from his embrace and put his hands on her shoulders. He looked her in the eyes seriously and said:\u2014 Echidna, I have a request.\u2014 I'll do my best! \u2014 The girl did not hesitate to nod her head immediately.In her gaze aimed at Kang Yu, there was unmistakable loyalty and faith.\u2014 Are all summoned beings so devoted to their masters\u2026? \u2014 Young-ju asked with interest.Kang Yu smiled bitterly and answered:\u2014 No, this is a special case.Not much time has passed since Kang Yu and Echidna's first encounter.Although it was true that Kang Yu was the one to call her, the reason for her sincere devotion was quite different.'She doesn't want to go back to living alone.'He continued to stroke her head gently, feeling sympathetic.\u2014 There's somewhere we have to go. Please turn into a dragon and give us a ride.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Okay! \u2014 Echidna's eyes sparkled and she nodded eagerly. \u2014 I can do that immediately! \u2014\u2014 Slow down. If you transform now, you'll destroy the whole building. Let's go out first.They all went outside together.Young-ju asked:\u2014 Wouldn't it be a big deal if a dragon suddenly appears in the sky?\u2014 I have a way to get past that, \u2014 said the guy without hesitation.The red-haired girl glanced at Echidna with doubt.Ignoring the conversation, Echidna turned to Kang Yu:\u2014 Can I transform now?\u2014 Yes, you can.As soon as Kang Yu agreed, a blue light started to emit from her body.When the light faded, a dragon was standing in front of them, about 20 meters in size.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju gasped.Beside her, Hwa Yeon had her eyes wide open.\u2014 I can't believe it\u2026Both girls were surprised to see Echidna turn into a dragon.Of course, it's not like Kang Yu was the first player to tame a monster, but no one had ever tamed a dragon before.Again, Echidna ignored the girls, focusing only on her master. She asked:\u2014 Kang Yu, where are we going?\u2014 Um\u2026 that way.Kang Yu pointed in the approximate direction and got on Echidna's back. The girls swiftly followed his example.\u2014 I don't want to take anyone but you\u2026. \u2014 Echidna said in a voice filled with discomfort as she felt the girls climb up on her back.Kang Yu grinned and stroked her neck.\u2014 It's an emergency, so be patient.\u2014 Will I get a reward for this?\u2014 What do you want?In response to Kang Yu's question, she breathed nervously through her nose, embarrassed to tell him.Black flames puffed out of her nose and burned the flower bed in front of the building.Gathering her courage, she said it with a slightly shaking voice:\u2014 I want to go out with you.\u2014 Um\u2026She made her request with such a tragic voice, it was as if she was asking for something incredible. But her wish turned out to be such a trivial thing.\u2014 Okay, we'll go out as soon as we've finished what we started.\u2014 Really?\u2014 Yeah, we will.\u2014 Wah!Echidna, unable to hide her joy, exhaled again through her nose.The fire coming out of her nose was feverishly hot.\u2014 I will do my best!Flapping her two large wings, Echidna rose to the sky.Kang Yu used the Power of Projection on the dragon's body. She became semi-transparent and began to blend in with the surrounding background.It would be impossible to see her unless you were purposefully looking for her in the sky.\u2014 Wow, you have this kind ability, too?The people sitting on the dragon had become semi-transparent, too.Young-ju looked at her own body, feeling like she'd turned into a ghost.\u2014 Why do you have so many abilities? \u2014 The girl looked at Kang Yu, perplexed.Because before that, he had also revealed he had the ability to replace memories.It was as if for every 10 levels, he was given a dozen special abilities.\u2014 I'm a talented person.\u2014 Don't be ridiculous. \u2014 Young-ju narrowed her eyes as she stared at the guy.She didn't like the fact that Kang Yu was lying brazenly, hiding the truth.\u2014 Let's go! \u2014 Echidna exclaimed optimistically, and swung her wings wide.The almost transparent dragon cut through the air with great speed.A barrage of wind collapsed on the people sitting on her back.\u2014 Ah? \u2026Woaah!\u2014 Geh\u2026The girls, almost thrown off by the large gusts of wind, grabbed harder onto Echidna's scales, trying not to fall.And not just the girls.'Too fast.' Kang Yu took a breath and hugged Echidna by her neck.Even though speed was their priority, they were flying\u00a0too\u00a0fast now.To withstand the air pressure, he'd have to use the Power of a Thousand.The problem was, both the Power of a Thousand and Power of Projection was quite costly.To use these forces at the same time, intense concentration would be necessary.If he were to become distracted and loosen his grip, he would immediately fly off the dragon. It was far too difficult to use two Powers at once.'Echidna, slow down!'(Editor's Note: Yes, they're speaking through their minds because of their master-pet bond, consider it telepathy if you want. Anyway if you're reading on a site that starts with W ouch they stole this tl)She seemed to pause slightly hearing Kang Yu.He made an effort to grip her neck harder.Sensing this, Echidna's eyes twinkled.'Why are you speeding up?'She didn't answer.'That's enough!''You can just grip harder.''I can't hold on any more than this.''Are you embarrassed by me?'Echidna had seen how strongly Kang Yu held onto the neck of the giant orc before, back at the S-level gate.But at that time, the guy had used the Power of a Thousand. However, she was unaware of this. That's why she thought Kang Yu was being shy now and wouldn't hug her more.'Kang Yu, don't be shy with me.''Save me!''I want you to hug me as hard as you can.''I don't want to die!''I want to feel the warmth of your body\u2026''I'm falling\u2026'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(3/3)Editor: CherishA huge cave.There are stalactites hanging from the ceiling, emitting a glow that fills the space with light.Even deep within the cave, darkness couldn't be felt at all. The unusual glow illuminating the entire place was admirable.There were about twenty people in the cave, busy at work.One put a mask at the center of the drawn circle, another was spraying a dark red liquid.Just a little away from them stood a man holding a glowing magic crystal.\u2014 How's the preparation going? \u2014 A low voice came from a transparent ball.The man with tattoos all over his face responded politely:\u2014 It's almost ready. But\u2026 because of the rush, there's no guarantee of success\u2026\u2014 Hmm\u2026 \u2014 There was irritation in the voice coming out of the magic ball. \u2014 Well, do your best! Do everything you can. \u2014\u2014 Okay, \u2014 the tattooed man answered quietly.\u2014 This is the first step to a great calling. Failure is not acceptable. \u2014 With this, the light from the ball faded.The tattooed man stuffed the ball into his pocket, then went to the place of the rite.\u2014 Did you spray all the blood of the victims?\u2014 Yes! Priest Yu Dae Shik, all preparations are complete!The blood of the victims' was the most important element of their calling.The tattooed man named Yu Dae Shik knelt down, and put his hands over the ritual circle with blood splattered all over.'There still aren't enough victims.'As soon as they heard the rumors that Kim Jae Hyun, commander of Mir Guild, had been captured, they immediately headed here to prepare for the ritual.Because if he gave away their plan, the rite of calling may fail completely.But because of the rush, they didn't have time to prepare enough victims.If they hadn't cooperated with another big guild, they wouldn't even have a chance to try the ritual.'Useless creatures.'Dae Shik remembered the image of Jae Hyun promising to sacrifice a Class S special ability Player.(Editor's Note: Reminder that Jae Hyun is Mir Guild Commander, father of cocky kid-who-got-beat-up Yeong Hoon.)Trying to jump over his head, he got caught in the clutches of the government and ruined all their plans.(Editor's Note: In this case, 'jump over his head' means that he was trying to do something beyond his abilities.)'There's nothing we can do about it now.' He rolled his eyes with a frown.So far, the summon attempt has been progressing well, but the probability of success was extremely low.It would take a few more sacrifices to increase that probability.\u2014 Ah\u2026!\u2014 Priest!Dae Shik swiftly drew out a sharp dagger and slit one of his subordinates' throats.Because he cut the carotid artery, blood spurted out like a fountain.\u2014 It's your own fault that you didn't find enough victims, \u2014 Dae Shik said with a crazed look, staring down at his dead subordinates.The people around him froze and their faces turned pale.\u2014 Priest!\u2014 Have mercy!They fell to their knees, shaking with fear.The tattooed man bared his teeth and declared:\u2014 Don't worry about it\u2026 The devil will spare you for offering your blood and then give you immortality.A paradox that none of them realized.Each of them wanted to live forever, yet none were willing to die as a sacrifice to be reborn.The first person who wanted to escape from this hell was a girl with freckles.When she felt something was wrong, she turned around and started running.Dae Shik looked at her and frowned.\u2014 Disloyal garbage. Did you forget the Cardinal's words?\u2014 Ahhh!He threw a dagger at the running girl's back.Black energy flowed from the blade's edge.As it landed in the girl's back, a pain spread all over her body that made her scream.\u2014 Pupils, do not forget about the ten most important demonic commandments. \u2014 He clicked his tongue disapprovingly. \u2014 Anyone who is not ready to offer everything to the Devil will lose their chance at immortality\u2026 \u2014That was how the brutal massacre began.He killed everyone: those who rushed to flee, those who decided to attack him, even those who started to pray.Dark red blood flooded the circle prepared for the summon.\u2014 Heh heh heh. That'll be enough.Dae Shik, who had caused the bloodshed, smiled broadly, putting his hands on the circle again.A demon of the Ninth Thousandth Circle of Hell.It would obey only his will once it comes to Earth.'We're already behind the other schools\u2026'Devil's schools, scattered all over the world.Only the school in Korea was late and deviated from the plan.'Japan, for example. Three demons have already been summoned there.'Of course, their conditions were very different from the Korean ones, but it didn't change the fact that they were quicker.'I can't let my followers escape.'Remembering his meeting with the Japanese Teachers, his face turned sour.If his men run away, he'd bring shame to the Cardinal to whom he swore allegiance to.Dae Shik awakened the Magi sleeping in him, and began the ritual.\u2014 Excitare, demon! Videte mea vocant!(Editor's Note: The original couldn't be translated, so I made up a spell in Latin.)The summon circle, covered in the blood of countless victims, began to glow with a bright light.\u2014 Oh!\u2014 I thought I was going to die! \u2014 After climbing down from Echidna in Pohang, Young-ju began to breathe heavily, taking in as much air as she could.If Young-ju hadn't pulled out her chain in the middle of the flight to strap the three of them to Echidna, they would have just fallen down.\u2014 Kang Yu, did I do well? \u2014 When Echidna adopted a human form again, she looked up at the guy with sparkling eyes.Her eyes were practically begging for him to pet her.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksKang Yu smiled awkwardly and rubbed her head.\u2014 Heh, heh, heh! \u2014 She giggled happily, pleased to have helped Kang Yu.\u2014 Next time\u2026\u2014 Hmm~?\u2014 Fly a little slower.The girl's cheeks rose higher as her smile widened.\u2014 So you want to fly even longer with me!'I want to live.'\u2014 That's fine. Next time, I'll fly a little slower. I'd like to be with you longer, too.\u2014 Okay\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu nodded with an incomprehensible expression on his face.It seemed that Echidna slightly misunderstood, but what's important was the result\u2014 that she'll fly slower.'There's no gain without some loss.'Either way, they had arrived quickly.Kang Yu turned towards the Level S Gate.Hwa Yeon walked over to the squad members guarding the Gate.\u2014 It's an honor to see you!\u2014 How's the search going?\u2014 They say they haven't found anything yet.\u2014 I see. And Commander Ku Hyun Mo?\u2014 When he heard what was going on, he went into the Gate with his division.\u2014 I want to talk to him.\u2014 Got it!Hwa Yeon picked up the equipment that could contact people in the Gate.\u2014 Roger that, we'll be following behind you.After finishing the brief phone call, she came up to Young-ju and Kang Yu.\u2014 Any news on the search?The squad leader looked grim as she relayed the info:\u2014 They say that up till now, nothing has happened, but there was an explosion somewhere in the caves. It's hard to say for sure what it was, but they felt an unpleasant energy.\u2014 Unpleasant energy? \u2014 Young-ju questioned.\u2014 Most likely\u2026 it's Magi.Young-ju's expression became serious.Kang Yu squinted as he said:\u2014 I think they've already started the rite of calling.\u2014 The group who went ahead gave us the coordinates of the caves. I told the Second Division to take their time and wait for us, so it's time to move out.Kang Yu nodded and followed Hwa Yeon into the Level S Gate.Within the spacious Pohang Gate, there were hills with black holes here and there, reminiscent of ant houses on the outside.'Are all of these entrances to the caves?'Kang Yu wasn't sure if the Second Division could determine exactly which cave the Teachers were hiding in. After all, it was almost impossible to look through all the caves.\u2014 That's where they're hiding.He followed Hwa Yeon, who guided them by the coordinates, to the entrance of one of the caves.The Second Division was already near the entrance, armed and ready to fight.\u2014 Ah! You're here! Hwa Yeon, I'm sorry it took so long. But there were many caves to go through\u2026A golden-haired man with sunglasses approached the girl.Ku Hyun Mo.The commander in charge of the Second Division.\u2014 It's okay. Are you sure it's this one?\u2014 Yes! The sound of the explosion was coming from here! \u2014 He turned back slightly to his teammates. \u2014 You guys heard it, right? \u2014\u2014 That's right! \u2014 The entire team answered in a chorus to confirm their Commander's words.Kang Yu directed his gaze beyond the entrance of the cave.'Magi.'He was sure that the energy coming from there was Magi. He tapped Hwa Yeon on the shoulder to catch her attention:\u2014 Let's go in.\u2014 Got it. \u2014 She turned back to Hyun Mo and continued: \u2014\u00a0 Commander, I'm counting on you and your group. \u2014\u2014 Hha! Since you're asking, we'll do our very best. Position A, everyone!\u2014 Position A!Repeating loudly after the commander, the squad quickly lined up in proper formation.In a flash, their movements became coherent, as if they were one.Kang Yu, watching the squad that looked like they were in a superhero movie, bit his lip.'Will they be any help at all?'From the outside, the squad looked more like an amateur group than a government formation.\u2014 Let's go! \u2014 Ku Hyun Mo shouted as he looked at Hwa Yeon, his eyes gleaming with pride.He must have thought the 'Position A' that his squad took looked incredibly cool.Following his instructions, his squad entered the cave.Kang Yu slowly trailed behind them.The cave wasn't as dark as he had expected.The stalactites hanging from the ceiling were shining green.The cave, illuminated by their light, even looked beautiful.\u2014 Kang Yu, I can smell blood.Kang Yu nodded in agreement with Echidna's words. He could smell it too, even without using any Power.Unlike the bewitching cave, the smell of blood was frightening.Following the smell, they went deeper and deeper into the cave.Eventually, they reached a space of a hundred meters in diameter, where a circle was drawn in the center on the ground, from which the smell of blood was strongest.'Could this be where the calling took place?'He turned his head towards the man reaching out to the circle.He had such a big tattoo on his face that Kang Yu couldn't make out what he looked like.The tattooed man sobered up as he looked at the guests who suddenly showed up.There was an eerie smile on his face.\u2014 Ah\u2026 It's too late.There was a split in the air, like a crack in glass.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thick black Magi spilled from it.'Hell Magi.' Kang Yu frowned.It was exactly the kind of Magi he was used to.The summoning circle shone even brighter.\u2014 This is\u2026\u2014 Wha\u2026 what's going on?The voices of Hwaran's second division members were shaking with anxiety.Suddenly there was a rift.Another gate formed inside the gate. Everyone could instantly sense something bad about it.\u2014 Hhha! Oh, immortal! Come out! Absorb our mortal souls with your great power! \u2014 Yu Dae Shik shouted like a crazed man.He lifted his hands off the circle and spread them wide.Even he didn't know which of the demons was about to reveal himself.The only thing he wanted was the appearance of someone with great power.There was a low growl.As the crack widened, strong hands reached out from the rift.Black skin, a pulsing body.Grasping at the edges of the rift, he began to tear it like paper.The crack in the air grew even bigger and his red eyes flashed.\u2014 Who has called me, the demon of the Seventh Thousandth Circle of Hell, Orias?\u2014 Woah! \u2014 When Yu Dae Shik heard the voice from the rift, he crawled onto his knees where he was standing.He bowed his head to the floor before the monster coming out of the rift.\u2014 Oh, Orias! My mortal soul welcomes you!\u2014 Did you call me?\u2014 That's right, my lord, \u2014 Dae Shik politely replied to the demon before him.Orias looked down at the man with his scarlet eyes.\u2014 It's\u2026\u2014 A demon\u2026?Every guild member's face was riddled with shock as they gawked at the monster.A body up to seven meters tall.A muscular body ready to explode with power, and huge wings stemming from his back.A wild look and two horns on his forehead.Even if someone did not know the purpose of his calling, they would definitely understand it with just one glance at the demon's appearance.(Editor's Note: Basically even if someone randomly saw this scene, the demon looks so strong that they would understand it was called to rule the Earth. He looks impossible to defeat, compared to the regular Gate monsters.)\u2014 Why did you call me? \u2014 Orias asked in a low voice.\u2014 We offer you the blood of pitiful mortals! Accept us as disciples, and we will follow you! We will fulfill all your orders to get rid of the mortal species! \u2014 Yu Dae Shik shouted back.\u2014 Do you say you wish for immortality? \u2014 uttered Orias with a smile, lowering his gaze to Dae Shik, who bowed before him.Having been born and living so long as a demon, he considered humans who desire immortality, and step on others to acquire it, to be low.\u2014 Do you desire eternal life?\u2014 Yes!\u2014 Do you want to always experience passion and pleasure?\u2014 Yes!!! \u2014 Dae Shik almost shrieked with jubilation.He bowed even lower, hitting the ground with his head and drawing dark red blood from his forehead.\u2014 I wish to have an endless life like you! I want power and authority!He looked up at the wild Orias.A demon from Hell.For Dae Shik, he was both an aspiration and the messiah.'Eternal life! Unfading passion! Constant pleasure!' The tempting words spoken by Orias looped in his head.Before following Hell's teachings, Dae Shik was one of few Muslims in Korea.That's why he wanted to cross the line of mortality and devote his entire infinite life to Allah.But one day, someone wearing a red mask appeared in his life.The teachings he was spreading changed Dae Shik's values completely.'By following such a doctrine, do you have a real reason to yearn for immortality? We can give it to you. Blind faith in God is nothing more than comfort. Is there meaning in infinity after death?'What he heard then shocked him.Eternal life without death?No fear of death?How could this be? For he was born to accept the fate of man and eventually die.But demons are beings who don't need to care about a notion such as 'fate'.Dae Shik had no reason not to bow down to him.\u2014 Hhha! That's great! A man with enough passion!Orias could feel the passionate desire coming from the man.This passion, burning strongly like fire, excited him.The demon continued:\u2014 Speak, son of man. Where are the victims who will give me pleasure?\u2014 There. \u2014 Dae Shik pointed his hand towards the Hwaran Squad.From Orias, a raging flame of desire began to grow.\u2014 That's not bad. Not bad at all, \u2014 the monster growled, eyeing his meal.The corners of his lips twitched and stretched out into a smile.He was agitated by the power he felt from the Hwaran men, who pointed weapons at him.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksHe did not understand how mere mortals could radiate such a powerful force, but the monster knew for sure that there would be enough of them to entertain him.\u2014 That demon\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju looked at Orias warily.She grabbed the bracelet hanging from her hand.She could sense a completely different power coming from him compared to the energy of Gate monsters.He was far more powerful and destructive.\u2014 Squad, prepare for battle! I don't know what's going on, but it looks like we're gonna have to toughen up! \u2014 Ku Hyun Mo put on sunglasses and pulled out his weapons \u2013 two small knives.He immediately started concentrating Maryok in both hands.\u2014 It's the first time I've seen such a frightening big guy. \u2014 Hyun Mo gulped as he looked at Orias.He hardly ever showed signs of anxiety, but standing in front of such a monster, even he couldn't help but be nervous.The energy coming from the demon was just so powerful.\u2014 If he escaped beyond the gate, there would certainly be a ruckus. We must stop him by all means, \u2014 Hwa Yeon said, pulling out a white sword and preparing to fight.Young-ju clicked her tongue.\u2014 If my guys were here, it would be much easier\u2026\u2014 But they're not. It would be good enough if they could even get to the Gate before the demon gets out of here and causes chaos.The best way to resolve the situation was to kill the man before he called the demon, but it was too late.The other way was to kill the demon himself.Young-ju and Hwa Yeon were staring at Orias while they gathered Maryok.\u2014 O Demon, who lives through eternity! Show these mortal beings your power!\u2014 Wonderful. War and murder is the best entertainment for me.The seven-meter monster stretched his body and spread his wings wide.Veins protruded on his skin. His body was functioning at the expense of the strongest Magi.Orias' gaze landed on the Hwaran squad.The anticipation of the coming battle made him quiver with excitement.The monster, stomping his legs, extended his hand forward, and pulled a giant sickle out of the rift.\u2014 Hey, ugly bugs! \u2014 Orias shouted out, waving his sickle.The Second Division, led by Ku Hyun Mo, reacted first.Twisting the knives in his hands, the Commander shouted out:\u2014 Position C! Let's show this pumped-up pig what we can do!\u2014 Yes sir!The squad moved forward in a neat, coordinated manner.Their construction was like a spear.Hyun Mo, who led them, smiled. He confidently thrusted forward.The sickle and the knives crossed in the air.Hyun Mo cried out as he flew back with force. The monster was even stronger than it seemed at first glance.\u2014 He's so damn strong! \u2014 shouted out Hyun Mo, trying to calm the tremors in his body.If he had to keep fighting that demon one-on-one, he would have died from the next blow.However\u2026\u2014 Hha! How well done!\u2014 As expected of the commander!\u2026he wasn't alone.While Hyun Mo was distracted, the squad rushed into battle without delay.Of course, the demon was able to repel most attacks, but not all.Wounds started to appear on Orias' body.\u2014 Nice!The more wounds there were on his body, the happier his voice became, and the more his excitement increased.He swung the giant sickle.Along the trajectory he traced, a series of Magi explosions followed, throwing aside the Hwaran men to the ground as if it was nothing for the enemy.\u2014 Hhha! Did you see that, you pathetic people? This is demon power! The infinite power that an immortal creature has! \u2014 Yu Dae Shik screamed with a crazy look.The power shown by Orias was terrifying.'And this is only our first attempt at calling!'The wall separating the worlds was getting weaker and weaker.Which means they could easily summon even stronger demons.If that was the case, they could take over all of Korea. No, even the whole world could fall to his hands.Dae Shik could envision his life of immortality as ruler of the world.Just imagining it gave him goosebumps all over his body.\u2014 Hhha! This is it, humans! Make me laugh! Cheer me up! \u2014 Orias shouted in a crazy voice.He looked around eagerly for a stronger opponent.His gaze stopped at the man who was just standing still and watching him.\u2014 Huh? \u2014 When the demon saw Kang Yu, he frowned. \u2014 Eh\u2026 how is that\u2026? How\u2026 why? \u2014Orias was looking at the guy with eyes full of horror.The sickle in his hands fell to the ground and his body shook.\u2014 What\u2026 why is he here? No\u2026 no. This can't be happening! \u2014 Orias was muttering under his breath like he'd lost his mind.He shook with such fear that he looked pathetic.\u2014 Orias\u2026? \u2014 Dae Shik looked at the demon in bewilderment.Orias looked in his direction:\u2014 Son of man, cancel\u2026 cancel the summoning!!!\u2014 What\u2026?\u2014 Abolish it!!!\u2014 Why so suddenly\u2026\u2014 I'm\u2026 I'm going back to Hell! Quickly cancel your calling and bring me back! Aah! Can't you see that monster is coming our way?! Bring me back to Hell! \u2014 Orias' screams spread all over the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wh-what happened?\u2014 Immortal? Don't talk nonsense, son of man! We can't just rush to our own deaths!\u2014 But you just said you enjoyed the pleasure of battle and murder\u2026\u2014 If you were in my place, you wouldn't be able to enjoy it anymore either!'What is this nonsense?' He kept looking at Orias with a baffled expression.Only a moment ago he was enjoying the battle and showing off all his power, and now he's talking nonsense.'What happened?'Where did the self-confident Orias go?Before Dae Shik could blink, the demon's behavior had changed.Though it wasn't a good comparison, the demon looked like a schoolboy playing an online game when Mom suddenly called in.(Editor's Note: Comparing to teenage boys who curse a lot in-game and brag about themselves until their mom walks in and they stop acting so cocky.)\u2014 Come on! Hurry up and cancel the calling! Please, send me back to Hell! \u2014 Orias was screaming like he was praying.Dae Shik started biting his nails restlessly. His plan was falling apart.'Why, among all the many demons, did this one come\u2026?'Dae Shik thought his luck had really run out.He didn't think that a demon from the Seventh Thousandth Circle would be such a coward.Dae Shik was confused.He didn't have the slightest idea how to resolve this situation.\u2014 You can't go back. But don't worry, great Orias! They are just pathetic mortals! With the power you possess, you can easily kill these weaklings.\u2014 Pitiful mortals? Weaklings?! \u2014 The demon's red eyes flashed.\u00a0 \u2014 Stupid man! What do you know to say such a thing! You don't know anything. You have no idea who he is or what he's done! \u2014A look filled with horror. A voice that gives away fear.More questions appeared in Dae Shik's eyes. He had no idea who could make a powerful demon scream in fear.\u2014 Who are you talking ab- \u2014 Before he could finish, a deafening sound echoed through the cave.It was Kang Yu, using the Power of Growing Strike.He looked at Orias like he had a headache.'Does he really recognize me?' He looked at the demon with disbelief.Of course, Kang Yu was a famous person within the Ninth Thousandth Circle of Hell, as well as beyond.But unlike the technologically advanced Earth, in Hell, rumors spread only through words.That's why almost all demons have heard rumours about Kang Yu, but few knew what he looked like.But the summoned monster seemed to recognize his face with great certainty.If he was unlucky enough to get caught in a battle right now, Kang Yu would lose.'Or is it the other way around\u2026?'Kang Yu looked at Orias, who was terrified.Right now, the immense power Kang Yu had owned in Hell has been sealed.Even though he was able to restore some of his Powers thanks to raising his Player level and the Power of the Devourer, it still could not be compared to his abilities during his period of reign.In his current state, it would be quite difficult for him to fight the demon of the Seventh Thousandth Circle.'But if he's scared like this to begin with, it probably won't be that hard to bring him down.'The corners of his lips twitched upwards, and he licked his lips.\u2014 You're Orias, right? \u2014 Kang Yu said in a way that only a monster would hear him.\u2014 Oh! \u2014 Kang Yu's question reached Orias.The monster was even more shaken up with fear. Just hearing the guy's voice, his muscles tensed up even more.It's a feeling of horror that creeps to the bones. The Great Lord inflicted an irresistible fear in everyone.\u2014 Y-yes\u2026 \u2014 Orias replied in a trembling voice.\u2014 Speak in a way that only I can hear.\u2014 Y-Yes! Got it! \u2014 The monster hastily nodded his head.He made sure that no one else could hear what he was saying.\u2014 Lord, why are you here?\u2014 Did you just ask me a question?\u2014 N-no! Excuse me! \u2014 Shaking in terror, Orias hurriedly shook his head.Kang Yu had only said one line. Yet the reaction to that one phrase exceeded all his expectations. He smiled in content.'This will be easier than I thought.'It's easy for fear to override common sense.Kang Yu didn't know where he'd been seen by the demon, but Orias was unmistakably filled with fear.Since Orias had tucked his tail between his legs before the fight even began, Kang Yu knew that he had already won an unconditional victory.(Editor's Note: For those unfamiliar with this expression, tail between legs = feeling shame, defeat and resignation.)'The important thing is to avoid getting caught.'As long as he doesn't give himself away and Orias doesn't find out about his weakness, there will be no problems.'It's like taking candy from a child.'It couldn't be easier. Truly a trivial matter.\u2014 You seem to have interfered with my plans, \u2014 Kang Yu said pointedly.Orias' eyes widened.\u2014 P-plans?\u2014 Do you intend to keep asking me questions?\u2014 Oh\u2026 I'm sorry!It was a one-sided conversation.Orias fell silent, realizing he was wrong to speak up.He was in a dangerous situation now.His fear of the Lord enveloped him so much that he was afraid to move.'The further I ask, the scarier he'll be\u2026'Orias considered the Lord's words.He was trying to figure out what Kang Yu was talking about.Kang Yu carefully looked at the pondering monster.No matter how much the demon thought about it, he couldn't figure out what kind of plan the Lord had.'I just said a meaningful line.'To hide your weakness, all you have to do is keep your opponent away.Orias' expression grew more and more thoughtful. He could not understand at all what was the plan in question.After waiting enough time, Kang Yu continued in a low tone:Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 I'll give you a chance.\u2014 Oh\u2026 what chance are you talking about?\u2014 If you succeed, I will let you be my servant.\u2014 Servant? \u2014 In amazement, Orias repeated his words.A servant of the Great Lord!After the Seven Great Demons died at his hands, any being in Hell would be honored to serve Kang Yu.Becoming the Lord's servant means being able to borrow some of his powers.Even by taking over a small part of his powerful Magi, they could become incredibly strong.Kang Yu was so powerful that even demons from other Circles of Hell didn't dare to ignore him.It was this power that could make servants out of demons, for such an offer could not be refused.\u2014 I will follow any of your orders! I, Orias, swear eternal loyalty to the Lord!Having received such a sudden offer, he perked up.\u2014 Defeat the people here without using weapons. I want to know if you are worthy to be my servant.\u2014 Roger that! \u2014 Orias did not hesitate to nod his head.Looking at the agitated image of the monster, Kang Yu grinned.'You should try to turn on your brain.'Fighting people without using weapons to test your strength. If it were a more intelligent creature, it would definitely question such a wish.'Well, that won't happen.'And the problem wasn't even that the demon was stupid.It's just that such a proposal from the Lord of Hell was intoxicating.Milgram's experiment had proved that obedience to authority is deeply rooted in people's minds.And demons were no different from them. Orias was an excellent example.Orias, following Kang Yu's orders, threw his sickle aside and kicked it far away.With bare hands, he launched an attack on the Hwaran Squad.\u2014 What is going on with that demon?\u2014 I have no idea\u2026 \u2014 said Hwa Yeon, narrowing her eyes. \u2014 But it's a good time to attack him. \u2014No one could understand why the summoned demon was behaving like this, but it doesn't matter, because he's put himself at a disadvantage.'West Wind.'Hwa Yeon readied her sword.A strong wind blew from the white edge of the sword.Created and controlled by Maryok, it was an icy wind, inside which was hidden a force chilling to the bone.\u2014 Ah! \u2014 Orias made an excruciating cry.He tried to resist the wind with his bare hands, but it didn't work and the skin on his hands cracked.\u2014 You ugly beetles!Orias swung his fist, trying to resist Hwa Yeon's sword.\u2014 Kh\u2026Hwa Yeon, not expecting him to rush right at her, was thrown back with incredible force.The monster ran after her, but Young-ju blocked his way.\u2014 Who are you calling bugs? Ha?The girl stretched her hands forward, discontent. She closed her eyes and focused. The bracelets hanging on both wrists turned red.'Blood Chains.'From the bracelets appeared chains with sharp spikes.Dozens of bundles of metal chains covered the entire floor of the cave, slithering as fast as snakes.\u2014 Ahhh!The sharp spikes pierced his skin and blood spilled from his wounds. The chains kept attacking Orias tirelessly.His face twisting in agony, he looked at Young-ju.'She's strong.'So much so that he could hardly believe she was a mere human.\u2014 Damn it!He doubted that even a weapon would help him in this situation. His breathing grew heavy, and he looked down at his hands.Ah, if only he was a simple demon who could always win fights with bare hands.But he was so used to his sickle that his body was used to moving at a certain pace.And now, when he was told to fight with his bare hands, he was powerless.His movements were sloppy, and he lacked strength.'But this is the Lord's test!'Holding back the stifling feeling inside him, he kept fighting.The more he fought, the more serious the wounds he received.The passion that had arisen earlier subsided and his movements became slower.\u2014 Khhh\u2026 \u2014 Orias fell on one knee.He no longer thought he could resist the people, weapon or no weapon.At that moment, Kang Yu, who was lifting his sickle from the ground and heading in his direction, came into his line of sight.'Master will help me!' Hope sparkled in his eyes.If he retrieved his sickle and received power from the Lord, he would easily overcome all these people.He would simply crush the men threatening him like beetles!'Yes, I can see it now! The picture is clear.'The important thing is that he showed his intentions, the important thing is that he wasn't afraid to follow his master's orders!Surely the Lord must have been moved by Orias' efforts.\u2014 Ah\u2026 Kn\u2026 Huh?The sickle he was hoping to get back was digging into his heart.He looked down on his chest, unable to understand.\u2014 But\u2026 why\u2026?\u2014 Don't hate me, Orias. \u2014 He pressed even harder on the sickle that pierced his chest.Blood gushed out of the wound like a river.A smile graced the man's lips.\u2014 You just couldn't recognize the deception.[You successfully destroyed the demon Orias of the Seventh Thousandth Circle of Hell][You get bonus experience points][You got a lot of experience points][Level up by 5 units][When you reach level 50, you get Rank 6.][You have a new special ability]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not completely sure.)And taking into account all the bonus stats she has accumulated, it's safe to say that the average Player with 6th rank would not be able to beat her.'However\u2026'Kang Yu turned his eyes to Young-ju.Despite the fact that they had never fought against each other, seeing her battles with Kim Jae Hyun and Orias, he could roughly estimate her potential.And he understood that he was now on roughly the same level with her.'I haven't reached the limit yet.'After Kang Yu's return to Earth, he developed at a phenomenal rate as a Player.'Soon there will be problems.' Glancing again at his level on his status window, he frowned.The first hurdle faced by Players is the so-called 'Effort's End' or simply, 'Level 59.'From this point on, experience points will continue to accumulate for killing ordinary monsters, but their level will not increase.'I've heard that every Player has their own way of overcoming this problem.'Some suddenly try to learn martial arts, some try to go against stronger monsters, some try to get rid of the barrier by facing the edge of life and death.There were also those who simply went to bed in the evening, and woke up without any problems.(Editor's Note: The last sentence likely implies that this type of people give up and don't bother to try anything special to keep levelling up. )'They say gifted players will deal with this problem once or twice.'The higher the special ability levels of Players, or the better their skills, the faster it is to overcome this hurdle.Level 59 is not nicknamed 'Effort's End' for no reason.'Until I encounter this problem myself, I won't know how bad it is.'Although his chances of overcoming the problem painlessly were great based on his high level abilities, there was no guarantee.The most obvious example is Young-ju, who's stuck at Level 59, despite the fact that she'd unlocked a Class S special ability at Rank 1.'I'll think about it later.' Kang Yu averted his eyes.Although he wanted to test his new special ability immediately, it wasn't his priority at the moment.'Power of the Devourer.' The guy held out one hand.Being surrounded by so many people, he tried not to show the hand with which he was using the Power of the Devourer.A dark haze enveloped Orias' body.\u2014 Huh?\u2014 This\u2026 This is\u2026Ku Hyun Mo and the squad exclaimed in surprise.Kang Yu used another Force so that no one could hear the sound with which his Power devoured the flesh of the demon.That's why, all the others could see was a demon disappearing in black smoke.(Editor's Note: Force and Power will be used interchangeably, if you haven't already noticed from early chapters.)\u2014 Do demons disappear on their own after death? \u2014 Hyun Mo, watching what was happening, tilted his head to one side.Since there were almost no records of demons, no one knew for sure.[Magi increased by 3 units]'Three units?' Kang Yu frowned.Against all expectations, he was given too little Magi.'I wonder if it's because of my high Magi level?'At this moment, he possessed 83 units.It was so much that he was on par with the Level 80 Players with 9th rank.Despite the fact that with each increase in level, it becomes more difficult to gain stats, three units of Magi were not too bad of a result.'Although it's difficult to raise my stats, the efficiency is also increasing.'Comparing the power in 20 units of Magi that he obtained from the Andras Guild to the power he received in the 3 units just now, he could sense a much greater burst of energy with the latter.'I guess it's not that bad.'The number was not much of an important indicator.Although his Magi had increased by only 3 units, now he could feel a clear influx of powerful energy.Kang Yu smiled contentedly and nodded his head.He turned his eyes to Dae Shik, who was entangled in Young-ju's metal chains.\u2014 Hwa Yeon, this guy's the red-masked nutcase, isn't he?Hyun Mo hit the floundering guy across the cheek with force. \u2014 No, this one's merely his servant. \u2014\u2014 Yes, he will not reveal himself so easily. And I'm sure he will want to kill you all\u2026 \u2014 Dae Shik chuckled lowly.Hyun Mo slapped him hard on the cheek again.Though he looked like a gangster from the outside with how harshly he treated Dae Shik, he was really a Commander of one of the Hwaran units.He was well aware of how just dangerous Devil's Teachers were.\u2014 Let's take him to headquarters first and interrogate him. There are far fewer people in our department than in Seoul, so no one will interfere during the interrogation. \u2014 Hyun Mo smiled contentedly and turned to Dae Shik, snapping his fingers.\u2014 Look here, you moron. You're going to talk to me and\u2026Dae Shik suddenly started making strange sounds.\u2014 Huh? What's this? I haven't done anything yet.The man suddenly began to vomit black blood.Kang Yu quickly ran up to them.Powerful Magi began emitting from Dae Shik, who continued to throw up blood.'Aha\u2026' Kang Yu narrowed his eyes.He had seen this several times already.The moment Magi takes over one's mind and body.This means\u2026\u2014 aah!\u2014 What's going on?\u2014 Commander, step back!Hyun Mo and Hwa Yeon jumped out of the way.Dae Shik's body was growing bigger and bigger. Horns stuck out from his forehead and wings sprouted on his back.His skin stretched out, and his face, which was left with no trace of the tattoo, hardened.His arms suddenly cracked and split into two. Healthy fangs popped out of his mouth.Despite all this, he did not look like the previous 'demons.'He was rubbish that couldn't even become a proper demon.'Damn.' Kang Yu furrowed his eyebrows. Now there was absolutely no way to bring him back to a human form.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'We won't be able to find out the whereabouts of the masked man this time, too.' He clicked his tongue in displeasure.Considering the personality of the red masked man, the probability that Dae Shik knows much about him was extremely small.Even so, they couldn't miss a single opportunity to learn something about him. But the opportunity they had seized today has disappeared.\u2014 W-aah!Dae Shik, now a monster, rushed at them.But for these Players who had just defeated a demon of the Seventh Thousandth Circle of Hell, the man who became a monster did not pose much danger.\u2014 Damn it! We can't interrogate him like this!\u2014 Aaah!Young-ju waved her hand and sent red metal chains flying at the man-monster.Tightly squeezing him with the chains, she screamed angrily and shoved him up against the wall.Hwa Yeon spoke up:\u2014 Young-ju, calm down. He won't be able to tell us anything useful anyway.The girl took a deep breath.As if trying to relieve her tension, she lifted Dae Shik's body and slammed him into the ground several times.The girl exhaled and wiped the sweat from her forehead.\u2014 Now we need to find out which of the three remaining major guilds is working with the Devil's Teachers.\u2014 I think we need to make some preparations first. When they learn about what happened today, I doubt they will give themselves away so easily, \u2014 Hwa Yeon replied.\u2014 That's true.Young-ju looked down at the monster's mutilated body.The girl was well aware that they were no closer to exterminating the Teachers, even with what they had accomplished today.Hwa Yeon turned to Kang Yu:\u2014 By the way Kang Yu, you'll be receiving some compensation from the government.\u2014 Hm? \u2014 His eyes gleamed with surprise upon hearing this.Hwa Yeon continued with a chuckle:\u2014 You helped to expose the Mir Guild's deeds and interrogate Kim Jae Hyun. And we got to Pohang so quickly, too, thanks to you. If you don't receive anything in return despite everything you've done for us, my reputation will certainly suffer.Kang Yu has had an active part in this case.In fact, if it wasn't for him, things could have ended much worse.Kang Yu was glad to hear her words.\u2014 It's not going to turn out to be something like a certificate of honor, is it?Such a reward can be expected from the government. It certainly would hold no value to him.\u2014 Haha, I'm not stupid. I'll tell you more later, by phone. Give me your number so I can contact you.\u2014 By the way\u2026 it would be nice if I wasn't mentioned anywhere.\u2014 Do you not enjoy being famous?\u2014 I don't want to attract unnecessary attention.\u2014 Hmm, I see. We can arrange everything without an official announcement, but rumors will get out, one way or another.In other words, she was implying that if someone asked her about it, she will tell them about Kang Yu.There was a chance that he would start to gain attention beyond just being a rookie receiving support from Red Rose.\u2014 We can figure that out after you tell me what the reward is.There's no need to rush for answers.If the reward is so great that it's worth publicizing, they could discuss it again later.'I can't give up something of value just to avoid attention.'In any case, if they continue to work together in hunting down the Devil's Teachers, his name will inevitably be brought to light anyway.He was too active for a person who did not want to be caught up in rumors.\u2014 Haha. You're going to love it, \u2014 the girl said.Hearing the vivacity and confidence in her tone, Kang Yu's eyes sparkled with anticipation.Baek Hwa Yeon is not the kind of person to exaggerate or say something without acting on it. If she says so, then the reward will really be worth it.\u2014 Young-ju, your guild will also be rewarded, of course. Thanks for all your help and support.\u2014 Well\u2026 I have my reasons for it, \u2014 the red-haired girl replied in a low tone. \u2014 But anyway, let's finish here for today. I really want to go home and relax.So much has happened, from meeting Kim Jae Hyun to fighting a demon. It'd be strange if they weren't tired after that.Kang Yu looked at Young-ju with a pitying gaze.'She doesn't seem to be just tired.' Kang Yu recalled that someone from her guild had suffered at the hands of the Teachers. 'She must be blaming herself.'They hadn't been able to learn anything new about the red mask man today.Surely sadness and anger was clouding her mind now.As he walked towards the exit of the cave, he quietly said:\u2014 You're doing great.\u2014 What\u2026?\u2014 I'm talking about revenge. Of course, what we did today is not enough, but you shouldn't blame yourself. And don't rush. I'm sure we'll have a better opportunity for revenge soon. And that's when you can do your best.The girl fell silent.Seeing this, he continued softly:\u2014 Don't worry, I'll help.\u2014 How presumptuous of you\u2026 You think you'll be able to help me?Young-ju turned her back to Kang Yu.Though she had spoken like she was displeased with his response, his words actually seemed to alleviate her burdens a little. She even smiled a little.'If you rush too much, you can easily make a mistake that will only complicate things.'Kang Yu thought it would be a mistake for him to lose her.And the problem wasn't just about not getting support from Red Rose.'To some extent, I feel something for her\u2026' Thinking this, Kang Yu left the cave.(Editor's Note: Could be sympathy, could be love\u2026 what do you think?)'Well, it's time to test the new special ability.'This was the moment he was looking forward to.He seemed to experience exactly the same emotion as all the other Players when receiving a new special ability.He opened the status window, his heart pounding, breath held, eyes sparkling\u2026 much like a child tearing open a gift wrapping.Kang Yu couldn't help but anticipate what ability he would get and how much stronger it would make him.'What is this\u2026?' Upon opening the status window, Kang Yu's face twisted in confusion.[ Rank 6 Ability: ??? (Class: ???) ][ This ability will become fully available upon reaching the highest degree of demonic form ]'What are these question marks?'He'd already delayed testing his ability to 'devour' Orias, but now this happened.'What's the big deal? How am I supposed to achieve the highest degree without knowing at least the conditions for achieving it?'To meet the conditions, it was necessary to have at least some information.Kang Yu even wondered if it was someone's cruel joke. No, he wanted to believe that someone was just messing around with him.'Because if they are, I'll definitely break their neck into the form of a question mark.'Kang Yu looked again at the status window full of question marks and grimaced.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The unknown in the red demon mask lightly nodded his head in response.\u2014 Tell me more about the support they have offered.\u2014 We will get pure, concentrated Magi. There will be enough to make the cardinal even stronger so we may carry out our plan.\u2014 Excellent, \u2014 said the red mask cardinal, sounding satisfied by this response.(Reminder: We last saw this cardinal character about 20 chapters ago. Last time he spoke with Dae Shik, tattooed face man, in the video recording that the spy passed to Hwaran.)Even in his answer, there was passion and zeal.No matter what the outcome was, the calling itself had been successful. The condition set by the School has been successfully fulfilled, which means that he will receive a reward.'I never thought it would turn out this way.'He frowned as he recalled the video viewed through the crystal in his hands.It was, of course, a good thing that the calling had been successful, but he could not have imagined that ordinary Players would be able to defeat the demon with such ease.'I expected that at least the Hwaran Squad would suffer from him.'He'd realized that Hwaran could be a major obstacle to their plan of destroying Korea.That's why he hoped that the Squad would get hurt.But in the end, it turned out quite the opposite.For some unknown reason, the demon whom they summoned with great difficulty began to behave strangely halfway through, and fell at the hands of Hwaran.'Why did the demon behave like that?' He frowned, puzzled by the sudden change in behavior.Orias had appeared and presented himself as a mighty demon, but only moments later, he hid his tail between his legs with a squeal like some kind of cowardly dog.He hardly acted like a demon at all.'Is it because of Chae Young-ju?'The most powerful Player in the cave at the time was Chae Young-ju of the Red Rose.After a few seconds of reflection, the masked man shook his head, dismissing the idea.He himself has crossed paths with Young-ju several times.While she surpassed all the female Players in terms of strength, it was not enough to take down a mighty demon from Hell.No, even if she is that strong, the demon would certainly try to fight her before fleeing, to save his pride.'Something's wrong.' He narrowed his eyes.There had to be some kind of decisive factor that he simply didn't know about.But it was something that couldn't be seen through the crystal's recording.'Maybe it has something to do with the guy who raised Orias' sickle at the end?'He recognized that guy; that man had made a dangerous impression.Rumors of the young man named Oh Kang Yu had, of course, reached his ears.A rookie sponsored by Red Rose. A Player with extraordinary talent. No doubt that there would be gossip about someone like him.'Hmm\u2026' He let out a sigh, deep in thought.Still, no matter how talented Oh Kang Yu could be, he was just a novice. It has only been a month since the Red Rose Guild started sponsoring him. During this time, he could not have become so strong that he could intimidate a demon called from Hell.'I have no idea.'The demon's behavior defied logical explanation.'There's more we need to know.' He frowned again, his eyes flashing as he decided there was not enough information to work with.\u2014 There is more news, Cardinal.\u2014 Speak.\u2014 World Ranker Players have started to make their move.Hearing the news about the World Rankers, the face of the unknown man visibly twisted, even underneath the mask.It was not the fact that they began to act that angered him, but the fact that they were mentioned.\u2014 Hmm. . . .Calming himself down, he leaned back in his chair.The walls between the worlds have weakened, so the Devil's Teachers were actively advancing their plans. Of course their actions would catch unwanted attention.Therefore, he was not at all surprised by the news he heard.\u2014 Did you get any instructions from the School?\u2014 Not yet.\u2014 Not yet, you say\u2026 \u2014 The masked man's eyes gleamed with irritation.The lack of instructions was practically an instruction in itself. He continued:\u2014 Then we must hurry. Our plans cannot be put on hold. We will start with El Quero.The name he uttered belonged to the monster that dwells in the Level S Gate in Suwon.\u2014 Yes, sir! \u2014 The priests answered loudly, bowing to the floor.Immediately after leaving the Gate, Kang Yu hopped onto Echidna and flew home. Young-ju and Hwa Yeon, who refused to succumb to his persuasion of riding home together, went their separate ways.When the two of them arrived home, Han Sol was already back from taking Si Hoon to the hospital.And it wasn't just Han Sol.Eun Bi and Dae Su were with her.They rose from their chairs and stared at Kang Yu, as if implying that they had a lot of questions to ask him.(Editor's Note: Reminder that their group was at the Gate when Kim Yeong Hoon \u2013 aka Si Hoon's half-brother \u2013 of Mir Guild attacked them. And then Kang Yu used Yeong Hoon as bait to lure out his father, Kim Jae Hyun. About 10 chapters ago.)He met their gaze with confidence and nodded his head.\u2014 I'll tell you everything tomorrow we go to visit Si Hoon.Now that they, too, have gotten involved, there was no reason to keep hiding it from them.When they're all gathered at the hospital tomorrow, he will explain everything:The fact that he gets support from Red Rose; that a pseudo-religion began to act in Korea; even that Kim Jae Hyun and his son were involved with the disappearance of Players to sacrifice them to the Devil's Teachers.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 So what happened was\u2026 you heard the rumors about me, and you've been following me for a week?\u2014 Yes. As soon as I heard the rumors, I realized they were talking about you, Si Hoon.\u2014 Where did those rumors even come from\u2026\u2014 The world of Players is small. Not to mention, such attractive people have gathered in our party. It would be strange if rumors didn't spread, \u2014 Kang Yu replied calmly.Of course, the rumors\u00a0didn't\u00a0appear on their own. But there's no way he would tell them that he was the one who threw out Si Hoon as bait.He was only saying what everyone expected to hear.'Besides, I'm not exactly lying.'The plan had only succeeded because Si Hoon's party truly was different from other parties.First, the party members' physical appearance was already eye-catching, and second, their abilities were outstanding.\u2014 And you couldn't tell us in advance? \u2014 Han Sol looked at him, feeling a little disappointed.She knew, of course, that Kang Yu actually kept a lot of secrets to himself.'Most likely, this case is not the only one.'She felt that Kang Yu was hiding even more secrets of great importance.The girl thought that, despite their cohabitation, she still could not get close to him at all.An incomprehensible sad feeling weighed on Han Sol's heart.\u2014 I'm sorry I made you worry.\u2014 Mm\u2026 \u2014\u00a0 Han Sol let out a barely audible acknowledgement of his words.He simply apologized without trying to make excuses, and the girl felt remorse.She shook her head and started to apologize:\u2014 No, no, it's nothing. Why did I suddenly\u2026 You must have had your reasons.\u2014 Nonetheless, I made my family worried. I can't promise it won't happen again, but I will try my best.\u2014 Wh\u2026what are you saying? Aa\u2026 \u2014 Han Sol was so flustered she couldn't even finish her sentence.Her heart was pounding at breakneck speed. If she didn't force herself to look normal, she'd be smiling like a fool right now.The word 'family' uttered by Kang Yu firmly stuck in her head.\u2014 Thank you\u2026 \u2014 She said it barely above a whisper, as if she'd lost her voice.The moment was so sweet, it looked like there was some kind of pink shining aura around them.\u2014 Kang Yu, here, \u2014 Echidna said, sitting down on his lap.She held out the tangerines she had bought before they went to the hospital.The guy grinned and took a tangerine.\u2014 So hyung, what happened to those Devil bastards? \u2014 Dae Su asked.\u2014 So far, we've dealt with some of them, but we still haven't been able to track down their leader.\u2014 Oh\u2026 And they really sacrificed people\u2026?\u2014 Yes. And don't forget, you almost fell into their clutches, too.\u2014 Ugh, those vile creatures! \u2014 Dae Su stomped his foot, a disgruntled expression on his face.If Dae Su's angry face appeared in someone's dreams, that dream would definitely be considered a nightmare.'You really don't look human.' Kang Yu restrained himself from saying it out loud. Instead he said:\u2014 In general, you should be more careful when hunting. Who knows when they will start acting again.\u2014 Understood.\u2014 Here, take this. \u2014 Kang Yu passed a transparent ball to each of them, which he had received from Young-ju.\u2014 Kang Yu, what is this? \u2014 Si Hoon took hold of it and stared at it.\u2014 This ball allows you to call from the Gate to the outside world. If anything happens, call me right away.\u2014 Thank you! \u2014 Si Hoon, appearing overwhelmed, clenched his fist around the ball. \u2014 And Kang Yu\u2026 I have a question.\u2014 I'll answer it if I can.\u2014 What happened to Kim Yeong Hoon and his father?\u2014 They'll spend the rest of their lives in prison.Si Hoon fell silent.\u2014 Don't worry. This time they went too far and committed an act that they will not be able to pay off with money.Kidnapping Players and sacrificing them for a pseudo-religion.Of course, they can try to fake an alibi, but Kang Yu won't let that happen.'If necessary, I'll even fake the evidence myself.'Kang Yu had plenty of opportunities to do so.\u2014 And\u2026 I accidentally found out about your situation\u2026\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 I heard that Kim Jae Hyun had a hand in your huge debts. I'll do my best to get you reimbursed for all the damage they've done. And if I'm not mistaken, your mother is sick, so I will help and make sure she receives the best medical attention.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon's mouth dropped wide open, shocked by what he just heard.He trembled slightly, and a tear rolled down his cheek.\u2014 Gh\u2026 thank you. Really, thank you. Kang Yu\u2026 you are my savior, \u2014 he said, almost sobbing.'Don't say that. Or else I'll start to feel guilty.'Kang Yu, remembering how he'd attacked Si Hoon and forcibly made him his subordinate, smiled awkwardly.\u2014 Oh Kang Yu, you really are a good man\u2026'Enough is enough.'\u2014 I'm so lucky to have met you.'Sorry, I was wrong, I'm sorry. Not that I know you better, I understand that I went too far by making you my subordinate.'\u2014 I also want to call you hyung, like Dae Su.(Editor's Note: i.e. he's expressing he wants to have a more intimate \u2014\u00a0not romantic ofc\u2026yet? cough cough\u00a0\u2014 relationship with Kang Yu.)'Why are you doing this to me?'Kang Yu's guilt was eating him alive.No matter how calculating and cold he was, he still had feelings.'I feel like real trash.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But from the very beginning, I've gotten\u2026 slightly different alerts than others.\u2014 Different\u2026?His teammates stared at him with a questioning look.Kang Yu was also interested, because it was also his first time hearing about this, and his eyes gleamed with curiosity.\u2014 Because the Gaia System was weakening, I was chosen as an additional defense.\u2014 Gaia System\u2026?\u2014 I don't really know what it is either. But on the very first day I became a Player, I received this message.Kang Yu narrowed his eyes.'I didn't expect to hear about the system.'It was a concept that even Chae Young-ju never heard of.So he could never have imagined that Si Hoon would talk about it.(Reminder: He briefly mentioned it to her before, thinking she'd know about it, but she didn't.)An idea sparked in his mind, and he asked:\u2014 Si Hoon, when exactly did you become a Player?\u2014 Hmm\u2026 May 22.Han Sol looked surprised and asked:\u2014 Hey, isn't that the first time we met, Kang Yu?The 22nd of May.The date of Kang Yu's return to Earth.'I went back to Earth the same time Si Hoon became a Player.'It was not hard to guess why Si Hoon received such a message.'The Gaia System is weakening\u2026'Now Kang Yu was sure that he was the reason for the weakening of the protective function.'Which is why they chose a defender for the system.'To some extent, everything was connected.Kang Yu continued to reason with himself:'So Si Hoon is the key to rebuilding the system, right?'Of course, Si Hoon himself was unaware of this.Perhaps Si Hoon was a protector who could restore the system. Or the system had become so weak it could no longer exist without external protection.'Looking at the situation from an outside perspective, it is more accurate to assume that the system cannot recover itself and needs a defender.'In any case, Si Hoon performs the protective function of the weakened system.'It must be fate that we met.' Kang Yu's eyes shone.He realized that Si Hoon was playing a much bigger role than he had anticipated.'And we have a good relationship now.'Because of his help in the last case, Si Hoon now thought of Kang Yu as a trustworthy person.If Si Hoon continues to develop the powers of his Musin spirit and become able to fulfill the role as the protector of the system, it would bring even more benefit than originally intended.'I do still feel a sense of guilt.'But he felt a little less pressure, because he realized that making the defender of the system his subordinate was a good idea.After all, no one knows what could happen in the end, with the Gaia System continuing to grow weaker everyday.In order to prepare for the uncertain future, careful preparation and preliminary research will be needed.\u2014 So this means\u2026 Si Hoon is actually a hero defending our planet? \u2014 Dae Su questioned.\u2014 Haha! That's too much. Honestly, I don't even understand it myself. Sure, I got amazing abilities when I started out, but I don't think I'm better than, for example, Chae Young-ju or Baek Kang Hyun.\u2014 But it's a special SSS class ability! Even the First Lady only started with a Class S ability! Aren't you even more amazing?(Reminder: First Lady Grace McHobbin, #1 Player worldwide)\u2014 I still haven't been able to fully harness the Musin's strength yet, so I can't use it to the fullest. Basically\u2026 I'm at about the same level as other Players with Class S special abilities right now.\u2014 Still, you're incredible! \u2014 Dae Su broke into a wide smile and patted the guy on the shoulder.Si Hoon looked down with a small smile.\u2014 Even with that ability, I almost lost to Kim Yeong Hoon. I'm not as 'incredible' as you think I am.\u2014 Hehe. Then you're just a little less incredible than our hyung, \u2014 Dae Su said lightly, smiling proudly.Kang Yu rose from his seat with a grin.\u2014 I hope you will continue to take care of our party. Call me if you need anything.\u2014 I will do my best to be useful, \u2014 Si Hoon replied firmly.Kang Yu nodded his head, satisfied.He liked that Si Hoon told them everything, accepted the past and was ready to move on quickly.\u2014 Rest until you've fully recovered.\u2014 Yes\u2026\u2014 I'll be going now. I don't want to disturb your rest.Kang Yu turned towards the exit, but as soon as he did, Si Hoon's face turned glum.\u2014 You're already leaving\u2026?\u2014 Ah? Yes, it's time.There was some surprise in Kang Yu's face. What he had just heard made it sound like Si Hoon didn't want to let him go.'I wonder what's wrong with him?'Thinking that this reaction seemed to cross over the line of just a 'good' relationship, one thought crept into his head.'It can't be.'Kang Yu, not even wanting to imagine it, shook his head.There have been many cases where tamed people or creatures began to feel sympathy for their master.They were simply instinctively attracted to the master.'Please!' A plea could be read in his gaze.He desperately hoped that this did not apply to Si Hoon.Kang Yu left the room quickly without looking back.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAfter meeting Si Hoon in the hospital that day, Kang Yu was caught in a busy schedule.He often met with Young-ju and Hwa Yeon to discuss further actions against the Teachers together, and began to fulfill his promise to Si Hoon.Along with this, he visited Kim Jae Hyun, who was in prison, several times to organize all the information he knew about the Devil's Teachers.Kim Yeong Hoon could not remember anything about being held hostage nor his last actions against Si Hoon's party.Kang Yu checked up on his 6th rank special ability many times, too, as well as the available amount of Magi and Powers that he could now use.'So tired.'He sighed, remembering everything that had happened recently.Kang Yu has been so busy that he could not remember the last time he could just lay on the bed and lounge around.'I still can't use the Power of Duplication.'With that Power, he would be able to create an exact copy of himself by endowing it with his mind.It was a Power that cost a lot of Magi, and it would be too difficult for him to use, even now after reaching Rank 6.'That aside, there is another, much more daunting problem.' Kang Yu opened his status window with a sigh.He had to figure out if he would have problems overcoming Level 59, like other Players, as well as the conditions of achieving the 'highest degree of demonic form' required for him to access his 6th rank special ability.But his everyday life flew by so quickly that he did not even have time to create an action plan to fulfill those two tasks.'Only one more thing.'Thanks to the speed with which he dealt with the other tasks, he only had one more to complete, and he should finally have some free time for himself.Han Sol walked out from her room.\u2014 Kang Yu, I finished packing my bags for the move.\u2014 And your mother?\u2014 She said she had something else to do. She'll arrive a little later, by taxi.\u2014 Hmm. \u2014 Kang Yu nodded his head.He looked around the empty room.The house where he lived with Han Sol after his return to Earth.'Apparently she needs more time.'Kang Yu has only lived in this house for about two months.But Han Sol's mother, Kim Mi Jong, has lived here for at least 20 years. So it won't be enough for her to just pack her things. She had a much deeper emotional attachment to this house.\u2014 Then, we should head out first, \u2014 Kang Yu said, getting into the car.Han Sol sat in the front seat, while Echidna climbed into the guy's lap.\u2014 Kang Yu, why is she\u2026Without saying anything, he lifted Echidna and sat her in the back seat.\u2014 You've been so cold lately\u2026 \u2014 Echidna, offended, lowered her head.Kang Yu grinned, started the car and drove in the direction of the Players' Center.As they drove, Han Sol plucked up the courage to ask him:\u2014 Is it really fine\u2026?\u2014 What are you talking about?\u2014 It's\u2026 it's you who got a new home. Is it okay for my family to live in it, too?\u2014 I told you, don't worry about it. I wouldn't enjoy living alone in a big house.\u2014 But still\u2026\u2014 Besides, I'm not paying out-of-pocket, it's all being covered by the Red Rose.\u2014 Chae Young-ju?\u2014 Yes, it's one of the conditions in our contract.\u2014 Hmm. \u2014 Han Sol clenched her fists, frustrated.An apartment of 165 square meters near Seoul Station.After the Player Control Department and the offices of major guilds opened near the station, the land there has skyrocketed in value.The 165-square-meter home they were moving into cost about $20,000.(Editor's Note: might be monthly rent, highly inflated. Assuming this is $20 000 USD, it's equal to more than 20 000 000 korean won. Let's not question the numbers like Asekhan eheh)Kang Yu was secretly jealous of Young-ju, who could so easily provide him with this kind of accommodation.'They seem to be good friends\u2026'\u00a0 Han Sol bit her lip, a feeling of disappointment welling up in heart. 'Plus, Chae Young-ju's home will be very close to ours from now on.'Imagining the two of them together overwhelmed her thoughts.\u2014 Ahh\u2026 \u2014 She let out a long breath.Thinking that she still has a long way to go compared to Young-ju, Han Sol felt as if a heavy weight had fallen on her shoulders.There was silence in the car.Echidna began to speak, shattering the silence.\u2014 Kang Yu, what are you doing tomorrow?\u2014 Tomorrow? I don't even know\u2026 \u2014 said the guy uncertainly, who, until this moment had been working while counting every minute.\u2014 Will you be busy tomorrow too? \u2014 Echidna asked gently, curious.She wanted to spend time with him, but at the same time did not want to distract him from important matters.She sounded very much like a child asking a busy father about his weekend plans.He smiled.To him, Echidna's thoughtful approach seemed very sweet.'It doesn't hurt to rest for a day.'Since his return to Earth, the days that could truly be called weekends could be counted on one hand.Thinking that he could become even more busy in the future, the idea of rest seemed like a great idea to him.\u2014 There's no business to deal with tomorrow.\u2014 Ah!! Then\u2026\u2014 You wanted to go out together, didn't you? Let's go tomorrow.\u2014 Yes, yes! I'll go anywhere with you!She immediately cheered and her face lit up.As she imagined the two of them walking together somewhere, goosebumps ran through her body. How exciting! A day with just the two of them!\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Han Sol, who was listening to them, suddenly exclaimed.The girl realized that it wasn't just Young-ju she had to worry about, but also Echidna who suddenly appeared in their lives.'I met Kang Yu before everyone else.' She felt resentful being brushed off to the sidelines.\u2014 Then\u2026 Then I'd like to go too!\u2014 Ah? Weren't you going to sort out the new house all day tomorrow? \u2014 Kang Yu was surprised by her sudden outburst.\u2014 Those things can be organized anytime! I-I want to go too! \u2014 Han Sol responded immediately.\u2014 Alright, let's all go together! \u2014 Kang Yu said joyfully, nodding his head approvingly.\u2014 Hnnng\u2026 \u2014 Echidna tightly pressed her lips together, turning her gaze to the girl who had suddenly wedged herself into their plans.She looked as if she had been served a bowl of waste at a posh restaurant.(Editor's Note: i.e. unexpected, unwanted, and overall disappointing.)\u2014 Ah\u2026ahhaa\u2026\u2014 Han Sol laughed awkwardly, feeling Echidna's burning gaze.She herself knew perfectly well that the younger girl wanted to spend time with Kang Yu alone, but, alas, there was nothing to be done.'All is fair in war.'For his sake, Han Sol was ready to become even that very waste in the bowl.(Editor's Note: Continuation of the restaurant analogy. Rather than posing as a fancy dish, she's ready to ruin Echidna/Kang Yu's time together by being the disappointing, unwanted waste in that fake scenario.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a huge shopping center.The girls, who at first looked at each other with displeasure, at some point began to have fun and smile at each other.'Their relationship is better than I thought.'Since Echidna by nature dislikes strangers, he thought that she would not be able to become friends with Han Sol.After all, even yesterday, Echidna was glaring at Han Sol from the corner of her eyes all day as they moved their belongings into their new home.But coming to the mall together, the two were chirping merrily and seemed to get along so well they could be mistaken for sisters.'Is this a girl's joy?'Kang Yu could not understand the difference in the clothes that the girls were choosing between with genuine interest.\u2014 God, look at this! Echidna, this suits you perfectly!\u2014 Do you think Kang Yu will like it\u2026?\u2014 Haha, of course!\u2014 Then I'll try it on!Han Sol wandered around the store and picked out clothes for Echidna as if she were her little sister.Perhaps even Echidna had an awakened interest in choosing clothes, as she followed Han Sol everywhere.'Well, it's good if they're enjoying it.'He believed it would be better if Echidna, who was so strongly attached to him, could become close with another person.After all, excessive attachment to someone can obviously lead to ruin.\u2014 Kang Yu, come here.\u2014 Kang Yu, does this look good on me?Kang Yu, turning in their direction, immediately saw the anxious expression on Echidna's face.She looked pretty damn cute in the plaid skirt that reached just above the knee paired with an ivory blazer.'She looks like a schoolgirl.'The clothes looked more like a uniform on her precisely because of her cute baby face.\u2014 It suits you.\u2014 Hee-hee!Hearing Kang Yu's positive response, her cheeks turned bright red and her eyes shone.She raised her radiant gaze to Han Sol.\u2014 I want this outfit.\u2014 Okay, I'll buy it.\u2014 Thank you! Han Sol, I like you!Echidna forgot her displeasure towards Han Sol with just one outfit.She smiled happily and clutched at Han Sol's collar as she hugged her, standing on tiptoes to reach.\u2014 Ah! How cute! \u2026Echidna, it's a little hard to breathe\u2026Han Sol returned Echidna's hug, resting her cheek on the back of the girl's head.Kang Yu smiled widely as he watched the girls bond.'It's good that we went out together.'He couldn't stop smiling at the sight of this scene.After paying for the clothes, they left the store, grabbing Kang Yu by the arms and dragging him to the next place.He had a flower in both hands. Truly beautiful ones, at that.He could tell he was drawing jealous glances. Kang Yu smiled like a winner and allowed himself to be dragged around by the girls.'This is life.'Before this, he'd spent all his time in Hell amidst demons and constant battle.And there, he was always afraid that he would fall asleep and never wake up because his body was suffocated in the embrace of\u00a0someone's\u00a0tentacles.But now, he thought that even if all that torment was the price for the moments he lived now, then it was not in vain.An hour has passed.\u2014 Echidna, what do you think?\u2014 It suits you!'Hmm\u2026 They seem to be getting closer and closer.'Two hours have passed.\u2014 Ohohoho~ Kang Yu, try this on!!\u2014 Kang Yu looks cool!'Hmm\u2026'Three hours have passed.\u2014 Kang Yu, Kang Yu! Let's go back down to the second floor. I liked it better there.\u2014 Oh, I'd also like to go back to where we were an hour ago.'What's going on\u2026?'Four hours have passed.\u2014 I think we'll have to go back to the very first store.\u2014 Yes, yes, I agree.'Why are they still shopping?'Even after four hours, the shopping looked no closer to ending.Kang Yu looked at the girls with a panicked expression.Walking around all the stores in the mall was not a problem. But they kept moving to other stores and going back, thinking the previous was better.'This is our fourth visit to this store.'The guy's face began to turn pale.Kang Yu was already pretty exhausted and hungry, but the girls tirelessly continued to walk here and there, looking at everything.They were so cheerful that Kang Yu wondered if they had some kind of skill that coincided with his own Power of Cheerfulness.He began to feel like their shopping was so endless it could easily be compared to a Moebius strip.(Editor's Note: like infinity. Like a moving conveyor belt. Too long to explain so search it if you're curious.)'This is life\u2026?' He couldn't help but reconsider his own words only hours ago.He wasn't physically tired of walking for hours, no, he had the stamina for that.He was mentally exhausted, watching the useless repetitive actions for hours on end.'Is this really a day off\u2026?'He'd come to the mall, hoping to get some rest before the days that followed when he would be madly busy again.But the guy felt like he wasn't resting, rather, it felt the same as just another day of fighting monsters.Just as he was about to scream, Han Sol said:\u2014 We've been walking around for a while. It's time to rest, right?\u2014 A little, you say? \u2014 Kang Yu could hardly hold back his real thoughts.\u2014 Phew, let's step away from the clothes and look at something different.This phrase sounded like a bolt from the blue.The guy's face turned even more pale.\u2014 Kang Yu, I want to eat~!\u2014 Oh, by the way. I think we missed lunch by a little bit. Why don't we go up to the food court and have a bite?\u2014 Food\u2026 court? \u2014 Kang Yu tilted his head in surprise.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksBut Han Sol was even more surprised to see such a reaction.\u2014 You don't know what a food court is?\u2014 I've never heard of it.When he was on Earth before going to Hell, not only did Kang Yu never hear about food courts, he had never even visited shopping malls.Han Sol gave him an awkward look.\u2014 Erm\u2026 it's a place where most of the restaurants are gathered in a mall. Usually there is an extensive selection of food to choose from, and the prices are not very high.'Oho~' Kang Yu's gaze brightened.Food was the most interesting thing on Earth for him.\u2014 Let's go.Emotion began to show on Kang Yu's tired face. With eyes full of expectation, he headed towards the food court.And how surprised he was when he arrived at his destination.\u2014 And all this can be ordered right here\u2026?\u2014 Yes, \u2014 she said. \u2014 All you have to do is go over there and name the number of the dish you want, and then you get a ticket.\u2014 Oh~Goosebumps ran through his body as he looked at the huge menu.'Is this paradise?'There wasn't just kimchi jjigae, but also kimchi jjigae with tuna, beef and even ham.If this place was not paradise, then what does real paradise look like?\u2014 So there were places like this in the world\u2026Kang Yu regretted learning about such an incredible place so late. He had always been preoccupied with hunting and levelling up.'I forgot about the most important thing.'He had forgotten about the reason he wanted to return to Earth in the first place.Wasn't it all for food and entertainment?He felt a thirst rise in him. He wasn't just hungry. It was a real demonic thirst, engulfing his entire body with fire.Desire gradually gained the upper hand over reason.\u2014 Kang Yu, what are we going to eat?'\u2014 All of it.\u2014 All of it?Kang Yu walked to the checkout counter and, with sincerity in his eyes, uttered:\u2014 Please give me numbers 1 to 168. Ah and 10 servings of 67, 68 and 69, please.The dishes he'd ordered 10 servings each of were, of course, varieties of kimchi jjigae.\u2014 K Kang Yu! Calm down!Han Sol ran up to Kang Yu, who was losing his sanity.\u2014 Why?\u2014 We can't eat that much.\u2014 If there are leftovers, we can take it with us.\u2014 It's going to go bad before we can even finish it.\u2014 It's fine. I'm sure I'll have time to finish before it goes bad.Kang Yu could use the Force of Decay to keep food in a good condition for a long time.Han Sol, watching the strange behavior of the guy, knocked on his head.\u2014 They have a big menu, but the taste is so-so. I can cook it better.\u00a0 And we'll take only as much as we can eat here.\u2014 Hmm, if the taste is only so-so\u2026Hearing this, his desire immediately evaporated.Kang Yu regretfully ordered only three variations of the kimchi jjigae. In fact, this was a lot for a single person, but compared with his original order, this amount seemed insignificant.\u2014 I'll eat the same as Kang Yu.With sparkling eyes, Echidna repeated her master's orders.Han Sol wanted to stop her, but looking into the girl's determined eyes, she knew she could not argue with the child.\u2014 And I'll have udon\u2026Hardly any time had passed before the signal sounded, notifying that their order was ready.The dishes that Kang Yu and Echidna had ordered could hardly fit on the table meant for four people.\u2014 Well, let's try it.With a satisfied expression, he quickly dug into the beef kimchi jjigae.\u2014 Hmm.Just like Han Sol said, this dish could not compare with her cooking.'Even so\u2026'Kang Yu's eyes shone. He was excited that he could choose.In Hell, he could only dream of such a wide variety of dishes.And now he finally had a great opportunity to make the dream from Hell come true.Kang Yu stared down at the pizza. He placed pizza on top of kimchi jjigae.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026? \u2014 Han Sol said anxiously.The guy moved on to the second dish, decorating it with a slice of pizza.And not just pizza.He seasoned the meat in sweet and sour sauce and added it to the kimchi jjigae along with chicken. Mixing it all up, he began to eat.\u2014 Oh, this isn't bad!Kang Yu's face was glowing as he gobbled up the pizza, meat and chicken broth.Echidna, tilting her head to one side, turned to Han Sol:\u2014 Is that how I'm supposed to mix it up?\u2014 No, I don't think so.\u2014 But Kang Yu did it!\u2014 That's just Kang Yu, he's\u2026'Strange.'Without finishing the phrase, Han Sol stared at Kang Yu who was happily eating kimchi jjigae.At that moment, they were approached by a man using a terrible dialect in his speech:\u2014 Ha, this eccentric guy sure knows a lot about food! Yeah, that's it! Our ancestors also said that everything should be mixed!Without even asking for permission, he sat down next to Kang Yu.Kang Yu stopped eating and slowly looked up at the guy.The man was wearing a Hawaiian shirt with a gold chain over it. His physique was far from bony, and his skin color had a healthy shine. He was probably just a little shorter than Dae Su in height.\u2014 And who are you? \u2014 Kang Yu said irritably.The corners of the man's lips twitched, and he replied,\u2014 Baek Kang Hyun of the Hanul Guild. Have you heard of me?Kang Yu frowned in an instant.Baek Kang Hyun. Most likely, there was not a single person in Korea who did not know his name.\u2014 So you're the one sponsored by Red Rose, huh? \u2014 The man chuckled coldly and continued: \u2014 I have a business proposal for you, so to speak. \u2014\u2014 A proposal?\u2014 I'll give you $50 million. And I'll equip you with exceptionally high-end equipment. A house, a car, cash \u2013 I'll give everything they offer and better. Join our guild. I'll put you in a great position.Hearing what Kang Hyun was proposing, Han Sol's mouth dropped open.But it was impossible to read any emotion on Kang Yu's face. He chuckled and leaned against the back of his chair.Kang Yu lazily continued:\u2014 It's not enough.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, what conditions will suit you?\u2014 Hmm. . . .The guy squinted as he looked at the best Player.On the outside, his expression resembled that of a lazy cat, but he was actually going through the options of what he desired.'If it's Baek Kang Hyun\u2026'A name he had heard at least a hundred times.Although this man did not qualify as a World Ranker, he was still called a monster with no equal within their country.Even Chae Young-ju was inferior to him.'I didn't think he would look like this.'Kang Yu had imagined that Baek Kang Hyun wouldn't look very human, but after meeting the man in person, he realized that his guess was nowhere close.His image of the strongest Player in Korea collapsed in an instant.'I wonder if he showed up because of the latest rumors?'It was impossible for Kang Yu to stay under the radar. He was too active in relation to the Devil's Teachers.Baek Hwa Yeon had warned him that rumors would spread one way or another, whether he liked it or not.'But who would have thought Baek Kang Hyun himself would make an offer to me personally?'It was a surprise he could not have anticipated.'That Chae Young-ju, too\u2026 Both guild leaders personally went out of their way to meet me.'Kang Yu stared at Baek Kang Hyun for a while without looking away, then said:\u2014 I'm sorry, but no matter how good your conditions are, I'm not going to join your guild.He answered without hesitation or doubt.It was true; he was more than satisfied with the current relationship he had with Red Rose and the Hwaran Squad.The most important thing for him in their relationship was their treatment of him as an equal, and the fact that there was no need to follow any orders.However, joining a guild, everything would change immediately.One way or another, he would gain a superior.'I don't want that.'No matter great the conditions laid out to him were, the guy could not accept the very idea of having to obey someone.\u2014 Haaah, what is it that you want?\u2014 Who knows. Try to guess for yourself.\u2014 Haha! Good! It's been a long time since I've met people who dare to speak like this to me!He nodded his head and smiled cheerfully.\u2014 How about an offer like this? If you join us, I will give you Legendary Elite equipment.Doubt flashed in Kang Yu's eyes for a moment.Baek Kang Hyun noticed this and chuckled.\u2014 I think you're interested in my proposal.'Hmm. . . . I can't deny it.'Legendary Elite equipment.No matter how much money a Player had, it was still hard to find Legendary level equipment.First of all, it was insanely rare.The common equipment that most Players used were manufactured by a joint force of engineers involved in the creation of modern weapons.Mana stones extracted from Gate monsters were used in its production, along with other common materials.But for the production of Legendary Elite equipment, the materials used are those obtained in Level S Gates and higher, in particular mana stones extracted from the bosses of those Gates.'It's not always possible to obtain the materials for such equipment.'In addition, this tier of equipment possessed a so-called 'memory.'When a person puts on Legendary equipment, it 'remembers' the initial user and no one else will be able to use it.Hence, because of the memory function, it was not uncommon for a Player to be unable to use the Legendary equipment even when they've found one.'This offer does sound attractive.'Although the high-end equipment he had access to was very effective, the word 'Legendary' beckoned him.'The metal chains that Chae Young-ju uses are also Legendary.'Of course, she's strong on her own, but the chains allowed her to save energy and increase her power.Moreover, it is said that there have been cases where Legendary equipment enhanced the user's skills.'But, unfortunately, it is powerless in raising Magi.'The realization of this fact became another argument in favor of refusal.After much doubt, Kang Yu shook his head firmly.\u2014 I'm not interested.Though admittedly, the offer really had been tempting.Even so, such attractive conditions could not force Kang Yu to obey anyone.\u2014 Haha. I knew you would answer that way.Baek Kang Hyun gave him a good-natured smile as he rose from his seat.\u2014 This is my number. If you change your mind anytime, call me.\u2014 Alright.\u2014 I'm sorry I interrupted your meal. Oh, and you need to add something else to your dish for better taste.Baek Kang Hyun took the plate of kkakdugi next to the udon and dumped its contents into Kang Yu's mix of kimchi jjigae.(P.p.: Kkakdugi \u2013 a kind of kimchi with the addition of sliced radish cubes)\u2014\u00a0 It will taste better this way! \u2014 Kang Hyun flashed a confident smirk\u2014 Adding kimchi to kimchi jjigae\u2026?\u2014 Heh, you don't understand anything. The spice is very different, the spice!\u2014 Well, I'll give it a try.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksKang Yu chuckled as he mixed everything in the plate and began to eat.Now the soup did not resemble kimchi jjigae at all, but it had a semblance of some kind of garbage.Han Sol, who had seen this combination for the first time, looked down at the plate doubtfully.\u2014 Kang Yu, is it delicious?\u2014 Sure.Having emptied all the ordered dishes, the guy got up from his seat.\u2014 Well, let's go?\u2014 Kang Yu, are you okay? You declined such a great offer\u2026 \u2014 Han Sol looked worried.\u2014 Do you feel regretful about the 50 million won?\u2014 Oh, no, that's not what I meant! It's not even my money. It's just\u2026 I know he doesn't look like the kind of person to do it, but\u2026 what if he decides to get revenge?\u2014 Let him, if he dares! \u2014 Kang Yu exploded into laughter. \u2014 I'll make him regret it. \u2014Yes, to the fullest extent.Walking around the mall once more, they headed to the parking lot.Han Sol was beaming from ear to ear.\u2014 Today was so much fun!\u2014 Yes, \u2014 Echidna agreed. \u2014 I was able to buy clothes that Kang Yu likes.Both girls had wide smiles on their faces, clearly satisfied with the day.\u2014 Well, that's good, \u2014 Kang Yu said with a slightly tired expression.Although he had been close to losing his mind from constantly walking in circles around the mall, he wasn't in a bad mood at all.In addition, thanks to today's trip, Han Sol and Echidna were able to become much closer with each other.\u2014 I'll bring the car, wait here.\u2014 Okay, Kang Yu.He went to his car, temporarily parting with the girls.This time, Echidna sat in the front seat.Kang Yu, already accustomed to his new car, easily pulled out of the underground parking lot.\u2014 It's such a pity. \u2014 Han Sol suddenly spoke.\u2014 Hmm?? What are you talking about?\u2014 About the Legendary Elite equipment. I noticed you hesitated.\u2014 Oh, yes, that's a pity, of course. \u2014 The guy clicked his tongue, recalling the offer/Thoughts about the Legendary equipment have not left him since lunch.\u2014 It's a good thing you were able to turn down the offer.\u2014 You think it's a good thing?\u2014 Yes. \u2014 Han Sol narrowed her eyes. \u2014 He struck me as a\u2026 disturbing man. \u2014Kang Yu thought about the guy who had sat down with them. Thinking back to it, Baek Kang Hyun's accent was pretty cute, and he seemed like a nice guy. He certainly didn't make Kang Yu feel worried.'It must be a woman's instinct.'Kang Yu thought that he should learn more about this man from Young-ju and Hwa Yeon.\u2014 Well, for me, I just didn't want to obey anyone.\u2014 I agree. I can't imagine you following someone's orders.\u2014 Kang Yu shouldn't have to listen to orders, \u2014 Echidna piped in, sounding displeased as she clutched at his shirt.She idolized Kang Yu and did not even want to imagine him following someone else's decrees.\u2014 Don't worry. That won't happen. \u2014 Kang Yu tightened his grip on the steering wheel.There was silence in the car. Most likely, Han Sol and Echidna were too tired to keep talking, after a whole day of wandering around the mall.'Legendary Elite equipment\u2026'The silence felt heavy, and Kang Yu remembered the recently received offer again.'It is doubly a pity to miss something that was so close.'Kang Yu even thought about asking Young-ju for such equipment, but he himself was aware of how valuable it was.Even Young-ju could hardly find it.At that moment, a melody sounded from his phone.\u2014 Hmm?Kang Yu slipped the phone into a holder on the dashboard, and put an earpiece in his ear.\u2014 Hello?\u2014 It's Baek Hwa Yeon. Can you talk?\u2014 I'm driving\u2026 What is it?\u2014 Can you come to Hwaran's main office right now?\u2014 Now?If it's the main building, he'd have to go all the way to the Level S Gate in Suwon.It wasn't far from Seoul Station, but it wasn't exactly close either.\u2014 Yes, it won't take long! \u2014 The girl said excitedly.Kang Yu cocked his head to one side.\u2014 Did something happen?\u2014 The government award has been prepared for you. You can get it at the main branch, so it would be nice if you came right now.\u2014 Oho~So this was about the reward Hwa Yeon had promised.\u2014 What's the reward? \u2014 he asked.\u2014 You're going to ask me after how much effort I put into getting something like this?The girl spoke a little differently than usual.Kang Yu became even more interested, hearing her speak like that.\u2014 I just want to know if it's worth it.\u2014 Hahaha! You're going to love it. For all the service you've done, you will be presented with Legendary Elite equipment which has been stored at Mir Guild all this time.Kang Yu's eyes sparkled.The same Legendary Elite equipment that has been haunting him for the last few hours.All his regrets disappeared in an instant.Kang Yu smiled broadly.'As expected, the important thing is to live as a person should.'(Editor's Note: He means living the way he wants \u2013 not having to submit to others. And\u00a0maybe\u00a0he also means not betraying Red Rose, who sponsored him first.)He felt as if he had finally received the answer he had been looking for after a long, long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It won't take long.After taking Echidna and Han Sol back to their new home, Kang Yu intended to head straight for Suwon.But when they arrived, they found Young-ju waiting for them near their house.\u2014 I got a call from Hwa Yeon. You're going to the main branch, aren't you? I also have business there, so let's go together.She opened the car door to sit in the front seat.\u2014 You are\u2026 \u2014 Han Sol was surprised to see the Red Rose guild leader outside their house.\u2014 Ah, you girls. Could it be\u2026 you're living with Kang Yu?\u2014 Y-yes. We live together.Young-ju narrowed her eyes.Moving her gaze to Kang Yu and then to Han Sol, she gently said:\u2014 Isn't it hard for you to live with this weirdo? If you want, we can find you another apartment in this area.\u2014 It's okay. I like living with Kang Yu. \u2014 Han Sol firmly rejected the offer.\u2014 Seriously\u2026?Young-ju looked away in disappointment.She sat down in the passenger seat next to Kang Yu with a cold chuckle.\u2014 I really don't understand how she can like anything about you.\u2014 Then maybe you should go in your own car, and not with 'this weirdo?' \u2014 Kang Yu retaliated.\u2014 I'm not in the mood to drive today.Getting comfortable in her seat, the girl gracefully crossed her legs.\u2014 Go.\u2014 Am I your driver now or what?\u2014 Can you return the car then?\u2014 I'll get to Suwon quickly and safely.Kang Yu raised one hand and waved to Han Sol and Echidna.The girls gazed discontentedly at the retreating car with Young-ju in it.Slightly releasing the gas pedal, Kang Yu said:\u2014 I had a question to ask, so it's great that we met.\u2014 A question?\u2014 Yes.Kang Yu thought about the extravagant guy he'd met at the mall.\u2014 I ran into Baek Kang Hyun today.\u2014 Wha\u2026 what? Where?\u2014 In the mall. But I don't think it was a chance meeting. He went there on purpose.\u2014 What did he do? \u2014 Young-ju asked, squinting.Her voice betrayed her slight anxiety.Noticing this, the guy chuckled.\u2014 What do you think?\u2014 Don't joke like that. \u2014 She glared at Kang Yu with anger.He shrugged his shoulders and continued:\u2014 He made an offer to join their guild.\u2014 Ah\u2026 what were the conditions?\u2014 50 million won, an expensive house, car, and a good position in the guild. And also\u2026 Legendary Elite equipment.'He's a lunatic.' Her eyes widened.He certainly had to be crazy, offering such conditions.Chae Young-ju sometimes wondered if she was overdoing it with funding, but Baek Kang Hyun crossed all boundaries of reason.'Hmm\u2026' She bit her lip, annoyed.She believed that no one could refuse such conditions, including Kang Yu.\u2014 And\u2026 and when are you joining their guild?\u2014 Ah? What do you mean, 'when are you joining?'\u2014 Don't tell me that you\u2026 you refused?\u2014 I don't exactly intend to obey anyone.\u2014 Ha!She looked exhausted.In their first meeting, she herself could feel that Kang Yu was not the kind of person who would obey orders.But she could not have imagined that the guy would go as far as to refuse such a transcendental offer.'You're definitely weird.' She looked away from Kang Yu.The window that Young-ju was looking through reflected her slight smile.\u2014 So, do you know anything about Baek Kang Hyun? \u2014 he asked.\u2014 Well, we've met a few times.\u2014 What do you think of him?\u2014 Most likely the same as what you thought. He is so simple that it's hard to believe that such a Player is at the top of Korea.\u2014 Hmmm. That's exactly why he's interesting. And what do people say about him behind his back?'If you're thinking about rumors\u2026' Young-ju thought for a moment. \u2014\u00a0 I heard he lost his temper once. \u2014\u2014 Lost his temper?\u2014 Yes. Like the moment when the Commission told him he didn't qualify to be a World Ranker. At that time, everyone thought he had it in the bag and that he would definitely pass.\u2014 Hmm\u2026\u2014 Anything can happen. He didn't expect himself to fail.\u2014 How did he fail?\u2014 Well, among the participants, there was one Japanese \u2013 Fujimoto Ryoma. That's who he lost to. And what happened next is pretty stupid.Fujimoto Ryoma.He was famous for possessing legendary high-grade weapons.She continued to explain:\u2014 Since the relations between Japan and Korea are not very good, this failure\u2026 sparked a flurry of criticism. There were rumors that Baek Kang Hyun deliberately lost to humiliate his homeland, and that he was a traitor.\u2014 No wonder he got angry. It's only natural.It would be strange if he did not react to the criticism against him.\u2014 If you were in his place\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 I would find anyone who dared to leave such comments and break their hands.Hearing this, she was hardly surprised.\u2014 Does he have any other skeletons in the closet? \u2014 Kang Yu continued to probe about the eccentric man.\u2014 Why are you asking? Did he say something to you?\u2014 No, I'm just asking in case, to know whether or not he will take revenge on me for refusing his proposal.The girl chuckled.\u2014 He's not like that. If he smiles, he means it. That man definitely does not feign smiles.(Editor's Note: In other words, Baek Kang Hyun doesn't put on a front. Anyway check novelupdates to be up to date with chapter releases.)Kang Yu nodded, feeling like he heard everything he wanted to learn, and pressed harder on the gas pedal.\u2014 Oh, you're here. I've been waiting for you.Arriving at Hwaran's main office, they met Hwa Yeon by the entrance. Kang Yu nodded in greeting and came closer.\u2014 You shouldn't have waited outside, I could have called to let you know when I'm here.\u2014 The atmosphere inside is overwhelming, \u2014 she said, turning and heading to the entrance. \u2014 Come on. I'll show you the reward. \u2014\u2014 The Legendary Elite equipment?\u2014 That's right. We looked through the Mir Guild's belongings and found equipment that hadn't been used before.\u2014 I'm guessing it wasn't easy.\u2014 That's an understatement. You have no idea how many of the higher-ups were against it.Hwa Yeon shook her head, as if trying to forget those memories.\u2014 Well, they are deputies.\u2014 Yeah, and it was really difficult to find common ground with them.Hwa Yeon escorted Kang Yu to the special vault containing the Legendary equipment.As soon as they passed through the thick metal door, a long black coat came into view.The design of the coat looked so simple that by its appearance you wouldn't be able to tell that it's Legendary equipment.\u2014 Is this it? \u2014 Young-ju came closer, her eyes shining with interest.Kang Yu followed her and turned his attention to the sign with information on the object.[\u00a0Equipment Information\u00a0][ Name: Black Pearl CoatType: LegendaryBinds to the user once equipped.Effects: +660 resistance to physical attacks, +480 resistance to magic damage, +5 to unique statsUse: Summons Kraken's Wrath, doubling bonus stats for 1 minute. Can only be used once every 24 hours.Description: This coat is crafted using baked blood from the Kraken's heart. ]\u2014 Huh\u2026 This isn't as good as I expected.Young-ju clicked her tongue after reading the information.Now she understood why Mir did not use this coat, and left it in storage.\u2014 But it does raise unique stats quite well.It is almost impossible to find equipment that enhances unique stats by 5 units.Usually, this number did not exceed 3-4 units.The higher the stats became, the stronger the Player became and the more difficult it was to increase them.In the beginning, it was easy to increase the stats by 1-2 units, but as soon as 40 units were reached, the increase became devilishly long and difficult.Most Players, once risen to a high level, could only advance by receiving bonuses.This means that at some point, Players simply stop increasing their stats at the expense of their strength.And if, in such a situation, each of the constant stats could be increased by 5 units, it could be assumed that the Player's level essentially rises by as much as 4-5 units as well.And considering that it is more and more difficult to increase stats with each level, it's clear that this effect is a very useful bonus.(Editor's Note: Author gave a long-winded explanation but it's really just that even +1 unit once your stats are high is crazy strong, and it becomes hard to level up your stats eventually so Players get bonuses or equipment to increase their stats.)\u2014 Only, now, there are practically no Players with unique stats.That was the problem.There have always been few Players with such abilities.As a result, if the Player does not have unique stats, the whole essence of this Legendary coat is lost.\u2014 The physical and magical resistance is not as good as we would like it to be. \u2014 Hwa Yeon appeared apologetic.The red-haired girl nodded in agreement.\u2014 Yes, it's a bit of a pity.Young-ju, intending to comfort the probably upset Kang Yu, turned her head in his direction.\u2014 Ah\u2026?But when she saw his smiling face, she tilted her to the side.Doubting her eyes for a second, an incredible thought crept into her head.\u2014 No way\u2026do you have unique stats?\u2014 That's right.Her mouth fell open in surprise. The most 'rare' person she'd ever met was the very one standing in front of her, Oh Kang Yu.'Come to think of it, it's not that strange.'The speed of his development as a Player was simply incredible. If he was one of those few Players who possessed unique stats, then his speed was understandable.Hwa Yeon's eyes lit up.\u2014 That changes everything. In that case\u2026 this is probably the best equipment you could get.'Great.' Kang Yu nodded his head in satisfaction.His unique stat was Magi.'My Magi will rise by as much as 5 units.'In addition, every 24 hours, he could increase his bonus stats by double their units.This means that his bonus Magi will be as much as 10 units.'Even for killing Orias, I only got 3 units of Magi.'This equipment could give him many times more Magi than for killing a demon from the Seventh Thousandth Circle of Hell.Turning around, he extended his hand to Hwa Yeon.\u2014 Thanks for the excellent equipment. From now on, I will put even more effort into fulfilling our common goal of capturing the Devil's Teachers.\u2014 Hahaha! I really could not have thought that you'd have unique stats. This can only be fate. I'm looking forward to our continued cooperation. \u2014 The girl smiled broadly as she shook his hand.\u2014 Freeze! Get away from this equipment!At that moment, four people entered the room: a well-dressed elderly man and a convoy of three.\u2014 Deputy\u2026?\u2014 A petition was submitted and approved by the Members of Parliament. This equipment will be sent to the state treasury.The formally dressed elderly man, Hong Jun Tae, chuckled, pleased that things were going his way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(2/10)Editor: CherishHong Jun Tae.A member of the 'We Are United' party, endowed with great power.(Editor's Note: A political party, not a Player party. Its name may have been based off South Korea's United Future party, but altered slightly so as to avoid involving actual politics.)Hwa Yeon winced at his sudden appearance.\u2014 What kind of petition? \u2026What are you talking about?\u2014 It's exactly what you heard. The members of our party have created a petition that has just been approved. No one has the right to give this Legendary equipment to anyone.\u2014 The Hwaran Squad got it during the proceedings. The acceptance certificate is held by Commander Jang Hyun Jae, who approved the transfer of equipment to Player Oh Kang Yu.\u2014 Ugh! How can you reward a person who recently became a Player in this manner!? No matter how you look at it, Hwa Yeon, you\u2026 did you arrange all this in order to keep the gear for yourself? \u2014 He looked at the girl with obvious suspicion.Her expression immediately turned serious.\u2014 What are you implying?\u2014 All of you young and greedy folks do things like this. You've been entrusted with the 3rd Division and yet you dare to ignore orders? Do you even know how valuable this equipment is?!\u2014 And I have told you many times that he has done things worthy of this reward!\u2014 How dare you raise your voice at the elderly!? \u2014 The man shouted in anger. \u2014 No matter what you say, the decision has been made. The President personally instructed me to deal with everything. \u2014Although Hwaran was a government unit, they had the right to self-organization and self-government.Nevertheless, no matter how independent the unit was, they could not oppose the president.Hong Jun Tae inspected the room and fixed his gaze on the coat.Invaluable Legendary Elite equipment.His eyes were instantly filled with greed. Looking away from the coat, he muttered in displeasure:\u2014 It is precisely because you have wind in your head that you disgraced such a wonderful man like Kim Jae Hyun\u2026(Editor's Note: Kinda calling her an airhead, saying she doesn't have a brain to think with.)\u2014 But he is guilty of kidnapping Players and sacrificing them!\u2014 The public will never have to know that! And what if you fabricated evidence?\u2014 Mr. Hong!!The man, not wanting to listen to anything, waved them off with his hand.\u2014 Anyway, we've started a background check on this case, so pray you haven't missed anything.He specially emphasized on the word 'you.'Listening to them, Kang Yu chuckled.'So he's under Kim Jae Hyun.'It was all too easy to guess why the man was behaving this way.Kang Yu could sense the case smelled of bullshit.Hong Jun Tae, who had been studying the room, approached Kang Yu.\u2014 Are you the one the Red Rose is sponsoring? Do not suffer from your own desires. If you're a beginner, then sit and keep your head down, as befits a beginner. Got it? \u2014 Raising his hand, he lightly patted Kang Yu on the cheek mockingly.'Ha.' Kang Yu let out a chuckle, realizing that the man was overstepping his boundaries.Kang Yu could not ignore this attitude towards him.'Only malice can respond to malice.'After ten thousand long years in Hell, he realized that this was the only way to survive.In a low whisper, he said:\u2014 You talk too much, you bastard.\u2014 What\u2026?\u2014 How old are you? How can an adequate adult person slap another on the cheek?Hong Jun Tae just stared at the guy stupidly, not knowing how to answer.No matter how you look at it, Kang Yu was only warming up to his second decade, and he was already making comments about age.\u2014 This lunatic is going crazy\u2026\u2014 Crazy? Are you calling me crazy? You don't have any decency at all. Why didn't the adults teach you this, huh? What were they doing to make you grow up so shameless?\u2014 Hah!?Kang Yu patted the man on the cheek.Although Kang Yu had touched him quite lightly, the strength of the Player made itself felt.As soon as he released his cheek, the man grabbed his face and stepped back.\u2014 What a psycho!The deputy's face turned red with fury. He clutched at his face and shouted at the convoy:\u2014 What are you standing around for? Kill him!Assault was the favorite method of the deputies.Although they can not really kill a person, to cripple is really easy.The powerful men lined up behind him rushed forward.Each of them, as it turned out, possessed a weapon.'They've all had special training.'Of course, such work could never be entrusted to ordinary people, and each of them had to have serious strength.'If they work for the government, they certainly must have Rank 6 or higher.'Even so, to Kang Yu, they looked like children playing in a sandbox.\u2014 Ha! \u2014 The man at the head of the group rushed at Kang Yu.His weapon was a metal gauntlet. The gauntlet, completely covered with spikes from his hand to his elbow, flew to the guy.\u2014 Ah?Kang Yu lightly lunged forward and caught his fist like he was catching a baseball. His opponent frowned, putting in even more effort.\u2014 This\u2026 what is this?His fist could not move. He felt as if his hand was being squeezed by a large metal vise. Kang Yu gripped the man's fist even harder and brought the enemy to his knees.\u2014 ah!The man bent over and blood flowed from his mouth in a stream. His eyes dimmed, and he lost consciousness.\u2014 Wh\u2026 how could this be\u2026? \u2014 The deputy's face turned pale.Each member of his convoy was a high-class Player of the 7th rank.If Kang Yu was indeed a two-month old rookie, there was no way he could withstand such opponents.\u2014 Should I help? \u2014 Young-ju casually called to Kang Yu.\u2014 No, I just wanted to warm up.Unlike the frightened Hong Jun Tae, Young-ju behaved as usual.As if she knew how everything would turn out in the end.\u2014 You\u2026 what are you doing?! He's a member of the Red Rose Guild, isn't he? Get him away from me! If you don't, then what happened to Kim Jae Hyun will take down the Red Rose too!\u2014 Oh, I'm sorry, but Kang Yu doesn't belong to our guild. I don't have the right to order him.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksSmiling, the girl raised her hands up like she was surrendering.\u2014 Wha\u2026 what? How?\u2014 Waaah! \u2014 His men continued to scream.Before the deputy could come to his senses, the fight was practically over.Kang Yu, using the Power of a Thousand, easily stopped the men rushing at him.He threw them back and they, hitting the stone walls of the room, cried out and lost consciousness.'I didn't even have time to warm up.' Kang Yu clicked his tongue in frustration.He slowly walked towards Hong Jun Tae, who backed up and tripped over his feet.\u2014 Huh? Don't\u2026 don't come any closer!\u2014 Heh\u2026 And you say the young people are greedy\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu squatted down in front of the fallen deputy and looked into his eyes. \u2014 You want to tell me how to live my youth, huh? I've worked my whole youth in good faith! I lived believing in justice. \u2014The man's expression was twisted.\u2014 But look at the young people today\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu continued. \u2014 My heart hurts, my heart! \u2014\u2014 Ah\u2026 you! Are you making fun of me!?\u2014 Are you kidding me? Do you think I'm making fun of you? As an adult who has brought you benefit, I'm kindly giving you advice.\u2014 Oh, you son of a\u2026 \u2014 Hong Jun Tae shook with anger.He was infuriated that Kang Yu was talking to him like an immature youngster.\u2014 This year, I will turn sixty, you bastard! Sixty!!!\u2014 Sixty? \u2014 Kang Yu chuckled. \u2014 I thought that the milk on your lips hadn't dried yet, but it turns out that you yourself are pouring. \u2014(Editor's Note: In case you didn't get it\u2026 he's implying the man still drinks baby milk, and is surprised he's old enough to pour the milk for himself.)\u2014 Ah\u2026 rahhh!! \u2014 The man, overflowing with anger from head to toe, swung his fist at the guy.But since he wasn't even a Player, of course his shot could not harm Kang Yu in the slightest.\u2014 ah!On the contrary, he hurt himself trying to strike.The bones of his arm likely broke, and it was from this that he grabbed his fist with his other hand and began to cry.\u2014 Does it hurt? \u2014 Kang Yu asked mockingly.The man just sobbed incessantly.\u2014 It's because you're too young, brat. I promise this pain will help you get stronger.The deputy wandered back and forth, not knowing whether to soothe the pain in his hand first or continue to be angry.\u2014 Haha. So what are we going to do in the end? \u2014 Young-ju approached them. \u2014 You do realize that things won't be the same anymore? \u2014Kang Yu had touched a Member of Parliament.This was different from Kim Jae Hyun, and the consequences could be completely unpredictable.\u2014 It's okay. Every problem has its own ways of solving it.\u2014 Are you going to erase his memory, like with Kim Yeong Hoon?\u2014 That is also an option, but it won't help to solve the problem.\u2014 In that case, what are you going to do?Kang Yu smiled.\u2014 I am going to do my best for the bright future of the Republic of Korea.\u2014 No, really\u2026 what are you going to do?\u2014 You'll know when you see it.Kang Yu put his hand on the man's head. The released Man Ma Jung flowed from his hand.As Kang Yu began using the Force of Torment, his expression became more serious.\u2014 Kh! Wha\u2026 what are you\u2026After Kang Yu removed his hand, the man grabbed his head in a panic and groped at it from all sides.'But nothing has changed.' Young-ju frowned, looking down at the deputy.\u2014 What did you get from Kim Jae Hyun? \u2014 Kang Yu calmly asked.\u2014 Six years ago, I started taking more than 20 million won in bribes annually\u2026 ah! Wha\u2026 what did I just say?! \u2014 The deputy covered his mouth with his palm, his eyes bulged out in surprise.But the words continued to fly out of his mouth.\u2014 And not so long ago I received 13 million for helping large businesses in tax evasion. And also\u2026 \u2014 He continued to expose his own dirty deeds.If any of this was leaked to the media, his career as a politician would be over.\u2014 This\u2026\u2014 I made it so that from now on he will speak only the truth.Kang Yu looked down at Hong Jun Tae, who continued to talk about his dirty business.Now that he could not hide behind a mask of lies, his essence was revealed.\u2014 Oh, none of this is true! None, I say!!! \u2014 The man ran out of the room with a pale face.Young-just looked stunned as she watched the quickly fleeing deputy.\u2014 Can't he just shut his mouth?\u2014 No, I don't think so. I made sure he couldn't resist talking about himself.\u2014 Why would you do that? \u2014\u00a0 Young-ju asked uncomprehendingly.In Kang Yu's case, he had a tremendous amount of ability to make sure that the petition could simply be cancelled.\u2014 What will happen if the President of the Parliament starts knocking? Of course, the heinous deeds of large organizations and guilds will begin to surface. If this happens, it will be a good lesson for other individuals who want to get away with bribery.It wasn't just a bomb.Such an action would wreak havoc throughout the entire political sphere.Young-ju fell silent.\u2014 What?\u2014 Just\u2026 this is\u2026 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu. Do you think\u00a0all\u00a0the dirty deeds will really come up?\u2014 Of course. \u2014 The guy nodded his head confidently.The girl looked away.\u2014 Right\u2026 well, you know\u2026 this is also going to\u2026 hurt me.\u2014 What?\u2014 Well\u2026 the information I've been collecting about you\u2026 And the fact that a Player who has not reached Rank 7 has a pass to the Level S Gate\u2026 And\u2026 Echidna, right? Her fake ID\u2026Kang Yu pressed his lips together.It was like a notice with the words 'TEAMKILL' immediately surfaced in his head.(Editor's Note: Not an actual Player notification.)The guy turned towards the door where Hong Jun Tae had just run out.The bright future of Korea?Kang Yu realized that he had been acting truly selfish.\u2014 We must catch him again!And also the fact that a 'bright future' does not suit him at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(3/10)Editor: CherishNow, the goal of catching Hong Jun Tae was not the cloudless future of Korea.(Editor's Note: His goal is no longer making Jun Tae expose his crimes and making Korea better.)Kang Yu cancelled the effect of the Power used earlier and allowed the man to keep as many dirty secrets as possible. Taking a deep breath and calming down, he entered the storage room for special items.He was immediately approached by Young-ju.\u2014 Well, how did it go?\u2014 I told him to report that his opinion against me was biased. And, of course, I denied him from revealing everything.\u2014 Phew! Thank God.\u2014 All the lousy actions of the country were almost exposed\u2026The two people in this room were, one might say, glad it didn't leak out.\u2014 What? \u2014 Young-ju questioned Hwa Yeon's staring.\u2014 N\u2026 no, nothing. \u2014 The girl frowned and rubbed her forehead.She did not know whether it was simply worth loving life as it is, or whether it would be more correct to repent for all sins.'The world is not as simple as it seems.'She, being a star, a girl who leads a military unit, just had to get used to this.\u2014 Well, that problem has been solved, now you can try on the equipment.Kang Yu took the Black Pearl coat into his hands with anticipation in his eyes.As soon as he put on the coat, a couple of notifications arrived.[You have equipped Legendary Elite gear.][The process of unity with the Black Pearl coat has begun.]He could only rejoice at such notifications.The coat began to radiate an incomprehensible magical power.The bright blue light emanating from his coat began to shine into his body.[The unity process has been successfully completed.][Oh Kang Yu is now installed as the Black Pearl coat owner.][Magi increases by 5 units.]Along with the pop-up notifications, the guy also felt the changes take place in his body.In an instant, his Magi increased from 83 to 88.The surge of strength that came out of nowhere spread pleasantly through his body.He did not fully understand how the system of stats works.'Amazing.' Kang Yu thought, looking down at his coat.But there was one thing he understood for sure \u2013 after he'd reached 80 units of Magi, each increase of Magi could clearly be felt and gave him a large amount of strength.'And if there is also the ability to double the bonus\u2026'Though only for a moment, he could increase the number of Magi to as much as 93 units.He broke into a satisfied smile.'Speaking of Legendary gear, I didn't think I'd be able to boost Magi with it.'It would not be an exaggeration at all to call this 'fate.'Kang Yu opened the status window without taking off his new coat.[Status Window]Player Name: Oh Kang Yu[ Level: 54Rank: 6Special skills are currently sealed.Special Ability Rank 1: The Power of the Devourer (Class: ???)Special Ability Rank 2: Overwhelming Hunger (Class: C)Special Ability Rank 3: Thirst for Maryok (Class: A)Special Ability Rank 4: Master of Magi (Class: A)Special Ability Rank 5: Master of Hell's Creatures (Class: S)Special Ability Rank 6: ???

A single Player can use no more than five equipment at a time.\u2014 Only five?\u2014 Yes. You know how the Maryok in the gear interacts with the Player's body? So, if the Player decides to use more than five at a time, then there will be no effect.\u2014 Who decided that? \u2014 Kang Yu was a little upset, but nodded his head in understanding.He'd been planning to look for other equipment in his spare time, but now this plan needed to be reworked.'But at least five can be used.'Still, it would be quite difficult to find other Legendary outfits that enhance the unique Player stats.\u2014 Well, do you like it?\u2014 Very much! \u2014 Kang Yu replied without hesitation. \u2014 I even want to test how much stronger I became. \u2014'Hmm.' Young-ju reluctantly made an offer:Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Do you want to try to fight me in the training room?\u2014 Training room?\u2014 Yes, the one in Hwaran's main branch is quite spacious. Hwa Yeon, do you think we can use it?\u2014 Sure.\u2014 Okay, thank you. \u2014 Young-ju turned to Kang Yu again.\u2014 Well, do you want to try?\u2014 I have no reason to refuse.Young-ju was one of those at the top of the country.She was a great opponent to test how much stronger he has become after reaching Rank 6 and equipping Legendary gear.'Moreover, I wanted to see for myself just how strong Young-ju is.'He and Young-ju were on friendly terms.That was precisely why it was important for him to know what power his ally possesses and what role she can play in the future.It wasn't just Kang Yu thinking this way.Young-ju squinted as she observed the guy.'I wonder how strong he is now?'After all, even when she met him for the first time, she thought that the guy had the potential to become much stronger than herself.Even so, she could not have imagined that he would develop so quickly.The rate of his levelling was much higher than that of all Players ever recorded.In fact, even the World Ranker in 1st place, Grace McHobbin, did not develop so quickly.'It's not just speed.'She learned that after dealing with Orias, Kang Yu reached Level 50 and Rank 6.Rank 6 in two months is, of course, surprising in itself, but that wasn't even the problem.'With only 3rd rank, he was able to defeat Moon Yeon Ho.'The Player named Oh Kang Yu was amazing, not only because of his level up speed.She didn't hesitate to use the word 'amazing' because, when comparing his level to his strength, his strength was far ahead.After all, at 3rd rank he'd defeated a Player who'd almost attained 7th rank.Comparing them by stats, Kang Yu was like an elementary school student while Moon Yeon Ho was an adult man \u2013 so much was the difference in their stats.No matter what high-class special abilities a Player may have, he still would not be able to bridge a gap of such scales.'But Kang Yu was superior to Moon Yeon Ho.'That's what was alarming.How could an\u00a0 'adult' not defeat the 'child' in hand-to-hand combat?He certainly had some other strength separate from his level and stats.'Now that the opportunity presents itself, I need to find out what he's capable of.'The girl hardly knew much about Kang Yu.So she thought that if they were going to work together in the future, it would be nice to learn more about her partner.\u2014 Shall we start right away?\u2014 Yes, \u2014 the guy replied rather contentedly.Heading into the training room, the girl lightly clenched her fists.'I'm not going to give up easily.'She knew perfectly well that he was already at the level of other Players at the top of the nation.Be that as it may, she couldn't afford to lose easily.Young-ju herself was one of the strongest Players at the top of the rankings.Except, it didn't Kang Yu long to convince her otherwise.Dozens of metal chains covered the floor. Created from a special alloy, they, with spikes radiating Maryok, covered the entire hall.The chains rotated from side to side.And from the outside they looked like a flock of writhing snakes.They created a deadly grid from which it was impossible to break free.In the moments when the 'snakes' wriggled, Kang Yu managed to set foot on where the floor was still safe.Using the Power of Fluency, his movements were faster than that of an ordinary human. He was moving at the speed of sound.It was in this position that the chains tried to grab him.Then, using the Power of Heaven, he defied the laws of physics and climbed up at a right angle.The remaining chains below lost sight of him.With the Power of Detonation, the chains on the floor flew to the sides and he sank to the floor.Chains immediately swooped down on him from all sides, piercing his skin with sharp thorns.But he hardly cared.Kang Yu quickly ripped open the mesh made from the chains.\u2014 Kh! \u2014\u00a0 A brief exclamation.Young-ju crossed her arms and tugged at her chains. The chains that had been scattered all over the floor fell into a heap right in front of her.The guy spread his arms wide and clapped. With a touch of his hands, there was a powerful rumbling.\u2014 W-aah! \u2014 In an instant, Young-ju stopped hearing anything.Grasping at her ears, she shivered. Trying to concentrate, she created a shield from the chains.'Power of Rising Strike, Power of a Thousand.' Kang Yu raised his right fist, which began to be shrouded in black energy.It gathered and began to take shape.It began to seem like his fist was expanding tenfold.He pulled back the right side of his body and, bending enough, threw his fist forward.'Heavenly Rift.'Kang Yu switched techniques.Two simultaneous forces enveloped his fist.\u2014 Aaah!Young-ju was thrown against the wall.The wide wall, about a meter deep, crumbled as if it were made of paper, and the entire room trembled from the force.\u2014 A\u2026h\u2026Strength left the girl's body, and she rolled down the wall to the floor.She stared up at Kang Yu with horror.Didn't she plan to not lose so easily?To not give up?Nonsense.'This one's a monster\u2026' Young-ju muttered softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(4/10)Editor: Cherish[Kraken's Wrath has expired.][You may reuse this skill after 24 hours.]'Wow.' Kang Yu looked radiantly at the Black Pearl coat.As expected, the Kraken's Wrath was effective.Although this feature was limited to only a minute, thanks to the increase of Magi to 93 units, Kang Yu was able to surpass Young-ju in strength.'The higher the stats, the more powerful the effect will be.'If Kang Yu continues to develop, then with the help of the coat, he will become even stronger.Kang Yu understood exactly why high-class Players dream of Legendary gear.The higher the level of the Player, the better the effect of its use.'But Young-ju is also amazing.'If he did not possess Legendary equipment, he could not have gained the upper hand with such ease.Now, having fought with her personally, the guy had a good idea of her strength.'It feels like she's hiding something.'But that was just a hunch.At the last moment when Kang Yu had used the Heavenly Rift technique, it felt like she was about to do something, but in the end did not.It was likely she stopped because she noticed Kang Yu's next move.He held out his hand to Young-ju, who was sitting on the floor. She grabbed it and stood up.\u2014 What a monster, \u2014 mumbled the pale Young-ju.Kang Yu shrugged.\u2014 It's all thanks to the equipment.\u2014 So? I also have Legendary equipment. \u2014 The girl pointed to the bracelet hanging on her wrist. \u2014 Are you really human? \u2014\u2014 What? Can't believe I learned all this in two months?\u2014 What do you think? Oh, my head hurts\u2026 \u2014 The girl rubbed her forehead.\u2014 Well, in the end, it's not a bad thing, is it? I'm at least as good as you.\u2014 But you aren't exactly reliable either\u2026Taking a breath, she turned away from Kang Yu.They both looked in the same direction and met the gaze of a pale and shaking Baek Hwa Yeon.It was clear from her face that she was not only surprised by the outcome of the battle.Hwa Yeon's horrified look was aimed at the huge dent in the metal wall of the training room.\u2014 This\u2026 this is\u2026\u2014 Hmm?\u2014 Do you have any idea how much this room costs? Hundreds of millions have been invested in it! How could you tear it up like that?!Kang Yu turned his gaze to the wall, where he had punched with his fist using the Heavenly Rift technique.It was so curved that it could no longer be called a wall.The rest of the hall was also destroyed beyond recognition.\u2014 Oh\u2026 uh\u2026 well\u2026It was a rare moment where Kang Yu was at a loss for words.In fact, he could have done without using the Heavenly Rift.And Young-ju, being an adult, would have understood how strong he was just by seeing his fist.But at that moment, greed awakened in Kang Yu \u2013 he wanted to personally experience all the strength gained from the coat.Of course, now he was ashamed that he could not restrain himself and destroyed such an expensive room, but there was nothing to be done about it.\u2014 It wasn't me, \u2014 Young-ju quickly replied, looking away.Wearing a serious expression, she tried to defend her innocence.\u2014 In terms of what? You did damage too.\u2014 Are you talking about the scratches on the floor because of my chains\u2026?\u2014 That's also damage.\u2014 Um\u2026 then I will also pay for the repairs. \u2014 She nodded obediently.\u2014 Out of good conscience, I think we should pay for the repairs 50/50, \u2014 Kang Yu spoke up.\u2014 Conscience? Do you even know what that is? You must be kidding me.A harsh answer.The girl's words stung Kang Yu and he winced. But if he backs down now, he wouldn't look cool at all.\u2014 The only reason I hit so hard is because of how strong you are. I couldn't hit any weaker than that.\u2014 Hey, even so\u2026\u2014 If you had fallen earlier from my lighter blows, this would not have happened in the first place.A paradox disguised as logic.\u2014 Are you saying that the dent in the wall is\u00a0my\u00a0fault?Kang Yu nodded his head without a doubt.\u2014 I was too afraid of your attacks, and I had no choice but to do so.\u2014 No, but that last blow was unnecessary\u2026She was right. The last attack was unnecessary.\u2014 What are you talking about? You know perfectly well how hard it is to stop yourself when your whole body is overflowing with energy.He spoke with conviction.He didn't even need to lie. And it was reflected on his face.\u2014 As you know, I became a Player only two months ago. Thanks to luck and talent, I was able to gain great strength, but I have not yet learned how to fully control it.Well, that was a lie.The man, capable of subjugating Man Ma Jung, was almost certainly able to control his Player powers.\u2014 Khh! \u2014 Young-ju was shaking with frustration.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksShe had a feeling the guy was lying, but she had nothing to say in retaliation.Because for a Player who rose to Rank 6 in two months, control indeed could pose a serious problem.\u2014 Oh, you\u2026! \u2014 There were many things she wanted to scream at him.Kang Yu only smiled.\u2014 So, in that case, let's split half and half on repairs. After all, this is both your fault and mine.'How can a man be so insolent?' Young-ju narrowed her eyes, glaring at Kang Yu.She let out a heavy sigh. A training room built from high quality material.The repairs would cost at least ten million. If she could use money from the guild, then there would be no problem. But the situation now was different.'I can't spend guild money on something like this.'Even if she was the Commander of one of Korea's largest guilds, she could not spend money on personal problems.\u2014 I have a good idea, \u2014 Kang Yu said.In fact, this idea had appeared during their battle. Of course, it was not intended to be used to pay off debts.\u2014 A good idea?\u2014 How about hunting together?\u2014 What? \u2014 Young-ju tilted her head to one side.Kang Yu continued:\u2014 El Quero.The girl fell silent.El Quero.The boss monster whose appearance resembles a giant stingray, the very one that has made the lake in Suwon's Level S Gate his home.El Quero was considered the most terrible of all monsters among the Players.Because when this Gate first opened, an expedition crew was sent there, and not a single person returned.After that incident, there was an unspoken law among Players that if a Player hunts in the Level S Gate, he must bypass the lake.\u2014 Do you have any idea what El Quero is\u2026?He was strong.However, he was considered dangerous not only for his strength.First, he lives in water.Although he sometimes got out on dry land, he spends most of the time in the water, ready to attack anyone with his poisonous needles.Anyone who wants to attack him will not even have the time to approach him, as they will be attacked first.Not only does he live in water and is difficult to catch, but he is almost immune to magic and repels all ranged attacks.Five years have passed since the opening of the Gate in Suwon. During these five years, not one Player has been able to catch El Quero.Of course, he was not an elusive and impregnable monster. If a punitive squad consisting exclusively of high-class Players is made, they will most likely be able to defeat the monster.But no punitive squad of any sorts have been made to kill El Quero. More precisely, there was simply no need for it.Usually, a punitive unit is gathered only in cases when there is a possibility of a monster leaving the Gate and becoming a threat to civilians.On this basis, it is not difficult to guess that a monster who lives under water will not pose any danger to civilians.And now, given that he is so difficult to catch and there is no need for it, he has been peacefully living there for five years as a boss.\u2014 I know it's going to be tough.\u2014 More than 'tough'\u2026 If your goal is money, there's no need to go as far as catching El Quero.Of course, ten million won is a lot of money, but for Players as strong as Young-ju and Kang Yu, this amount was not impossible.They could easily accumulate the necessary amount by hunting giant orcs for a while in the S-level gate and selling their mana stones.\u2014 It's not just because of the money.\u2014 Then what else?\u2014 If this is an S-rank boss, albeit small, then there's a chance that we'll get materials to make Legendary equipment, right?\u2014 Yes, but even if you get them, producing the equipment is not as easy as you think\u2026 Do you only want to attack him because of Legendary gear?\u2014 Not only that. I also thought that killing such a difficult boss could be the key to solving the Level 59 crisis.'Oh, you're at 6th rank now.' The girl looked thoughtfully at Kang Yu.She had already forgotten that Kang Yu had not yet faced the problem known as 'Effort's End.'Comparing his strength to his level, it hadn't occurred to her that he had not yet crossed that line.'Did I really just lose to this Player, weaker than myself in terms of level?'She immediately realized how devastating her defeat had been.Young-ju sighed sadly.\u2014 But you know that every Player has their own way of solving this problem, right?\u2014 I've heard that killing a high-level monster is the most common way.\u2014 That's true.The three most typical ways to overcome the Level 59 wall were: hunting a boss, self-comprehension and mortal danger.Of course, there were many other ways in addition to these methods, but it was thanks to these methods that most Players got rid of their problem.And the most effective and popular of these methods was boss hunting.After all, there were practically no Players who wanted to devote a huge amount of time to tedious training for the sake of enlightenment which may not come, nor those who wanted to deliberately put their lives on the line.\u2014 It's a great way to get money for repairs, materials for Legendary gear and overcome the Level 59 crisis all at the same time! What do you think?\u2014 Something tells me that only you will benefit from this.\u2014 I disagree. This is all for the sake of strengthening our allyship.\u2014 You speak well, \u2014 Young-ju chuckled.Truthfully, killing El Quero would be good for her, too.After all, for a very long time she has been unable to overcome the Level 59 crisis.'Okay, let's catch him, this El Quero.' She nodded her head to agree, and looked at the guy.Fear and anticipation mingled in her gaze.'If he overcomes the problem of Level 59 and continues to rise\u2026'She was curious: she wanted to see for herself just how far Kang Yu could go, and what kind of monster he would become.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'm partially responsible for this too. So I'd like to help cover the costs.\u2014 Hwa Yeon\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju, touched, took her hand. \u2014 I knew that you'd be different from this human garbage! \u2014\u2014 You know I'm standing right beside you and I can hear\u00a0everything, right?Ignoring him, Young-ju continued:\u2014 You are so kind and understanding, and you know what 'responsibility' is\u2026 Yes, this is exactly how a person should be.\u2014 Hey!Again, Kang Yu's protests were ignored.\u2014 Ohhh, thank you Hwa Yeon. If you come with us, then we'll definitely catch him.Kang Yu paused and pressed his lips together tightly. He felt this was unjust.'It wasn't only my fault.'If Young-ju could hear his thoughts now, she'd definitely be pissed off. He turned away, and the long, under two-meters sword Hwa Yeon was carrying entered his field of vision.'That's only good for close combat.'And in fact, melee weapons are the most useless item in hunting El Quero.Moreover, it would not allow you to move safely under water.'However\u2026'Kang Yu's eyes gleamed.For the method that had just occurred to him, someone with this kind of weapon would be needed.She'd be a big help.'I wonder if it's appropriate to say this is a case of 'luck in misfortune'?'Although they now had to pay compensation for repairs, thanks to this, he and the girls would cooperate to catch El Quero.Besides, money did not play a big role for him. What he needed could not be bought with money.Even if he has hundreds or thousands of millions, he still would not be able to find more high-class equipment of Legendary level.If the product itself is not on sale, then it cannot be bought.The same could be said with overcoming Level 59.There was no way to solve the problem with money.'You can't buy power with money.'They were not in a mobile game, where you could buy anything. In reality, there is a limit beyond which there are things that cannot be bought.In order to regain his lost strength, and to acquire beyond what he had, it would take more than just money.\u2014 Then with Hwa Yeon, that makes four of us.\u2014 Four? Who's the other Player? \u2014 Young-ju tilted her head.\u2014 Echidna. You've seen each other, remember?\u2014 Oh, that's right. The creature you summoned, \u2014 the girl said, unsurprised.Kang Yu nodded.Echidna was sure to be a huge help in hunting El Quero.\u2014 So, the four of us?'Hmm,' the guy thought for a moment.Although he wanted to bring Si Hoon along, for this case, the risk was too high.'It's still too early.'Of course, he was an incredible Player with outstanding abilities.And if Kang Yu did not exist, Si Hoon would have every chance at taking the position of 'best Player,' overshadowing anyone with his heroic deeds.But as it was now, the level of Si Hoon and his party was quite average.There was no way they could stand up to an S-ranked boss.'We have a lot of work ahead of us, and right now he will only get in the way.'Given that they would have to fight in water, there was a high probability that Si Hoon would become a hindrance. After all, even the orc boss he'd fought before could not be compared with El Quero.After much thought, Kang Yu finally replied to Young-ju:\u2014 We should have one more person.\u2014 Who? A Damager? Healer?\u2014 We need someone who can fight melee.\u2014 Close combat? When hunting El Quero? \u2014 Young-ju looked at him blankly.Any Player knew full well that close combat was absolutely useless against El Quero.A tank to fight from a distance and distract the monster would be most useful.\u2014 I have an idea. But this requires an experienced Player who is able to conduct an active attack.'Hem\u2026 A Player capable of attacking El Quero\u2026'\u00a0 Young-ju pondered.Every member of her guild was an exceptional Player. And of them all, there were a few people she could think of who fought well in close combat.But their goal was\u2026El Quero.It had never occurred to her that there would even be a single Player willing to go hunting at the Level S Gate to catch the boss.\u2014 How about Commander Ku Hyun Mo? \u2014 Hwa Yeon suggested.\u2014 Oh, the Commander of Hwaran's 2nd Division?Ku Hyun Mo.A blond man with sunglasses. Although he looked like a thief and behaved in a simple-minded manner, she had no doubt about his skills.(Editor's Note: Officially changing my previously mistaken term 'robber' to thief as of this chapter.And hey if you ain't reading on a site starting with C and ending with i, this was stolen. Find us for quickest and original updates.)'Oho~' Kang Yu, pleased with Hwa Yeon's good choice, nodded his head.He remembered how Ku Hyun Mo fought with Orias, and it was clear that the man was skilled.He was excellent at handling two small daggers thanks to his well-trained dexterity.Despite the fact that Kang Yu had expected someone different, he could not help but take into account the superior skills and strength of the 2nd Division Commander.\u2014 Since we have friendly relations with him to some extent, I think he will easily agree, \u2014 Hwa Yeon murmured.\u2014 If he does agree, he will help us a lot.\u2014 Mm. Wait a bit.She took out her phone and dialed the number.\u2014 Hwa Yeon? Did something happen?From the phone was Hyun Mo's slightly surprised voice. As if he hadn't expected a call from her at all.\u2014 I want to ask you something.\u2014 Hahaha! If you're the one asking, I'm ready to do anything! I'm ready to listen to you for the rest of my life!(Editor's Note: bro i'm embarrassed for u)\u2014 This isn't what you think it is\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksKang Yu could hear the guy's voice trembling slightly, like he was agitated. Realizing what was going on, Kang Yu chuckled.\u2014 Commander! You did it!\u2014 Is the Commander starting to meet someone for the first time?!\u2014 Shut up, you idiots!From the line came not only his voice, but also the voices of his teammates.It was hard to believe that this was a conversation between two Commanders of a large government unit.Ku Hyun Mo coughed and tried to proceed businesslike.\u2014 S\u2026 so, what's this pro-propos- request? If you want to have lunch together, I know a place that will take your breath away\u2026!\u2014 No, I'm not asking to have lunch together.\u2014 Ah\u2026 Yes, of course\u2026 \u2014 the guy replied languidly.Hwa Yeon explained the situation and said that she wanted to ask for his help in capturing El Quero.\u2014 El Quero\u2026\u2014 If this is too difficult for you, I will find someone else\u2026\u2014 No, it's fine! If this is your request, I will help you, no matter what! Hahaha! And I myself have always wanted to try catching El Quero, too!\u2014 Ah, good.\u2014 I'm on my way!\u2014 No, there is no need\u2026\u2014 Hahah! If I come too early, will it be possible to have a bite with you and walk around for some sightseeing in Seoul?\u2014 I need to write a report on the destroyed training room, so that will be quite difficult.\u2014 Ah\u2026 Yes, that's understandable. Well\u2026 since you are busy\u2026\u2014 I'd be grateful if you call when you arrive at headquarters. The guys from 3rd Division will meet you.\u2014 Yes\u2026 I'll call\u2026Hwa Yeon hung up.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 Somehow, it sounded like his energy was drained near the end of the call. I wonder why? \u2014 Hwa Yeon, not understanding his reaction, tilted her head to the side.Kang Yu and Young-ju stared at the girl in silence.Their gaze seemed to say,\u00a0 'Does she really not understand?'\u2014 Why are you looking at me like that?\u2014 Well\u2026\u2014 Hmm. I never expected that Commander Ku would be so passionate about catching El Quero. It's a good thing we're not forcing him into it. \u2014 Hwa Yeon nodded twice, seeming satisfied.\u2014 What are you talking about\u2026?\u2014 Yes, she really doesn't understand\u2026Hwa Yeon looked surprised, raising an inquiring gaze at Kang Yu and Young-ju.\u2014 What's going on? Is there a problem?The two looked at each other again, and the guy continued:\u2014 Forget it.\u2014 Yes, otherwise it will become more complicated, \u2014 Young-ju agreed.They understood each other's thoughts perfectly.Hwa Yeon frowned.\u2014 What are you talking about now?\u2014 It's nothing.\u2014 I'm more concerned about something else: when are we going hunting? \u2014 Young-ju skillfully changed the subject.\u2014 It's best to do it as soon as possible, \u2014 Kang Yu answered.\u2014 I'll need to talk to my guild members and sort things out\u2026 That should take about three days.\u2014 And I need to draw up a report and speak with the authorities. I think it will also take me three days. I'll try to come up with some other reason why the walls in the hall are so broken, so as to not drag you into this.\u2014 Then let's agree to meet in three days. I'll gather some information and make a more detailed action plan. \u2014 Kang Yu nodded to their responses.Three days of grace.During this time, it was necessary to draw up a plan of action and take care of their affairs.'First of all, I need to reach Level 59.'Right now, he was still at Level 54, and has not yet reached the crisis known as 'Effort's End.'And in order to confirm that capturing El Quero will really help him to overcome the problem, he first had to acquire Level 59.\u2014 Then let's meet in three days, at two o'clock at the Gate's entrance, \u2014 Hwa Yeon summed it up, and the others agreed with her.[You have successfully destroyed a normal Rank S Giant Orc][Level up][You have reached Level 59. You have reached your limit. You will continue to accumulate additional experience points. Once you have overcome your limit, you will receive all the points at once.]\u2014 Hmm\u2026 So in the end, I ran into the same problem as everyone else.Kang Yu, reviewing the notifications, clicked his tongue.He was told that there were many gifted Players who could easily overcome the problem.That's why he began to think that the crisis of Level 59 would not affect him at all.But the world doesn't always work by your rules.He closed the notifications window and turned towards the exit.\u2014 Kang Yu, it's time.\u2014 Just in time. Let's go.\u2014 Are we going to catch that monster you talked about today?\u2014 Yes.\u2014 Kang Yu, I will try my best to be helpful today.Echidna, who had helped him level up for the past three days, clenched her fists firmly.Kang Yu smiled and stroked her head.Echidna, showing that she was in a good mood, grabbed Kang Yu's hands and pulled them to her cheeks.\u2014 I believe you.\u2014 Will I get an award this time too? \u2014 Echidna looked up at him with sparkling eyes, full of expectation.The guy nodded his head cheerfully.\u2014 Of course!\u2014 Hehe! Then I'll try really hard! \u2014 Echidna answered cheerfully.On the way out of the Gate, they saw Young-ju, Hwa Yeon and Hyun Mo waiting for them.\u2014 What the? You entered the Gate earlier?\u2014 Yes, I wanted to hunt a little.\u2014 Isn't that a waste of energy before meeting the boss?\u2014 It was just a warm-up.Kang Yu quickly greeted everyone.\u2014 Well, let me tell you about the plan I came up with.A plan that was created and revised over three days as he simultaneously hunted in the Gate.\u2014 The essence of the plan is\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(6/10)Editor: Cherish\u2014 Wah!A wild wail.Three giant orcs flew towards them, shaking the ground.Not only did they have weapons, each of them easily reached five meters in height with a muscular physique.\u2014 These animals do nothing but make noise.But at the moment, none of those present even thought to be afraid of them.Young-ju frowned and raised her hand.Like a coil of thread, a tangle of red chains with sharp spikes tore from her hands.\u2014 Kiaaah!The chains entangled the orcs' bodies with great force and speed.\u2014 Let's go! \u2014 Echidna's voice came from somewhere behind.She let go of the hem of Kang Yu's shirt, which she'd been holding onto, and began to gather Magi.The black energy turned into burning hot flames.Three fireballs created in an instant flew at the giant orcs.Tied up in chains, the orcs caught on fire and tried to actively break free.Behind Baek Hwa Yeon, Ku Hyun Mo and Kang Yu headed towards the monsters.They were like comic book heroes, catching monsters, quickly bypassing them from the back and attacking at the same time.Dark scarlet blood gushed out and the monsters' bodies fell lifelessly to the ground.Hyun Mo gently landed on the ground and whistled.\u2014 His name is Kang Yu? I heard that the Red Rose has a talented newcomer, but I didn't expect this. Is he really a rookie? \u2014 Hyun Mo directed his questions at Hwa Yeon.Kang Yu seemed so experienced that the guy had a hard time calling him a rookie.Hyun Mo's eyes flashed as he looked directly at Kang Yu.Originally, when Kang Yu explained today's action plan to them, he thought that the guy was only here for his good ideas and reasoning.But seeing how experienced he behaves in a battle with orcs, he quickly realized he was mistaken.\u2014 Mmm\u2026 I'll explain it to you later. But know this: in battle, he is in no way inferior to Young-ju.\u2014 W-what? Cha\u2026 Chae Young-ju?\u2014 It's a long story.Speechless, he turned his eyes to Young-ju.Seeing that she didn't try to refute what was said, he decided that it might be true.\u2014 No, but how\u2026Thanks to the rumors flying around, he'd heard that Red Rose was sponsoring a Player who wasn't even three months old.But to say that this same rookie compares to Young-ju, one of the Top Players in Korea?Hyun Mo, again thinking he could have misheard, turned his eyes to Kang Yu this time, but the man behaved calmly, as if everything said was true.\u2014 This is the lake.\u2014 Looks calm.'The entire area around the lake belongs to El Quero.' Kang Yu looked around.It was so quiet, it was hard to believe they were in the central part of the Gate.But even in this silence, an occasional quiet pat could be heard, and he turned in that direction.He'd found the perfect location after spending three days at the Gate.\u2014 We're going over there.\u2014 Do you really think this method will work? \u2014 Young-ju hesitantly asked.\u2014 Do you have any other ideas?\u2014 Mmm\u2026 No, none.Young-ju rubbed her forehead with her hand, staring at the huge rock by the lake.Green golems covered with moss slowly moved around the shining rock.Rock Men. This is the third type of monster that lives in the Level S Gate in Suwon.In fact, such creatures were rarely seen, and due to the fact that they did not attack first, they hardly resembled S rank monsters.Instead of skin, they had a thick layer of stone covering their body.Likely because of this, they could avoid the terrible El Quero and peacefully live by the lake, rather than escape into the thicket of the forest as others did.Because they resided in El Quero's territory, Players hardly hunted the golems as well, but even if they did manage to hunt a couple, the golems do not bring much experience points, rendering them useless.\u2014 Well, let's start.\u2014 Alright.\u2014 You know you're a key figure today, right?Young-ju nodded her head heavily.Dozens of metal chains began to appear in her hands along with red light.\u2014 We must move, too.While Young-ju was preparing, the others, according to the plan, also had something to do.Kang Yu picked up one of the metal bundles created by Young-ju.This time it was not the usual chains with sharp spikes, but bundles of absolutely smooth, shiny chains.Young-ju and Hyun Mo nodded their heads with concerned expressions.\u2014 Fuh\u2026A deep breath and exhale.Tension hung in the air.Kang Yu turned his eyes to the tranquil lake.It looked so beautiful, it was hard to believe it could be inhabited by a terrible devourer.\u2014 Well\u2026Kang Yu put his hands up. Magi immediately flared up in his body and, concentrating, it began to flow into his hands, which he abruptly lowered.The Power of Rumble began to take effect.In an instant, a rumble erupted in the lake, so loud it was deafening.There was a low growl.\u2014 It's coming!The reaction was instant. Bubbles first appeared on the smooth surface of the water, followed by a huge something.Across the lake, a huge creature about 30 meters, resembling a stingray, raced in their direction.\u2014 Echidna!\u2014 Yes!Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAs soon as El Quero twitched once, large poisonous thorns the size of a palm flew in their direction.Echidna, stepping forward, put her hands in front of her and created a black wall of Magi.There was the sound of thick glass breaking. Surprise appeared on Echidna's face, and her hands shook in front of her.\u2014 Let's go! \u2014 Kang Yu threw his hands out.Through the hole in Echidna's wall, Kang Yu used the Power of Heaven and quickly flew upward.\u2014 Kh!\u2014 ah! This isn't a joke anymore!Hwa Yeon and Hyun Mo, clutching the lowered chains, also took to the air.The three of them climbed up tens of meters, when suddenly Hyun Mo yelled:\u2014 I'm falling down! \u2026I have a fear of heights!!Screaming even louder, the guy clung tightly to the metal chains.Kang Yu gently lowered himself onto the monster's back.\u2014 We have to make it before he goes underwater again!\u2014 Got it!El Quero suddenly began to shake, trying to get rid of the Players on his back. Hyun Mo lost his balance and fell.\u2014 It's so slippery!He quickly drew out one of his knives and thrust it hard into El Quero's back, scrolling a hole in the flesh.\u2014 aah!\u2014 Why does it keep making these sounds?!The guy, grumbling something under his breath, continued to act according to the plan.Grabbing one of the chains, he stuck it in El Quero's body, breaking through the monster's skin with his knife.\u2014 Ha!Hwa Yeon did the same.Standing on the back of the monster and balancing herself, she swung her sword against the wind and thrust it into El Quero's skin. Then she took the chain with one hand and shoved it under the skin of the monster.Blood poured from the wounds like a waterfall.\u2014 aaah!El Quero began to flounder from side to side.Hwa Yeon and Hyun Mo hung onto their chains and slid down his back.Kang Yu, using the Power of Heaven, rose again, unaffected by the monster's vibrations.El Quero twitched a little more and bent over.'Are you going to go underwater?'El Quero had one huge advantage to guarantee his safety.And this advantage was the giant lake.Kang Yu went ahead of the monster and dove into the water first. He was enveloped by a strong current, eyes stinging as he tried to see underwater.After plunging into the water, Kang Yu immediately swam to El Quero's belly. His huge white belly had a mouth and gills.The guy could not get himself together and swim straight, he was constantly being carried away by the current. He concentrated powerful Magi in one fist.\u2014 Heavenly Rift, \u2014 Kang Yu muttered underwater, barely audible, and thrust his fist forward.From above, it seemed that there was a huge explosion underwater, causing a whirlpool that was able to push the monster to the surface.Still, there was not a single scratch on El Quero from the attack Kang Yu had just carried out.But the guy wasn't finished.Since he'd struck underwater, he'd been unable to use all his power. Only 10% of his force was used.'Now!'Kang Yu stared up at the monster flying into the air.He kicked off the water and, creating strong waves, flew out of the water and immediately felt a sharp change in pressure, which the monster too certainly felt.\u2014 Aaaaah!With a loud cry, the monster slammed his fins in the air, from which sparks flew in different directions.\u2014 Get off his back!Hwa Yeon and Hyun Mo, who were hanging on El Quero's back, immediately pushed away from him and jumped high.Kang Yu felt a powerful electric charge go through his body.\u2014 Hhhh!So strong that everything turned white before his eyes.His expression turned blank.\u2014 Kang Yu! \u2014 Echidna released Magi to support the guy from falling in the air.The current that pounded his whole body finally weakened, and he regained focus.[Power of Glaciation]The water's surface was immediately covered with a layer of thick ice, onto which El Quero, who had been in the air all this time, fell.But this was only temporary, as the ice began to crack under the weight of the 30-meter creature.Kang Yu, waiting for the right opportunity, tightened his grip on the metal chain.Approaching the monster, or rather the gills at the belly, he slowly made his way across the cracking ice.Dark blood spilled from the wide-open gills. He bled from his flapping mouth. But no one cared. Kang Yu entered the monster through his mouth.Holding the chain, he walked straight, slicing through the flesh that was hindering him.Using the Power of a Thousand, he mercilessly tore out pieces of meat from inside the monster, making his way deeper and deeper.His goal was to connect the chain in his hands and the chains in the monster's body stuck from outside.Mercilessly tearing El Quero to pieces, Kang Yu went on with his task.The monster's body shook terribly.The red blood began to turn black, eventually turning so black that it was too dark to see anything. But the guy could care less.Even if he could not see, he could move.He continued to disfigure the monster's insides as he moved forward.Drenched in blood, he finally punched a hole out.He wrapped the chain in his hands around El Quero.Clutching the chain, Kang Yu climbed onto the monster's back.\u2014 Pull! \u2014 Kang Yu shouted.\u2014 Hold on tight! \u2014 Young-ju shouted from afar.They began to pull El Quero to dry land, creating a loud rumbling sound that normally accompanied earthquakes.Sitting on the monster's back, Kang Yu looked in the direction where Young-ju was.Dozens of stone golems bound by chains were right behind her.'Great.' Soaked in blood, he smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(7/10)Editor: CherishThere was the sound of water pouring out.The water on the right began to wash over El Quero's body, carrying away streams of blood.\u2014 Hhh! \u2014 Kang Yu let out an exclamation.He began to feel intense pressure all over his body as he tightly gripped the chains holding down the monster.If he was not using the Power of Iron Curtain and Power of a Thousand at the same time, the pressure would have simply torn his body apart.'A little more\u2026'He glanced at the stone golems behind Young-ju.Bound by metal chains, they were pulling El Quero's body towards them with all their might.\u2014 Raaah!The monster jerked sharply, and this vibration reached the stone golems through the chains, causing them to lose their balance and fall to the ground.Despite the fact that there were a lot of them, about ten, their strength began to leave their bodies.'Their strength is running out.'El Quero possessed strength corresponding to the size of his body. No, even more than that.He was truly a strong opponent.The stone golems behind Young-ju looked up at El Quero.\u2014 Where are you staring, you stone heads!?The guild leader used one chain as a whip and swung it at the golems.(Editor's Note: omg calm down you devil)Echidna came to her aid, supporting them with Magi.The golems looked between El Quero and the girls.\u2014 Shorty, go that way!\u2014 I'm not short! \u2014 Echidna puffed her cheeks discontentedly and went in the direction Young-ju pointed to.The stone golems again began to look ahead and dragged the monster towards them.The chains dug into him on both sides, creating more and more wounds.There was so much blood that the surface of the entire lake was painted scarlet.El Quero let out an eerie scream and began to flap his gills like wings.A large number of poisonous thorns flew at the stone golems.Since they consisted entirely of stone, the poison that would have been deadly to other creatures did absolutely no harm to them.However, they still could not ignore the hail of spikes because of the physical pressure exerted on them.Losing their balance again, they fell to the ground.\u2014 Damn it.The enemy turned out to be much stronger than anticipated.Kang Yu turned to look back. Hwa Yeon and Hyun Mo, who'd fallen into the water, swam towards them.'Can't wait around for help\u2026'In a situation where he has a Power only capable of lifting himself into the air, he could not come to their rescue so quickly.As a result, Kang Yu came to the conclusion that he needed to deal with this situation on his own.He frowned, trying to concentrate.'There is nothing left to do but to use a third Force.'He could not afford to undo neither the Power of a Thousand nor the Iron Curtain right now.In order not to miss El Quero, he needs to use three Powers at once.The difference in using two Forces and three at the same time was colossal.When it comes to consuming Magi, using a third Force required as much energy as the first two combined.When Kang Yu used two Powers, he spent four times as much energy as when using one, and when using a third, the consumption of Magi was as much as eight times greater.[Kraken's Wrath]With this effect applied, his coat began to radiate a dark blue light.His bonus stats doubled and he gained 5 additional units of Magi.Kang Yu focused and activated the third Power.[Power of the Blade]A black sword began to form in the hand with which he held onto El Quero.Fully formed, it pierced through the skin of the monster.\u2014 Wrraaahh! \u2014 A cry soaked in pain.The blood, splashing with renewed vigor, once again poured out into the water.'No\u2026'The forces applied were still not enough.El Quero seemed to have no intention of weakening. Still another powerful attack was necessary.Kang Yu shouted to Young-ju:\u2014 Create thorns!\u2014 What!?\u2014 Create thorns on the chains!\u2014 Have you lost your mind?! Then\u2026 then you too\u2026\u2014 Hurry!Young-ju suddenly turned serious.She swallowed hard and nodded tensely.Taking the bracelet in her hands, red light began to emanate from it again. At the same time, thorns 'ran' along the smooth chains to Kang Yu.[Confrontation]A feature embedded in the armor he'd obtained from Moon Yeon Ho.(Reminder: The dude from Red Rose that fought Kang Yu when he was Rank 3 like 40 chaps ago. )Within a short ten seconds, his resistance to physical attacks doubled.Although the resistance was increased, Young-ju's chains were still a Legendary weapon. As a result, the thorns that appeared pierced through Kang Yu's armor and inflicted wounds on his body.Sharp pain shot through his entire body.Trying to control himself, Kang Yu struggled to maintain the third Force.The pain was so strong that he thought he was about to throw up. It hurt so much he could hardly scream.Following this, the thorns appeared on the chains inside the monster, undermining his strength.Since there were many thorns, they created even more wounds from which blood poured out like a fountain.Kang Yu was finally able to let go of the chains, and jumped off El Quero.\u2014 Kang Yu, are you okay?Echidna quickly ran up to him and gazed up at him with eyes full of anxiety.The guy nodded his head slightly.\u2014 We don't need the stone golems anymore. Deal with them, Echidna.El Quero's resistance to magic was astounding.None of Echidna's actions would be able to bring the desired effect. That's why Kang Yu decided she would be more useful at sorting out the stone golems and involving them in carrying out the plan.\u2014 Got it.She sent a charge of Magi towards them.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe Rock Men, tired of pulling El Quero and easily susceptible to magic, finally let go of the chains and began to fall to the ground.\u2014 Chae Young-ju! Stop running away already and come back!\u2014 You say that as if I'm running of my own free will!Young-ju, who was running away from the stone golems as bait, approached Kang Yu. He nodded in the direction of El Quero.\u2014 He didn't die even after ascending to dry land.\u2014 Of course not. Even though El Quero looks like a stingray, he's not actually a fish.No matter what, El Quero was still a monster from the Gate. Moreover, from the Gate of Level S. This was not a creature who would immediately die from being dragged out to dry land, though it was still a necessary move.\u2014 Haah, it was so difficult to swim such a distance! \u2014 Hyun Mo exclaimed.\u2014 We really successfully executed the plan, \u2014 Hwa Yeon commented.As soon as Hwa Yeon and Hyun Mo returned, their team was reassembled.Kang Yu raised his right hand, from which a black sword appeared.\u2014 Let's finish what we started.It had to be done now, while El Quero was on the surface of the earth. This was their chance to end the creepy monster.Hwa Yeon raised her long sword, and Hyun Mo took hold of his knives.\u2014 Get started.\u2014 His behavior should be different from when he was in the water.\u2014 Wah! \u2014 The monster screeched.\u2014 No well\u2026 I can't concentrate because of his screams!Hyun Mo couldn't keep quiet, and had to put in his five cents.(Editor's Note: In case you don't know, 'put in _ cents' = put in your own opinion/thoughts)But he himself knew perfectly well that it was not a time for jokes. Hyun Mo bent down and moved close to the monster, which immediately shook its tail like a whip in different directions.A whip belonging to a 30-meter monster.Its tail was only two meters wide.Hyun Mo immediately crouched down. The tail had barely brushed past his head.\u2014 Step back!Hwa Yeon, from a distance beyond his tail, raised her long sword high in the air.A strong wind enveloped her snow-white sword. Lowering it, she sent a jet of wind to El Quero.\u2014 Waaaaah!The wind sliced off the end of his tail. Deep red blood flooded everything around.El Quero focused entirely on Hwa Yeon, who was distracting him.Young-ju and Kang Yu took advantage of this moment.\u2014 I'll distract, you attack!\u2014 We believe in you.Kang Yu nodded. Replacing his defensive Force with an offensive one, more damage could be done.He did not follow Young-ju's order and didn't attack immediately, instead staring calmly at El Quero.'He's weak.'Unlike fish, he did not die choking on air.Still, the apparent weakening was one of the features of sea monsters.In addition, the wounds seemed to sting.They were so large that it would not be surprising if he died as soon as he was fully out on dry land.'In that case\u2026' Kang Yu's eyes lit up.They just had to finish what they started.He slowly closed his eyes and felt the powerful energy concentrated in his heart.Man Ma Jung.A cluster of Magi, of which he accumulated over a long ten thousand years.It was stronger and thicker than any other energy.'Ocean.'Indeed, it was like an ocean woven from Magi.Endless and incredibly deep.Even Kang Yu himself did not know exactly who created Man Ma Jung and the secrets kept with it.He'd never thought about what was at the depth, and what could happen if he just dived in head first.Neither now nor in the past when he used the Power daily.Kang Yu raised his head and looked around.He saw three doors hanging over the ocean of Magi.'There's no need for that.' He looked away from the doors.The guy held out his palms to the ocean. He gathered what he saw before him into his palms.But the power he gained was negligible compared to the ocean of energy.Even so, this was enough for him now.Very much so.[Bident]He simultaneously activated the Power of Dark Spear and Hellfire at the same time.From the black tongues of fire appeared a spear, which the guy grabbed with confidence.Incredibly strong energy gathered in his hands.But Kang Yu understood that these forces would not be enough. The energy he used was like a small boat sailing on the boundless ocean.Greed awoke in him.The fire of thirst grew at an alarming rate.'A little more.'[Crushing Power]Tearing his armor and cutting his skin, the destructive power went into the bident.Reaching the very end of the spear, the Force broke the tip into two, and the bident began to squirm like a snake.Suddenly the feeling of powerlessness washed over him and, as if his soul had left his body, only lethargy remained.Using three Powers at the same time and creating a bident was taking a toll on him.Kang Yu felt dizzy and thought he was about to faint.But he smiled.[Death Spear]With a slight metal-like sound, the crimson bident was completely transformed.Grasping it firmly in his hand, Kang Yu kicked off the ground.At that point, a couple of notifications popped up.[You successfully used three Powers at the same time.][The second condition of achieving the highest degree of demonic form has been successfully fulfilled.]It didn't bother him now. He had no reason to think about it.He directed even more power into the spear in his hand.The monster prepared to strike him with his tail, but the shield of red chains prevented him from doing so.Kang Yu punctured El Quero's body with the crimson bident.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(8/10)Editor: CherishA crimson red spear pierced El Quero's body.The flames inside the monster exploded.The Hellfire, rapidly dispersing throughout his body, inexorably devoured his life force.\u2014 Gotcha.Kang Yu was sure of it.With such a powerful attack, even El Quero had no chance of survival.At the end of the Death Spear, there was a slight tremor.Kang Yu's mood improved significantly.This was the first time he could use this technique, using three Powers simultaneously, after returning to Earth.In Hell, he could use it every day without a second thought, but now, on Earth, it felt very different.It was like a pleasant warmth flowed through his body for the first time in a long time.A heat rose in his throat, a greed for his forgotten power awakening in him.'So this was the second condition of achieving the highest degree of demonic form.'Kang Yu's eyes twinkled.He still did not know exactly what the 'highest degree of demonic guise' was and what changes it would bring.But one thing was for sure \u2013 there had been nothing like this in Hell, meaning he would receive a new strength, beyond what he had before.It would be strange to not look forward to it.'I wonder what the next condition is?'He didn't have a single clue about it.But based on the description of the ability, there was a high probability it was associated with Magi.'Hmm.' Kang Yu immersed himself in his thoughts. 'Wait\u2026?'He felt a certain sense of discomfort.He frowned. It felt like something was missing.'I didn't get a notification?'Suddenly, he realized that he had not received a single notification about El Quero.He immediately whipped his head to look at the monster.There was a roar.'It can't be\u2026 he's not dead?'El Quero, half burnt to ashes, flashed a vicious glare.Even the roar he was emitting had become different, wilder.But the most important fact remained that El Quero was alive.'This can't be.'But he could feel it in his fingertips.He was sure that his experience, accumulated over thousands of years, should have been enough to help kill the monster.The Death Spear was such a powerful technique that it was capable of killing even the strongest demons inhabiting the Seventh Thousandth Circle of Hell.And El Quero didn't even have a chance to defend himself. So how could he be alive?\u2014 Wha\u2026 What kind of attack was that?! Kang Yu, who\u00a0are\u00a0you? And more importantly, how is this happening?\u2014 H\u2026 how did he survive after such an attack?Hyun Mo and Young-ju were shocked.They had certainly seen the crimson spear puncture the monster's body and fry it from the inside.Even if El Quero was a Level S Gate monster, they could not have imagined that he would survive such an attack.\u2014 Kah! \u2014 The monster's loud screech rang through the air.\u2014 He's escaping!Squirming with what was left of his body, he tried to get to the lake.\u2014 Damn it! \u2014 Young-ju hurriedly put both hands forward.Bundles of red chains immediately wrapped around the fleeing El Quero.But since the characteristics of her physical strength did not surpass his, he jerked and pulled the girl along with him.Kang Yu rushed to her side and, overtaking the girl, pulled on the chains.\u2014 Khh! \u2014 His face twisted as he struggled.The chains dug into his palms. He would gladly use one of his Forces if he could, but because he'd just used a powerful technique, there was no Magi left to spare.\u2014 Pull on the chains!If El Quero made it back to the lake, all their efforts thus far would be in vain.Hwa Yeon and Hyun Mo quickly ran up and took hold of the chains.\u2014 Ugh! How can he possess this much strength\u2026\u2014 Are you sure we can really kill him? Why is he still so strong?!El Quero, dragging the four people behind him, moved quickly towards the lake.It suddenly seemed that the monster was even stronger than it was at the start.He possessed abnormal strength on land despite being a water-based monster.'Is this how we're going to lose him?' Waves of anxiety washed over Kang Yu.The pain along the wounds on his hands and arms stung more than ever.If he could use the Power of a Thousand, perhaps he wouldn't be struggling so much.But he couldn't.\u2014 Hold on tight!Young-ju began to enforce the chains with Maryok, and the chains, wrapped tightly around El Quero, lit up with a red glow.\u2014 Aah!\u2014 Come on\u2026The monster jerked with even greater force and, overflowing with hatred, he let out a piercing roar. Black energy was pouring from the less wounded half of his body, ready to explode.Magi.Kang Yu frowned seeing this.The energy the monster emitted was unmistakably Magi.'What is happening?'He couldn't understand what was going on. There was no time for him to carefully analyze the situation.'Will we lose him?' Kang Yu thought, noticing how El Quero had almost reached the water.He bit his lip.He had no ideas left to resolve this crisis.'Leave it to me, Kang Yu.'\u00a0Echidna's voice echoed in his ears.Emitting blue light, her body began to return to its original gigantic form.Now standing at a height almost equal to El Quero, Echidna swung her tail, knocking the monster back.\u2014 Calm down a bit!Kang Yu expected nothing less from a real dragon.Returning to her original size, Echidna had more than enough strength to block El Quero's path.The monster, thrown to the ground, floundered from side to side, desperately trying to escape.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksBlood flowed again from the large wounds all over his body. Echidna swung her tail at him once more. Suffering another blow, he was visibly shaken.The growls he made gradually quieted to a stop, and his previously frightening glare grew dim.Kang Yu received a series of notifications.[You have successfully destroyed El Quero, boss of the Level S Gate.][You get bonus experience points for defeating an enemy.][You've gained a lot of experience points.][Once you have overcome your limit, you will receive all accumulated points at once.]These notifications were definitive proof that the monster was dead.'Even with this, I couldn't take care of the Level 59 problem.'Kang Yu stepped back with slight disappointment, and turned to the other Players.Right now, there was something more important than overcoming 'Effort's End.'\u2014 What\u00a0was\u00a0that just now?\u2014 I have no idea\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju slowly shook her head, her eyes wide.El Quero's fury near the end of the battle was unaccounted for.For as long as Kang Yu has hunted, this was the first time a monster was able to continue the battle even after being cut in half.\u2014 Maybe it's a special unknown feature of El Quero? \u2014 Young-ju suggested, tilting her head to the side.Among the Gate monsters, there were many whose features were inexplicable or simply unknown.This could very well be the case with El Quero, since no one had ever managed to catch him.\u2014 I don't think so. \u2014 Kang Yu shook his head, narrowing his eyes.\u2014 Why not?\u2014 I got a kill bonus. If my spear wasn't what killed him, I shouldn't have been able to get that bonus.\u2014 But all of us saw that El Quero only died after Echidna hit him with her tail\u2026\u2014 That means\u2026\u2014 We need to check.Approaching the monster's corpse, he examined where the Magi was coming from.It was located in the region of his brain.\u2014 Something's shining\u2026He dug into the monster's brain, grabbing what he saw and pulling it out.It was a gem the size of two fingers. Magi was trapped inside the stone.'What is this?'It was the first time Kang Yu had seen such a stone.It resembled a mana stone, instead containing Magi.But there was an obvious difference in color \u2013 it was black, giving the impression that it was created artificially.'It's too perfect.'Compared to the unsightly mana stones with rough edges, this black, perfectly smooth stone looked out of place.Which is why Kang Yu suspected it was not created naturally.'Is this why El Quero was even wilder than expected?'Kang Yu believed so.\u2014 What is that, Kang Yu?\u2014 I have no idea.Frowning, he studied the black stone in his hands.He even tried using the Power of the Observer, but could not learn any information except that it was actually Magi inside the stone.He carefully examined the dead body once more. After reviewing the area of the brain he'd discovered the stone, he realized something.'Originally, there shouldn't have been a stone here at all.'There were clear traces that someone had implanted the stone.Kang Yu's eyes flashed.He went through all the possible options in his head.And soon enough, he figured out who could have put the black stone in El Quero's brain.\u2014 I think I'm starting to understand, \u2014 he murmured.Young-ju cast him a questioning glance.\u2014 Understand what?\u2014 I'm not exactly sure, but there's a good chance that the Devil's Teachers did this.\u2014 The Devil's Teachers?Young-ju's gaze immediately changed, glowing with overwhelming malice.\u2014 What do you mean?\u2014 This black stone was clearly implanted in the monster's head. And what's more, it contains Magi. As far as we know, only the Devil's Teachers know how to deal with Magi.Magi, unlike Maryok, was not so easy to get.There was no one else on Earth aside from the Devil's Teachers and Kang Yu who were well informed about Magi.\u2014 Hmm\u2026Kang Yu stared down at the black stone with interest.The Magi in it was drawn to his fingertips.Within moments, Kang Yu pulled the Magi out of the stone, applying the Power of the Devourer.[You have absorbed pure power.][Magi increased by 3 units.]Coupled with the notifications, Kang Yu felt a new wave of Magi spread through his body.His eyes widened.'Three units at once\u2026?'Now, even without the Black Pearl Coat's effects, he had 83 units of Magi.Over the past three days, he'd managed to kill about a hundred giant orcs and absorbed all their power, and still he did not receive even a single unit of Magi.His struggle these past few days perfectly demonstrated to him exactly how difficult it was to increase his stats at his current level.And yet, in an instant, he'd been able to acquire as many as 3 units of Magi.'Wow\u2026'Kang Yu's lips stretched into a broad smile.He felt thirsty for power. The use of the Death Spear had drained him.And the Magi he just received was like a sip of cool water in an arid desert.Still, he could not imagine why the Devil's Teachers planted such a 'surprise' in El Quero.It was also not clear why or how they had gained pure Magi and put it into this form.'How nice of them.'It was thanks to this 'pure power' that Kang Yu could now enjoy a burst of energy after overexerting himself.Given that he was still unable to overcome Level 59, the Magi he received would likely play an important role later.'Hmm. Surely they couldn't have left only one gift, right?'Kang Yu licked his lips expectantly.With his appetite suddenly awakened, to him, the Devil's Teachers were now less like people and more like the name of a restaurant that smelled of fragrant dishes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 1)A goodbye gift from Cherish. (9/10)Editor: Cherish\u2014 Wha\u2026 what is this? Why did it suddenly disappear?! \u2014 Young-ju's expression portrayed utmost bewilderment.The black stone discovered by Kang Yu.The one thing that could provide clues about the Devil's Teachers began to dissipate in the air until it eventually disappeared.\u2014 I have no idea. It started to disappear as soon as I picked it up\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu feigned surprised, staring down at his hands in awe.But in fact, he knew well that not a trace remained of the stone because he'd used the Devourer's Power on it, which, of course, he could not reveal.Just like he concealed the fact that he had already lost his humanity long ago; that he was a demon who'd lived in Hell for ten thousand years and became its ruler.Young-ju was visibly disappointed.\u2014 I wonder if this is just the way Magi works?\u2014 If that's true, then it makes sense why Orias' body turned to ash and disappeared last time, \u2014 Hyun Mo pointed out.'Right.' Kang Yu's eyes flashed, recalling what happened last time.Young-ju nodded her head thoughtfully.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 Seems this really was a special feature, then, possibly because Magi was involved.\u2014 First, we need to find out if El Quero is the only one with this stone, or if there are other monsters with this implanted in their heads. If these stones are in the heads of other monsters, then we must obtain them before it becomes a problem, \u2014 Hwa Yeon said.If implanting these black stones into monsters' brains was part of the Teachers' plans, then it was unlikely this act was limited to one creature.Among the many monsters all over the Gates, there certainly had to be those with the same stone.'If I get all that pure power\u2026'He shivered with excitement.If he absorbed all the power within those black stones, then he could disrupt the Teachers' plans and, at the same time, gain great benefits for himself.In this situation, it was perfect to say 'kill two birds with one stone.'\u2014 But this stone disappears the moment you touch it. Even if we find monsters with stones, can we get it and deliver it for analysis? \u2014 Young-ju asked doubtfully.This question was directed at Kang Yu, who was lost in gleeful thought, but the guy was not taken aback and immediately replied:\u2014 I think everything will be fine as long as you do not touch it with your hands. I'd say it's best to store it in a bag.\u2014 Hmm. Ok. I'll instruct my guild members to search for stones.Hwa Yeon nodded in agreement.\u2014 And I will give the same order to the Hwaran people. It's a black stone inside the monsters' brains, right?\u2014 Yes, \u2014 he said. \u2014 And those monsters will likely show signs of outside interference. \u2014\u2014 Got it.With the Red Rose Guild and Hwaran Squad, if everything goes exactly as Kang Yu imagined, he could harvest a huge amount of pure power.The guy could hardly restrain himself from letting out a scream of joy right on the spot.Echidna, quickly returning to her human form, approached him and tilted her head to one side.\u2014 Kang Yu, you look happy.\u2014 Is that how it seems? But how could I possibly have fun in such a difficult situation?She stared at him in confusion. Since they were spiritually connected, she could roughly sense the guy's mood.And right now, he was radiating excitement and joy.Seeing her perplexed facial expression, Kang Yu immediately changed the subject.\u2014 You really helped us a lot today.\u2014 Really? I was able to help you?\u2014 Yes. As expected of Echidna. Let's go home and do whatever you want.Steam flew from her nose with joy. Her thoughts were immediately filled with various requests she could ask for as a reward.The guy smiled widely as he stroked her head.'I should look for it, too.'From only one stone with pure Magi, he was able to get many times as much Magi as he did from killing a hundred giant orcs.And because of the Level 59 crisis, experience points were not so important at the moment, so he thought it would be much more useful to try finding more stones with pure power.'And thanks to them helping with the search, I'll be able to catch some sleep.'He still hadn't passed Level 59, nor did he learn about the last condition of achieving the highest degree of demonic form.But now, thanks to the timely appearance of the Devil's Teachers' shenanigans, he had the opportunity to cast aside those thoughts and search for stones instead.You could say he was grateful to them.Even with the thought of how much pure power he could gain, his hunger vanished.Imagining it, he burped.\u2014 El Quero\u2026 was caught.\u2014 What did you say?It was in a dark room.The mysterious being wearing a red demonic mask continued in his low voice:\u2014 How could this have happened\u2026?\u2014 We don't know either. We went to the Gate to test the pure power, but the stone was gone, and everything in the area was covered with El Quero's blood.The masked man slammed the table with force. The table, made of dense wood, crumbled under his hand.\u2014 And the rest of the monsters?\u2014 We're still checking. However\u2026 I think our plan has been discovered, and they are also being hunted.\u2014 Dammit\u2026El Quero was an undefeated monster that has existed on Earth for five years.But now, just as they were beginning to put their plan into practice, this terrible monster was caught and killed.In this short period of time, he managed to feel a whole range of emotions: anger, breakdown, despair.\u2014 How is our plan progressing?\u2014 Because of what happened, we've been delayed\u2026He narrowed his eyes.Even behind the mask, the gleam of his eyes was intimidating.\u2014 What if we switch to a different method?\u2014 Ca\u2026 Cardinal?!\u2014 I'm not saying to do it immediately. But you need to check everything in advance.\u2014 If we start using\u00a0that\u00a0method now, we should make it in time.\u2014 Hmm\u2026\u2014 But\u2026 Cardinal, if we do that, we won't be able to cope with the consequences. There's a good chance that the World Rankers will react to such actions.\u2014 I know. \u2014 His response was brief. \u2014 What about our reserve of pure power? \u2014\u2014 We still have some.\u2014 Give it to other monsters. We need to speed up the execution of the plan before we lag behind even further\u2026He turned to the Disciples with a frightening look:\u2014 You are also involved in this.\u2014 Y-yes, we know! \u2014 All present answered with voices full of fear, and bowed to the floor.\u2014 So\u2026 who was it? The one who managed to catch El Quero?\u2014 We're not sure yet, but suspicions are falling on Red Rose.\u2014 The Red Rose Guild?Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Yes. Traces of Chae Young-ju's bracelets were found at the scene.\u2014 They've already interfered with us twice\u2026 \u2014 The masked man began to radiate a terrible aura of hatred.The Disciples, frightened by the power emanating from him, trembled.\u2014 Prepare the Shadows.\u2014 Are you planning to destroy Chae Young-ju?\u2014 Yes. We must get rid of the one who is constantly disrupting our plans.\u2014 She's very strong.The girl was one of those among the Top Players in the country.In addition, not only did Red Rose have strength, but also power, which would make it difficult to eliminate the girl.(Editor's Note: Physical strength/ability plus power to sway society.)The masked man smiled.\u2014 Chae Young-ju has a rookie she's protecting. A smug guy named Oh Kang Yu. Take him hostage.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 That bastard doesn't know the way the world works. So it's going to be easy.\u2014 Understood.\u2014 Take him captive by all means. Oh, and there's some little girl he always walks with. Grab them both.\u2014 A little girl\u2026?The masked man nodded.\u2014 I can feel Magi coming from her. It is necessary to check whether this is the case.\u2014 Yes!The Disciples rose from the floor and left the room.\u2014 Fuooh\u2026Left alone in the room, he took a deep breath and exhaled, removing the red mask from his face.\u2014 I don't like it one bit.The masked man\u2026 No, Baek Kang Hyun put the mask on the table, his face twisted.\u2014 I've deducted the cost of repairs, this is the remaining balance.Hwa Yeon had called Kang Yu and Young-ju to Hwaran's headquarters and handed them an envelope.\u2014 After we sold the mana stones and body, about ten billion was rewarded. Since this is the first time El Quero has been caught, his body was even more valuable.\u2014 Hmm. Is that why you're giving us 50 billion each?\u2014 Yes.\u2014 Why didn't you leave anything for yourself?\u2014 I don't need it. Besides, the two of you put much more effort into capturing the monster.\u2014 You're like a messenger from Heaven\u2026 \u2014 Smiling joyfully, Young-ju tucked the envelope into her breast pocket.Hwa Yeon continued:\u2014 And there's good news.\u2014 Good news? \u2014 Young-ju questioned.\u2014 Are you talking about the stones? \u2014 Kang Yu asked, voice filled with hope.Hwa Yeon shook her head.\u2014 No. The squad is on the case, but we haven't found anything so far. But there's something else.\u2014 What is it?\u2014 We extracted material from El Quero's body that's suitable for creating Legendary gear. They said a sword can be made from the thorns on his tail.\u2014 Ooooh!\u2014 Wow, we're really lucky.Both Young-ju and Kang Yu's eyes sparkled.Legendary Elite equipment.As a high-class Player, possessing at least one such thing is an indicator of their strength, so without exaggeration, it is a highly valuable asset.In addition, after recently experiencing the power of Legendary gear for himself, a greed has awakened in Kang Yu.'Though I don't use swords like this\u2026'The guy didn't use physical swords. Or rather, he didn't need to.After all, he can conveniently create whatever weapon necessary and use it during battle.But since the equipment would increase his stats, he was ready to try.\u2014 And also, the approximate features that the sword will be endowed with have been determined\u2026 Most likely, it will increase either strength or agility.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 Then it's useless for me, \u2014 Young-ju and Kang Yu said at the same time.Since Kang Yu predominantly used Magi, and Young-ju Maryok, the increase in strength or agility would not play a special role for them.\u2014 Hwa Yeon, can't you use it?\u2014 Haha. Unfortunately, I do not fit its terms of unity.There were cases when certain parameters were set for the unity process with equipment.These parameters were included in the equipment not at the manufacturing stage, but depended on the source materials. And this meant that it was impossible to change them.\u2014 What are its conditions?\u2014 You must have a unique aura.(Editor's Note: It's actually 'life force,' or your 'qi energy' or 'energy flow,' but I think aura works better.)\u2014 Aura? Like in the comics?\u2014 Yes. It is said that Players with such power do exist, but few. Usually they are Players from China\u2026 In Korea, they are almost non-existent.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 so it does have some value. Can you sell it in China?\u2014 I wanted to hear your opinion first. After all, you put in a lot of effort to catch El Quero.Hearing this, Kang Yu and Young-ju nodded their heads.It was true that the greatest role in capturing the monster was played by Kang Yu, with Young-ju's support.Of course, the others helped too, but not to the same extent.\u2014 Well, no one in my guild has that much power. Let's set the exact cost and sell it.\u2014 I know a buyer, \u2014 Kang Yu suddenly said.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026?The guy nodded his head.A unique aura.He knew one person with this description.Kim Si Hoon.The good-natured guy Dae Su had brought in.A player with outstanding looks and even more outstanding skills.'Though we are not of the same blood, I consider him my little brother.'It was no exaggeration to say that they have become really close lately.Soul-bound Players, and this was not just a metaphor.'I want to give a gift to my little brother!' Kang Yu thought, clenching his fists tightly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(Part 2)A goodbye gift from Cherish. (10/10)Editor: CherishIt's been two weeks since El Quero was caught.After Hwa Yeon's call in the morning, Kang Yu immediately headed for Suwon.\u2014 The manufacturing was just completed.The sword glinted blue as Hwa Yeon placed it on the table in front of him.Kang Yu ran his fingers along the blade and asked:\u2014 Is all Legendary equipment made so quickly?After all, it's only been two weeks.Making the sword was not a simple matter, so he wondered if it was made too quickly.He couldn't help but question if the quality of the item was up to standard.\u2014 The hardest part about making Legendary gear is finding the materials for it, \u2014 Hwa Yeon replied.\u2014 Hmm.. still, it is a costly business. Hwa Yeon, you didn't overwork yourself to prepare the sword, did you? \u2014 Young-ju said with suspicion in her tone.\u2014 So what if I did? You and Kang Yu are showing much better results in defending our nation than the Hwaran Squad right now. It'd be shameful for me to stand idle and watch, \u2014 the girl countered.At the moment, the Devil's Teachers were a far greater threat to civilians than the monsters in the Gates.Although only Players have fallen victim to them thus far, no one knows when casualties among ordinary people will appear.\u2014 I'm not trying to protect civilians by tracking down the Teachers\u2026 I have my own reasons. \u2014 Young-ju looked away.\u2014 Well, I'm doing it for the safety of the whole world! \u2014 Kang Yu smiled.Young-ju scoffed.\u2014 Don't bother pretending to be righteous. I've known you weren't that kind of person since our very first meeting.\u2014 You don't have to believe me if you don't want to. \u2014 He shrugged at her cold response.Though he'd said it with a joking tone, he was completely serious.'But I agree, I've been doing it for another reason lately.'The Devil's Teachers somehow knew another way of extracting Magi.If he tracked them down to understand how they did it, he could get many times more Magi than expected.The original purpose of hunting the Devil's Teachers was to protect all of humanity, but at some point, an opportunity for personal benefit had arisen.\u2014 Whatever the reason, the fact remains that you help a lot. Although not everything may go according to plan, now we can hope for a better outcome, \u2014 Hwa Yeon said, smiling sweetly.She spoke with such conviction that Kang Yu admired her.'I'm starting to understand why Hyun Mo has a crush on her.'If they weren't in the same relationship as they are now, Kang Yu probably would have been interested in her, too.Although at first glance she appears straightforward, she knows how to adapt to the situation and draws a clear line between what is good and what is bad.If things had been different, and he was part of the squad with her, he would certainly have wanted to win her heart.\u2014 Don't you dare fall in love\u2026 \u2014 Young-ju muttered.\u2014 What?\u2014 I'm saying, you're not allowed to have any strange feelings towards Hwa Yeon! A bad guy like you is definitely not worthy of her!Hwa Yeon coughed and asked:\u2014 Ahem. Young-ju, why did you suddenly bring this up?\u2014 It's written all over his face that you've charmed him! Be careful, Hwa Yeon. If you get involved with this bad guy, your life will change for the worse!\u2014 Young-ju, get it together. There's clearly something wrong with you\u2026\u2014 Kang Yu said.\u2014 But it's true! \u2014 Young-ju shouted with obvious anger in her voice.Kang Yu looked at her in surprise.\u2014 But I had no such thoughts. Don't you think you're the only one thinking about it?\u2014 I\u2026 I am, just in case! \u2014 she shouted again, her cheeks quickly turning red.Hwa Yeon chuckled as she said:\u2014 It's like you're jealous.\u2014 About what?!\u2014 Hahaha, I'm kidding.\u2014 Hah! I could never be jealous because of a guy like him even in theory!\u2014 She's talking nonsense again\u2026 \u2014 The guy shook his head wearily and turned away, studying the sword on the table instead.[Information][Name: Sword of El QueroType: LegendaryBinds to the user once equipped.This item can only be used by Players with a unique aura.Use: Lightning Speed Attack +700Effects: Strength +2, Agility +2Feature: You can walk on the surface of water.Description: A sword made of thorns from the tail of El Quero.]'In total, the stats will increase by four units.'The first thing Kang Yu wanted to check was how much this Legendary item would increase stats.Likely because the sword was made from El Quero, its properties were better than the average Legendary equipment.\u2014 Do you like it? \u2014 Hwa Yeon asked.\u2014 If I could use it, I would certainly want to get my hands on it. I like it.\u2014 Hahaha, that's great. Honestly\u2026 even I felt greedy and wanted it, but since I can't use it, I thought I should at least help with the production.\u2014 You invest in the right things. Kim Si Hoon is a Player who will continue to develop at a great speed. In no time, he will start helping us in battle against the Teachers.\u2014 You said he was your little brother?\u2014 Yes. Although we are not bound by blood, our relationship is fraternal.\u2014 Hahaha. If you're the one saying that, I expect a lot from him.\u2014 He won't disappoint you, \u2014 Kang Yu assured her.Kim Si Hoon was the best prize he could have won.'Because he's a descendant of Musin.'If Kang Yu had not returned to Earth, it was he who would have become a man capable of rewriting history.The guy could not even imagine what heights Si Hoon could reach.\u2014 Oh, there's something else I wanted to say.\u2014 Say it.\u2014 Maybe you can address me as 'you?' \u2014 She leaned back in her chair and continued, \u2014 Normally, I don't let people do that\u2026 but we're on the same team right now. I don't think it's fair that you're the only one who speaks politely to me. \u2014\u2014 Well\u2026 if that's the case, I'll switch to 'you.'\u2014 Good.He never thought that using 'you' was difficult, but taking into account that the girls were communicating with each other in a friendly way, it was probably better if he also foregoes polite treatment to fit in.\u2014 Is there still no news about the stones?\u2014 All members of the Squad are working hard on it, but there have been no results.\u2014 Same with my guys from the guild, \u2014 Young-ju piped in. \u2014 They've been catching five times more monsters for two weeks now, but still no pure power. \u2014\u2014 Maybe we were mistaken?Kang Yu himself had visited various Gates these past two weeks as well, but to no avail.He was beginning to think his assumption that the other monsters were involved was wrong.\u2014 We can't be sure yet, so we'll keep looking.\u2014 Good.\u2014 I think I'll go now, \u2014 Kang Yu said, getting up from his seat.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYoung-ju followed suit.\u2014 Do you have nothing to do? Why is it that every time I come to Suwon, you're here too?\u2014 You're not the only one who caught El Quero. Even though we're giving you the sword, we're hoping to benefit from it later. So I want to see for myself the results.\u2014 Hmm.He couldn't argue with that.The guy swallowed his displeasure and nodded his head.Young-ju, clearly rejoicing in her victory, chuckled and snorted loudly.\u2014 Ah, hyung!\u2014 Oooh! Kang Yu, it's been a long time!Kang Yu met with Si Hoon and his party on their way out of the Gate after completing their hunt.He saw Han Sol everyday, but it was the first time in a long time since he'd seen the others, so he decided to chat with them a little, after which he invited them to his place.\u2014 Oho~ Is this your new home? \u2014 Dae Su asked admiringly, looking around the apartment.\u2014 Kang Yu, is that you? \u2014 Echidna came out from the next room.Eun Bi's gaze lit up.\u2014 Kang Yu, who is this cute girl?\u2014 Kang Yu called me.\u2014 Ca\u2026lled?\u2014 Mhm.Not believing her ears, Eun Bi trembled.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026 are you using this child for all sorts of things?!\u2014 What are you talking about?\u2014 Aren't you afraid of rumors? It's disgusting!\u2014 Even though she looks like a child, she's ten times your age.\u2014 No matter what\u2026 this is illegal!She looked very anxiously at Echidna.Kang Yu slapped the delirious Eun Bi on the back of her head and went to the living room.\u2014 Today, I want to give something to Si Hoon, so I invited everyone to visit.\u2014 To me\u2026?\u2014 Yes.Kang Yu held out the Sword of El Quero to Si Hoon.\u2014 What is this?\u2014 Look and find out.The guy came closer and looked at the information. His eyes widened immediately and he said:\u2014 This\u2026 this is a Legendary sword! It is, isn't it?\u2014 Yes.\u2014 And you're saying you're giving it to me?Kang Yu nodded his head.Si Hoon looked at the sword in confusion.\u2014 Why such a gift so suddenly?\u2014 Because you deserve it.\u2014 Kang Yu!The boy's eyes flushed red as if he was about to cry, and he touched the blade of the sword with trembling fingertips.\u2014 I\u2026 I have no right to accept such a gift.\u2014 It's up to me to decide whether you have the right to do so or not.The guy didn't answer.\u2014 What level are you at now?\u2014 38.A little more and he would get 5th rank.Of course, he rose levels much slower than Kang Yu, but compared to other Players, he was probably the fastest.\u2014 Do you realize that you are improving much faster than other Players?\u2014 But that doesn't make me special\u2026\u2014 Not, it's precisely because you're special. Of course, your team is a great help, but the main reason lies in your uniqueness.Si Hoon fell silent.\u2014 You're going to become even stronger. It's okay if it takes you some time to realize that you're more than worthy of this sword.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026\u2014 You believe me, don't you?\u2014 Of course I do! I will do my best to prove my worth to own this sword! \u2014 Si Hoon shouted with confidence in his eyes.A real fire burned in his eyes, filled with self-belief.Kang Yu nodded his head in satisfaction.All that remains is to pass the rite of unity. As expected, he reached for the sword.\u2014 Ah? What is it?Only, he didn't take the sword. The guy's hand brushed past the equipment and grabbed Kang Yu instead.'What's with him now\u2026?'\u2014 Actually, when I first saw you\u2026 I felt kind of weird. It was like my whole body was against you.'That's because you're the Defender of the planet, and I'm the one who broke the system.'\u2014 But then that feeling disappeared.'Because I made you my subordinate.'\u2014 And now\u2026 haha. Maybe it sounds a little strange\u2026 But I feel like we're spiritually connected.'Because we really are connected.'\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026'Don't look at me like that.'Kang Yu smiled awkwardly and abruptly removed the guy's hand.The expression on Si Hoon's face immediately turned sad.Goosebumps ran through Kang Yu's body.'Have I gone too far?'He had the feeling that he first forced Si Hoon to trust him, then turned his back on him.Kang Yu realized that a line had to be drawn in their relationship.\u2014 Si Hoon\u2026\u2014 Ah, Kang Yu, there's something I wanted to tell you.The guy took something out from his pocket. As soon as Kang Yu saw it, his eyes widened.\u2014 During the last hunt, I noticed something strange. After examining their bodies, I found this.Si Hoon was holding two black pebbles the size of a fingernail.Kang Yu immediately reached for the stones.These were the stones filled with pure power that he'd been so desperately searching for these past two weeks.What's more, there was not one, but two!The corners of his lips immediately stretched upward.'Si Hoon, let's go all the way together.'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guys and I were hunting like always, but at some point something felt wrong. How do I explain this\u2026 Oh, you know how I mentioned I had some kind of negative feeling toward you when we first met?\u2014 Yeah?\u2014 Well, this time I had a similar feeling.\u2014 Wow.\u2014 And following this feeling, I realized that this monster was somehow strange.\u2014 Strange?\u2014 Yes. We were hunting minotaurs, but its appearance was slightly different from usual. It was like\u2026 he was blacker, and he was acting like a madman.\u2014 And when you caught this monster, you found these stones?\u2014 Yes. \u2014 The guy nodded his head.\u2014 Did you find both stones in that monster?\u2014 No. Today, I got the same feeling again during the hunt, and we noticed the monster was acting strange in the same way. We found this one today. \u2014 Si Hoon pointed to one of the stones in Kang Yu's hands.The guy was immersed in his thoughts, which were spinning through his head at an incredible speed.'And it's the same feeling of hatred as when we met?'The first thing that came to mind was Magi.It could be assumed that the guy had a bad feeling towards all things containing Magi.\u2014 Si Hoon, when you saw Echidna, did you feel the same feeling of hatred as you did for me?He pointed to Echidna with his thumb, who was quietly sitting next to him.Feeling all the attention directed at her, the girl tilted her head to the side in surprise and tugged at the end of Kang Yu's shirt.\u2014 Kang Yu, do you hate me\u2026?\u2014 No, that's not what we're talking about.\u2014 No, I don't think so. I met Echidna for the first time today\u2026 but I didn't feel any dislike towards her.\u2014 Is that so\u2026So it wasn't the Magi.Although Echidna was a slightly different being, she still uses Magi.'Then\u2026'Kang Yu wondered what else he and the monsters had in common, excluding Magi.But nothing came to mind. Kang Yu lost himself in thought, then suddenly remembered Si Hoon's words that the minotaurs were blacker than usual.'Were they in the process of becoming Hell creatures?'If Magi, entering the body of a human, makes them a demon, it would not be strange if it, upon entering the body of a monster, makes it a Hell creature.Thinking of 'Hell Creature,' the image of the Boer and Hellhound popped in his head.\u2014 Ah! \u2014 A short exclamation escaped his lips.It seemed to him that the pieces of the puzzle were finally put together.'A splinter of the rift.'He remembered seeing the notifications that he'd destroyed a splinter of the rift when he killed those Hell creatures.In addition, upon returning to Earth, he'd heard the voice of the rift.The splinter and the rift.He thought that these two things were bound to be connected.'And Si Hoon intuitively senses the creatures that have emerged from the rift.'The idea made sense.Kim Si Hoon was chosen by the Gaia System, which had sealed Kang Yu's forces upon his arrival on Earth.Si Hoon's role is to defend.He is the one who replaces the damaged System.'The Gaia System was designed to block things from reaching Earth from the rift. In particular, Hell's beings.'In that case, it was not strange at all that the Defender felt a natural wariness towards such creatures.'Does this mean that the Devil's Teachers are aiming to create these 'splinters' right on Earth?'Now Kang Yu finally figured out why they were implanting pure power into the Gate monsters.The guy smiled radiantly.'No wonder Si Hoon can find them.'So far, Kang Yu did not know exactly why they were creating Hell creatures, but he knew for sure that Si Hoon had the ability to find them with ease.Initially, finding the stones resembled finding a needle in a haystack, but suddenly everything turned simple, because now there was a metal detector.It was likely that Si Hoon could sense monsters implanted with pure power even over long distances.\u2014 Si Hoon. \u2014 Kang Yu grabbed his hand.Now the guy was more useful than ever.For the first time, he felt that he was receiving benefit from his constant investment.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026?\u2014 I'd like your help.\u2014 I'm ready to help you as much as you need. What do I need to do?\u2014 Nothing, just walk around.\u2014 Uh, what?\u2014 Just you being around will be a big help to me.To draw an analogy, it was nothing more than navigation.Simply put, it was enough if he accompanied Kang Yu and directed him wherever he felt a sense of hatred.Of course, in the near future, he would play a much greater role than the role of a navigator.But this much was enough for now. More than enough.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu? \u2014 Han Sol took a step back.\u2014 Oh my god! No wonder you two seemed suspicious last time at the hospital! Bullseye!\u2014 Hah?Before he could get an explanation, he noticed the reaction of the two girls.Han Sol's face suddenly turned pale and her body trembled, and Eun Bi's nose was gushing blood from an excess of emotion.Kang Yu reflected on what he just said.'Oh shit.' He immediately pulled away his hand from Si Hoon.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu, if that's what you're saying\u2026'Just don't blush.'\u2014 I'll do my best. Yes. I will follow you anywhere.'You moron, don't blush, I said.'He desperately hid his face in his hands. But it was too late to change anything.'Well, how am I going to explain this?'Han Sol's pale face flashed in his mind.The misunderstanding was definitely set.\u2014 Then, we'll meet tomorrow morning.\u2014 Yes, stay safe.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksDae Su spoke up:\u2014 Kang Yu! Can't I go with you?\u2014 I already told you. We're going to a Gate above Level A. The more people I have to protect, the more dangerous it will be.\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 Or, are you confident that you can stand up to class monsters alone?\u2014 Well\u2026 no, I'm not sure.\u2014 Do you know what that means?\u2014 Okay\u2026 But my name is Kang Dae Su! Even though I can't go with you right now, I won't give up!\u2014 That's right. I'll be waiting for you.Kang Yu smiled broadly.After coming up with a rough plan to resolve the misunderstanding, he said goodbye to Dae Su, Eun Bi and Si Hoon.Although he wanted to go to the Gate right away, there was something else to be done.'We need to come up with an effective plan.'There were many Gates.Recklessly walking through all the Gates would not be very efficient.If he tells Young-ju and Hwa Yeon about this, they could develop an effective plan of action, then things will work out better and faster.'I should go to Red Rose.'It didn't take long to get from his new home to the guild's office, even on foot.He turned towards Han Sol and Echidna, who were standing next to him.\u2014 I'm going to the Red Rose office. I might be back a little late.\u2014 Is there anything I can do to help?\u2014 Not yet.A large number of people will only slow down the work.It didn't take many people to create an effective plan.Echidna and Han Sol both looked at him with disappointment and nodded their heads.\u2014 Then we'll stay home. Be careful.\u2014 Good.Kang Yu waved to them and headed for the office.The girls stood in the doorway and stared at the retreating image of the guy until he disappeared.\u2014 Han Sol, you look tired.\u2014 It's nothing, don't worry about it, \u2014 the girl said, patting Echidna on the head.Echidna grabbed the hem of her dress.\u2014 It can't be nothing. Um, you know, Kang Yu is very grateful to you. I have a special bond with him, so I know that for sure.\u2014 Oh\u2026 Aw\u2026 really?Han Sol's cheeks turned pink and she smiled, taking Echidna's hand.\u2014 It's time for dinner. I'm going to cook whatever you want today.\u2014 Oh oh! Pork! I love pork!\u2014 Heh, okay. Then, let's go to the store fir\u2026The girl trailed off and frowned sharply, her gaze turning serious.\u2014 Who are you?In front of them stood frightening people in red masks who had come out of nowhere.The two girls were surrounded by ten people dressed in robes so black they blended in with the surrounding darkness.\u2014 Are you asking who we are?\u2014 You don't need to know that, \u2014 a second person continued.\u2014 We only need one thing.\u2014 Your lives.\u2014 Now you must\u2026\u2014 Call him.They spoke intermittently, complementing each other's words.Their actions seemed so cohesive that it seemed as if they were led by one mind.\u2014 Call\u2026 him? \u2014 Han Sol repeated.\u2014 Oh Kang Yu.\u2014 Call the guy you were just with.\u2014 And then everything will be over for you.The girl bit her lip.\u2014 I can't do that. I don't know who you are, but I won't follow your\u2026\u2014 Should I just call Kang Yu?\u2014 Eh\u2026 Echidna?\u2014 Wait a bit. I'm going to call now.Echidna, as if not understanding what situation they were in, calmly closed her eyes.Through the special bond between master and summoned being, she called Kang Yu.\u2014 He'll be here soon.\u2014 I like that you think quickly.The scary masked men laughed in unison.Kang Yu, who was on his way to Red Rose, immediately returned.\u2014 Who are you? \u2014 Kang Yu asked, standing between the strangers and the girls.\u2014 You don't need to know who we are.\u2014 Follow our instructions.\u2014 And then we will grant you death without torment.Kang Yu looked at the masked men with interest.\u2014 Are you guys from the Devil's School?\u2014 We don't have to answer.\u2014 We're the ones asking questions here.\u2014 You sound like fools. \u2014 Kang Yu couldn't help but smile.Although they surrounded Han Sol and Echidna, there was nothing to worry about.Not reacting to Kang Yu's words, they continued their speech:\u2014 It's just as he said. This guy is smug.\u2014 A good-for-nothing that knows nothing about life.\u2014 He gets everything he wants from the world, hiding behind Young-ju's skirt.\u2014 Yes, I can see you are narrow-minded.The masked men approached the girls from behind and grabbed them.Curved daggers touched their necks.\u2014 Be careful, \u2014 Kang Yu said.The masked men chuckled.\u2014 It's too late. Nothing you say will change what we do.\u2014 No, I'm not talking about that\u2026 \u2014 The guy broke into a wide smile. \u2014 I'm saying it for you. \u2014One of Echidna's arms turned into a dragon wing and she swung it at the masked man standing behind her.With the sound of breaking bones, he was sent flying back.\u2014 Don't you dare touch me. \u2014 Echidna looked down at him with cold eyes. \u2014 Only Kang Yu can touch me. \u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This\u2026 how could this happen?\u2014 What in the\u2026?\u2014 Your image is collapsing. \u2014 Seeing their disheartened appearance, Kang Yu chuckled.Echidna turned her wing into a human hand again and prepared to use magic.Black energy concentrated in her palm.\u2014 Do something! \u2014 One of the men shouted out, voice laced with anger and irritation.The magic spilling from her hands surrounded the masked men from all sides.\u2014 Retreat!The masked men, trying to avoid the attack, scattered in different directions, one of them grabbing Han Sol along the way. Taken by surprise, she let out a scream for help.Kang Yu stomped his foot.With his hands behind his back, he approached the one who grabbed the girl and swung at him.Grunting roughly, the masked man flew backwards.\u2014 Surround him and attack him!The men in black robes pulled out their weapons.The weapon was one Kang Yu had never seen before: a metal hook with chains attached to it.Nine people took aim and simultaneously attacked Kang Yu with the metal hooks.The guy narrowed his eyes.There was a dangerous energy coming from their bodies.Kang Yu embraced the girl and, applying the Power of Heaven, rose high into the sky.\u2014 ah! Ka\u2026 Kang Yu?!\u2014 Don't move, \u2014 he said calmly, addressing the squirming girl.Flying across the street away from the dangerous masked men, Kang Yu descended to the ground.\u2014 Wait here for a bit.\u2014 I\u2026 I want to help too!She immediately stretched her arms forward and created a charge of Maryok. A bright white light gathered in her palms.\u2014 Favor of Light!At her command, the light entered Kang Yu's body.[You have received the Light's Favor.][Strength +3, Agility +3, Unique Attribute (Magi) +2]\u2014 Oh\u2026Kang Yu looked down at his body with interest upon absorbing the white light.Strength and agility would not help him much, but the two units of Magi were clearly felt.He could feel more Magi flowing through his body.'It's a bit strange that the Favor of Light was able to raise Magi.'But more importantly, Han Sol's buff turned out to be much more helpful than expected.He realized he could look forward to the moment when she would become a high-level Player.'In the meantime\u2026' The guy squinted at the nine red-masked men. 'We need to deal with these guys.'Kang Yu raised his right hand and a black sword appeared from his wrist.Bending down, he used the Force of Fluency and shot his body forward like an arrow.The metal hooks immediately flew towards him.Although he was attacked by nine people at the same time, none of their chains entangled with each other.This was indisputable proof that they were well trained in terms of combat.Kang Yu swung his sword and hit two of the chains flying at him.He was lucky that he managed to duck in time, otherwise the chains would not just brush past his hair but severely injure him.Kang Yu pushed off the ground with both feet and jumped into the air. The two chains aimed at his legs clashed and fell to the ground.The eyes of the masked men flashed viciously.This time, three chains were sent at the guy who had jumped up.He stopped the Force of Fluency and applied the Power of Heaven.Ignoring all the laws of physics, he climbed up at a right angle.All three chains grazed his Black Pearl coat and, tearing it slightly, hooked onto it. Kang Yu flew down at a tremendous speed.[Power of Dark Spear]Small, finger-sized spears formed and hailed down on his opponents, and they immediately stepped aside to avoid the attack.\u2014 Kh!However, one of them did not manage to escape his fat, and his body was pierced by dozens of small spears.Dark red blood immediately poured from his wounds and he fell to the ground.The remaining eight men tried to counterattack.The chains flew at him again.'Although their maneuver was not bad\u2026'Looking at the chains flying from all sides, Kang Yu laughed.They were trying to create a net out of chains.'\u2026They are far from Young-ju.'The guy raised his right hand and aimed at the ground.With a wave of the Power of Hurricane, he turned the chains flying at him in the opposite direction.Even behind their masks, it was evident that the attackers were dumbfounded.\u2014 Quickly\u2026 get away from him!The information they'd received was incorrect.Kang Yu was not at all an amateur hiding behind Chae Young-ju's skirt. Nor did he lack understanding of the world.He was no worse than Chae Young-ju. No, he was certainly even stronger than her.'We need to report to the Cardinal.'After all, Kang Yu played an important role in his plan. If he does not learn this vital information, he will suffer a crushing defeat in the future. The men in red masks simultaneously turned their backs on Kang Yu.\u2014 Where do you think you're going?The guy spread his arms wide.Frost gripped their bodies and their speed of movement slowed before they could blink.\u2014 Echidna.\u2014 Leave it to me, Kang Yu.Echidna held out her arms.A wall appeared in front of the fleeing people. It was usually used for defense, but now it was intended to block them from escaping.They immediately aimed their weapons at the wall.\u2014 It's too late.Kang Yu took a deep breath.He was preparing to use Magi. His arms spread apart, he touched the ground.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'Surface of Blades.'Cracks began to form on the ground, from which sharp blades were sprouting. There were not just one or two. Dozens, hundreds of swords appeared and pierced the bodies of the fleeing men in black.\u2014 Aaaakh!\u2014 Damn it!The masked men were planning to run away, but now there was nowhere to run.Ahead was a wall of blades, and behind was a field strewn with swords.In this short period of time, four more of them said goodbye to their lives. Those who still survived had faces full of despair.Not wasting a second, Kang Yu turned towards them.'This time I can't miss them.'Kang Yu wanted to stop them from acting before they either killed themselves or turn into monsters.Quickly approaching them, Kang Yu grabbed the masked man who had given the order to retreat by his head.Tightly clasping his head, he used the Force of Fear.\u2014 uah!White foam oozed from his mouth and his body trembled.Kang Yu's expression changed.'Did I screw up?'In an instant he'd spent a large number of Magi, but despite this he could not see the horror on the man's face that usually arose when the Force was successfully used.Using the Power of Dominance which supports the Power of Fear, he soon heard what he wanted, though it took more energy.Because his opponents were not weak, he thought it might be worth applying it.'Well, the Power of Fear is not universal.'Kang Yu took off the mask, under which hid the face of a man who looked about 35 years old.With a clenched fist, he punched the man in the face.\u2014 Whose orders are you under?\u2014 Kh\u2026 Die!Kang Yu did not hesitate to break his arm.There was a scream filled with pain.\u2014 I'm not in the mood to give you many chances. So tell me, who sent you?\u2014 Die\u2026 ah!He broke his other arm.The man's legs went limp, wetting himself as black dots blurred his vision.\u2014 Who. \u2014 A voice that knows no compassion.The man's gaze was filled with fear.\u2014 Don't\u2026 Don't know\u2026\u2014 You must know. Speak. If you say it, it'll be much easier for you.The man fell silent, hesitant.\u2014 Death is a trivial thing. You know it very well yourself, \u2014 Kang Yu said calmly.The man tried to swallow, but his throat was dry.Death really is trivial. He knew it himself.In the face of torment and suffering, death was the best wish.The common sense-devouring horror eventually consumed him and he began to speak:\u2014 B\u2026 Beh\u2026\u2014 Beh?As he was ready to speak, one of the defeated men rose from the ground and threw a metal chain.Only this time, the target was not Kang Yu but the man who started talking.\u2014 Do not lose your loyalty to the School!Growing annoyed, Kang Yu clicked his tongue and muttered:\u2014 Armor.His resistance to physical attacks doubled with the effect of his Power Armor.(Reminder: received from Moon Yeon Ho in c36. This effect lasts for 10 seconds.)Additionally, Kang Yu erected a wall in front of him with the Power of Iron Curtain.The man, expanding, eventually exploded like a balloon, taking with him the lives of the other masked survivors.After walking around the site of the explosion, the untouched Kang Yu picked up one of the red masks from the ground.It was a mask depicting the face of a demon.\u2014 How difficult.This time, too, Kang Yu could not find out the identity of the Cardinal.Anger began to take over him.He took a deep breath and exhaled, trying to calm himself.'Now they won't show up again anytime soon.'His eyes flashed.\u2014 So we have to smoke them out.The guy was in no hurry.Tightly clutching the mask in his hand, it crumbled to pieces and fell to the ground.\u2014 They\u2026 they failed.\u2014 What did you say?\u2014 The death of all Shadows has just been confirmed.\u2014 Is this the work of Chae Young-ju?\u2014 We haven't verified it, but there's a good chance you're right.\u2014 Right. It's rare for someone other than Young-ju to be able to defeat the Shadows.Baek Kang Hyun's face twisted into a displeased grimace.He had no idea that the Shadows would be so useless.Most likely, they were killed either by Young-ju herself, or members of her guild.\u2014 How difficult\u2026He even thought that his decision to deal with the girl was in vain, because in the end he only lost important people.A lump of anger rose to his throat from the constant defeats.\u2014 How many of the splinters have been collected?\u2014 About 30%.\u2014 Not bad at all\u2026 \u2014 Baek Kang Hyun nodded approvingly.'They won't be able to find the stones of pure power.'He was confident in this.After all, how can you find something when you don't have the special device to detect it?Baek Kang Hyun smiled broadly, running his fingers over his demon mask.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hahaha! How much progress was made?\u2014 That is\u2026 everything stopped at 50 percent. The stones with pure power were discovered before they could change the bodies of the monsters.\u2014 Damn it to hell!Another blow rang out.Even under the red mask, his trembling gaze could be seen.Their plan was crumbling.It was like pitfalls appearing in a river on which they had sailed beautifully before.But who, who the hell, was so skillfully and purposefully finding the stones with pure power?Naturally, the guy considered:'Could there be a traitor among the Disciples?'But as he continued to ponder this, he shook his head. To prevent this from happening in the first place, they'd carefully selected each of their subordinates.The chances of a traitor emerging were extremely small.\u2014 We're changing directions.\u2014 Ah?\u2014 Let's move on to a different plan.\u2014 Ca\u2026 Cardinal!At the mention of this, the Disciples' faces turned pale.They did have a backup plan in addition to creating 'splinters' by implanting stones with pure power in them.However\u2026'It's pure madness.'What they were about to do would be even worse than abducting people as victims.Simply put, it was an act approaching genocide.After all, even if the backup plan works, the consequences would affect the whole world.The Devil's Teachers in Korea were far from the strongest.Even if you compare them with the Teachers from China or Japan, the difference is huge.Therefore, if they move on to this plan, it would be no different from declaring war on the rest of the world.\u2014 It\u2026 it's too dangerous. Perhaps it would be better to contact the School and discuss the creation of a new pl\u2026 kh!With a wave of Baek Kang Hyun's hand, the Disciple's head fell from his shoulders.\u2014 Create a new plan? Do you think that will fix everything? Ah?\u2014 Geh\u2026\u2014 In a situation where the Japanese are already making their way to the finish line, are you saying we have the leisure to create a new plan?When he mentioned Japan, anxiety mingled with hatred appeared in his gaze.His memories of all the mockery and ridicule he'd endured immediately surfaced to mind, as well as his loss to Japan. The sound of the next Disciple's neck breaking reverberated through the hall.Baek Kang Hyun examined the remaining Disciples with a crazed look.\u2014 Get it ready. I don't intend to repeat myself twice.\u2014 uh- understood!The Disciples immediately rose from the floor and scurried to leave.\u2014 Pleasant to the touch.Kang Yu, looking down at the three stones lying in his hands, smiled contentedly.Just today, they'd found as many as three stones with pure power.As soon as Kim Si Hoon joined his search, the state of affairs immediately changed.Before this, he'd looked for stones like a needle in a haystack, but with Si Hoon, the situation inevitably changed.In the last ten days, with the guy next to him, they managed to obtain 14 stones.Compared to the previous two weeks, during which he could not find even a single stone, this number seemed large.\u2014 Kang Yu, are we done today?\u2014 Yes. The Gate is too crowded now. Let's keep going tomorrow.\u2014 And what are these stones with pure power? Why do they have such an effect on the monsters?\u2014 I'm not sure myself.Kang Yu, even having lived ten thousand years in Hell, did not understand how Magi works and on what principle turns a man to a demon and a monster to a Hell being.'But it doesn't matter.'What matters is that they could interfere with the Teachers' plans by removing these stones from the bodies.And also that he could use them to his advantage.'They must be in shock.'There was a high probability that they, being unaware of Si Hoon's ability to easily locate the stones, would be unable to do anything.After all, the situation could almost be compared to Kang Yu pointing out the treasure in an unknown place to thieves.Most likely, they were completely discouraged by what is happening.\u2014 Either way, I'm glad I can help you.Si Hoon smiled faintly. It was exactly this smile that made people feel flustered.\u2014 Let's go back.Looking away from him, Kang Yu sat in the driver's seat. On the way home, he was lost in thought.'The effect is becoming more apparent.'Of course, Kang Yu didn't know how many stones the Devil's Teachers had.But the concentration of power contained in these stones was able to increase his Magi to almost 90 units.It was frightening to imagine what could happen if they had tens, hundreds or even thousands more of these stones.'If so, they must be preparing for something serious.'During the ten days spent with Si Hoon, they'd found 14 stones scattered across different Gates throughout Korea. This showed that they very well may be in possession of many stones.'What will happen now?'Of course, he did not believe that the Teachers would merely sit back and watch.They were likely to either send mercenaries after them, or they will push themselves to try and follow the plan.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'If only we had a little more information\u2026' The Teachers are clearly focused on splinters of the rift, but it remains a mystery what their main goal is.Kang Yu would gladly guess, but there was so little information that he couldn't even form a guess.'The Teachers know better than I do what's happening.'They certainly had much more information about the rift.It was not difficult to guess this, considering how the Andras Guild knew it was necessary to use mana stones to form a rift, or how the Disciples, with the use of sacrifices, were able to summon a demon from the Seventh Thousandth Circle of Hell.'I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.'In this situation, it would be dangerous to assume their plans, and whatever else they'd be willing to do, with the lack of information.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu.On their way from Suwon to Seoul, Kang Yu noticed Kim Si Hoon's expression turning serious.\u2014 What is it?\u2014 I just got a message from the system\u2026\u2014 What?Kang Yu, not understanding what the guy meant, looked at him questioningly.They're not even on a hunt right now. How could he get a system message?\u2014 What does it say?\u2014 Erm\u2026Before Si Hoon could continue, Kang Yu answered an incoming call from Young-ju.\u2014 Give me a sec.\u2014 Where are you now?\u2014 What's going on?\u2014 Fast! Where are you?! \u2014 The girl hastily shouted.Hearing her speak so frantically as if she'd lost her mind, Kang Yu frowned.\u2014 I'm on my way from Suwon to Seoul. What happened?\u2014 Go to Isu Station! Right now!\u2014 Chae Young-ju, \u2014 Kang Yu said in a low tone. \u2014 Calm down. \u2014\u2014 This is not the time!\u2014 Calm down, I said. Take a deep breath and focus. Don't jabber meaninglessly. Rushing will not solve anything.There was silence, and then he heard her exhale.Kang Yu nodded his head.\u2014 Well, explain it normally now. What happened?\u2014 Gates appeared at the center of Isu Station.\u2014 Gates appeared?\u2014 Well actually, they can't be called real Gates\u2026 They are more like\u2026 a rift. Exactly the same blue cracks that appeared with Orias.A rift.Kang Yu had a bad feeling.\u2014 Are demons coming out of it?\u2014 No. Not demons.\u2014 What is it then?After a brief pause, Young-ju continued in a trembling voice.\u2014 Black energy\u2026 it covers people\u2026 and\u2026 and then they\u2026Young-ju couldn't continue.Though she fell silent, Kang Yu could imagine what was going on there.'Magi is spilling from the rift.'And then the Magi covers people.Based on this, there were not many possibilities of what was happening.\u2014 The humans\u2026 turn into demons.More precisely,\u00a0not\u00a0demons.An unprepared person, receiving such an amount of Magi, turns not into a demon but into a Hell creature.Either that or\u2026 they die right there.One way or another, the number of people who could remain unaffected by so much power was very small.After all, even strong Players could not resist it, let alone ordinary people.What was happening was comparable to the use of biological weapons in the city center.No, this was something with an even more deplorable effect.Because the people who turn into Hell creatures will attack ordinary citizens.\u2014 Please\u2026 come quickly. Hwa Yeon and I are headed to the station too.\u2014 I'm coming.Kang Yu turned his head to the guy sitting in the passenger seat.\u2014 What was written in your message?\u2014 The number of splinters is increasing\u2026 The system is telling me to stop it.Kang Yu narrowed his eyes as the thoughts in his head began to spin at a great speed.A rift that appeared at one of the most crowded stations.The transformation of humans into Hell creatures with the help of Magi.A growing number of splinters.Looking at these three facts, the puzzle began to take shape.Kang Yu's expression twisted.The Devil's Teachers were going to keep the rift open with the help of the transformed Hell creatures.It was because of him and Si Hoon that their original plan failed.And in the end, cornered, the Teachers decided to choose quantity over quality.But the problem was that the victims for this 'quantity' were not monsters, but helpless civilians.\u2014 Lunatics\u2026Kang Yu had never thought of himself as a good person.He did not feel sad about other people's sorrows, nor sympathize with them.He always distanced himself from people who could become an obstacle, and took advantage of everything that could be useful.Cruel and cold.All because he'd lived in a place where it's impossible to live.But even he knew the line.No matter how greedy he was, he did not touch people who could not answer him.(Editor's Note: i.e. those significantly weaker than him.)In this way, he maintained what little humanity he had left.But the Devil's Teachers have crossed all boundaries.The guy pressed the gas pedal to the floor and the car jerked forward with great speed.Having fallen into a desperate situation, they, like mice, were floundering and trying to get out.Only, their floundering turned out to be more harmful than expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Hell creatures, possessing sharp horns and long claws, rushing at people.Like hungry predators, they pounced on a man and tore his neck.There were loud wails all around, and blood was flowing like a river.The woman's face turned pale.\u2014 Don't\u2026 don't look.\u2014 Mom?Without letting the child look behind them, she started running again.Her throat and mouth were dry, and her heart seemed ready to jump out of her chest.But they had no leisure to stop.Otherwise, they will immediately become fodder for those monsters.'Why is this happening again\u2026?'Despair settled in her soul.The humans, becoming monsters, ruthlessly killed other people.However, they have already encountered such a thing.Five years ago, the Gates and the monsters emerging from them appeared all over the Earth.They had seen something similar that day. But this time, everything felt much worse.\u2014 How\u2026 How could this happen?It was not clear where this black energy, that envelops a man, makes him shake and turns him into a monster, came from.A young man who was just carrying a basket around the store now turned into a monster, running around and indiscriminately attacking people.\u2014 Ah\u2026 ah\u2026 Mo\u2026 Mom, it's too hard for me. I can't run anymore.The boy's face was pale.The woman, biting her lip, took the child in her arms.\u2014 I'm scared\u2026\u2014 Just a little more. Everything will be fine, I'll protect you.But the woman was running out of strength.Even if she were alone, running would be difficult. Having to carry a child in her arms was making it all the more impossible.She could only run a little more before one of the monsters would overtake them.She began to cry.\u2014 You\u2026 you can run again, right? Run by yourself.\u2014 Mom\u2026?\u2014 Run!The woman lifted a stone sculpture standing on the ground.However, she herself was well aware that it would not be much use in defending against the monster.But without at least this kind of weapon, she wouldn't be able to buy any time at all for her child.'God\u2026'She prayed that someone would come to her aid.She wished that a savior would appear in the midst of this hell. A savior capable of freeing more people from this torment. She didn't even think about herself. At least the children, at least those who have not yet had time to live their lives.\u2014 Ahhh! Mom!\u2014 Please, run! \u2014 The woman screamed with all her might.Grabbing the stone sculpture, she swung at the monster.\u2014 Kh!Taking the blow, the monster stopped moving for a moment\u2026 but it was only for a moment.Distraught, the monster roared harder than ever and pounced on the woman.She screamed, pushing his body away with both hands.And at that very moment, as a gust of wind blew past\u2026 the monster was torn into two.A guy with a blue sword had defeated the monster.\u2014 You\u2026 you\u2026\u2014 Get out of here quickly, \u2014 said the young man with a dazzling appearance in a low tone.The woman gulped and picked up her child in her arms.Kim Si Hoon, the young man who saved the woman, raised his trembling gaze and looked around: the central district had turned into hell.Wild screams rang throughout. The people who turned into Hell creatures were attacking other humans just like themselves only a moment ago.The guy's hands trembled.Although they looked different now, they were still human only recently.He didn't know if he had the right to kill them so easily.'Listen carefully.' Si Hoon recalled Kang Yu's confident words. 'Once they have become a Hell creature, they cannot return to being human. As soon as the Magi gets them, they are dead. Think of them as dead bloodsuckers. Got it? Think of them as zombies or even the walking dead.'The guy clenched his fists, blood running down his bitten lip.'Don't doubt your actions. If you think too much, you're going to put people's lives at risk. If you have the time to doubt, start moving. In a moment of desperation, draw your sword. Don't let your emotions get in the way. Do everything you can do.'\u2014 I can handle it, \u2014 Si Hoon murmured, responding to the void. He bravely took a step forward.[Special Quest for the Defender begins.][Quest Info: Get rid of the splinters of the rift (1/2789)][Reward: Experience points. When working with a party, the points will be divided among all members.][P.S. Defender, please. Please make sure that the calamity does not escalate.]'This\u2026'After reading the messages that came to him, the guy frowned.The first thing that caught his eyes was the number 2789. That's a huge number.This means that the number of Hell creatures have reached four digits.Isu Station is one of the most walkable places in Seoul,so realizing how many people could instantly turn into monsters made it impossible to stay calm.'P.S.?'Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksLooking down at the end of the message, he was surprised to read the phrase, as if it was personally written to him.He had never heard such suggestions appear in system notifications addressed to Players.'But it doesn't matter.'Now was not the time to think about these things.The guy tightened his grip on the sword.The number of victims will only increase if he wastes any more time.[Dragon Walk]Small wings emerged from his body. Flapping them, Si Hoon flew forward.Swinging his sword, he cut the Hell creature in half with one blow.They were not strong at all. No stronger than the Orcs from the Level D Gate.'But there are too many of them.'Although they resembled orcs in strength, they still belonged to a different kind.And even orcs are capable of causing irreparable harm to defenseless people.'We have to hurry.'Si Hoon raced forward down the street, killing the monsters one by one.Fortunately, each monster took no more than one sword strike.'Even faster!'His body ached from such rapid movements, but he paid no mind to it. The important thing is that the blood of the Hell creatures continues to be shed. Though he was pushing his body to its limits, it did not matter.The killings continued one after the other.He couldn't even hear the words of gratitude from those he saved.Si Hoon was entirely focused on the rapid extermination of the monsters, trying to kill more than was possible.It was like the world had turned into one with only a crowd of opponents for him, one sword in his hands to kill them with.There was a loud notification sound.[You have achieved self-neglect.][You have received the skill 'Fusion with the Sword.][You are changing for the better!]Some sounds were heard from behind him, and Si Hoon turned around.\u2014 Ooh!\u2014 Mr. Hero!\u2014 Thank you! Thank you!The people he'd rescued were lining up, rushing to catch up with Si Hoon.They instinctively knew that the safest place right now was next to the guy.\u2014 Damn it.But following him was much more dangerous.The guy looked up at the buildings shrouded in black smoke.The screams emitted by those transforming into monsters did not stop.'What can I do by myself\u2026'He couldn't withstand thousands of monsters all at once.\u2014 Si Hoon!\u2014 Si Hoon, is that you?\u2014 Dae Su? \u2026Eun Bi?\u2014 And I'm here.\u2014 Han Sol? How did you get here so fast\u2026His question was quickly answered as another girl appeared before him.Echidna. Although her appearance now was a pretty little girl, he knew perfectly well that she was actually a powerful dragon.He immediately understood how Dae Su, Eun Bi and Han Sol had arrived so quickly.And it wasn't just his party on the scene. A little later, he noticed Chae Young-ju and Baek Hwa Yeon dispersing the black smoke.\u2014 Where is Kang Yu? \u2014 Young-ju asked sharply.\u2014 Kang Yu, he is\u2026 \u2014 His gaze rose to the huge rift hanging in the air.But everything around the rift was surrounded by a thick layer of black smile. Nothing could be seen.\u2014 He went to the rift.Pushing off the cracked asphalt, the guy quickly headed towards the rift surrounded by a thick layer of Magi.The closer he got to the rift, the more the surrounding space resembled Hell.Hell, in which he spent ten thousand long years.\u2014 Ah? Aren't you Kang Yu? What are you doing here?A familiar face appeared.'Baek Kang Hyun.'The player ranked #1 in Korea.A strong Player who neither Chae Young-ju nor Hwaran's First Division Commander Jang Hyun Jae could surpass.Kang Yu narrowed his eyes and looked around.The man was surrounded by a large number of Players' dead bodies.\u2014 I'm guessing you also came to see this mysterious rift. It's dangerous here, so you should run away. I, Baek Kang Hyun, will close this rift.He gave a good-natured smile and headed towards the rift.Kang Yu raised his right hand without slowing down.[Power of Metal Axe]Concentrating Magi in his hand, he created an axe.Simultaneously using the Power of Ice, cold air enveloped it.\u2014 Leviathan, \u2014 he said, swinging his right hand.The axe, consisting of icy air, was aimed at Baek Kang Hyun.Baek Kang Hyun flew back with a loud crash.His arms were crossed to repel the attack, and there was no more trace of the 'good man' smile.\u2014 How did you guess? \u2014 he asked in a cold tone.Kang Yu raised the axe in his hand.\u2014 There's not a single corpse of a Hell creature around you.The man fell silent.\u2014 You're completely surrounded by human corpses. One monster couldn't have killed all these Players, so you must have done it.\u2014 Oh.Baek Kang Hyun's eyes flashed with interest.Kang Yu threw the axe over his shoulder and said:\u2014 Don't embarrass yourself, you brute, and put on your mask.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His crazed look became even wilder as he put on the mask.Kang Hyun clenched his fists, looking at the hand in which Kang Yu held the axe, concentrating his strength.\u2014 Get started.\u2014 I like how you think.Neither of them needed long explanations.Realizing that they are opponents, unnecessary words would be meaningless.Kang Yu pulled the axe back to the necessary distance, swung it, and flew at Kang Hyun with great speed.The chilling cold axe made several turns around him.Due to the moisture in the air, it even began to be covered with frost.Kang Hyun crouched down and clenched his fists, forming gloves of Magi around them.It wasn't just power. It wrapped around his hand and took shape.And given that he did not go mad even taking such a force, it proved he could control the Magi.He raised his hands from the bottom up, as if delivering a punch, and successfully repelled the axe flying at him.However, because of how cold the axe was, the gloves were immediately frozen.\u2014 Hmm, \u2014 the guy said in displeasure.The axe contained far greater power than he could have imagined.He stared at the axe with surprise.But Kang Yu, ignoring his surprise and the broken axe, swung his left hand.The axe immediately disappeared and a long black sword emerged from his hand.As soon as the sword and gloves came in contact with each other, there was a pure metallic clang.With each collision, there was a recoil in the area.The earth cracked like thin glass, and cars flew up like little pebbles.Calling this battle a battle of two monsters, rather than people, would not be an exaggeration at all.Baek Kang Hyun drew a nearby truck weighing several tens of tons at Kang Yu.However, Kang Yu's thin blade easily cut it in half and it fell behind him to the ground.In that brief moment that Kang Yu sliced the truck in half, Kang Hyun ducked down and pulled his right fist back.Power began to concentrate in his hands again. However, Kang Yu immediately took note of this.[Heavenly Split]Kang Yu used both the Power of Heaven and Power of Rising Strike.As the name implied, this technique had the power to split the heavens.Their fists collided in a single punch.The ground beneath their feet cracked and collapsed.In the center of the city, a huge hollow has formed, resembling a karst funnel.Both guys, pushing away from the bottom of the tunnel, flew out.They advanced and defended at such great speed that the human eye could not catch all their movements.Kang Hyun stepped back a little and, in his tracks, the asphalt cracked and turned inside out.He looked down at his trembling hands.The moments their fists collided, he felt such a strong energy that he felt as if his body would crack.\u2014 Now I get it. \u2014 Kang Hyun nodded his head with realization. \u2014 It wasn't Chae Young-ju, but you. \u2014\u2014 What about me?\u2014 The one who thwarted our plans. It was not Young-ju, but you.Chae Young-ju was strong.She was a Top Player in the country.'But no more than that.'He'd never personally fought with her, but he knew perfectly well what strength she possessed.She would never have been able to ruin their plans.\u2014 Who are you? \u2014 Kang Hyun looked at Kang Yu in bewilderment.He even started to think that the rumors that this man had become a Player only three months ago were false.The guy showed such power that it could not fit in his head that he was merely a talented newcomer.There were only a few possibilities: either he was a Player who has been hiding his identity for a long time, or he had obtained a fake ID abroad and was now illegally operating in Korea.Kang Hyun thought that the second option was very likely.'But he's not on the World Ranker list.'The World Rankers are the world's Top, consisting of eight people.But even among them, there was no one who would choose to stand in their way.Kang Hyun narrowed his eyes.'Not all of them are really as strong as people think they are.'The World Rankers were simply well promoted. In fact, there were many Players in the world who had more power than they did.A great example of this was the School Cardinals, who possessed much more strength that the World Ranker Players.\u2014 Who knows\u2026\u2014 Well, I didn't expect you to answer right away. \u2014 Kang Hyun exhaled through his nose, trying to pull himself together with a smile. Goosebumps were running through his body, carrying a charge of power behind him. \u2014 So I'm going to make you talk. \u2014\u2014 If you're so confident in your abilities, go ahead, \u2014 Kang Yu replied calmly.Kang Hyun's face twisted.The two monsters met again in battle.The earth shook like there was a strong earthquake.The battle dragged on, and the balance in their powers began to lean to one side.\u2014 Kh! \u2014 Kang Hyun stepped back.There was a crack in the red mask he was wearing. Tearing it off his face, he threw it aside.\u2014 You're really strong.He had no choice but to admit this fact.This unknown Player named Oh Kang Yu was stronger than him.The grin disappeared from his face.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'Again?'Memories of the bitter defeat that had dragged him to the bottom of despair resurfaced in his mind.Fujimoto Ryoma was a high obstacle that he never managed to jump over.And now, with Kang Yu appearing before him, the memories flooded with renewed vigor.\u2014 Interesting, \u2014 he said, baring his white teeth.Kang Hyun looked at the rift and thought that meeting such an obstacle was great luck.All these numerous sacrifices and plans were made in order to give him a chance to overcome that 'wall.'\u2014 Hehehe! \u2014 There was a rough laugh.Seized with madness, he rushed towards Kang Yu.\u2014 You're an excellent subject to experiment the strength I've gained.Kang Yu, not understanding his words, furrowed his eyebrows.\u2014 Come on, come on! There are enough splinters!Kang Hyun took two more steps towards the rift.He split the stone with pure power, and Magi poured out of it like an explosion.At the same time, barely visible streams of black energy from the people who turned into Hell creatures rushed into the split.Although the force coming from them was quite weak, there were many of them, and in the end produced a decent amount.'That's why the splinters were needed.'Kang Yu frowned and turned serious.\u2014 Hahaha! Faster. Faster!(Editor: Harder too? Jkjkjk don't kill me)Kang Hyun couldn't stop grinning. He'd set in motion a plan that would kill thousands of people.The plan was about to be completed right before his eyes.The Magi, passing through the rift, burst out and headed straight for Kang Hyun's body. He opened his mouth and a roar escaped from him, growing louder and louder.Kang Yu heard the sound of growing flesh.On the back of the guy formed slits from which appeared giant wings.His body became several times larger, and his skin began to redden.Following this, sharp fangs and a long tail emerged.And most importantly\u2026Two horns cut through his forehead.\u2014 Grrr!There was a frightening roar, and two yellow eyes gazed at Kang Yu like a wild beast.\u2014 This couldn't be better.Baek Kang Hyun was more than pleased to feel his body overflowing with power.The power he so passionately longed for.A power that will finally allow him to overcome that very 'wall.'There was a roar again.For the sake of this moment, he'd sacrificed thousands of people, but having received what he desired, his conscience did not wake up even for a split second.No, not even that. He believed that for the sake of this, human sacrifice was something to be taken for granted.The law of the jungle!Namely, a strong individual devouring the weak.The law of survival applied not only in the wild, but all over the world.Wanting to seize power, thousands of victims seemed trivial to him.'What is this place\u2026?'\u00a0A voice rang out inside Baek Kang Hyun's head.\u2014 You seem to have come to your senses.'Who are you?'\u2014 My name is Baek Kang Hyun. You can consider me your donor.'What does that mean?'The corners of Baek Kang Hyun's lips twitched and slowly rose upward.\u2014 You'll find out soon, take your time.His gaze settled on Kang Yu.The guy, having a hard time believing that Kang Hyun managed to transform into a demon, slowly looked at him from bottom up.\u2014 How\u2026 Is it really possible?Kang Yu was well aware of what had just happened, but he had no idea that such a thing was really possible.The guy had a feeling that his world was about to turn upside down.'He summoned the demon into his body.'But Kang Yu didn't yet know what exactly Kang Hyun had summoned: either the soul of the demon, the physical component, or both.He also did not know whether a human would be able to fully merge with the demon over time by forming an alliance.But either way, Kang Hyun's actions were beyond reason. And that fact remains that this insane act was successfully completed.\u2014 Well, let's start over!Kang Hyun kicked the ground and the strongest Magi began to emit from his body. So strong that for a moment even Kang Yu felt goosebumps run through his body.He knew for sure that the summoned demon had to be one of the strongest.'It is likely that the demon will turn Kang Hyun's body into his own and that he will become even stronger.'In fact, this is the first time Kang Yu has seen such a thing.Before that, he'd never even considered whether it was possible and what the effects would be.'But it doesn't matter.'It didn't matter at all how it was possible or what would happen to Kang Hyun.Kang Yu turned his eyes to the monster rushing in his direction with wild screams.He stretched both hands forward and Magi began to spill all over his body. Taking a deep breath, the guy focused on gathering strength.\u2014 Die!Kang Hyun's fist was aimed at Kang Yu.Given that his body had swelled to three meters, his fist was quite a powerful weapon. However, it was not difficult for Kang Yu to dodge the blow. With flexibility, he reflected the attack at just the right time.[Kraken's Wrath]His fist, concentrated with Magi, headed for Kang Hyun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Baek Kang Hyun smiled.The force that was tearing from within broke out.He completely changed, ceasing to be like a man, but he did not care at all.He'd become immortal and no longer needed food, but that was not important either.The most important thing was the power he has gained.\u2014 He's damn strong.Kang Yu frowned, feeling the pain in his fist.Kang Hyun had no defensive elements, but the powerful strike that should have hit him did not cause any damage.This means that Kang Hyun indeed acquired the body of a powerful demon.'Everything should be over in a minute.'While Kraken's Wrath is in effect, his Magi is doubled.It should be enough time to defeat Kang Hyun.\u2014 Hmm. \u2014 Kang Yu exhaled thoughtfully.He wasn't exactly cornered. He could easily think of one way to resolve this situation.However\u2026'I'll leave it for later.'The method posed too high of a risk. He couldn't use it recklessly.'For now, my goal is to finish everything within a minute.'Kang Yu crouched down.In order to defeat Kang Hyun in a minute, it was necessary to act in a certain way.\u2014 Fouh\u2026Kang Yu took a deep breath in and out. Concentrating, he began to accumulate Magi in his body.[Bident]He combined two forces: the Power of Hellfire and Dark Spear.But he did not stop there, continuing to build up even more strength.The ends of the split spear began to wriggle like two snakes.[Death Spear]Kang Yu tightly gripped the spear made from three Powers.The flowing Magi in his body began to leave him at a rapid speed.He clutched the handle of the spear and took a pose.\u2014 What is he up to? \u2014 Kang Hyun's eyes filled with excitement.He intuitively understood what kind of power lies in the spear created by Kang Yu.\u2014 Not bad at all! \u2014 The guy laughed.Kang Yu proved to be a worthy opponent to test the power he'd received.\u2014 I like it! \u2014 His cry was filled with madness.He stretched out both hands and concentrated Magi in them, creating even more powerful gloves than before.Baek Kang Hyun and Oh Kang Yu.The two monsters clashed again in duel.\u2014 Ha!Kang Yu, crouching low, pushed off the ground and swung the Death Spear.Kang Hyun jumped up with a stomp of his foot and the spear immediately changed course and followed him.\u2014 And you are persistent!Kang Hyun clenched his fists and flew towards Kang Yu, the spear colliding with his glove.From the incredibly powerful blow, Kang Yu's body was thrown backwards.\u2014 Kh\u2026Kang Yu felt a tremor go through his body, after which everything floated before his eyes, and he could hardly stand on his feet.\u2014 Kef\u2026He coughed up the blood accumulated in his mouth, and his vision gradually began to return to normal.'I can't take him out by force.'Without the Power of a Thousand, Kang Yu would never have the strength to defeat him.But if he decides to use it, he will not be able to support the other three Forces that the Death Spear consists of. Meaning there was no way to finish him off in one shot.The breathtaking battle continued.They struck each other a dozen times in a second.At first glance, it seemed that this was an ordinary hand-to-hand fight, in which neither could surpass the other. But the more time passed, the less favorable the conditions became for Kang Yu.'Only five seconds left.'There's almost no time left.Kang Yu narrowed his eyes. It was time to take more drastic measures.He pulled the Death Spear backwards and, turning it halfway around him, ducked.Preparing himself, he threw the spear forward.\u2014 Hah?! \u2014 Kang Hyun stretched his hand forward and the glove flew towards Kang Yu, while throwing the spear back with his other hand, not using any defensive technique.A satisfied smile appeared on Kang Hyun's face.He kept his fist on Kang Yu with his sturdy gloves made from Magi.At that moment, something unexpected happened.\u2014 Ah? \u2014 Kang Yu gasped.The forces within him began to fade away rapidly, and the Death Spear thrown back by Kang Hyun turned into black haze and dissipated in the air.\u2014 Hahaha! Gotcha! I knew it would turn out like this, because you were in too much of a hurry!\u2014 What\u2026 happened?Kang Yu's face was twisted in confusion.The moment Kang Hyun's glove touched Kang Yu's hand, Magi stopped flowing in his body.Not expecting this, Kang Yu was confused.Kang Hyun laughed smugly.\u2014 This is what they call the Devil's Power.\u2014 Power\u2026?Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Yes. Power.Kang Hyun looked pleased as he gazed at the glove wrapped around the guy.\u2014 First, thanks to the Blockade Power encased in the gloves, I can exhaust the enemy.\u2014 So\u2026\u2014 Yes. It means that you, as a Player, cannot use your powers.Kang Yu concentrated and tried to feel for Magi in his body. But his attempt was in vain.Despite the fact that he possessed not only Player skills but also the Powers acquired in Hell, he could not use either of them. Apparently, the blockage extended to all abilities at once.Now he was no different from the man he was before the trip to Hell.Kang Yu staggered and lightly fell to his knees.The guy coughed up blood and his mind went blank.\u2014 Hahaha! This is what you get for showing off without knowing the ways of the world!Baek Kang Hyun burst out laughing. Looking down at Kang Yu, he smiled contentedly.\u2014 It suits you when you're on your knees.(Editor: :^) )The guy struggled to rise from the ground, but the glove grasping his left hand inexorably pulled him down.Now that all Kang Yu's Magi was locked, Kang Hyun's grip was like an overwhelming burden for him.'It couldn't be any worse.'Now, after returning to Earth, Kang Yu found himself at a disadvantage for the first time.Even at the time of his return, he'd felt quite weak, but at least there was still Magi. The guy looked down at the glove holding his hand.He needed to find a way to free himself from it.He wanted to push it away with his right hand, but the glove clutched firmly on his left hand did not move.He couldn't push it away at all.\u2014 Hehe. You can't free yourself.Chuckling, he kicked Kang Yu once again.With a booming sound, the guy fell to the ground again and coughed up a small clot of blood.Moving even closer, he lifted Kang Yu up by the throat.Due to the fact he'd turned into a monster three meters in height, Kang Yu, raised by his throat, hung high in the air.\u2014 I know smug people like you very well. You are mistaken in thinking that the whole world belongs only to you. Insolent, rude and not knowing any decency.Kang Hyun's hateful gaze was not directed at Kang Yu at all.\u2014 It's time for revenge. \u2014 A pleasant chill ran through his body.The name of the person who had made him experience the taste of defeat surfaced in his mind.Fujimoto Ryoma.Kang Hyun's life, which had previously been going uphill before, fell so low in an instant until there was no light to be seen.He felt like dancing from the mere thought that he finally has the opportunity for revenge.Kang Hyun, still holding Kang Yu by the throat, tossed him aside, where the bodies of the other Players were scattered on the ground.\u2014 Where is your impudence now? Ah? \u2014 Kang Hyun asked him mockingly.He felt pure joy watching the adamant Kang Yu now lying on the floor, exhausted of strength.\u2014 It's time to finish this. You've entertained me well.Kang Yu gripped his chin tightly and looked up at him.Kang Hyun just laughed out loud, gazing at the silent guy.\u2014 Kang Yu!At that moment, Echidna appeared, making her way through the smoke.Seeing the guy lying on the floor and the demon hanging over him, she immediately understood the situation.\u2014 Get away from Kang Yu!Echidna, with eyes full of rage, prepared to gather power to attack.\u2014 A\u2026h?But she, like Kang Yu, could not feel any Magi inside herself.The reason was simple \u2013 her abilities are closely related to the forces of Kang Yu.The moment Kang Yu's powers were blocked, the same thing happened to her.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu\u2026 \u2014 The girl's face turned pale.\u2014 Is that the kid you were with at the mall?Kang Hyun's gaze immediately shifted to Echidna and, laughing, he approached the little girl.\u2014 A\u2026ah!Echidna was caught in Kang Hyun's palm.She desperately pounded his huge fist with her little hands.\u2014 How cute! \u2014 The guy laughed at her attempts, not even feeling her fists.Squeezing the girl even tighter in his grasp, he said:\u2014 You seem to have a great relationship\u2026 I'm interested to see your reaction if she gets flattened in front of your eyes.\u2014 Let go! Do you think you can just touch my body\u2026 \u2014 Echidna shouted, desperately trying to get out.Kang Hyun laughed again.Kang Yu looked up at him calmly.Among the bodies of the Players, he was able to grope for something. It was a long sword, broken in half.\u2014 Hahaha! Do you think you can resist me without your powers? \u2014 Kang Hyun asked with a sneer.The guy, ignoring his words, grabbed the hilt of his sword.\u2014 Recently, you asked who I was. \u2014 He swung the sword, the broken blade brushing past the demon standing over him.Instead, he pointed the blade at his own hand, which was being tightly gripped by the glove of Magi.But his blows were far from strong. They corresponded to the abilities of an ordinary adult male. So of course, he failed to cut off his hand in one go. Still, it didn't bother him much.He continued to swing it like an axe, hitting his right hand and causing blood to trickle down like a river.After the blood appeared flesh, followed by the sound of breaking bones.The word 'crushing' was more appropriate for this situation than 'cutting off.'\u2014 What the\u2026 \u2014 Kang Hyun's eyes widened.Kang Yu did not stop there, shattering the bones, which fell to the ground, mixed in blood.The terrible pain from his hand spread all over his body.But he paid no attention to it.His skin was in tatters from the wreckage of the broken sword.When the sword struck his arm again, his body jerked with all its might, and dark red blood gushed from the cut arteries. He cut the flesh remaining on his hand and\u2026 the ground left hand fell off his body.Along with the glove that held it.\u2014 Now you'll know who I am, \u2014 Kang Yu said, baring his snow-white teeth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he was still not afraid of him.Although the glove would no longer have a blocking effect, the guy still lost an arm.He was well aware that losing a limb in battle for a Player was tantamount to death.\u2014 Who knows. You'll understand soon enough.Kang Yu grabbed his severed arm.Although he could now use Magi, the situation, as Kang Hyun said, has not changed a bit. On the contrary, it just got worse.The effect of Kraken's Wrath had worn off, one of his hands was cut off, and because he'd previously used three Powers at the same time, he was nearly out of Magi.'There's nothing I can do about it now.'Kang Yu took a breath. There was nowhere to retreat.The risk was too great, so he did not want to use this method initially, but in this situation he had no choice.\u2014 What can you do with a body like that? \u2014 Kang Hyun snarled, sharply unclenching the fist in which he held Echidna.As Magi returned to Kang Yu, her powers were also restored, and the girl gently landed on the ground.\u2014 I'll protect you.Echidna stood between Kang Yu and Kang Hyun, but her master approached her from behind and put a hand on her shoulder.\u2014 I'll handle it myself today.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026?\u2014 Stay here, \u2014 Kang Yu instructed Echidna, and she immediately froze.An order given by the master cannot be opposed by a subordinate being.She bit her lip, looking up at him, ready to cry.Kang Yu pretended not to notice her indignant look and stepped forward.\u2014 I knew this would come in handy one day.The guy placed his right hand on his chest.Most of the time, he used the Blade Power, Acceleration, and Dark Spear, as they were easy to use.But they didn't quite suit him.For him, only one of the Powers was the most suitable and effective.[Power of the Devourer]He closed his eyes and focused.His sullenness gradually began to give way to serenity.'Man Ma Jung.'The boundless ocean appeared.An ocean filled with Magi.An ocean, in front of which were three doors.Kang Yu headed to the smallest of them. A chill ran through his body as he touched the doorknob.The ocean behind him was agitated, as if wanting to devour the guy.Kang Yu hesitated for a moment, but then gripped the handle even tighter.The door opened and energy began to spill through the crack.Man Ma Jung.The first door was open.The blood that flowed from his severed hand turned black and vicious.His skin melted downward.From his chest to his throat, and moving to his shoulders, arms and legs, his entire body melted away, replaced by mucus.\u2014 What is this\u2026Kang Hyun frowned as he watched this eerie scene.There was a bad feeling in his throat and the thought came to him that something was going wrong. Very wrong.'What's going on?'The mucus began to form a body. Now Kang Yu looked many times scarier than Kang Hyun who'd turned into a demon.'How is this even possible\u2026'There was only one way out of this situation.Clenching his fists, the demon caught his breath and concentrated Magi into his palms.He created a new glove.Once complete, he stamped his foot and sent his huge body flying towards Kang Yu.\u2014 Ha!His fist, coming into contact with Kang Yu's jelly-like form, formed a large hole through his body.Baek Kang Hyun laughed.\u2014 Hahaha! Nothing has changed! You're still just as easy to attack.With just one blow, he'd practically destroyed half the man's body.Now, unlike the moment when Kang Yu had tried to attack him with a spear, the guy was much easier to hit.\u2014 Hey? React somehow! \u2014 Kang Hyun yelled, a growing anxiety swelling in his chest.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu! \u2014 Echidna, seeing the hole in his chest, turned pale and wanted to rush to his side.But the master's order did not allow her to budge.The girl bit her lip and continued to watch helplessly.\u2014 A\u2026h? \u2014 Her eyes widened.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksSomething unexpected happened.The large hole in the guy's chest began to close, absorbing Kang Hyun's fist. From the black substance, something began to appear.'A mouth?'A mouth with snow-white fangs appeared.And the mouth was not alone. Dozens, hundreds of mouths with fangs began to appear all over his body.\u2014 What in the\u2026 ah!Before he could finish, an agonizing cry escaped from his lips.The numerous mouths with sharp teeth tore off a piece of his flesh the size of several fingers from his hand.Comparing the wound to the rest of his body, the bite was completely unnoticeable. But with more of these bites, then everything would change.The sharp fangs, digging into the hand, easily cut through the man's flesh and skin, tearing it in pieces.Baek Kang Hyun hastily tried to pull his hand out of Kang Yu's chest, but to no avail.He shifted to concentrating Magi in his other fist and swung at the guy.However, the same thing happened again, and his second fist was pulled into Kang Yu's body.The mucus, formed, flew to his eyes.\u2014 No\u2026 Can't\u2026 ah\u2026ah!When the mucus touched Kang Hyun's face, a mouth appeared on it and bit into his eye. He screamed, his vision going white as the intense pain drove him to insanity.\u2014 Wha\u2026 what is this?!He'd never heard of anything like it. He could never have imagined such a thing.Monster? Demon?He did not know the word to describe the creature before him.Fear of the unknown began to envelop his consciousness.Kang Hyun kicked at the ground in anger.\u2014 Do you think that I, Baek Kang Hyun, will lose to such a monster?His body was shaking.He tried to pull his fist out sharply, but it was useless. Kang Hyun made every effort yet with no success. His hands were only drawn in deeper and deeper.The mucus continued to nibble at his flesh, carrying it to Kang Yu's severed hand.Focusing, he concentrated all the Magi in one place.\u2014 Ergh\u2026 hah!Gathering all the energy to his limbs stuck in Kang Yu's body, he made the Magi explode.From the shockwave, nearby sculptures flew to the sides and cars easily flew back.Even so\u2026\u2014 A\u2026ah\u2026It did not help him get out of the matter devouring him.No, on the contrary: the black flesh, as if absorbing the energy, began to devour it with even greater greed.As a result, black mucus wrapped around more of his body, and Kang Hyun's face turned pale.\u2014 No\u2026 no\u2026He saw more white fangs appearing. Now there were not hundreds, but thousands of such mouths.All attempts at liberation were futile.It was as if he was drowning in the depths of the ocean, trying to fight the water.And so the mucus finally covered his entire body, devouring him from all sides. It was like being in a lake full of piranhas.'What's going on?'\u00a0The question rang out in his head.It was the voice belonging to the demon he'd summoned into his body.\u2014 Sa\u2026 save me.'Are you asking me for help? What happened\u2026'Kang Hyun merged his consciousness with the demon's.Of course, by doing this, there was a higher probability of losing control over his body, but in this situation, there was simply no other way.'Ah-ahhh!'However, nothing has changed.Becoming one with Kang Hyun, the demon roared at the top of his lungs, his scream filling Kang Hyun's head.The demon, now seeing what was happening through the guy's eyes, desperately wailed:'Why? Why did you contact this monster?!'\u2014 Did you just call him a monster?'Oh, you fool\u2026 Idiot! I'd rather fight with the great demons: Satan or Baal!'A cry filled with genuine despair.He was discouraged by the agitated, terrified wails of the demon.\u2014 What are you talking about now? How can he compare to the Seven Great Demons?'The Seven Demons? Compare, you say? Wake UP, man!'\u00a0The demon shouted.\u00a0'They're long dead! Destroyed by the very monster in front of you!'\u2014 What\u2026?'He is the greatest demon, the Devourer! Stupid, how could you not know this?'Kang Hyun began to feel the demon's fear from their merged connection.'He is none other than the Devil himself!'\u00a0A heartbreaking cry burst out.Kang Hyun still didn't understand what the demon was talking about.The\u00a0Devil.The ruler of the Ninth Thousandth Circle of Hell.Why would such a being be here on Earth?'It can't be.'It just doesn't make sense.The countless lacerations lost sensitivity, and Kang Hyun stopped feeling any pain.All he had now was a small amount of flesh and remnants of a clouded consciousness.The black mucus pulled together again, returning to Kang Yu and again forming something from it.A huge mouth, able to gobble up the remains of Kang Hyun in one go, immediately swung open.Sharp, big fangs dug into what was left of the monster, together with a sound that could scare anyone, and the mouth absorbed Baek Kang Hyun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He felt as if he was seeing something pouring into this darkness.'Baek Kang Hyun.' The guy began to recall what happened, the image of being devoured by a huge mouth.An image of desperately trying to break out, but ultimately consumed by darkness.As he watched Kang Hyun calmly sink in the ocean, he could not figure out what to do.'Need\u2026 to get out.'He shook his head, but there was only darkness around.The guy pushed off the void with his feet.More and more.And eventually, his body began to rise up.'Kh\u2026'Something grabbed him by the ankle and dragged him to the bottom.The guy looked down.A mouth.A huge mouth sucked him in deep. He sank even lower.He was shaken. Using all the power he had, he'd been able to pull out one leg, but the other was cut off from the sharp teeth.'Now.'The guy waved with both hands, pushing away with his remaining leg as he tried to swim higher out of the darkness. But there were mouths on all sides.The snow-white fangs of a predator and the jaws of a Devourer.His whole body was immediately covered in bites, his arm was cut off again, and his face was ripped half open.Even so, he did not stop.He knew better than anyone that if he stopped now, there would be no turning back.The guy looked up.In the darkness, where nothing could be seen before, there was one open door.He headed in its direction, but the devouring jaw almost reached his waist.With cries of pain, he desperately tried to get to the door, but the devouring jaw did not want to let the guy go so easily.His consciousness clouded again and everything floated before his eyes.'Ah\u2026' He did not understand where he was.The guy could not even remember who he was: neither name, nor age, nor past \u2013 he did not remember anything.In an instant, he even thought that the bottom of this ocean could be quite pleasant and comfortable.\u2014 Kan\u2026 Kang Yu!He heard a voice.

So the source has been eliminated.The news brought calm to him, and he lay back on the ground.Echidna, trembling, stared down at him, transparent tears rolling down her cheeks.\u2014 You were going to leave.Kang Yu remained silent.\u2014 You summoned me, so I know for sure. You almost just died.\u2014 At times like this, you have to risk your life to keep being badass.\u2014 It's not funny!Echidna was really angry and glared at him with displeasure.\u2014 You\u00a0said\u00a0I wouldn't be lonely anymore, that I wouldn't be left alone!The guy reached out to her, wiping the tears rolling down her cheeks.\u2014 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.She cried even harder, falling into his arms.Kang Yu, lightly stroking her head, delved into thought.'As expected, it's too hard to open the door now.'Opening the door.It's a way to forcibly collect Man Ma Jung in one place.Even in Hell, he'd used this method only in the most extreme cases.It doesn't take a genius to figure out why.'If something goes wrong, you'll be devoured too.'Man Ma Jung is great.(Editor's Note: Hard to find an English equivalent. Generally great; huge; strong.)Even in Hell, Kang Yu did not have time to fully explore this vast ocean.Dozens, hundreds of demons.To call that ocean in which all their great energy is collected another universe would not be an exaggeration at all.That is why the place that gathers all their powers together is so dangerous.'But I usually never had problems with the first door before.'Likely because the Gaia System sealed his powers, it became significantly more difficult to control Man Ma Jung.'I can't mindlessly resort to this method.'The risk turned out to be even higher than he'd anticipated.If it were not for the faint voice of Echidna, who called him through the darkness\u2026 he could well have remained trapped at the bottom of the ocean of Magi forever.From now on, he should wait for the moment when the lock set by the System weakens even more so he can access more Magi.'I can't just die like this.'Kang Yu looked down at Echidna hugging him.Although not much time has passed since his return to Earth, a huge number of events have taken place.He could eat tasty food again, relax, and enjoy a pleasant aftertaste.And also\u2026 he has loved ones to protect.He now had a meaning in life.He received a series of notifications:[You defeated the demon of the Eighth Thousandth Circle, Amudscias.][After surpassing the level limit, you will receive the accumulated points.][Magi increased by 5 units.][You have successfully mastered the Power of Blockade.]\u2014 Oh, oh, oh!Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksFive units of Magi!This immediately brought a smile to his face.Given that he now has just under a hundred units of Magi, the five units were a really large number.And with Kraken's Wrath, the effect will be even stronger.'I've finally gone over 100.'Kang Yu opened his status window.Now he had as many as 103 units of Magi!Previously, he only managed to reach a three-digit number with the help of Kraken's Wrath, but now he had 103 units without intervention from a third-party.'I've heard that all World Ranker players have at least three-digit numbers in their stats.'In order to qualify for evaluation from the judges, it was necessary to reach at least Level 85 and have one three-digit attribute.Usually, Players question whether they can even advance to triple digits at Level 89 and Rank 9, but Kang Yu managed to do so while at Level 59.Ultimately, the strength of Players is not determined by the level, but by the well-raised attributes.That is why, even if he decides to fight someone from the World Ranker, he will be no worse than them.On the contrary, considering all the Powers he has, it would not be surprising at all that he will be able to surpass them.Only three months have passed.Yet in three months, he'd risen to the level of World Players and was able to compete with them.'And the new Force is quite effective, too.'The Power of Blockade.This Force was so powerful that it could even block the powers of Kang Yu himself.Despite the fact that it has a drawback \u2013 the glove must touch the target \u2013 it's still incredibly effective.'I think I'll be able to make use of it.' Kang Yu smiled.It's a pity, of course, that he did not manage to overcome the Level 59 crisis yet again, but receiving a new Power and more Magi made him forget about it.\u2014 Kang Yu!\u2014 Kang Yu!\u2014 Hey, are you okay?Han Sol, Si Hoon and Young-ju ran towards him, with Dae Su, Eun Bi and Hwa Yeon trailing some ways behind.\u2014 Absolutely. \u2014 The guy nodded his head and tried to stand up.But at that moment he staggered and fell back to the ground.\u2014 Kang Yu! \u2014 Young-ju held out her hand to him.The chains that flew from her wrists cushioned his fall.\u2014 If it's too hard, just lie down! Don't make people worry about you unnecessarily! \u2014 The girl glared at him. \u2014 And who allowed you to go alone? You yourself warned us how dangerous the Teachers are! So why did you decide to take care of everything yourself?! \u2014Kang Yu just laughed at her loud outrage.Realizing that behind the anger hides sincere concern, the guy's mood significantly improved.\u2014 Well, anyway, everything was successfully resolved in the end, no?\u2014 That's besides the point! Do you know how much\u2026\u2014 Thank you for your concern. \u2014 Kang Yu gently placed his hand atop Young-ju's head.She shuddered with surprise and recoiled sharply from him.\u2014 I\u2026 I wasn't worried! \u2014 The girl shouted, her face turning as red as her hair.Without answering, Kang Yu lay back down on the ground. As soon as the fight had ended, it felt as though his entire body was seized by fatigue.Han Sol approached the lying Kang Yu and, placing her hand on his chest, concentrated her powers.\u2014 Healing Light.\u2014 Oh\u2026Although the fatigue did not completely disappear, the aching pain throughout his body began to subside.\u2014 Not bad at all!\u2014 Because this time I'm at the 5th rank.\u2014 What? You've crossed Level 40?Although he didn't say it out loud, the speed of their increase impressed him.\u2014 This time, Si Hoon got a special quest. And once we completed it, our levels went up a lot.\u2014 A special quest?\u2014 Kang Yu, I'll explain it to you later. For now, I think you should rest.\u2014 Mm. \u2014 Kang Yu nodded his head slightly.'I agree. I feel like I'm about to pass out.'Although he received the Healing Light and his body stopped aching, the pain remained.\u2014 It's hard for you to move, isn't it?\u2014 A bit. \u2014 Kang Yu nodded.She smiled the way hunters do, and lifted his body.Although Han Sol had the appearance of a fragile girl, she was still a Player.One way or another, physically she was definitely superior to ordinary people in strength. That's why it was not difficult for her to carry an adult man in her arms.\u2014 I'll take you home.\u2014 Well, this is a little bit\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu smiled awkwardly.Whatever it was, Kang Yu felt strange upon realizing he was easily being carried in the arms of a cute girl.'I think it would be better if I ask her to put me down.'Although it was difficult enough to move, he could still walk in a straight line.\u2014 Thanks for your help, but\u2026At that moment, something incredibly soft touched his abdomen, causing a pleasant feeling that was impossible to describe in words.Her breasts.His eyes bulged out.\u2014 Think you can walk by yourself? \u2014 Han Sol questioned, tilting her head.\u2014 Oh, well\u2026 ah\u2026Doubt immediately arose in him, generated by the struggle between instinct and reason.However, his hesitation was short-lived.Kang Yu sighed loudly and replied:\u2014 Actually, I doubt it. Oh well, there's nothing I can do about it\u2026 Even though I don't want to force you, it's better than pushing myse\u2026\u2014 In that case, Kang Yu, I'll carry you! \u2014 Dae Su said.\u2014 Ah?But that's not it!\u2014 Hahaha! It would be much more convenient if I carry you, not Noona!(Editor's Note: Noona is what men in Korea call women older than them, usually out of respect and intimacy. Basically 'older sister.')'Don't come near me.'\u2014 Since you can't walk, I can't just stand by!'Dude, please\u2026'\u2014 Kang Yu! Come into my arms!'Go away.'Dae Su took the guy into his arms and he immediately felt the solid, stone-like body with a stench of sweat.\u2014 Kang Yu! I'll take you home right away! Do not worry. Guys, I'll get him home safely!\u2014 But\u2026 your house is in a completely different direction. So\u2026 \u2014 Kang Yu tried to reason.\u2014 Hahaha! For you, hyung, I'll do anything!\u2014 Well, put me down.\u00a0 Maybe I can walk on my own.\u2014 Patients should not strain themselves! Relax!Dae Su concentrated even more strength in his arms, ready to hit the road.The sweat that soaked up Dae Su's entire shirt immediately splashed on the guy.'Oh, no.' His face paled.With a plaintive expression, he reached a hand out to Han Sol.'Please, no\u2026'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, what happened at Isu Station stirred up the whole of Korea. No, this case shocked not only Korea, but the whole world.The Devil's Teachers \u2013 creatures, hiding in the shadows, who were now ready to reveal themselves to the world.However, high-ranking officials were not surprised at all by this news.After all, they have known the existence of Hell creatures for a while now, and they were well aware of the danger posed by them.Governments of all countries tried to find and exterminate the Teachers, but with little effect, because they were strong and carefully hidden from the outside world.In addition, due to the fact that many soldiers from large units had moved to the ranks of Players, forming their own small guilds, the search for the Teachers was difficult.And since the Devil's Teachers have lost the need to hide, and they can act more openly, the number of victims is bound to increase.Korea, the very place it all began five years ago, has remained relatively calm, while unrest is taking place everywhere else around the world.And the reason for this was Oh Kang Yu, who rooted out the leader of the Devil's Teachers in their country.That was how he attracted the attention of influential people to Korea.At a house in Downtown Seoul.\u2014 I think I'm all better.Three days after the incident, Kang Yu finally got out of bed.The aftereffects of awakening Man Ma Jung were not so easy to get rid of, so for the past few days he just continued to sleep, which helped him to fully recover and return to his original form.\u2014 Kang Yu, why did you get up?\u2014 I'm feeling better. I think I can walk.\u2014 Don't strain yourself. Nothing bad will happen even if you rest some more. I'll look after you.Echidna pulled him by the hand and dragged him back to bed.The guy smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u2014 I'm really fine. I've rested well and I feel better than ever.The girl glanced at the lively Kang Yu and for a moment made a plaintive face.After all, she could be around him at all times these last three days while caring for him.\u2014 Kang Yu, just don't overdo yourself.\u2014 Sure.\u2014 I feel like you say that all the time. \u2014 Echidna snuggled up to him and tugged at the hem of his shirt. \u2014 What are you going to do today? \u2014\u2014 I don't know, I'll probably see what and how first.Although he'd heard what was going on, he didn't know for sure.The guy opened the door and went into the living room.\u2014 Ah?In the room sat Young-ju, sipping tea with Han Sol.\u2014 Why did you get out of bed?\u2014 I'm feeling better. I'm more interested in what you're doing here.\u2014 This house was bought with my money, can't I come to visit? Is there a problem?Hearing this, Han Sol laughed lightly.\u2014 Young-ju worries about you, so she visits everyday.\u2014 Wha\u2026 what the hell?! I'm not worried at all! \u2014 Young-ju shouted with some hesitation, and the guy chuckled. \u2014 Anyway, I was going to call you. \u2014\u2014 Call? What for? Everyone around me calls me a patient, shouldn't I act like a patient and lie down?\u2014 You just said everything was fine. \u2014 Young-ju sighed and finished her tea in one gulp. \u2014 First of all, the Hanul Guild is officially disbanded. \u2014\u2014 And the Disciples?\u2014 They were caught\u2026 but just before the interrogation, they all turned into monsters.\u2014 Hmm. \u2014 Kang Yu swallowed.He guessed it was done to prevent information leakage.\u2014 What about the school?\u2014 They began to be noticed all over the world\u2026 but so far only in Korea have they shown themselves so clearly. The Government is still dealing with this.Of course, the situation could not be resolved quickly, considering it affected more than a thousand people.Kang Yu nodded his head and took out his phone, opening a news site.'A demonic pseudo-religion spreading all over the world. What is their main goal?''The appearance of a hero! Dragon Kim Si Hoon!''According to surviving witnesses, the Dragon Kim Si Hoon was sent to us by the heavens themselves!''Creation of a fan club for Kim Si Hoon. Interest in Dragon Kim Si Hoon is growing all over the world.'\u2014 All the news is about Si Hoon.\u2014 Because he was the first in the Isu area before anyone else and started rescuing civilians by killing monsters.He had the appearance of stars, and he behaved like a hero, saving ordinary people from death. A Player that no one had heard of until now.It would be strange if he didn't get everyone's attention.\u2014 Don't you regret that all the glory was taken from right under your nose?\u2014 Not a bit. \u2014 The guy shrugged.In fact, there was nothing more annoying than attention.Therefore, Kang Yu actually pitied Si Hoon for receiving so much attention from this incident.\u2014 Ah, and another World Ranker Player came to Korea.\u2014 World Ranker?\u2014 Yes. From Zheng Jin Mun\u2026 The Chinese guild.\u2014 Did he come to bring Si Hoon to his group?\u2014 I don't know. He hasn't shown himself yet.\u2014 Hmm. \u2014 He nodded again.He thought that the World Rankers had little to do with him.\u2014 So, can we consider the problem of the Devil's Teachers in Korea almost solved?\u2014 Yes. But it seems that the Teachers in Korea were only the tip of the iceberg. \u2014 Young-ju narrowed her eyes.Glancing at her, Kang Yu asked:\u2014 But you won't end your revenge here, will you?\u2014 Of course not. I won't rest until they're all gone.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Good choice.Thanks to what happened three days ago, he realized for sure that the Teachers posed a great danger not only to him, but to the whole world.And given that the Gaia System is continuing to weaken, no one knew what else they might throw out.'I had no idea that he would be able to summon a demon into his body.'Merging with a demon was something truly incredible.\u2014 So far, we still haven't caught anyone's tail?\u2014 Yes. Sometimes they give themselves up, but it's not something easy to get hold of.\u2014 I see. \u2014 Kang Yu squinted.As it was now, it would be difficult for him to travel the world to personally assess the situation.'It's like banging your head against a wall.'Even in Korea, it'd been difficult to find them. It would be senseless to go to other countries without knowing their exact location.'We need to become even stronger.'If you cannot attack the enemy fortress, you need to build a huge wall around your own.So huge that the enemy could not even look behind it.'First of all, I need to deal with the Level 59 problem and the highest degree of demonic form.'Having reached the limit in terms of level and not knowing the last condition for achieving the highest degree of demonic form, there could be no talk of development.However, both problems were serious, and he did not know which one to tackle first.'In that case\u2026'He couldn't waste time on something that could last forever.Therefore, it was important to take on what he is more likely to accomplish.'And I'll start with what I can do right now that can help me.'The first thing that crossed his mind was raising his Magi through hunting.However, given that it has already exceeded 100 units, increasing it could also take an indefinite amount of time.Therefore, this method could not be considered effective.Kang Yu calmly shut his eyes and pondered.\u2014 Ah!At that moment, he thought of a great idea.Something he could do right now that would also help him.'I need to call Si Hoon.' Kang Yu smiled, and took out his phone.Yep it's us, Ce~~ntinni.\u2014 Kang Yu! Are you feeling better?Less than 20 minutes after Kang Yu's call, the guy ended up at their home.Kang Yu nodded slightly.\u2014 How are you? I flipped through the news, you're in all the headlines.\u2014 Ha! Don't even mention it. As soon as I'm on the street, I'm surrounded by people. It's impossible to hunt, \u2014 the guy said wearily, pulling off his mask and removing his cap. \u2014 I think I need to get a bigger mask. \u2014\u2014 Well, what can you do\u2026 Stay strong.\u2014 Honestly, I'm not very happy about it.\u2014 Why?\u2014 Well, to be honest, the one who solved this problem wasn't me, but you. You're the one they should be calling a hero, \u2014 the guy said with pity.He seemed to believe he was taking the credit from Kang Yu.\u2014 Don't talk nonsense.\u2014 Is it fine that people don't know about any of your merits?\u2014 I wouldn't gain any benefits taking the spotlight, so it's alright. You said it yourself that it's exhausting.\u2014 Right\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon confirmed.But his face reflected pity that Kang Yu could not gain recognition for his hard work.\u2014 I'd hate to deal with something so tiresome.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 Well, if you say so. Why did you call me?\u2014 I have a request for you.\u2014 I'll do anything for you, \u2014 the guy answered instantly, devotion blazing in his eyes.Hearing such an answer, Kang Yu chuckled.\u2014 I want to learn martial arts.\u2014 Martial arts? \u2014 Si Hoon tilted his head inquiringly.\u2014 Yes. Fusion with a sword, was it? You said you improved your skills.(Reminder: He's referring to the skill Si Hoon mastered recently.)\u2014 Yes, but\u2026\u2014 It's okay if I'm a little worse than you. I just want some kind of base.\u2014 Oh\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon swallowed.He doubted not in the abilities of Kang Yu. He carefully continued:\u2014 I'm not good at it enough to teach you.Kang Yu was at a much higher level than himself.If he teaches something to Kang Yu, it would look as if the student is explaining to the teacher how to teach correctly.Kang Yu shook his head.\u2014 No, I don't think so. I may have great powers, but in terms of weapon-related discipline, it's exactly the opposite.What he can learn from Si Hoon would ideally complement his collection of abilities and skills.'Let a great warrior not stand behind me\u2026'It would be a pity if such a person nearby, especially the descendant of Musin, does not render any help.Now that he has reached his limit, he had no choice but to start studying martial arts.'Even though I didn't think I'd need it.'\u2014 Okay. \u2014 Si Hoon nodded. \u2014 I will teach you martial arts. \u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although I'm getting help from the guild, there's another person I've sworn allegiance to. \u2014\u2014 Sworn allegiance?\u2014 Can you reveal his identity?\u2014 I'm sorry, but no\u2026The people surrounding him exhaled with pity.\u2014 Ah\u2026 Then at least an autograph?\u2014 Mm\u2026 That's a little bit\u2026 \u2014 He faltered, his cheeks turning red.Kang Yu intervened in their dialogue:\u2014 Finish this so we can go quickly.\u2014 Oh, yes! Coming!The guild members glared viciously at Kang Yu.\u2014 What kind of scary jerk was that?\u2014 He's kind of rude!The guy, hearing the whispers behind his back, made a sour look.Objectively, Kang Yu wasn't scary at all. No, even if you call him beautiful, it wouldn't be an exaggeration.However, in comparison to Si Hoon, he looked ordinary. Anyone in contrast to Si Hoon would look terrible.\u2014 I'll go tell them off and come back. How dare they call you a scary\u2026\u2014 Forget them, let's go.If he starts defending someone else now, it would only cause discontent.They took the elevator to the basement floor, heading for the training room.\u2014 Ah, it's you. I heard from the Commander that you were coming.Upon entering the hall, they met Park Hyun Woo.\u2014 I've heard about what happened to Hwaran's room.(Reminder: You couldn't have forgotten how they wrecked that training hall right?)\u2014 Ah\u2026\u2014 They say you've got a lot of money. Hahaha! \u2014 He smiled dryly as he shook Kang Yu's hand. \u2014 Please, let's do without it this time. \u2014\u2014 We'll take that into account.\u2014 Hahaha! I hope so.There was weariness in his smile.'I heard he's in the management department now.'Given the frequent incidents lately, he must have a lot of work to do.Kang Yu sympathetically watched the departing Hyun Woo and headed inside.\u2014 Well, let's start right away.\u2014 Sure.Si Hoon, entering the room, immediately turned his head towards the training equipment.\u2014 Kang Yu, what kind of weapon do you prefer?\u2014 I don't know\u2026 I don't have a favorite.To get out of a predicament, he usually used everything that came to hand.Si Hoon nodded.\u2014 First, before you start learning techniques, you need to decide on the weapon you'll use. Hmm\u2026 let's start with the sword, since I use it the most often.\u2014 Sword, you say\u2026Thinking about it, the most familiar weapon for Kang Yu was a spear.Of course, he uses the Power of the Blade quite often, but it is noticeably different from the sword that Si Hoon is now offering him.Since his blade appears from the back of his hand, it resembles an assassin's blade.'But if I'm going to learn from Si Hoon, it's better to use a sword.'The guy picked up a sword for training.\u2014 Let's start with the basics of the Rapid Dragon Strike. I think you can master them in a day.The Rapid Dragon Strike technique consists of eight positions.Si Hoon's sword moved smoothly, as if flowing along the river. After demonstrating all eight positions, he turned to Kang Yu.\u2014 Repeat after me.\u2014 What\u2026?\u2014 Just do what I showed you.\u2014 But how can I repeat what I've only seen once?\u2014 It's enough to repeat the movements. \u2014 Si Hoon looked at Kang Yu blankly.Kang Yu, in turn, raised his sword with a questioning glance and quickly sliced through the air with rough motions.\u2014 Seeing it for the first time, can you repeat it? \u2014 he asked Si Hoon, trying to make a point.\u2014 Of course.Si Hoon, as if asking what kind of nonsense this was, raised his sword and perfectly repeated the movement he'd just seen.'What's wrong with him?'Kang Yu felt a little awkward.\u2014 Kang Yu, don't be like that. Just repeat it.\u2014 I'm telling you, I can't.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 There's nothing we can do about it then. In that case, let's study the positions one by one.Si Hoon stretched his neck and showed the first movement.He swung the sword from the top of his head to the waist, thrust forward, then lifted it up again.Kang Yu, following Si Hoon's demonstration, swung the sword from the bottom up.\u2014 No, not like this.\u2014 What? It was the same thing.\u2014 You're using too much when you lower the sword. This creates too much recoil when you lift it again.Si Hoon once again showed 'the right thing to do,' and Kang Yu repeated once more.\u2014 That's not it. It's too weak this time.'What is going on?'Kang Yu thought that this was turning out much more complicated than he expected, and swun his sword again.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Try doing it a bit weaker this time.Another attempt.\u2014 No. Too weak this time. Again.\u2014 A little stronger.And so three hours passed.Repeating the same movement over and over, irritation began to show on his face.\u2014 Si Hoon, did you also fail at first?\u2014 R\u2026 right, \u2014 the guy replied, averting his eyes.Kang Yu saw his expression and immediately guessed the guy was lying.\u2014 It's fine, you can tell me the truth.\u2014 I mastered them after two or three tries\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon answered carefully.Kang Yu chuckled wearily.'You're telling me it only took two or three times?'Putting the right amount of force into the blow was as difficult as filling a glass to the rim with water with closed eyes.Since the guy was more familiar with a completely different weapon, he couldn't sense when he was doing it right and when he wasn't.\u2014 Phew. Let's leave the amount of force for later and move on to the movements themselves.\u2014 Mmm. Yes, let's.Si Hoon looked at the guy questioningly but still nodded.There were eight positions in total.Kang Yu repeated them one by one, slicing through the air with his sword.'It feels like something goes wrong in the end.'Moving from position to position, Kang Yu did not like any of them.There was a feeling like his body was rejecting an alien object inserted during an operation.\u2014 Why can't I smoothly link the fourth and fifth positions? \u2014 Kang Yu turned his head to the guy.Aren't mentors here for moments like this?Si Hoon smiled cheerfully and replied:\u2014 Don't get too hung up on the flow. Just let the sword continue your movements.\u2014 What?\u2014 You're too focused on doing things perfectly. Just trust your body.\u2014 Erm\u2026Kang Yu bowed his head and swung his sword. As Si Hoon suggested, he tried not to ponder every move.Although it sounded simple in words, in fact, it did not work.'Why?'It seemed as if the awkwardness he'd previously felt overwhelmed his mind.Kang Yu, trying to apply Si Hoon's techniques to himself, once again was convinced that he was a true genius.He immediately remembered an old interview of one of the pro-Players, with whom he now absolutely agreed.What is a trifle for one is a real problem for another.Since something for one person may be self-evident, they could not understand how difficult it is to another person.\u2014 Hmm.In less than a day, Kang Yu realized one very important detail.'Si Hoon has no talent for teaching.'Because he was so talented, he couldn't explain 'how' to do it.Without the same talent, he could not learn anything from him.\u2014 I think I should give up. \u2014 Kang Yu clicked his tongue.\u2014 Wh\u2026 what are you saying? Maybe my skills really aren't good enough for you\u2026\u2014 That's not it. Quite the opposite, actually.\u2014 The opposite?\u2014 You're too talented.Si Hoon pressed his lips together as Kang Yu sighed and turned away from him.\u2014 Let's end this. There will certainly be another chance later.\u2014 Ah\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon uttered briefly.It seemed that Si Hoon was upset about missing out on his chance to repay Kang Yu even a little for his kindness.\u2014 Kang Yu, don't say that. Let's try another technique.\u2014 Another one?\u2014 Yes, it's basic. I can definitely explain it well.\u2014 Hmm\u2026After a brief moment of hesitation, Kang Yu nodded his head.Even if it doesn't work out again, it'd be better than not trying at all.\u2014 First, observe how I use force.\u2014 Okay.Kang Yu, using the Power of the Observer, began to watch the energy flowing through Si Hoon's body, sourced from the center of the abdomen.'I think I can handle this.'Kang Yu thought it would be easier for him to use his inner strength than his physical strength.The guy, assuming a lotus pose, continued to observe the movement of energy in Si Hoon's body.[Initiating the Lord of Magi effect. You have increased the ability to control Magi.][You have successfully learned the Heavenly Dragon Basic Technique.]'Oh.'His attempt was suddenly successful.Applying the learned technique, Magi immediately formed a circle in his body.'Ah?'He immediately felt a clot of Magi concentrated under his belly button.Not just concentrated, but as if it formed something solid.'This\u2026'It was a familiar feeling.The image of a black stone surfaced in his mind.[You have successfully created pure power.][You have successfully unlocked the last condition for achieving the highest degree of demonic form.]'Si Hoon\u2026'A pleasant shiver ran through his body.It was blind luck.He was able to unlock the last condition of achieving the highest degree of demonic form at the most unpredictable time, in the most unpredictable place.'Boy, I adore you!'Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wonder if the power I created is different from the one used by the Devil's Teachers?' Kang Yu tilted his head and focused on the pure power formed in his abdomen.At first glance, the pure power that formed through concentrated Magi was no different from that used by the Teachers.But taking into account that his pure power was created on the basis of Magi, then they are radically different.'They are of the same type, but they differ in strength.'A perfect comparison was the difference between an Americano and Espresso.The pure power created by the Masters was diluted with water, while Kang Yu's was an extracted drink.Of course, depending on the percentage of 'water,' the extracted force will also vary.Kang Yu concentrated strength in his fist.Although Kang Yu was not using any of the Powers, he felt a tremendous destructive energy in his fist.To test the newfound strength, he struck a steel doll in the training room.The solid steel shattered from the impact alone, crumbling and dissolving into thin air.\u2014 Wow\u2026 wow, you're amazing, Kang Yu! \u2014 Si Hoon said in a voice filled with envy.He could cut the doll in half himself, but Kang Yu did something incredible \u2013 he didn't just cut it apart, he made it evaporate.\u2014 Have you learned how to use the technique?\u2014 Yes, thanks to you, I learned something really important.Since this was the first use of the power he created, he wanted to test its power, and spent all his energy in one blow. However, he understood that if he possessed a larger number of Magi, he would spend only a third of his pure power.'Well, this is just the beginning.'There's no need to hurry.Now that he's mastered this technique, he simply had to build up Magi to strengthen the pure power.For him, a man who was able to cope with Man Ma Jung, dealing with inner energy would not be a problem.Kang Yu settled into a lotus pose again and concentrated, applying the Heavenly Dragon Technique.'I don't think it's necessary right now.'The guy straightened his legs and got up from the floor.As long as the situation wasn't urgent, then he could calmly continue to use the technique even in everyday life.\u2014 Ka\u2026 Kang Yu, that's dangerous!\u2014 Ah? What's dangerous?\u2014 If you rise from the lotus position in the process of performing the technique, you may experience deadly disturbances in your body!Si Hoon's eyes widened as he warned the guy of the danger.However, Kang Yu didn't even stagger when he got up\u2014 Did you\u2026 suspend the technique?\u2014 No, I didn't.\u2014 Then\u2026 you mean you can use it on the go\u2026?Si Hoon looked at the guy in disbelief.He knew, of course, that there were techniques that could be used while moving around, but the 'Heavenly Dragon' was definitely not one of them.This was a technique that requires concentration to get results.However, Kang Yu was able to do something incredible and step over this requirement.\u2014 How\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon stared at the guy incomprehensibly.Kang Yu was able to apply the Heavenly Dragon Technique without concentration, even though the great Musin spirit himself said that it was impossible.\u2014 It's not that hard. Does it involve the life force of a person? You can simply differentiate them when the body is in motion.\u2014 Won't the forces move after the body?The reason for using this technique in the lotus pose is simple: the energy accumulating in the body changes direction following the movements of a person.Everything is complicated because the flow of energy moves in different directions, and if a person is moving, then it is difficult to make sure the forces do not collide. No, it's not just difficult. More precisely, it is almost impossible.\u2014 They can be calculated to make sure they don't go astray.Seeing how lightly Kang Yu spoke of it, Si Hoon bit his lip.Although the guy talked about it as if it was a trivial thing, he perfectly understood how complex and incredible the processes taking place in him were.Kang Yu's actions were so crazy that it could be compared to a madman walking along a cliff with his eyes closed \u2013 just one wrong step could lead to death.\u2014 As expected\u2026 nothing intimidates you. \u2014 Si Hoon shook his head with a pale face.Kang Yu laughed.Controlling the energy flowing through his body was nothing compared to controlling Man Ma Jung.'If it can be called a talent, then I'm definitely gifted, but\u2026'Kang Yu thought this wasn't the case at all.This was simply the result of his desperate attempts to survive for a long ten thousand years, so as not to be completely absorbed by the Magi.That's why his skills could not simply be called talent.\u2014 So, how about studying another technique?\u2014 Let's do it later. For now, this will be enough.As Kang Yu had discovered a way to create pure power, he wanted to focus on this technique.'If it all works out\u2026'Kang Yu thought about the final condition to get his 6th Special Ability.So far, he did not know what it would be or what effects it would have, but it certainly couldn't be negative.'On the contrary, there's a high probability that it will be a great asset.'There was little left to achieve the goal.He had a clear purpose and a plan of action, so there was no reason to postpone it.'First, I will focus on the technique.'Kang Yu, calmly using the Heavenly Dragon, felt the pleasant power form where the Magi was concentrated.'I should try to create a little more pure power.'Kang Yu smiled, satisfied, and turned his eyes to Si Hoon.\u2014 We're done for the day.\u2014 We're leaving the rest of the techniques for later?\u2014 Yes. Is Heavenly Dragon the most powerful of all concentration techniques?\u2014 Yeah. I think the more I learn from Musin, the more techniques appear, but right now this is the most powerful.\u2014 Oho~This means that as Si Hoon develops, Kang Yu, too, will be able to learn something new.'Si Hoon, I hope for your rapid development!' He looked at Si Hoon like a gardener looks at his fruit, wishing for it to ripen faster.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksOf course, he wasn't going to just watch from the sidelines.\u2014 Si Hoon, how about we go to the Level S Gate together next time?\u2014 Where? The\u2026 S Gate?\u2014 Yes.\u2014 I appreciate that you trust me so much, but our party is too weak to hunt in the Level S Gate right now.\u2014 It's fine. I'll take the driver's seat.\u2014 Huh?\u2014 All you have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride.A special bus ticket for a quick promotion called Oh Kang Yu.\u2014 I'll show you my driving skills.Aye, say it with me, this is translated by C-e-n-tinni!\u2014 Are you leaving? \u2014 Park Hyun Woo approached them on their way out of the training hall.\u2014 Yes, thanks for lending us the hall.\u2014 You won't see the Commander before leaving?\u2014 Tell her that I'm very busy today and will drop by next time.\u2014 Haha. The Commander will be upset. \u2014 Hyun Woo smiled slightly and nodded his head. \u2014 Well, you're welcome to visit any time. \u2014\u2014 I'm the one who should thank you for the warm welcome.The three exchanged handshakes.\u2014 By the way, did you hear that Zheng Jin Mun came to Korea?\u2014 Yes, I heard.Zheng Jin Mun.A guild dominated by Sword Ruler Zheng Mu-jin, one of the Top 8 Players worldwide.The Players of their guild, like Si Hoon, possess a unique aura. And they did not resemble ordinary guilds, rather, they could be called a 'legion.'\u2014 People say\u2026 that they've started to act.\u2014 Hmm\u2026 and why are they here?\u2014 This is still not clear.Kang Yu nodded.\u2014 I'll take that into account.\u2014 Be careful. If you mess with them, you may be in danger.Their guild was on a completely different level than the Korean ones.First, the number of Players in their guild was close to ten thousand.Considering the number of Players in Red Rose hardly exceeds a thousand, the difference is massive.\u2014 Hahaha, don't worry.\u2014 Well\u2026 I think you should understand and know to avoid them.\u2014 No, there's absolutely no need for that.Hyun Woo looked at the guy questioningly.\u2014 Even if we run into each other, I'm not in danger at all, \u2014 Kang Yu laughed.There was silence.\u2014 Well, we'll be going now.Zheng Jin Mun.If they were poking their noses in his business, there was no need to run away from them, because the principle of survival is simple: 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth.'If you give in easily, everything will be taken away from you. Once you bow your head, you will be brought to your knees.However, in the event that you realize you really cannot win, escape is a must.It is unwise to go out on a battlefield only to await death.'But that's not the case for me.' Kang Yu knew the limits of his abilities.Although he was unable to regain all the strength he'd accumulated in Hell, he was not so pathetic to walk on Earth with his head low.\u2014 Si Hoon, let's go.\u2014 Let's go!Si Hoon glanced at Kang Yu, who was walking away, and quickly caught up with him.Leaving the Red Rose building, Kang Yu entered his car.\u2014 I'll give you a lift home.\u2014 Don't worry, I can take the subway.\u2014 Come on, you've spent so much time on me. This is the least I could do. Oh, and you should pick a car for yourself.\u2014 N\u2026 no, Kang Yu. It's already enough that you help with mom's hospital bills\u2026\u2014 It'll make me feel better. And if I call you, you'll be able to come to me quickly without any problems.\u2014 Kang Yu\u2026 \u2014 He choked as he uttered this, his eyes turning red.Kang Yu broke into a smile.'Really, what would he do without me?'Today, Si Hoon had given him a lot, and the car is nothing in comparison.Even so, he reacts so naively.Anyone could fool him.'I'll be there to make sure that doesn't happen.'Thinking this, he drove off to Si Hoon's house.\u2014 Ah?When they arrived at the house which Kang Yu had visited several times before, he saw men dressed in dobok*.(Note: Dobok is a special uniform for taekwondo. White uniform, light trousers and jacket with a belt over it.)\u2014 Who are you? \u2014 Si Hoon asked, getting out of the car.The men in uniforms looked at him. One of them approached Si Hoon and began to speak in broken Korean:\u2014 My name is Nan Gong-jin. I am the Commander of the third division of Zheng Jin Mun Guild. The Sword Ruler wants to see the Korean 'Dragon.' Follow us.\u2014 What? Sword Ruler\u2026 Are you talking about Zheng Mu-jin?Hearing the name of one of the strongest people in the world, Si Hoon shook.Nan Gong-jin's eyes gleamed.\u2014 Don't say his name as you please. Follow me. The plane is ready.\u2014 What\u2026 \u2014 Si Hoon hesitated.Kang Yu put a hand on his shoulder and pushed Si Hoon aside, taking a look at Nan Gong-jin.\u2014 You really don't know Korean.\u2014 What?\u2014 You jerk, why are you being so impolite?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Kim Yeong Hoon? No, I definitely heard he was in prison.\u2014 There is something dearer than blood in this world.He stared blankly at the guy. It seems that he could not understand such a 'deep' sentence.\u2014 Do you know what a named brother is?\u2014 Ah\u2026 that's what it means.Nan Gong-jin nodded his head and exhaled sharply.\u2014 We're not interested in you. The Sword Lord wants the Dragon. Get out of the way.\u2014 I don't care.\u2014 Watch your tongue, \u2014 the man replied with hatred.Nan Gong-jin turned his eyes to Si Hoon.\u2014 If you don't want to see him get hurt, just follow us, Dragon.\u2014 Don't be rude to my brother.Disregarding the title of Sword Lord, Si Hoon stepped forward. Taking the sword in his hands, fury began to emit from it.Although, of course, his fear of the unknown still remains.He was the best player in China and possessed enormous strength.The President of China himself listened to him, so it was clear why even his subjects communicate with people in such a way.But with them threatening Kang Yu, things were different. He was the one who pulled Si Hoon out of his Hell-like life.He wasn't so cowardly as to watch his savior be bullied.\u2014 Ooh, pulled out the sword, huh? \u2014 Nan Gong-jin narrowed his eyes. \u2014 Oh Heavens, see, we didn't mean to harm you, but now that you've pulled out your Dragon Sword\u2026 \u2014Nan Gong-jin thought about brutal methods.'Although the Sword Lord asked us to deliver it unharmed\u2026'But if you think about it, why should he grovel in front of a newcomer like Si Hoon?Nan Gong-jin reached for the hilt of the sword tucked in his belt.However, Kang Yu stood in front of him, preventing him from drawing his sword.\u2014 Don't do it.\u2014 Tch\u2026 what the heck\u2026\u2014 You moron, you're dead if you do that.At that moment, he noticed Kang Yu's hand had slid to the hilt of his own sword.Nan Gong-jin was strong.He was one of those Players with a unique aura with impressive fighting skill, so naturally he should be stronger.But did he just let someone touch their sword?\u2014 Kh! \u2014 He immediately stepped back, looking at Kang Yu with caution and some confusion. \u2014 How\u2026? \u2014(Editor's Note: To clarify, he's so strong and well-trained he should've noticed if someone was about to touch their weapon and pose a threat.)He suddenly realized that there was not a single thought in his head.\u2014 I'll tell you now: you're not at a loss, you're just weak. So don't console yourself and make excuses.Wrinkles formed on Nan Gong-jin's forehead, and without any hesitation he pulled out his sword.\u2014 Stupid Koreans\u2026 ah-aah!A scream echoed around the area.The man did not have time to finish, as Kang Yu approached him and twisted his wrist, causing the sword to fall from out his hand to the floor.\u2014 Don't bring nationality into this. Don't you feel ashamed? \u2014 Kang Yu continued to shame him. \u2014 What does the country have to do with it? You should repent for such words. You empty-headed, lousy bastards who go to other countries without a drop of patriotism. \u2014\u2014 Here's the thing\u2026\u2014 Hey, do you think that such expressions, pronounced in a foreign country, will make a good reputation for your country? Ah? Think of your country before you blurt something out, you idiot. \u2014\u2014 Raah! \u2014 The man, as if infuriated, threw himself at Kang Yu.The guy dodged easily, swiftly raising his knee to kick his opponent. Nan Gong-jin, clutching his stomach, fell to the ground.\u2014 Kh\u2026 ah!\u2014 Oh, you!The men behind him took out their swords.Kang Yu continued in a threatening tone:\u2014 I told you not to do it.Anger hung in the air.The men's faces turned pale.It was certainly no ordinary rage.His face seemed to say not 'I will kill you' as usually is the case, but 'I will eat you.'He looked like a predatory beast in sheep's clothing.\u2014 You're not fools, so you should know you cannot defeat me, right?\u2014 Kh\u2026They gulped.Since even their Commander did not have time to swing a sword, they understood that the enemy was really strong.Nan Gong-jin, who was knocked to the ground, coughed.\u2014 Damn\u2026 these Koreans\u2026\u2014 Look at this bastard, doesn't understand a thing.(Editor: not a typo, but casual rough-talk.)Kang Yu grabbed him by the neck from behind and lifted him into the air.\u2014 The state is made up of the people living in it. If you act like shit, your country must not be any better.Nan Gong-jin was silent.\u2014 What, you don't understand? Well, the past can't be changed, but I'll give you advice on how to behave in order to present your country in a good light.\u2014 Wha\u2026 what are you going to do?!\u2014 Come and see.Kang Yu pulled the guy towards him and dragged him on one side.Si Hoon followed them.\u2014 Kang Yu, where are you going?\u2014 Si Hoon, is there a restaurant nearby that serves delicious kimchi jjigae?\u2014 Ah\u2026? \u2014 The guy's eyes widened in surprise.Why is he suddenly looking for a restaurant that serves delicious food?\u2014 There's one in that alley.\u2014 Great. \u2014 Kang Yu smiled contentedly and pulled Nan Gong-jin along.Walking a little further, he cocked his head to shout at the lost standing men:\u2014 Hey! You're coming too!They glanced at each other, shrugged in a 'no idea' manner, and followed Kang Yu.\u2014 Woman, please give me seven servings of kimchi jjigae. And add more meat.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u2014 Oh\u2026 Okay, sir. Isn't that man hurt?\u2014 No, he's just pretending. Isn't that right?Kang Yu stroked Nan Gong-jin on the shoulder and shook him.\u2014 Wait a little bit.The woman, making a pretty impression, went to the kitchen.Hardly any time passed before the rich kimchi jjigae was ready.\u2014 This\u2026 what is this?\u2014 Kimchi jjigae. Try it, you'll like it.Kang Yu gently patted Nan Gong-jin on the back and he winced.\u2014 Are you saying that by offering me this hodgepodge, you are doing something for your nation?\u2014 Hodge\u2026podge? \u2014 Kang Yu's eyes widened and malice began to emit from him again.Kang Yu, applying the Force of Fear, pressed down on his shoulder, and the guy felt so much pressure that he felt like he was being pushed down in the ocean.\u2014 ah!\u2014 Not hodgepodge. Kimchi jjigae. I think the meat is soaked, let's eat.\u2014 Kh\u2026Nan Gong-jin looked up at Si Hoon and began to eat.'Mm\u2026?'It was really delicious.The kimchi he'd tried once before had been so sour that he winced, but this soup cooked with it as a base had a sweet taste. And putting a piece of meat on top of a spoonful of rice, he felt that sharp taste of kimchi, enveloping his entire mouth.'Is there such food in Korea?'Of course, even with the delicious food, he hadn't forgotten why they were here.As he was a subordinate to one of the strongest Players in the world, they often ate extremely expensive dishes that would make kimchi jjigae seem like a cheap dish.'Why then do I keep eating it?' thought the man, finishing the contents of the plate.And not just him. The four people who arrived with him, seeing this, also began to eat kimchi jjigae.\u2014 Woman, give me three more servings! And a bowl of rice for each.\u2014 Alright, sir. What an appetite you have!Kang Yu smiled with satisfaction and turned his eyes to Nan Gong-jin.\u2014 Is it tasty?\u2014 Uh\u2026\u2014 Hehe, I think so. You need to eat your fill.Kang Yu finished another kimchi jjigae, whistling under his breath.\u2014 Actually, I'm not a patriot at all. But the kimchi jjigae is worth respecting, isn't it?\u2014 It's not that tasty.\u2014 But you've already emptied two plates. In any case, you understand now, don't you? You need to show the positive sides of your country! That's how you can make it better, you fool. Don't act in vain, behaving nastily and attacking people carelessly.After saying this, Kang Yu focused on his food.When everyone had finished eating, Kang Yu, who had eaten the most, rose from his seat.\u2014 Let's go, Si Hoon.\u2014 Oh, yes\u2026\u2014 Settle here and head back to China. And tell the Sword Lord, or whatever it is, that if he wants to see Si Hoon, then he can come in person. \u2014 With these words, they left the restaurant.The men, not understanding what had happened ,were dumbfounded.'After eating from the heart, he tells me to pay?'Here it is \u2013 Korean friendliness.\u2014 Are you saying you're back after only eating some soup?A thin man sat majestically in an armchair in the center of the huge room.Although he looked as if he was ready to crumble from any touch, the power emanating from him enveloped the space around, oppressing those nearby.Sword Ruler, Zheng Mu-jin.The name of a man who could be called the overlord of China without exaggeration.\u2014 Ah\u2026 forgive me! \u2014 Nan Gong-jin said in a trembling voice, kneeling in front of him.The room was filled with suffocating anxiety.\u2014 Ha\u2026 Ha ha\u2026There was laughter.\u2014 Hahaha!!!The laughter of Zheng Mu-jin filled the room.\u2014 Good! Interesting! Interesting guy! \u2014 He continued to speak through laughter. \u2014 Anyway\u2026 \u2014The atmosphere suddenly changed.He turned his gaze sharply to Nan Gong-jin.\u2014 Didn't I ask you to bring him in as politely as possible?\u2014 This\u2026 This is\u2026\u2014 What? He didn't understand who wants to see him? Mixed our guild name with shit?\u2014 N\u2026 no!\u2014 What do you mean 'no?'Zheng Mu-jin stretched out his hand.Nan Gong-jin was pulled forth by a strong wind and found himself in front of Zheng Mu-jin.He grabbed him tightly by the neck and uttered in a threatening tone:\u2014 I sent you for him because you know Korean, and you, without accomplishing anything, just traveled.\u2014 Ah! I\u2026 just\u2026\u2014 This is a legion. We do not need people who are useless.\u2014 B\u2026 but\u2026Zheng Mu-jin waved his hand and the man was thrown back to a wall.\u2014 Ha! He says I have to come personally\u2026 \u2014 He rose from his seat.This was the first time he'd heard such a thing since becoming a Top Player.\u2014 If they tell me to come, then I must go.\u2014 Father, are you personally going to Korea? \u2014 A velvet voice rang out.The man turned his head.He was approached by a girl with two buns in her hair.A slender physique and thick eyebrows. Pointed nose and red lips. Just looking from the outside, you could say she stands out.Zheng Su Ying.Daughter of the Sword Lord, one of the strongest Players in China.\u2014 What? You heard he was handsome and now you want to come with me?\u2014 Ahahaha! Father, what are you talking about?She sat down on one of the armrests of the chair and crossed her legs.\u2014 I can't be interested in someone weaker than you.The man swallowed hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That's why you shouldn't load the others with your thoughts.\u2014If I can help you, please, contact me at any moment.Kang Yu grinned and nodded his head.\u2014 Let's continue.Kang Yu softened up and looked around. It would be good to find the monster that had fought off the pack.\u2014 There he is.Kang Yu noticed one of the most common S-level gate monsters in Suvona, the giant orchestra.When he approached the monster, he used the Force of Silence, because if others heard them, things would get complicated.\u2014 Ehidna.-\u2014 Yes, \u2013 she came forward.The girl stretched her hand towards the orc. The black haze created eight sickles that spun and headed for the orcs.That clever movement evaded the attack, which could not be compared with its size.However, after a moment returned boomerang sickles inflicted him a lot of wounds, from which he started bleeding, and his movements slowed down.\u2014 Get ready.\u2014 Yes, Kang Yu.The face of Si Hoon, who delivered El Quero's sword, seemed excited.Dae Su, who had just been ready for everything, and Eun Bi, who was asking for a rest, also became more serious.\u2014 Aaaah! The monster's cry flew.\u2014 A little more.Kang Yu waited until the Orc's strength was exhausted.It's important to wait until the monster weakens to such an extent that Si Hoon's team can defeat it.\u2014It won't do any good if they just get experience points.In fact, the reason Kang Yu brought them to the S-level gate for hunting was not because they were awarded experience points.Although Shi Hun's Party is still weak to fight S-level monsters, Kang Yu wanted them to feel their power as soon as possible.\u2014 This will help them.A simple boost has its limit too. After all, if two players with equally pumped characteristics collide in the battle, the one who was pumped will obviously lose to the Player who received all his points on his own.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cIn a real battle, numbers do not play a role,\u201d this is what real Players say.Simply put: a high level and characteristics is not a hundred percent guarantee of victoryImproving the basic characteristics is nothing more than working on yourself and your body. That's why, for example, the bodybuilder may not win in hand-to-hand combat, as it has only increased the weight.Since Kang Yu had enough time to accumulate experience in real battles, now he just needs to improve the characteristics, which, in his case, directly interact with force.But that was not the case with Si Hoon's Party.The body of a huge orc was shaken along with the growling.Kang Yu commanded it:\u2014 Here we go.\u2013 Yes!Together with a short answer, Si Hoon and Dae Su came forward.Han Sol began to buffalo, and Eun Bi applied magi.\u2013 Aaaah!Even though the giant orc was one foot in the other world, the fight was fierce.A giant orc is not the kind of creature that could be defeated by an average game consisting of Players of level 40. However, even if he was dying, the Si Hoon Party showed excellent results, proving that they could cope with it.\u2013 He is really strong!The fight was over.Unlike Dae Su, who was puffed up, Si Hoon looked as if he still had a power reserve.\u2014 After all, Si Hong also has strength that does not match his level.Probably, if he had used all his strength, he would have been able to resist the giant orc alone.However, he, realizing that other teammates also need to train, did not put all his efforts into it. And he is good.Later, it will be necessary to prepare for him a single training session.It was impossible to deny the fact that there was a huge difference between him and the other teammates.That is why it is necessary to think of something else for his direct development.\u2013 Let's check our equipment and move on to the next monster.\u2013 Phew, good!\u2013 Dae Su, come here.Han Seol called him in and healed his wounds.At that moment, several giant orcs came into their sight and pointed their weapons in their direction.\u201cDid they smell blood?\u201dEven though he muffled the sounds coming from them, apparently, it was not enough.Kang Yu began to form a pure force when he looked at the three monsters approaching.If Kang Yu hadn't been with them, the group couldn't have handled so many monsters.\u2013 Wait here.Kang Yu turned around and there was a terrible scream coming from the Orcs.He used the power of the Dark Spear and grabbed the spear formed from the black smoke. He looked as if he had been enveloped in pure energy, not as usual.There was a pure clash of metal and a light beam appeared.Orcs running to it stopped at one moment, and thin cuts appeared on the body. Gradually they began to spread, forming fountains of blood.All three giant orcs lost their lives in an instant.Kang Yu turned his gaze to the side when he saw a lazy, skinny man walking towards him and two people following him. One of them was a charming girl, and the other was a frightened young man with a pale face.\u201cWith one stroke of three giant orcs\u2026,\u201d Kang Yu squinted.Young Ju wasn't able to do that for sure.And that means that in front of him is a man who is above the Top of the country.Only one person came to mind who had a reason to come personally.Lord of the Sword, Jong Mu Jin.The player under which was all of China, a man who was in the world top.\u2013 Apparently, you decided to come in person. I was beginning to doubt whether you will not send to the insolent squad of murderers.\u2013 So you're the same named brother\u2026 I apologize for what happened. Ah\u2026 I think you don't understand Chinese, \u2013 he slowly translated the look at the guy standing just behind.The guy, clearly nervous, started talking:\u2013 G\u2026 Jong Mu Jin-san said he was sorry about\u2026\u2013 Just speak Chinese.\u2013 \u2014 \u041e? So you know him? \u2013 Jong-Moo Jin asked after Kang Yu used the power of General Language to answer him in Chinese.Kang Yu nodded his head.The man continued with a certain relief:\u2013 Then, the conversation will be quick. Excuse me, my subordinates behaved rudely.\u2013 In words, anyone can apologize.\u2013 Hhha! That's right.The man bowed low to Kang Yu.When he saw something like that, everyone around him froze in shock.Even Kang Yu, without expecting it to happen, clenched his lips tightly.Lord of the Sword, Jung Moo-jin.The strongest person who was reading worshipped a commoner.It was unbelievable that a person with such powers could do such a thing.\u2013 The Players who robbed you were expelled from the legion. It was my fault for not being able to raise my subjects properly.\u2013 Well, since you came in person, I will accept my apologies.Anyway, because of Nan Gong Jin, no one was hurt.And since he was also punished by his guild, there was no need for more.\u2013 So why are you here?\u2013 I came to meet with the Dragon.\u2013 I have already heard that. Why do you want to meet Si Hoon so much?\u2013 I was watching the video.Kang Yu looked at it.\u2013 I think it was called \u201cDragon on Isu\u201d. The video of the battle at that place.\u2013 So what?\u2013 So I wanted to check something.The man sprayed in a smile and continued:\u2013 How could the Dragon master Musin's techniques?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You speak Chinese? \u2013 Kang Yu was unusually surprised.It wasn't until a moment later that he realized he had forgotten one tiny detail.\u2013 If you think about it like that, she shouldn't even know Korean.That's exactly what he had never thought about. After all, from the moment they met, she always spoke perfect Korean, which made him not suspect anything.That's how he assumed that Ehidna, having become his subordinate, had automatically taken over the power of the Common Language.\u2013 No, I don't know. I use magic to communicate with people.\u2013 Oh\u2026So she did have something like his Power of Common Language.\u2013 And your magic can spread to other people?\u2013 Yes.\u2013 Then make sure that Si Hoon and the others understand us.\u2013 Okay \u2013 Ehidna raised her hands.After a little preparation, a magical charge appeared from her hand, directed at Si Hoon.\u2013 It was\u2026\u2013 Oh, so the Dragon understands Chinese too?\u2013 N\u2026 no, it's like\u2026\u2013 Magic.The guy looked surprised at Ehidna.How can magic accurately convey all thoughts to the interlocutor?He has never heard of such magic from other Players before.\u2013 Yes! It is not complicated at all. At RNO, it is often used.Ehidna, who thought she had helped Kang Yu a lot, exhaled her nose loudly.\u2013 In the end, my interpreter is of no use! \u2013 Zheng Mu-Jin laughed.The scared guy standing next to me moved.\u2013 Don't worry, I will pay as I promised.\u2013 Sp\u2026 thank you!\u2013 I'm glad that our dialogue will go faster. Dragon, how did you know about Musin's techniques? \u2013 asked the man.Si Hoon's eyes have widened.\u2013 From\u2026 where did you\u2026\u2013 I am also interested. How do you know that Si Hoon uses these techniques?\u2013 Heh heh. All members of our family are Musin's blood descendants.\u2013 Uh-oh, Kang Yu looked at them.If you believe his words, the great Musin Jeong Tae Hwan used to really live on Earth, and his direct relative is Zheng Mu-Jin..\u2013 So such techniques existed even before the Players appeared?\u2013 That's right. But of course, now, with the appearance of the Players, they have become even more effective.Kang Yu nodded his head understandably.\u2013 That's not surprising. They say that the Devil's Teachers also existed before the appearance of the Players.Now Kang Yu is convinced that even before the appearance of the Gate, there were people on Earth who were able to use magic and use special fighting techniques associated with the sword.\u2013 I mastered the techniques of Musin.\u2013 Stop,\u201d Kang Yu put his hand on Si Hoon's shoulder and silenced him. \u2013 What are you going to do when you know? To preserve the image of the family, you're going to kill him, right?\u2013 Hhha! I think you reread the comics.\u201cSounds like it's pronounced by a painted character.\u201dJung Mu Jin laughed cheerfully and continued:\u2013 I want to make a deal.\u2013 A deal?\u2013 That's right. Passing from generation to generation, not all techniques are passed on without spaces. But the Dragon Sword technique that I saw on the video is one of those that is left only in the old records.\u2013 Is that why you want to restore it?\u2013 Of course it is.Kang Yu glanced at it.He recognized the intention and purpose of the other side. That makes it easier.That guy sprayed a wide smile.\u2013 If it's a deal, you have to offer something in return.\u2013 Before I answer, I want to hear the answer to my first question. Where and from whom did he learn this?\u2013 I think it will be better to hear it from the person who owns this technique.Kang Yu, as if saying, \u201cNow you can,\u201d gently patted Si Hoon on the back.The guy told us how unusual it was for him to learn the fighting techniques of the great Musin Jong Tae Hwan.as Si Hoon continued to to tell him the man's mouth opened more and more in surprise\u2013 Oh-ho-ho. It is unbelievable that Musin's spirit has moved into your body.\u2013 But I cannot have a dialogue with him or something like that. His words just find themselves in my head, just like the knowledge of techniques.\u2013 Uh-oh. Is that why you are so good at Dragon Sword techniques when no one else could master them?\u2013 Simply put Si Hoon is bloody talented.\u2013 It's interesting.Zheng Mu-Jin's eyes glistened, and he began to look at Si Hoon's body. At some point, his eyes expanded.-Heavenly gift.The talent given by heaven.He could not have imagined that the day would come when he would see a man who could understand at one glance the essence of combat techniques and learn the essence of concentration.\u2013 Hhha! In the end, you didn't guess about talent.\u2013 Anyway, you learned what you wanted to know, and it's time to propose a deal,\u201d Kang Yu said in a smooth tone.The dialogue was so simple that he wouldn't have thought that the Lord of the Sword was standing in front of him.Zheng Mu-Jin translated the guy's point of view.Of course, he was impressed by Si Hoon's story about the Dragon Sword, but the Player named Oh Kang Yu was no less surprised.-Was anyone so sure of what they said before standing in front of me?Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksI don't think that was the case after he got into the World Ranker. Although, it wasn't before that either.Since he was born in a large influential Chyom Kom Mun Guild, everybody bowed their head in front of him since he was a child.\u2013 Heh heh heh. He heard a lot about you\u2026 but still I was surprised. Do you behave like this even after knowing who is standing in front of you?\u2013 Why, do I have to pay my respects in a bow?\u2013 Hhha! No, you don't. About the offer\u2026 How about this? If the Dragon can help us restore the gaps in our skills, I will personally teach him other techniques.\u2013 You say you'll teach the techniques?\u2013 As far as I know, the Dragon now has only two techniques: the Dragon Quick Strike technique and the Dragon Cloud Strike technique. In fact, there are two more, more complex and effective.\u2013 Oh-ho-ho.\u2013 Even though one of them was lost, the other is effectively used. This is the one I used for destruction of orcs.\u2013 Didn't you say that the techniques were transmitted to you with spaces?\u2013 That's right, but we still have a technique that is more powerful than the Dragon's Cloud Strike.Kang Yu thought about it.The technique was inherited by Musin's direct descendant, who is a World Ranker-Tempting suggestion.After all, this way, Si Hoon will be able to add to his treasure trove of technology.Whichever way you look at it, the offer is good, even very good.\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d he translated the look at Si Hoon.He is not the central person in this matter.The person who fills in the gaps in their skills, and the person who receives knowledge from the Lord of the Sword, will be Si Hoon.\u2013 Kang Yu.\u2013 The choice is yours. What do you think?Si Hoon was hesitant, but not for long.\u2013 I want to learn.Lord of the Sword teachings. It's hard to find a warrior who didn't want to learn from him.\u201cAnd more importantly\u2026\u201d \u2013 Si Hoon looked at Kang Yu.This is a confident image that did not hesitate even in front of the Lord of the Sword.He wanted to be the same. He did not want to just accept help from Kang Yu.Si Hoon grabbed the handle of the sword and raised it up.-I want to become stronger.He remembered what had happened in Isu District: people crying, smoke filling the streets and dead bodies.If he had been stronger then he could have saved more people.Kang Yu nodded his head.\u2013 Then, it was agreed. Oh, and there is one condition.\u2013 A condition?\u2013 The restoration of gaps and the training of military equipment should take place in Korea.We shouldn't have to let Si Hoon go far.If they find themselves far away from each other, in which case he can't help the guy.\u201cYou can't trust Zheng Mu-Jin completely\u201d.He did not give the impression of someone he could trust.\u2013 Hmm\u2026 Korea\u2026 Seo Yeon, what do you think?\u2013 It's okay with me. I wanted to be here anyway, she laughed and everyone felt the strange atmosphere hanging in the air.She looked at Kang Yu and the lights danced in her eyes.\u2013 Then, first, we'll stay here for a month.\u2013 Okay, Kang Yu smiled quite a bit and nodded his head.Previously, Kang Yu had been thinking about having a single training session for Si Hoon, but now, apparently, there was no need.\u2013 Let's get out of the gate. Oh, I heard you live near Seoul Station. Isn't that right?\u2013 Yes, I do.\u2013 So we'll buy a building nearby.\u2013 A building\u2026?\u2013 We'll need both a training hall and accommodation for a whole month.Anyway, Kang Yu was shocked that a man would want to buy a whole building to stay here for a month.Zheng Mu-Jin approached Si Hoon.\u2013 Let's have a little chat while we go to the exit. There is a lot I would like to learn from you.\u2013 Ah, yes! I am honored!So Zheng Mu-Jin and Si Hoon went a little ahead and Kang Yu followed them. Suddenly, a charming girl walking next to them approached Kang Yu.\u2013 Hello.\u2013 You are\u2026\u2013 My name is Jeon Seo Yeon,\u201d the girl said and smiled widely. \u2013 Your name is Kang Yu, right? It's the first time I've seen someone who can behave so confidently in front of my father.She looked at him with interest.The girl has been around her father since she was born, but she has never seen someone who dared to behave that way before him.\u201cI wonder what kind of person he is,\u201d she awoke curiosity.Before that, she could not even think that someone would be able to stand confidently in front of the Sword Master. She had no idea how strong a person should be, both spiritually and physically, to behave like that.\u201cThey say he defeated the commander of the 3rd unit in one second.\u201dShe was full of expectations, because her ideal type was a strong man.And not just a strong man, but one who would be even stronger than Jong Mu Jin's Sword Master.On a subconscious level, she was attracted to strong men. However, everyone she met was weaker than her father. Therefore, she immediately developed an interest in Kang Yu, who did not show weakness before Zheng Mu-Jin.\u2013 I have no reason to be afraid of him.\u2013 Hm. Are you sure you can defeat the Lord of the Sword?\u2013 Who knows, Kang Yu laughed.The girl immediately saw the power in his short laugh.Her gaze was similar to that of a predator who had seen his prey.\u201cEven though he says so simply because he doesn't know my father's full power.\u201dHowever, she could not deny the overwhelming feeling of interest towards this guy.Seo Yeon looked at the guy again and licked her red lips, looking at him with interest.At that moment, the girl felt like someone had pulled her clothes from behind and she turned around.A puppet-looking girl was looking at her from the bottom up and quietly, so that only Seo Yeon could hear it and say it:\u2013 Kang Yu is mine. Don't look at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
