    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1. The Fianc\u00e9 Is BackDuke Williot is called the Sword of the Empire.In the summer of the year I turned 14, I got engaged to Williot\u2019s only successor, Philen Williot, and entered the Duchy. Thankfully, the Duke and Duchess treated me as their real daughter, the daughter of a noble. If there was anything good or delicious, they brought it to me before Philen, and even when they attended tea parties or social parties, they praised me more than Philen. Philen always complained about it.\u201cIt\u2019s really strange.\u201dIt was the same on that day.Philen, who returned to the mansion after practicing swordsmanship, wiped the sweat off his forehead as soon as he saw me and said bluntly.\u201cIs it possible that our parents got swapped?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the case, Philen.\u201d I smiled softly, closing the book I was looking at.\u201cYou even look like His Excellency the Duke.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you the only one who thinks like that?\u201d\u201cNo. Everyone thinks that way.\u201dIt really was. He looked just like Duke Williot, so you could predict how Philen would grow in the future. Was it just the appearance? His sword skills and appetite were similar. Unfortunately, his brain wasn\u2019t the same.The Duke of Williot had a brilliant brain, but Philen was an idiot who only knew swordsmanship, and according to Duchess Williot, he barely learned the Imperial language.\u201cLeila, you have to be Philen\u2019s brain.\u201dShe had often held my hand and spoke earnestly before I officially engaged to Philen. \u201cAs a wife and duchess, fill what my stupid son cannot do. Please take good care of Philen and Duke Williot, Leila.\u201dAt the time, I had no reason to refuse. Rather, I was grateful, so I replied willingly. Since then, I have followed Duchess Williot and learned about what I have to do in the future.That alone was busy, but the Duke had to spend more busy days than he thought because he had informed him of what he had to do.Philen was busy with swordsmanship training, and hence, we rarely talked face to face even after we were engaged. However, it wasn\u2019t that we had a bad relationship or anything. We weren\u2019t dynamic like lovelorn couples or close like best friends, but we had a pretty good relationship. Sometimes, when I had a chance to talk, I made jokes and played pranks.People felt sorry for me, but the pity was useless. I was very satisfied with my life here. It felt like I was wearing clothes that fit my body. Every day was happy like a dream. As if to laugh at me like that, misfortune came suddenly.*****It was when I had been engaged to Philen for two years. I was managing the estate on behalf of the Duke and Duchess, who temporarily left the estate after receiving a royal order.Originally, it was Philen\u2019s job, but I took charge of it according to the strong opinion of the duke couple, that they couldn\u2019t entrust the mansion to him who didn\u2019t know the circumstances of the duchy more than me.Boom, boom!While looking at the papers for a while, I glanced out the window. That was when I heard a loud thunder. It was raining heavily, as if trying to turn the world into a sea of water.\u201cI hope there will be no major damage to the people.\u201d I muttered worriedly.Misa, the maid of the mansion, put down a cup of tea in front of me and smiled a little. \u201cYour lady will be a great duchess, just like her current lady.\u201d\u201cDo you think so, Misa?\u201d\u201cOf course. Not only me, but everyone does.\u201dThe Duchess was my idol. When I heard that I would be like her, I smiled lightly. I have to work harder to live up to expectations. I tried to concentrate on the papers again with the intention of surprising the Duke and Duchess when they came back.Rattle, bang!The door opened with a loud noise without knocking. The one who opened the door was a servant of the mansion, exhaling a rough breath.\u201cWhat a rude\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, young lady! We\u2019re in trouble!\u201dBefore Misa pointed out the servant\u2019s rude behavior, the servant shouted. I didn\u2019t know what the matter was, but it wasn\u2019t polite to talk or scream like that. When Misa tried to approach the servant to reprimand him, I grabbed her by the arm and asked the servant.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dIt was definitely something bad if he rushed over, so I decided to listen to his story first.\u201cThe master and madam\u2019s carriage slipped in the rain and fell down the cliff!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dMy judgment was correct, and the news the servant gave was shocking. Misa also opened her eyes in bewilderment.\u201cS-so what happened? Are the Duke and Duchess safe? Or\u2026\u201d\u201cThat-that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe servant stalled as if he didn\u2019t know. I had to find out for myself. I didn\u2019t hesitate to get up and go outside. With the shocking news, I forgot the Duchess\u2019 teaching that a perfect noblewoman shouldn\u2019t run recklessly. With long strides, I ran down the hall.\u201cLeila!\u201dAs I almost reached the end, I saw Philen running from the other side.\u201cPhilen!\u201d I ran to Philen, grabbed his collar and shouted. \u201cThe Duke and Duchess\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Philen said, embraced me tightly with his trembling arms.It was my first time seeing him shake like this.\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be fine. Neither of them will die so easily.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201dI wanted to believe. I hoped those two were really safe. I desperately hoped that they would open that door, come in, and say \u2018my beloved daughter, Leila\u2019, showing their love by calling my name.But God didn\u2019t listen to my wishes.With the sudden death of the Duke and Duchess of Williot, Philen was only 16 years old. He became the head of the Duke of Williot at an early age. However, he was disheartened by the sudden loss of his parents, and didn\u2019t take care of the Duchy and the estate. Most of the time, he was stuck in the training ground and kept swinging his sword. It was me who was in charge of the Duke of Williot family and the estate on his behalf. As his fianc\u00e9e, I had to play the role of the duke\u2019s wife as well as the duke\u2019s deputy.Since this happened, people around me had encouraged me to hold a wedding and became Duchess of Williot officially, but I didn\u2019t listen. When parents die, it is the duty of their immediate children to stay away from alcohol and color for three years and honor their parents. In line with that, I and Philen decided not to hold a wedding for three years. He skipped the coming-of-age ceremony and his debut at the age of 18.So, quite a bit of time passed, but Philen was still stuck in the training ground. I was spending busy days on my own, and then one day. As the Emperor, who had a lot of desire to conquer, declared a continental conquest, Philen went to war. The war lasted six years. The long war had exhausted many people, and I was included in it. I had to run in all directions to fill the vacancy of the duke as well as the role of the duchess.Even though the estate was peaceful, there were so many things to do, but the problem was that not long after Philen left, the price of grains jumped several times because of the great famine, and people who couldn\u2019t handle it, died from hunger. In particular, too many children died, and there were frequent livelihood crimes. To save them somehow, I released a huge amount of food stored in the Duke\u2019s warehouse. Because of that, I could only eat thin soup and bread for a while. Misa felt sorry for that, but I didn\u2019t.After barely overcoming the great famine, an epidemic came this time. To overcome the epidemic, I freed Duke Williot\u2019s private property and brought doctors and priests together. A huge amount of money was spent at once, so the Duke\u2019s finances were almost shaken. Until now, I was able to pass safely thanks to the continued savings and maintenance money that were given to me.After six years of struggling as a duchess and an absent duke, the long war ended with the succession of the predecessor emperor and the rise of the new emperor.When I received a letter saying that Philen would return soon, I dressed up for the first time in six years. I took off the modest dress that I always wore and changed into an elegant and colorful dress. My makeup was thicker than usual, and all kinds of accessories were adorning me. After finishing all the makeup, my reflection in the mirror looked so strange that I stared at it for a while. I smiled brightly, lifting my red-painted lips, but it still looked strange. I felt like I was wearing something that didn\u2019t fit me. The modest navy dress that I always wore seemed to fit me better.\u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, young miss.\u201d\u201cRight! You look like an angel from heaven!\u201d The maids clapped their hands.\u201cStop, I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201dEveryone burst into laughter when I blushed shyly and waved my hands. I didn\u2019t really love Philen, but he would be my husband soon. Maybe that\u2019s why my heart was pounding at the news of Philen\u2019s return. My heart fluttered and my feet rolled like I was walking on clouds. I felt like an immature adolescent girl. My pounding heart was even higher when the Knights led by Philen were seen far away.The man who took the lead and rode the black horse was Philen. There was still quite a distance, but I recognized him at once. As the distance grew closer and closer, and by the time he was fully visible, I waved my hands cheerfully.\u201cPhil\u2026\u201dI was going to call out his name, but I couldn\u2019t. It was because another woman was in Philen\u2019s arms.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2. Another WomanI was confused. It felt like someone had hit my head hard from behind. This was something that I hadn\u2019t even thought of in my dreams. I stared blankly at Philen and the woman in his arms.As the distance got closer, I could clearly see a woman in Philen\u2019s arms. Her platinum hair that shimmered under the rays of the sun was beautiful. Clear skin like white jade indicated that this woman wasn\u2019t an ordinary one.I couldn\u2019t see her face well because there was still some distance between us. What broke my gaze away from her face was her protruding belly, in contrast with her skinny limbs. At first, I thought that it was because she was sitting, but considering her figure\u2026Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s\u2026\u201cThe woman in Master\u2019s arms, is she pregnant?\u201d The maid next to me worded what I was thinking.Other maids and servants were also wondering about the same.\u201cWhy has Master brought a pregnant woman home?\u201d\u201cNo way\u2026 that woman, could it be the master\u2019s child?\u2026\u201d\u201cAll of you be quiet!\u201dThey all shut their mouths at Misa\u2019s indignant cry.\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d Misa said firmly to me, trembling with anxiety. \u201cMaster isn\u2019t like that. There must be some misunderstanding.\u201dMisunderstanding, really?Sadly, my intuition, unlike Misa\u2019s, convinced me that she was bearing Philen\u2019s child. Otherwise, Philen wouldn\u2019t hold her in his arms.\u201cHa.\u201dI laughed at this thought, and the situation, rubbing my temples with my fingers. If that woman really had Philen\u2019s child, what should I do?\u2018Do I have to grab her hair and use evil means like the other women? Or should I ignore her even if she is a noble lady? No, more than that. Do I have the right to do that? I\u2019m not even Philen\u2019s wife. I\u2019m just his fianc\u00e9e.\u2019People around me treated me as if I had already become the Duchess of Williot, but my last name was still Thebesa. Leila Thebesa, not Leila Williot.I wondered if I had the right to say anything about the woman Philen had brought. I was his fianc\u00e9e, so I could say something to some extent, but I wasn\u2019t in a position to blame the woman like a lover. So, I didn\u2019t know what to say to Philen. I couldn\u2019t figure out what kind of face I should make while greeting him.While I was shocked, and agonizing about the future, Philen had gotten off the horse and came this way. After six years, he had become a real man. His previously immature face had lost all the baby fat, showing off his sharp jawline.\u201cOh, my.\u201dHowever, the mischievous smile that drew on his lips was still there. He looked at me and the maids and servants standing behind me, grinning mischievously as before.\u201cYou must have lost your tongue while I was away.\u201dThe receiver of Philen\u2019s gaze was me. He stroked his chin and said in a jovial way.\u201cLeila, you didn\u2019t become dumb in 6 years, right?\u201d\u201d\u2026As if.\u201dOnly then, I came to my senses and replied in a feeble voice.\u201cIt\u2019s just a little shocking\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWas he asking because he really didn\u2019t know? Or was he testing me?Or\u2026 maybe that woman didn\u2019t have his child?It might be the latter.No, I was eagerly hoping for that, but thinking about it didn\u2019t explain why Philen brought her here. That\u2019s the only reason why he had her in his arms and carried her on his horse.I looked sideways at the woman who was still riding on Philen\u2019s horse. It wasn\u2019t unusual when viewed from a distance, but the woman I saw up close was quite a beauty.Those big blue eyes sparkled like jewels. The woman was wearing a plain linen dress, not a fancy one, but she looked prettier than me, who was dressed up in splendor.Feeling a mysterious defeat at that fact, I clenched my hand tightly. I thought I didn\u2019t want to see that woman anymore, but strangely, I couldn\u2019t take my eyes away from her. She was such a gorgeous and beautiful woman.If Philen had her as his lover, I could understand why he did it.\u201cOh.\u201d Philen, who suddenly looked back following my gaze, approached the woman with a small sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ll get tired if you keep riding, so get down here.\u201dPhilen dropped the woman off the horse with an extremely polite and affectionate touch. The woman was shyly in Philen\u2019s arms, her cheeks turning red. Even after getting off the horse, Philen didn\u2019t let her go. Rather, he hugged her shoulders more affectionately.\u201cHow can the master\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do this to the young lady.\u201dThe maids and servants were indignant at the unusual appearance of the two. Even Misa, who denied it just a moment ago, said, \u201cHe\u2019s crazy.\u201d She dared to spit harsh words toward her master.Misa and the servants deserved to be scolded, but I didn\u2019t say anything because I thought so too. Rather, I praised them for saying what I wanted to say.No matter how much I and Philen were engaged without love, that kind of behavior shouldn\u2019t be shown in front of me, his fianc\u00e9e. He deserved to be criticized. I wanted to do that, and I wanted to grab him by the collar and ask him what he was doing right now.Who is that woman? I wanted to shout if she had his baby, but strangely, my lips were trembling. I kept my mouth shut like a honey-eating mute, and only glared at him with eyes full of anger.[T/N: Honey-eating mute = an expression refers to a person who normally speaks with no problem, but has chosen not to speak in certain situations.]As if he didn\u2019t feel my gaze, Philen called Misa who was standing behind me with a calm face.\u201cMisa.\u201dMisa politely approached Philen, as if she wasn\u2019t unhappy.He called Misa, but the Misa he called to, was the woman in his arms, not Misa.\u201cYou must be tired of the long journey, so go back to your room and rest and take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cI like the sunny room.\u201dWhen the woman asked in a fake voice, Philen pondered for a moment and then looked at Misa. \u201cMisa, take her to the room at the end of the east corridor on the second floor.\u201dHearing those words, Misa\u2019s eyes widened. Other maids and servants were surprised and opened their mouths.The room at the end of the east corridor. It was the room used by the Duchess of Williot for generations. Even I, who was playing the role of the Duchess, couldn\u2019t use it, and even if the Emperor wanted to use it, it was a place that shouldn\u2019t be given. I was sure there\u2019s no stupid emperor who wanted to use that kind of place. However, it wasn\u2019t unreasonable for everyone to be shocked when they heard that the room would be given to an unknown woman.Likewise, as I was staring at Philen in surprise, I soon realized that he was ignorant of this side and called him. \u201cPhilen, that room is the duchess\u2019 room.\u201dHearing my words, Philen turned to me. His eyes were full of questions.\u201cSo?\u201dIt was as if he didn\u2019t know. The uncomfortable feelings grew in me.\u201cThe Duchess\u2019 room is not for anyone. It can only be used by the Duchess.\u201d\u201cBut my father used it.\u201d\u201cBecause he\u2019s the Duke.\u201d\u201cAnd you used it too.\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be helped because I had to work.\u201dEven if I wanted to work in my room, the ledger of this house was in the duchess\u2019 room at the time, and it was strictly forbidden to bring it outside. So it was unavoidable, and the Duke and his wife understood.\u201cAnd I only worked there. I didn\u2019t sleep there.\u201dThe Duchess said it was okay to use it, but it wasn\u2019t polite, so I slept in my room unconditionally.\u201cSo you can\u2019t put her in the Duchess\u2019 room.\u201d\u201cBut that room is well lit.\u201d\u201cThere are other rooms with good lighting.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as good as that room.\u201dAt my replies, Philen sighed and argued with dissatisfaction.\u201cI didn\u2019t know I would hear this nagging. I\u2019m going to use a room that no one else would use anyway.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not nagging, but the rules of the mansion\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the owner of the mansion who sets the rules for the mansion.\u201d Philen cut me off as if he didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, then glanced at me with a high-pressure, authoritative look. \u201cAnd now I am the owner of the mansion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201c\u201cIf you\u2019re smart, you know what I mean?\u201dI don\u2019t know how. He meant that he would bring that woman into the Duchess\u2019 room no matter what. Even if I wanted to object, there was no justification for it. As he said, it was the owner of the mansion who set the rules for the mansion.How could I stop the owner when he said he\u2019d do it? Even if I were the real Duchess, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop him.As I remained silent, Philen, who took it positively, ordered Misa. \u201cMisa, take her to the room at the end of the east corridor. And assign a maid so that there is no discomfort in staying.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dAt other times, she would have insisted that this was against reason, but Misa accepted it instantly. Misa glanced at me and took the woman into the mansion.You really put her in the Duchess\u2019 room, huh?It was so ridiculous that a laugh came out. I bit my lips to straighten my distorted face. Because of that, my lips, which I had been painted beautifully, were ruined mercilessly.Philen looked at me and asked. \u201cAre you angry?\u201dHis voice wasn\u2019t different from usual, with no sign of sorry at all. Philen didn\u2019t know what he had done wrong.Well, I didn\u2019t even know why I shouldn\u2019t let other people into the Duchess\u2019 room. What would happen if i got angry with such a person? Only my lips were going to burst.\u201c\u2026no.\u201d Instead of getting angry, I shook my head.The maids and servants let out a small sigh, and Philen nodded as if it were natural.\u201cYes. You can\u2019t be upset about this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3***\u201cThen, I\u2019ll see you at dinner. I\u2019m exhausted, so I want to rest a bit.\u201d Philen tapped my shoulder and entered the mansion.I stood there even after Philen disappeared.\u201cMy lady.\u201d The maid looked at me and asked slowly.\u201cAre you fine?\u201d\u201c\u2026 What would it change if I said I\u2019m not fine?\u201d\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just joking. I\u2019m alright.\u201d I laughed at myself and took out the pin that was holding my hair up.A feeling of ridicule spread throughout my body. I had dressed up prettily to look good for my fianc\u00e9\u2026 who returned with another woman.\u201cI\u2019m fine, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s work fast and prepare dinner.\u201dHonestly, I didn\u2019t want to do anything. I had the urge to stomp to my room and throw everything down to vent my anger. But my position wouldn\u2019t let me do that. My ambiguous position as Philen Williot\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and future duchess held my ankle tightly, and didn\u2019t let go, so I had to swallow my bitter feelings and force myself to move ahead.*****Misa, who guided the woman to the room, asked me what kind of maid I would like to assign to her.I contemplated for a while, then ordered Misa to serve her in person. It would be like surveillance. Surveillance to keep her from doing anything stupid. There was nothing important in the Duchess\u2019s room right now, but there could be something that she might not know about.\u201cIf you see anything strange, don\u2019t hesitate to come and report it to me.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Misa nodded and left, like an elite soldier on a very important mission.It was cloudy in the afternoon. As if it would rain anytime soon, the sky was filled with dark clouds. When the smell of rain wafted to my nose through the open window, I closed the window.Because the former Duke and his wife died on a stormy day, my mood remained dampened on rainy days. I couldn\u2019t sleep at night when thunderstorms struck, I\u2019d hide under the blanket and tremble. My cries weren\u2019t that different from a child\u2019s. Misa was the only one who knew about it. It would be shameful to show that side to other people, so I thoroughly hid it.Though, Philen also knew, back then. I didn\u2019t know if he still remembers, but\u2026 nevermind, he probably forgot.After shutting the window and returning to my seat, I began to go through the documents I hadn\u2019t checked, in the fuss of meeting Philen. The duchess\u2019s work alone wasn\u2019t much in a day, but I was really busy with the duke\u2019s work, which was supposed to be done by Philen. I was able to come here safely because the competent aides helped me well. I checked the documents carefully and then stamped Duke Williot\u2019s seal below.It had been nine years since the Duke Williot\u2019s seal, which should be in the Duke\u2019s office, entered my office. At first, people thought that it was bad if I was the one who did it but as time went by, they took it for granted.Yet, if I made a mistake at least once, they would sneer at me with a knowing look in their eyes and lament. There were also people who pulled their tongues out and pointed their fingers. As a result, I realised, there shouldn\u2019t be any mistakes. Everything can\u2019t be perfect, but I still have to do my best to make it seem so.As I was stamping the seal, confirming there was nothing wrong, dinner time was over. As that happened in the morning, I didn\u2019t want to face Philen and eat, but I couldn\u2019t help it. It wasn\u2019t a normal day, but the first day since he returned to the mansion after a long war. I couldn\u2019t have lunch together, but it was manners to visit at least for dinner. I pulled the bell and called a maid.\u201cDid you call me, my lady?\u201d Soon after, the maid came in and bowed.I asked, tidying my desk without looking at the maid, \u201cHow did dinner preparation go?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201d The maid couldn\u2019t answer my question right away, hesitated, and ended up shutting her mouth.I stopped and looked at her, on receiving an unusual response. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 the master said he would have dinner in his room tonight.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s going to eat in his room\u2026 not in the dining room?\u201d\u201cYes. He said he was tired and didn\u2019t want to go to the dining room\u2026\u201dThe sound of the table drawer closing rang.The maid apologized, tucking her neck in like a turtle. \u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not you who should apologize.\u201dYes, it wasn\u2019t the maid\u2019s fault. She simply conveyed Philen\u2019s words to me. If there was nothing special, it was only normal to go out and eat with your family on the first day of returning to the mansion.\u2018Family\u2026 Come to think of it, am I Philen\u2019s family?\u2019Suddenly, I came to the conclusion that I was not. I was also not included in the list of Duke Williot\u2019s family. The Duke and Duchess said they thought of me as their real daughter, but it was just a \u2018thought\u2019. It wasn\u2019t real.I had been working for the Duchy for over 10 years, but I was still a stranger. I didn\u2019t have the right to tell Philen to be polite and have a meal together. If he said no, I had to accept it. Even if I felt bad.\u2018There is nothing to feel bad about.\u2019It was awkward for me to eat meals face to face with him too. I should have been glad, but my heart was throbbing painfully. I pressed the left side of my chest, where the heart was.\u201cMy lady, are you in pain?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201dSince I wasn\u2019t having dinner, I could take off these clothes. And this stuffy makeup. This fact made me feel a little better.I headed to my room to change my clothes. My room was the third largest room in this mansion. The largest room was the Duke\u2019s room. The second was the Duchess\u2019s room, and the third largest was mine. People around me told me to just use it because I would be the Duchess anyway, but I didn\u2019t. The Duchess\u2019s room had been untouchable because I wanted to enter it after I became the official Duchess.If I knew this would happen, I would have entered it. I regretted, but it was in the past. Regretting now didn\u2019t make any difference.\u201cBring it over here!\u201d\u201cHey! What about this?\u201dThe hallway, which was usually quiet, was bustling today. It was because Philen, the owner of the mansion, returned.\u201cGood afternoon, my lady.\u201d\u201cHello, my lady.\u201dIn the midst of my busy day, when I passed by, I stopped what I was doing and bowed down to say hello. I didn\u2019t want to disturb them, so I hurried to walk.\u201cWait.\u201dI stopped again and called the maids who were dragging the food tray.\u201cWhere is that going now?\u201d\u201cTo the master\u2019s room, my lady.\u201dI could know that without asking. The servants of the mansion wouldn\u2019t have eaten such luxurious food. The problem was that the prepared dishes were not one set, but two sets. There\u2019s no way Philen would have asked you to prepare two sets to eat it all alone, unless he invited me to the room and ate together\u2026\u201c\u2026is that woman with him?\u201dAt my words, the maid nodded with a troubled look on her face.\u201cHa.\u201d I swept my head up in the air.He said the reason he ate in his room was because he was tired, but I guessed it was for eating with her. If he ate in the dining room, he would see me.\u2018Philen probably didn\u2019t want to see me. Sounds about right.\u2019It was Philen, who\u2019d clicked his tongue, saying that the people around him, even the Duke and Duchess, were tactless. He had no idea why I was upset before, that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t eat in the dining room while looking at me.\u2018Is it because of her act?\u2019Philen got my eyes on him, so did she seduce him to eat together in his room? I was curious, but I couldn\u2019t confirm it. I couldn\u2019t ask Philen or her, or the maids I was with. It wasn\u2019t enough to use the Duchess\u2019s room, but she was also eating with Philen on the day of his return. Someone would think I wasn\u2019t Philen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, but her.It hadn\u2019t been a day yet, but that woman\u2019s behavior had already started to get on my nerves. The same was true of Philen. I wondered how far I could endure their acts in the future. However, even if I didn\u2019t hold back, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference, and that fact made me sadder. As I stood up and stared at the food tray, the restless maid spoke up, \u201cWe have to go before this food gets cold, my lady.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes, you can go now.\u201dI held them and let them go because there was nothing different. The maids pulled the food tray and left in a hurry, in case I would catch them again. I lifted my foot from the floor by the time they were barely visible from my sight.\u201cWhat would you like for dinner, young lady?\u201d The maid who told me Philen\u2019s story followed me and asked.\u201cI\u2019m not going to eat.\u201dMy appetite fell sharply due to the overlap between what happened in the morning and what happened a while ago.\u201cMore than that, you\u2019re not the one who serves me, right?\u201d\u201cMisa asked me to serve my lady.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dShe should be busy serving that woman, but she had the time to assign a maid to serve me?I laughed a little because I could see how worried Misa was about me.\u201cOh, you laughed.\u201d The maid clapped and smiled brightly. \u201cSince the master returned, it\u2019s the first time you laughed.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. Well, there was nothing to laugh about. The master is mean too. How could he do that to my lady?\u201dIt was cute to see her pouting her lips in anger. Would it have been this way if I had a younger sister?\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Sarah, my lady.\u201d\u201cYes, Sarah. Please take care of me.\u201dAt my words, Sarah blushed shyly and bowed her head. \u201cPlease take care of me too, my lady.\u201d(ED/N: Dude, I seriously feel so bad for her.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Soaking in the hot water made my heart a bit lighter.Waiting for me to leave the bath was Baron Tail Wizard. He was one of the old aides who worked for Duke Williot. He sat patiently until I came out after changing clothes, and then politely handed out a document.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cThis is an urgent document.\u201dWhen I was told that I had to handle it urgently, I hesitated.This was supposed to be the Duke\u2019s job, so why should I?In usual cases, I\u2019d only handle it if the Duke wasn\u2019t here or was preoccupied with other work. Philen was going to have dinner with that woman right now, and I had to work?Just thinking about it made me feel sick and irritated. In an annoyed manner, I pushed away the document and turned my head.\u201cBaron Wizard. Take this to Philen.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dBaron Wizard looked at me as if he couldn\u2019t understand what I was saying. Well, I had been dealing with it for nearly 10 years and now that I suddenly said to let Philen deal with it, it\u2019s obvious he\u2019d be confused.\u201cUp until now, the Duke was away, so I took over, but now things have changed.\u201d I smiled and kindly explained. \u201cSo, take the Duke\u2019s work to him, he can handle it himself.\u201d* * *The Wizards had long been a family who worked for the Duke of Williot. The same was true of Tail Wizard. As soon as he graduated from the Academy, he worked as an aide to the Duke of Williot.For 30 years, he had been loyal to them. Yet, this was the first time he was this astounded.\u2018Take the document to the Duke.\u2019Would Philen understand this document properly? Tail was sure he wouldn\u2019t. He knew Philen would ask him this and that without knowing what it meant.\u2018It\u2019s not a good thing if his questions don\u2019t end.\u2019It was annoying. He could see she was waving at him to take it back, so he sighed. He just wanted Leila to handle it, but unfortunately, Leila didn\u2019t seem willing.\u2018It\u2019s only valid.\u2019Philen did something outrageous, she couldn\u2019t possibly want to work for him. He fully understood Leila\u2019s thoughts, but he couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cAll right\u2026 Let\u2019s go.\u201dHe had to get the approval. Tail sighed and headed to the Duke\u2019s room where Philen was.And then.\u201cDocument?\u201dAs expected, Tail sighed deeply inside when Philen asked back, thinking that this was annoying. However, on the outside, Tail politely handed out the document to Philen.\u201cIt\u2019s something you have to deal with today. Even though it\u2019s late, I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cI see that. Why did you bring it to me?\u201d\u201cI brought it because it\u2019s a document that the Duke has to approve.\u201dEven with the words that followed, Philen leaned against the wall without giving a single glance to the document. His beautiful eyes rose with discontent. \u201cYou know that Leila did this until now, right?\u201d\u201cLady Leila has been acting on behalf of the Duke because you were away.\u201d\u201cI know that Leila did it when I wasn\u2019t away, so why did you come to me all of a sudden?\u201dBack then, you didn\u2019t work at all because you were heartbroken and played around in the training ground!\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d He couldn\u2019t say that. Tail hesitated.\u201cDid Leila send it to me?\u201dTail smiled awkwardly and nodded as Philen hit the target.Philen stroked his chin, making a small impression. \u201cShe seemed angry earlier, is this because of that?\u201d\u201cDid you know that my lady is angry?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way I didn\u2019t know she was angry. I just don\u2019t know why.\u201dOh, he didn\u2019t know why.Tail sighed.\u201cPhil.\u201dFrom the inside, a hand stretched out and touched Philen\u2019s arm.It was that woman. Tail glanced at the woman\u2019s belly.He didn\u2019t know when he looked at it from a distance, but from a close distance, he could tell it\u2019s been around 4 months since she was pregnant.Tail counted the number of months of pregnancy, recalling when his wife was pregnant.\u201cWhat\u2018s going on, Cecily?\u201d Philen asked, caressing Cecily\u2019s cheek affectionately.\u201cIt\u2019s not much, just that I\u2019m bored. Do you still have a lot to talk about?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s over now. You\u2019re not alone now, so don\u2019t overdo anything.\u201dAt Philen\u2019s advice, Cecily nodded gently and went back inside.Philen looked at Tail again and said. \u201cTake the document back to Leila.\u201d\u201cMy lady told me to take it to the Duke\u2026\u201d\u201cSince childhood, Leila was easily upset over trivial things.\u201d Philen raised his body, which was leaning against the wall. \u201cThen the next day, she turned to normal. So, if you take it back tomorrow, she will approve it.\u201d\u201cBut this is something that needs to be done today. So, the approval\u2026\u201dPhilen shut the door and turned around before Tail was finished.\u201cMy Lord, My Lord!\u201dTail anxiously waited for him from outside, but Phil ignored him neatly and sat on the sofa where Cecily was.\u201cThat man\u2026 is it okay to leave him?\u201d\u201cIf he\u2019s smart, he\u2019ll go to Leila on his own.\u201d\u201cLeila\u2026 is that the young lady\u2019s name? Your fianc\u00e9e.\u201dAs Philen nodded, Cecily tilted her head a little.\u201cCalling names and speaking informally to each other, the young lady and Phil must be very close.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re close. We\u2019ve grown together.\u201d\u201cWell, still, isn\u2019t that too informal?\u201d Cecily straightened her head and asked, while Philen looked at her with wonder.\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\u201cThat young lady is the daughter of a Count and Phil is a Duke. I don\u2019t think even a childhood fianc\u00e9e should speak informally to Phil. If the other nobles saw it, wouldn\u2019t they think it\u2019s weird?\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dCecily hugged Philen\u2019s arm and continued. \u201cSo, wouldn\u2019t it be nice for the lady to speak formally to Phil? If not, either Phil or the lady might be greatly humiliated by other people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all for you and for her.\u201d Cecily whispered in a sweet voice, with her slender fingers sweeping Philen\u2019s bare skin.* * *I was quick to tell him to go to Philen, but I already knew he would come back. The Duke\u2019s seal was in my office. Even if Philen tried to work, it was impossible without the seal. So I didn\u2019t sleep and waited for Baron Wizard. Some were unable to sleep while doing the rest of the work.As expected, Baron Wizard returned soon after.\u201cGive me the document.\u201d\u201cMy lady\u2026\u201dAt my words, Baron Wizard looked at me with tears as if he had met his savior. From the behaviour of Baron Wizard, I could have expected Philen\u2019s reaction. Philen wouldn\u2019t do it, huh.Well, there\u2019s no way he would do what he had been thrown away for 10 years now. I would have to do it though.Since he was the Duke, he couldn\u2019t let go of his duties as a Duke forever\u2026 There was also a limit for me to do his job for him.I needed to talk seriously with Philen about this issue\u2026\u2018While talking, I\u2019ll also mention her.\u2019When I thought about that woman, my head was pounding. As I touched my forehead, Baron Wizard asked anxiously.\u201cAre you okay, my lady?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay.\u201d I smiled attentively and checked the document.My head still hurt, so I couldn\u2019t see the document well, but I tried hard to concentrate on correcting the wrong parts and stamp the seal.Bang!!!There was a loud noise.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI looked at the window in surprise. I couldn\u2019t see outside because of the curtain, but I could see the outside of the window flashing.Swaaa, the pouring rain was relentless. Baron Wizard looked at the window and said. \u201cIt\u2019s been cloudy all afternoon and now, finally, it rained.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know, right.\u201d I hurriedly stamped the seal and handed it over to Baron Wizard. \u201cI\u2019ve fixed the wrong parts. Please revise it and implement.\u201d\u201cYes, my lady.\u201d Baron Wizard held the document in his arms and bowed down. \u201cI apologize for bothering you late.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2026\u201d \u2026It\u2019s something I have to do. As I tried to add these words, but swallowed them and laughed awkwardly. The words that were usually taken for granted didn\u2019t come out today.Baron Wizard also had an awkward face as if he knew what I was trying to say. \u201cWell, then.\u201dAfter Baron Wizard left, I, who was here alone, stood up to go to bed.Boom!!!\u201cUgh.\u201d Another thunder shook my eardrums. I closed my ears and sat down.As if laughing at me, more lightning struck. It flashed in front of me and the day when the Duke and Duchess died naturally came to mind. The day that took away my happiness at once.It was painful to recall the vivid appearance of the two returning as cold bodies. I couldn\u2019t breathe.\u201cHyuk.\u201dI grabbed my chest and fell. The fingers that were grabbing the blanket became tighter.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Leila.\u201d It\u2019s just thunder and lightning. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. I tried to comfort myself and control my emotions, but it was in vain.Well, if it was that easy to get rid of, I wouldn\u2019t have suffered for 10 years.Thunder continued to strike. Covering my ears with a pillow was useless. Tears run down my cheeks, soaking the blanket.\u201cMisa, Misa\u2026\u201dIf she were here, I would have been able to sleep comfortably after taking sleeping pills. I regretted sending Misa to that woman.I thought I should ask another maid to bring me sleeping pills to pass this night. But\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to show this weak appearance of mine to others, so I didn\u2019t ask for help.I had an ominous feeling that the night was going to be much longer than usual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Every time there was a thunderstorm, her complexion turned pale like someone who couldn\u2019t get a bowl of soup.It was all because she was worried about Leila, and Misa, who had been stamping her feet all the time, eventually approached Philen, who was being lovey dovey with Cecily. \u201cMaster.\u201dPhilen, who was interrupted by the good time, looked at Misa with an annoyed face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dMisa glanced at Cecily and carefully spoke to Philen. \u201cThere\u2019s thunderstorms.\u201dPhilen\u2019s eyes looked out the window at the sudden remark. Just in time, thunder rumbled and struck loudly.\u201cKkyag!\u201d Cecily shrieked cutely and hugged Philen. As if Cecily was cute, Philen hugged her tightly.\u201cAre you afraid of thunderstorms?\u201d\u201cA little.\u201d\u201cOh my, you\u2019re a coward.\u201d Philen smiled and kissed Cecily\u2019s head. \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I have no choice but to be by your side tonight.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dAs if they had forgotten Misa\u2019s existence in front of them, the two were busy coveting each other\u2019s lips.Misa\u2019s cheeks turned red. It was a reaction from shame, not from embarrassment. She was thinking of talking to him again when they separated, but the two people didn\u2019t seem to intend to separate. \u201cMaster.\u201dWhen Misa, who was tired of waiting, called again, Philen, who had been coveting Cecily\u2019s lips, glared at her with a strong impression. \u201cAre you still standing there?\u201d\u201cMay I go back?\u201d\u201cYes, go back.\u201dAt Philen\u2019s answer, Misa bowed down, trying to hide her joyful expression.Cecily stared at Misa.Misa turned around, thinking that she had to go ahead and soothe Leila, who was crying pitifully.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d However, Cecily called Misa. Misa looked back at her, but she didn\u2019t look at Misa and looked at Philen. \u201cPhil, my legs and back hurt a little. I must have been on the horse for a long time.\u201d\u201cShould I bring you medicine?\u201d\u201cUh-huh. Other than that, I think it will be okay if someone rubs it.\u201d Cecily said that and glanced at Misa.Philen, who immediately noticed what Cecily wanted, beckoned to Misa. \u201cMisa, rub her legs and back.\u201dMisa bowed down and replied politely. \u201cThere is someone who does better than me.\u201d\u201cI want you to do it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dMisa\u2019s complexion became cloudy in an instant. In her mind, Leila, who must be in great distress, fluttered.\u201cWhat are you doing? Come on and do it.\u201dMisa tried to tell Philen that Leila was terrified of thunderstorms, but she shut her mouth. It was because of Cecily next to him. She didn\u2019t want to let her know about Leila\u2019s weakness. Leila wouldn\u2019t want it either.\u201c\u2026yes.\u201d Misa, who was contemplating what to do, eventually decided to follow Philen\u2019s order. Because there was no other way. The only way was to execute the order quickly and run to Leila.Misa tried to do that, but Cecily didn\u2019t let go of her, giving all kinds of excuses and reasons, so Misa could only go to Leila when the rain stopped.*****When the rain stopped and dawn came, Misa, who came to me, grabbed me and cried, saying she was sorry.I held onto Misa and cried, and then I fell asleep exhausted, and when I woke up again, Misa was not seen. Instead, there was a box of sleeping pills on the side table. It was no doubt that Misa had left it behind. I put the box in the drawer and stepped out of the bed.When the bell rang, Sarah came in with washing water. Sarah, who was standing by my side while washing me briefly and changing my clothes, asked anxiously. \u201cYou don\u2019t look good. Are you sick?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay, so you can go.\u201d\u201cYes, if you need something, please feel free to call me.\u201d Sarah, who was quick-witted, went straight out without bothering me anymore.I had no one else to meet today, so I thought I would quietly stay in my room and look at the documents.\u201cMy lady, the Duke is looking for you.\u201d Then the servant delivered unwelcome news.\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. He just told me to pick you up and come quickly.\u201dThat means there is a very urgent matter.I tried to figure out what happened recently in the estate or in the mansion so that he could find me in a hurry, but nothing came to mind. He just returned to the mansion yesterday and he couldn\u2019t find me for that. Is it his job?If that\u2019s the case, I didn\u2019t want to go, but I had to go. I stood up from my seat with a sigh.The servant walked ahead, saying that he would guide me. I thought he was in his room, but unexpectedly, Philen was in the office. Even though it didn\u2019t suit him, he sat at his desk and looked at something hard.\u201cDid you call me?\u201d\u201cLook at this.\u201dAs I approached him, he showed me what he was looking at. It was a letter. Fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s about her. Relieved by that, I took the letter from Philen.The luxurious letterhead was proof that it wasn\u2019t unusual. I opened my eyes wide when I saw the Imperial seal next to the signature on the bottom. A letter from the Imperial family. It was not a letter to be passed lightly.I stood there and read the letter without missing a single period. There were many words written on the letterhead, but there was only one thing that mattered. They wanted us to participate in the ceremony to commemorate the new emperor\u2019s enthronement in a month.\u201cA month from now. Time is tight.\u201dThere\u2019s no way we would miss the celebration party. Starting with clothes, there were a lot of things to prepare, such as accessories. I also had to calculate the time from here to the capital. It took about 4 days from here to the capital, so the remaining time was about 3 weeks.As soon as I went out, I had to call a costume designer. The accessory craftsman and the shoe craftsman were also called together, and if we went to the capital once, we would come back after a month, so we had to take care of the work in advance.I didn\u2019t know anything else, but I had to prepare for the rainy season. We couldn\u2019t exchange everything through a carrier pigeon, so we could discuss it through magic communication.\u201cLeila.\u201d Philen called me as I was trying to figure out what to do in my head.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cFrom now on, use honorifics to me\u201d\u201c\u2026what? What do you mean all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cNow, we would be in society often and using informal language is not good for other people to see.\u201dIt was correct in every phrase. I, too, didn\u2019t intend to speak informally to Philen as I do now in society. I was just embarrassed when Philen suddenly pointed that out.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201dAs I stared at him silently, Philen asked with a small impression. \u201cYou, you don\u2019t want me to be humiliated in front of other people, do you?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d\u201cThen use honorifics in front of other people. That\u2019s the way it was originally.\u201dYes, that\u2019s right. The problem is why Philen, who hasn\u2019t said anything so far, suddenly asks for it\u2026 Does the letter from the Imperial family remind him that he should? Or\u2026 maybe she pointed it out?It was more likely to be the latter than the former. Similar things happened in the past, but he didn\u2019t ask me to speak formally. Rather, it was Philen, who cheerfully laughed, saying, \u2018you don\u2019t have to pay attention to other people\u2019s eyes.\u2019 The reason he suddenly changed his attitude must be because of her.\u201cOkay.\u201d If so, I didn\u2019t even intend to stand still. \u201cFrom now on, I will call you Duke and use honorifics in front of other people.\u201d\u201cThen, from now on\u2026\u201d\u201cInstead.\u201d I continued, looking straight at Philen who looked at me with puzzled eyes. \u201cYou should also speak up in front of other people by calling me lady Thebesa, not Leila.\u201dSince Philen\u2019s return, there had been no quiet day for the Duke of Williot.\u201cDid you see it? Master and lady, talking to each other.\u201d\u201cYes, I saw it. What\u2019s going on all of a sudden?\u201dThe maid tilted her head and said. \u201cThe two, until now, they have always been comfortable with each other.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because of her? The woman with the master\u2019s child.\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s because of that too.\u201dAnother maid suddenly interrupted the conversation. \u201cIf not, there is no reason to use honorifics to make them suddenly feel distant\u2026\u201dIt was because I appeared that the maids, who chatted while wiping the windows, shut their mouths at once. I didn\u2019t want to stand in front of them senselessly. I had to go through this hallway to get to my office, so I couldn\u2019t help it.There was an awkward silence. Everyone closed their mouths like mute and looked at my eyes. After hesitating for no reason, I didn\u2019t want to blur the atmosphere further, so I walked quickly.\u201cGo, Good afternoon, my lady.\u201dAs I was going through the hallway, one of the maids carefully greeted me. Greetings that I wished I hadn\u2019t received.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to greet me if you don\u2019t want to.\u201dI didn\u2019t mean to answer coldly, but when I thought of what they said earlier, the words went cold without me knowing. One of the reasons that made my mood remained low for the last few days.\u201cMy lady, we are\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I smiled casually as if it\u2019s really okay and passed by the maids who didn\u2019t know what to do. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m saying something. You can keep talking.\u201d\u201cMy, my lady!\u201d At my words, the maids were embarrassed and called me anxiously, but I didn\u2019t look back.It wasn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t want to see them. The smiling mask that I was wearing broke down. I didn\u2019t want to show my distorted expression to the maids. My only remaining pride, who had nothing, didn\u2019t allow it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI quickly headed to the office because I didn\u2019t want to run into other employees.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dWhen I entered the office, I leaned against the closed door and sighed deeply, rubbing my face with both hands.After accepting my offer, Philen\u2019s behavior toward me became noticeably colder.Is it a week already?I and Philen started using honorifics in front of other people.If there\u2019s no one around, I decided to speak informally with him. But since that day, we had never met together alone, so I never had a chance to do that.We always called each other \u2018Duke\u2019 and \u2018Lady Thebesa\u2019. We didn\u2019t exchange jokes or talk as loud as we used to.\u201cIt seems like we became very distant.\u201dEven if Philen was on the battlefield for six years, I didn\u2019t feel distant at all. But in the last few days, I felt distant. If I knew that it would be like this, I would have told him not to use honorifics.No. It\u2019s something I should have done. Rather, it was strange if we still spoke informally.I decided not to think about it again, but I kept thinking about it, so I sighed. Especially, when I thought about that woman, I felt a heavy rock pressing my chest.It wasn\u2019t long when that woman sent Misa back, maybe she didn\u2019t like her anymore. Instead, she started using the newly hired maid as her exclusive maid, who was hired by Philen after an interview in person. That meant Philen cherished her so much.If he had shown me a little bit of his interest, I wouldn\u2019t have felt this sad. No, I might have been more disappointed if it had been. I could have been struggling because she definitely didn\u2019t want me to take Philen\u2019s attention from her.\u201c\u2026what happens to me if she gives birth to a son?\u201dWould she take my place as the Duchess and would I miserably have to leave the Duke of Williot?The sudden thought darkened my eyes because I had never thought of any other path than being a Duchess.After getting engaged to Philen, I was educated to become a Duchess. For more than 10 years, I carried out the Duke and Duchess\u2019s duties.I never doubted that I would be the Duchess until now. But would I not be able to be the one now? Would I be robbed by an unidentified woman whom I didn\u2019t know where she came from? So what should I do?If I couldn\u2019t become the Duchess, I\u2019d\u2026My mind was getting dark before my eyes. It became distant.I stumbled and sat on the sofa. A lot of documents were waiting for me, but I didn\u2019t want to see them now.I don\u2019t think it will get into my head anyway, so let\u2019s take a break.I closed my eyes to find peace in my mind.The whole world looked black. What if I fell asleep like this, I was worried. Of course, it was a useless worry.Knock. Knock.Not long after I closed my eyes, I heard a knock. I got up and arranged my messy hair and clothes.\u201cCome in.\u201dIt\u2019s time to work. I thought it\u2019d be an aide\u2026\u201cLeila.\u201dUnexpectedly, it was Philen who opened the door.I stood up, slightly surprised.It was the first time he came to my office after returning to the mansion.I asked with half-anxiety and half-pleasure. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Since there\u2019s no one here, I was talking like it used to be.\u201cYou called a costume designer before.\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201dTo participate in the upcoming banquet, I called out a costume designer and accessory craftsman to match Philen\u2019s clothes and accessories.\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d\u00a0Is that why you are here?If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d ask if it\u2019s better to change it right away before it\u2019s too late but Philen frowned.\u201cYou have no idea what the problem is?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t match her clothes.\u201d\u2026her?\u201cAre you talking about the woman you brought?\u201dI wanted to know that woman\u2019s name, but I didn\u2019t want to put it in my mouth, so I called her like that on purpose.\u201cYeah. When I checked, I found that she didn\u2019t match any single clothes. Why did you do that?\u201dAre you asking me that question now?I replied, pressing down my burning irritation. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the other way around. Why should I do that?\u201d\u201cWhy should you do that? It\u2019s obvious.\u201d\u201cHow is it obvious?\u201dPilen frowned as I kept asking.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect such a smart girl like you would ask something like that.\u201d\u201cThank you for thinking I\u2019m smart, but no matter how much I think about it, I don\u2019t know. So can you explain it to me?\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t understand. I was very upset. The reason he came to my office for the first time was to ask about her. There\u2019s no way I couldn\u2019t feel upset.The half-pleasant that I felt disappeared and that place was filled with irritation. I regretted having a conversation with him this time.\u201cCecily came to this mansion naked with nothing. The clothes she\u2019s wearing are all she has.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why.\u201d Philen continued with a strong impression. \u201cIf you had a little thought, you should have arranged some nice clothes for her. We\u2019re preparing baby supplies for our upcoming baby.\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to do that? Can she do it herself?\u201d\u201cShe is pregnant. What if she overdoes it and gets a miscarriage?\u201dIs it too much to match clothes and prepare baby supplies\u2026\u201cAnd you\u2019re the hostess of the mansion.\u201dHostess. The word completely cut off the strings of my reason.I twisted my lips and shot Philen. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m the hostess of the mansion?\u201d\u201cOf course. You\u2019re the woman I\u2019m going to marry. Who else would be the hostess of the mansion?\u201dI hated myself, who said that at least my place wouldn\u2019t be taken by her.\u201cAnd you\u2019re still asking me to take care of her?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dSeeing his eyes were wide open, Philen really didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was saying.I already knew he was tactless, but I didn\u2019t think he would be this stupid. I was thinking about what to explain, but Philen added.\u201cLeila, I don\u2019t think you know, but it\u2019s the hostess\u2019s job to take care of the guests who come to the mansion.\u201d\u201cGuest?\u201d I tilted my head and asked back.\u201cShe has my child, how can she be a simple guest? Not a guest, it should be considered a mistress.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to talk in circles, so he asked me bluntly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you have been angry about that?\u201dNow, as if he finally realized why I was angry, Philen smiled a little and came right in front of me.\u201cLeila, I say once again, you are the only woman I\u2019m going to marry. She only had my child for one night\u2019s mistake.\u201dOne night\u2019s mistake. Will it be like that?\u201cIf she hadn\u2019t had my baby, I wouldn\u2019t have brought her here. I had to bring her because she had my baby. I didn\u2019t want to be a heartless man who abandoned his child.\u201dI really wanted to ask if he treated her too kindly because of that, but I endured it because it seemed like I was too childish.\u201cWhen Cecily has the baby, I will take him into the mansion.\u201d\u201cI will put him into my family register.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s my blood anyway.\u201dYeah, you would. I didn\u2019t understand the heart, but I understood the head.My father, Count Thebesa, did the same. I became lady Thebesa like that.So I fully understood what he was saying, but that\u2019s all. I kept my mouth shut because I still didn\u2019t get the ready answer.\u201cIf you understand what I\u2019m saying, try to match her dress now.\u201dHe interpreted himself as such and began to talk bullshit.\u201cThere\u2019s no time to make a custom dress, so let\u2019s go with a readymade dress.\u201dWait. There\u2019s no time to make a custom dress? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201c\u2026are you going to take her to the capital?\u201d\u201cMm. If we leave her alone in the mansion, she\u2019ll be bored, so we\u2019ll take her to look around the capital.\u201dHow could that be the behavior of the man who had no choice but to bring her?I thought I could trust him even if he really liked her.There was no way to prevent Philen from taking that woman to the capital. If he said he\u2019s taking her to the banquet, I could stop him by making an excuse to be aware of other people\u2019s eyes. But it\u2019s not a problem with taking her to the capital.I felt very offended and I didn\u2019t like it. But it was my loss by saying this, \u201cYeah, do whatever you like.\u201dIf I throw out my pride, I\u2019d be crushed, and eventually, I\u2019d have to obey him. So I decided to let him do whatever he wanted from the beginning.\u201cBut don\u2019t tell me to take care of her. Do it on your own for that part.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t understood what I\u2019m talking about yet?\u201d\u201cI understand. I fully understand what you\u2019re talking about, but not this.\u201d I said, staring at Philen with cold eyes. \u201cIf you really think of me as a fianc\u00e9e and a woman to marry, don\u2019t ever tell me to take care of her.\u201dIf he couldn\u2019t understand what I was saying this time, I was ready to fight him greatly.Fortunately, Philen didn\u2019t mention her anymore to me as if he understood me well.I didn\u2019t even say anything about her, and everything seemed to go back to the beginning.Although my feeling was rising little by little, at least it was still on the surface.Philen called the designer to match that woman\u2019s clothes. She stayed with me the whole time choosing clothes.When I called him and said that he had to match my clothes to go to the capital, he didn\u2019t even show his nose, saying to do it on my own.As expected, Philen seemed to have a heart for that woman.I was a little disappointed, but that\u2019s all. I wasn\u2019t engaged to him in the first place hoping for his love. What I wanted was the title, Duchess Williot. A place where I could do whatever I wanted to do.A good reason to get out of that damn house. Anything else was good if that was guaranteed.Of course, if my fianc\u00e9 got acquainted with another woman, it would be heartbreaking. That said, I was able to endure it because my position wasn\u2019t threatened.Although the existence of the mistress was not officially recognized, many nobles had more mistresses than expected.Even if they swore on the outside, it was also an atmosphere of acknowledging implicitly. I didn\u2019t want to see her as much as possible. Soon, even if I had a child I gave birth to, I had no intention of conversing with her face to face.\u201cHello.\u201dWhat I didn\u2019t want to happen always happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWell, no matter how big the mansion was, it didn\u2019t make any sense if we lived together and never bumped into each other. Like now, there was a great chance that I would bump into her while passing by.Blaming my foolish self for forgetting that fact, I looked at the woman standing in front of me.The sunlight that came through the window shattered brilliantly over the soft platinum hair. Like the visible crescent moon, her pretty curved eyes were attractive. She was wearing a dress with no special decorations, although we already matched her dress. She was only wearing a necklace with a blue jewel as her accessory. And yet, she was gorgeous.I didn\u2019t want to be side by side with her because I already knew why Philen fell for her.I unintentionally looked at the woman\u2019s belly. It was two times bigger than when I first saw it.How many months has it been?I\u2019ve never seen anyone pregnant, so I couldn\u2019t tell.That woman felt my gaze and smiled lightly, touching her belly.\u201cYou can touch it.\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s okay.\u201dI couldn\u2019t do that unless I was out of my mind.When I refused right away, that woman, Cecily, looked sad.\u201cOh, I haven\u2019t introduced myself yet.\u201d Cecily smiled lightly. She grabbed the hem of her skirt and bowed lightly.Every time she moved, the blue jewel on her necklace shook unusually.\u201cCecily Heliode.\u201dWhat did you say? Heliode?Wasn\u2019t it the royal castle of the Mullis Kingdom that the Empire conquered some time ago? If that woman\u2019s words were true, it meant that she\u2019s a princess of the Mullis Kingdom. No, since the Mullis Kingdom was gone, \u2018she was a Princess\u2019 was the correct expression.Anyway, the fact that she was an uncomfortable person to laugh and chat with hadn\u2019t changed. I just wanted to ignore her and turn around, but it was hard to ignore her when she introduced herself with a smile.I couldn\u2019t help it. I introduced myself, swallowing annoyance inside. \u201c\u2026Leila Thebesa.\u201d In short.Then Cecily looked at me with her eyes wide, as if panicked. It was a face hoping for me to do something more.What does she want? Don\u2019t tell me, she wants me to ask her about the condition of her and her child lightly?If that was the case, it was a vain expectation. I had no intention of doing that. I didn\u2019t want her and her child to go wrong, but I didn\u2019t want them to be healthy either. It would be an accurate expression that I wasn\u2019t interested in at all.I already introduced myself, so I could go now, right? Cecily seemed to have more to say, but I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t even intend to listen to her. I was about to go, but Cecily called me again.\u201cLady Thebesa.\u201dThat said, if Cecily was an ordinary foreign royal, calling me Lady Thebesa didn\u2019t matter. However, she was a member of the royal family of the fallen kingdom. Was it right for her to call me Lady Thebesa?Usually, when a kingdom was destroyed, the royalties or nobles fell to commoners or lower status. So, it was wrong for Cecily, who was also a Princess, to call me Lady Thebesa.It was right to politely call me \u2018young lady\u2019. But there were exceptions to everything. For example, the kingdom was destroyed, but the emperor recognized the royal family\u2019s legitimacy. Or when the mother was from another kingdom and inherited the mother\u2019s status.When I saw Cecily\u2019s confident attitude, I couldn\u2019t rule out the case, so I was worried for a while.It was the most obvious and quickest to ask in person, but it was not easy because it was a sensitive matter.\u201cDoes the princess of the fallen kingdom need to be treated like a princess?\u201dIt was Sarah who spoke on my behalf. While I was taken aback by Sarah\u2019s daring words, I felt a cool feeling because of the sudden relief.On the other hand, Cecily made a small impression. She didn\u2019t seem to like what Sarah said. Looking at her reaction, she seemed to be an exception. Yeah, that\u2019s why you confidently called me Lady Thebesa.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt was right to apologize quickly because she couldn\u2019t take back the words she had already said.\u201cMy maid made a mistake because she was ignorant of this side. I\u2019ll go back and scold her, so please pass it generously just once. Umm\u2026\u201dHer kingdom was destroyed to be called Princess Heliode, and she was not a noblewoman of the Empire to be called Lady Heliode. She wasn\u2019t a noblewoman from another country, and I couldn\u2019t just call her name like I treated a maid.\u201c\u2026Miss Heliode.\u201dAs I was thinking about what to call her, I found an appropriate compromise.Cecily kept making an impression that my apology didn\u2019t make her feel better. But I didn\u2019t want to apologize anymore. Instead of saying something more, I turned around.I could feel Cecily\u2019s persistent gaze from behind, but I didn\u2019t look back. Because I didn\u2019t want to talk to her anymore.There was nothing to talk about, so I ignored Cecily and headed to my room. I walked quickly because I was afraid Cecily would catch me, and I was a little out of breath.As I stepped into my room with a quick breath, Misa was tidying up my desk and looked at me with perplexed eyes.\u201cMy lady, who has been chasing you?\u201dI sat on the sofa without answering.Noticing that I wasn\u2019t feeling very well, Misa asked Sarah. \u201cWhat happened out there?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cSarah.\u201d I shut her mouth by calling Sarah\u2019s name.Misa noticed that it was a bad thing, so she didn\u2019t ask further.I leaned over the sofa and closed my eyes gently.Misa looked at me and carefully called me. \u201cUm, my lady.\u201dCalling me even though she knew that I was in a bad mood meant that there was something so important. \u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cA little while ago, a letter from Countess Thebesa arrived.\u201d\u201c\u2026the Countess?\u201dCount Thebesa was my biological father, but not Countess Thebesa. She was just a mother in the family register.Countess Thebesa took me as her daughter to cover up her husband\u2019s mistakes, but that\u2019s all. She thoroughly ignored me and condemned me. If she was in a bad mood or had something wrong, she often threw her hands around. It was disgusting for her to pretend to be a good mother outside.The biggest reason I wanted to get out of the house somehow was Countess Thebesa. The second reason was her son and my stepbrother, Andant Thebesa.When I still closed my eyes, I remembered that day clearly.\u201cLeila, are you a good girl?\u201dA disgustingly thick smell of alcohol and his sparkling eyes. And\u2026\u201cMy lady?\u201d\u201cOh, sorry.\u201dWhat am I doing? There\u2019s nothing good for me to think about the bad past.I shook my head lightly and shook my thoughts away. \u201cDid you say you got a letter from the Countess?\u00a0 Bring it to me.\u201dAfter Misa brought me the letter, she and Sarah went far away. They were considerate so that I could read the letter comfortably.I tore the envelope with a knife and took out the letter inside and read it.On the letterhead, there were useless greetings and a long line of rhetoric, but the point was one.She will visit the Duke of Williot tomorrow.The reason for the visit was not stated. It was written that she was coming because she wanted to see me after a long time, but this was a new red lie that she wrote because she was conscious of other people\u2019s eyes. She said she wanted to see me? It was more convincing to say that the sun would rise in the west tomorrow.What should I do?I didn\u2019t really want to meet her, but there was no good reason to tell her not to come. I wondered why she was coming. I looked at Misa, thinking whether or not to meet her for a while.\u201cMisa, the Countess is visiting the mansion tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh my God, the Countess? I\u2019ll have to prepare in advance.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cNo. The Countess is coming. I have to prepare carefully.\u201d Misa went outside, saying that she had to prepare it quickly.After sending Sarah out, I was dealing with tasks that I hadn\u2019t done yet. But not long after, a maid came to me urgently and told me the unexpected news.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cIt is said that the woman suddenly collapsed!\u201dThat woman suddenly collapsed. The woman she was talking about was Cecily. She looked fine a while ago, but now she\u2019s collapsed.I didn\u2019t like it, but it bothered me. It\u2019s probably because she had Philen\u2019s child.\u201cWhat about the doctor?\u201d\u201cHe just arrived and heard that he was examining her. Even the Duke was very surprised and immediately ran away.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dIf Philen went, I wouldn\u2019t have to go. I too didn\u2019t want to go.I was working on what I was doing without worrying, but the door quickly opened without knocking.\u201cLeila!\u201dIt was Philen. He stared at me with a terrifying face and said, \u201cWhat did you say to Cecily?\u201dAs expected, I was right. I let out a deep sigh, half resigned. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d Philen denied my words like a knife. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t say anything, why did Cecily collapse after meeting you?\u201d\u201cIs she so? She was shocked and collapsed?\u201d\u201cNo. Cecily hadn\u2019t woken up yet. The doctor said it was because of a psychological shock. And Cecily\u2019s maids testified that you met Cecily today.\u201d\u201cSo? What did the maids say about what I told her?\u201dPhilen didn\u2019t answer me, and yet he ran like fire and pissed at me. It was so absurd that I couldn\u2019t even laugh. I was speechless.\u201cIf the child in Cecily\u2019s belly goes wrong, I won\u2019t let it go.\u201dA spark splattered in Philen\u2019s eyes that was looking at me.\u201cSo be careful in the future, Leila. Or you don\u2019t know how it\u2019ll turn out.\u201d Pilen threatened with a wistful face, then went out.I realized it only after hearing Philen\u2019s threats. Philen\u2019s heart for Cecily was deeper than I thought.I was stupid, reassured that the Duchess position would never be taken away by Cecily. The fact that the end of this engagement might be a break-up, not a marriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCecily, who was unconscious, soon woke up unscathed.Fortunately, the misunderstanding was cleared up. Perhaps because the threat had already come out from his mouth, Philen didn\u2019t visit me again.The threat he left behind became a big stone and weighed heavily on my heart. To make matters worse, the rain made me feel depressed and fell to the bottom.The rain started late at night and continued to rain the next day. On days like this, it was best to stay in the room and read books without doing anything, but sadly, I couldn\u2019t.\u201cWow, it\u2019s raining a lot.\u201dIt\u2019s because Countess Thebesa came to visit.The fact that I had to deal with her when my mind was confused and complicated felt terrible. However, since I couldn\u2019t ask the woman who had come to go back again, I smiled hard and greeted her.\u201cWelcome, Mother.\u201dUsing the title that\u2019s only used in front of other people.Countess Thebesa frowned slightly, as if not liking when I called her mother.\u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad you seem to be doing well. Leila.\u201dFor a moment, she looked at me wearing the mask of a loving mother, like a person who had long been in the social world.I held back my stomach, trying not to laugh.Couldn\u2019t stand to continue talking in the hall, I headed to the parlor with Countess Thebesa. She came in and asked for everyone but her to be sent out.I guessed she wanted to take off the mask she\u2019s forced to wear. I was also hoping for it, so I was willing to accept it.The maid put down the refreshments and stepped back. After everyone disappeared, a heavy silence flowed into the parlor where the two were left alone.\u201cYour face looks really good.\u201d Countess Thebesa, who had taken off her mask, said while picking up the teacup with a frosty face. \u201cEven though it\u2019s like that, you have a good face. I don\u2019t know if I should say it\u2019s good, or\u2026 should I say stupid?\u201dIs it an insult for me from the beginning?I wasn\u2019t in a good mood, but it was something I heard often, so I was able to keep my expressionless face.\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for a long conversation, so just tell me your business. \u201dAs I spoke straight out, Countess Thebesa twisted her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re rude as always.\u201d\u201cWould you like to have a long conversation with me, Mother?\u201d I deliberately called her mother.The Countess looked at me with a frown. Her eyes were full of disapproval. If it was in the past, I would avoid her gaze because I didn\u2019t know what to do, but it wasn\u2019t me now. I calmly caught her gaze.Countess Thebesa snorted and put the teacup down. \u201cDon\u2019t pretend like a real duchess just because you\u2019ve been acting like a duchess. Don\u2019t forget Leila\u2026\u201d Her friendly smile was creepy. \u201cYou\u2019re still Leila Thebesa.\u201dIt might not be an illusion that she emphasized the word of Thebesa.I didn\u2019t like the fact that I was still wearing the title of Thebesa.I wanted to let her know that I knew it too, but I stopped. I didn\u2019t want to argue with this woman for such a trivial thing.\u201cYou didn\u2019t come here to say that, did you?\u201d\u201cI heard that Duke Williot brought a mistress into the mansion.\u201dI picked up the teacup and stopped at Countess Thebesa\u2019s next comment.\u201cI heard he even had a child.\u201d\u201c\u2026how did you know?\u201d\u201cIs that important now? It\u2019s important that she got pregnant before you.\u201dCountess Thebesa continued with her tongue clicked as if she was at a loss of words.\u201cWhat are you going to do now? Because of her, your position has become ambiguous.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why, as soon as the former Duke couple passed away, I told you to get married quickly and become the duchess, but you didn\u2019t even listen to me. It serves you right.\u201dI wanted to refute it, but I couldn\u2019t refute it because it was right. At least Philen made such a threat yesterday.They were red and blue respectively.\u201c\u2026what\u2019s this?\u201dTo my question, Countess Thebesa gave me the red pill.\u201cThis drug helps you to get pregnant.\u201dThis time, she gave me the blue pill.\u201cIt\u2019s an abortion drug.\u201d\u2026abortion?I looked at Countess Thebesa in surprise.\u201cIf she gives birth, your position will be shaken. You could be broken up. Even if you become the duchess, you\u2019d be a scarecrow.\u201dCountess Thebesa said it was only natural for her to bring the abortion pill.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing if you become the duchess, but if you broke up, what would you do then? Don\u2019t tell me, you\u2019re coming back to the house?\u201dCountess Thebesa shook her head as if it were terrible just to think about it.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about that, throw that away. I have no intention of accepting you again.\u201dIt\u2019s a harsh word, but it was nice to hear. Rather, I would have hated it even more if she had told me to come back.\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re already 24 years old. You\u2019re old enough to be married. But do you think you can get married again after you\u2019re broken up?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can do it somehow. If you marry a very old nobleman.\u201dCountess Thebesa sarcastically asked if I wanted something like that.I already knew it, but I wasn\u2019t in a good mood when I was shot like this. It was even worse because the opponent was Countess Thebesa.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to say something weird, please leave now.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you think it\u2019s weird. It\u2019s all because I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\u201cWhere on earth are you worried about me?\u201d\u201cIf I weren\u2019t worried, would I be looking for drugs like this?\u201dAt those words, my attention turned to the drugs she had brought again. To be precise, to the blue, abortion pill.Countess Thebesa smiled strangely as I could hardly take my eyes off the abortion pill.\u201cIt was said that just one drop would result in a child stillbirth.\u201dShe looked like a demon from hell.\u201cIf you want to keep your place, feed her.\u201dStrangely enough, it sounded like sweet angelic whispers to me.*****I hated Cecily, but I didn\u2019t want to kill her. It was the same for Cecily and Philen\u2019s child.What sin is the child guilty of?If asked who was the guilty one, it was Philen, who hugged another woman over her fiance\u00e9.Cecily was also a victim in some way. So I couldn\u2019t use the drug that Countess Thebesa gave me and put it deep in the drawer of my dressing table.If I was not going to use it, it\u2019s right to throw it away, but strangely, I couldn\u2019t.It\u2019s been a while since Philen returned to the mansion, but the Duke\u2019s job was still my job.\u201cI think it\u2019s right to hand over the job to the Duke, My lady.\u201dNear the end of the meeting, one of the aides, Kent, spoke to me.\u201cIn the past, he was a disappointment, but these days, he seems to be fine, so I think it\u2019s right to hand over the job.\u201d\u201cI think the same thing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s good news for me, as I\u2019ll have a lot of spare time if the Duke takes the job. So please congratulate me, not worried, Baron Wizard.\u201d\u201cIf you say so, I will congratulate you.\u201dOnly then did Baron Wizard leave with a relieved smile. As soon as Baron Wizard left, I sighed and touched my head.The good news must be good, right? Leila.I asked myself a question, but I myself couldn\u2019t answer it. It only deepened my frustration.\u201cMy lady, the dressmakers are here.\u201dAh, are the clothes already done?I would leave for the capital the day after tomorrow, so it was time for the finished clothes to come.\u201cWhat about the accessory craftsmen and the shoemakers?\u201d\u201cI was informed that they were coming today.\u201d\u201cI have to compare it with the finished clothes, so tell him to come right away.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dMisa immediately ordered a servant to contact the accessory craftsmen and shoemakers.\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the dressmakers, but ask them to wait a little bit and take them to the parlor. Treat them properly.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBy the time the other craftsmen arrive, call the Duke and ask him to come to the parlor. We have to choose the clothes.\u201dAfter having Misa do this and that, I took care of the rest.It was originally the Duchess\u2019 job, including managing the mansion\u2019s finances. I was looking at financial documents such as money to be spent today, money to be spent in the capital, and tax management, but Misa reported that other craftsmen had come.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be right out, so go ahead.\u201dFinancial documents were confidential that couldn\u2019t be shown to anyone. So I was going to put it in the safe and cover it, but Misa didn\u2019t go out and looked at me.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cUm, that, My lady\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you have something to say, don\u2019t hesitate to say it.\u201dWhen I pressed her, Misa closed her eyes tightly and continued.\u201cThat woman is in the parlor, too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I never call her.\u201cPhilen, no, did the Duke bring her there?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I heard Master sent her first to greet the guests.\u201d\u201cHa?\u201dIt was the mansion\u2019s hostess\u2019s job to greet the guests, not a mistress\u2019s job. But he gave that role to Cecily.It was absurd. I didn\u2019t know what to say. No, did I have anything to say? I wasn\u2019t the hostess of the mansion either. I was just acting as a hostess under Philen\u2019s tacit permission.Thinking so, I felt bitter as I thought that my situation and Cecily\u2019s were the same.\u201cMy lady, what should we do?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. If the Duke tells her to do that, she\u2019ll follow it.\u201d\u201cUgh.\u201d Misa was frustrated with my answer. She shook her head and went outside.The frustration was the same for me. I wanted to ask Philen what on earth he was thinking, but I couldn\u2019t because I was afraid that a terrible answer would come back.\u201cYou\u2019re stupid.\u201dYou\u2019re really stupid, Leila.And like a fool, after putting the documents in the safe, I followed Misa to the parlor.Philen was already in the parlor.If I had been alone with Cecily, it would have been awkward, so I felt relieved seeing him here, but at the same time, I felt uncomfortable.Like a thorn stuck in my throat. \u201cYou are here, Duke.\u201d\u201cLady Thebesa is here, too.\u201dAfter a hard greeting with Philen, my eyes spontaneously turned to Cecily next to him. Should I also say hello to Cecily?I thought it would be better to do it because there\u2019s a lot of eyes, but I was hesitating because I didn\u2019t want to.\u201cHello, Lady Thebesa.\u201dCecily greeted me first in a friendly manner. I was greeted and it was not polite to ignore it.\u201cYes! Hello\u2026\u201dI tried to take it easy, but when I saw the clothes Cecily was wearing, I belatedly opened my eyes wide.If my memory wasn\u2019t wrong, the clothes Cecily was wearing right now were the maternity clothes that the predecessor Duchess gave me as a gift.It\u2019s been nearly a decade, but when I closed my eyes, I still clearly remembered what happened when I received that maternity clothes.\u201cTo give you this, who hasn\u2019t been married yet, I feel so excited, but what can I do? I want to quickly see you wear it.\u201dThe Duchess smiled shyly like a girl and gave me that clothes as a gift.She said she received the maternity clothes from the Duchess of Seonseondae. She said she wanted to do something like this when she had a daughter-in-law.\u201cA daughter who resembles you would be very pretty, Leila. If that\u2019s the case, I hope my hair looks like you.\u201dShe said she wanted to see me wearing those clothes before prenatal. She said she wanted to see my baby and gave me that clothes as a gift.But why is she wearing it? Clothes that I have never worn.Someday, if I had children the way the predecessor Duchess hoped, the clothes I kept in silence\u2026\u201c\u2026how come you\u2019re wearing it?\u201d I asked as I was crying in my heart.Cecily looked at Philen with frightened eyes.\u201cI told her to wear it.\u201d Philen stepped forward, hiding Cecily behind his back. \u201cSo don\u2019t say anything to her, Lady Thebesa.\u201dHang in there, Leila. There\u2019s a lot of eyes here. There are not only maids and servants, but also outsiders, so you have to put up with it.There was nothing good to show them that there was a conflict between him and me, but I couldn\u2019t do it even though I knew I had to stop here.\u201cThen, what should I say to the Duke?\u201dIt was because the emotions that I had kept so far exploded.\u201cYou\u2019re overreacting to a single piece of clothing.\u201dPhilen frowned as if he didn\u2019t understand my reaction.\u201cBesides, it\u2019s a maternity clothes that the Lady doesn\u2019t need. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for those who need it to wear it than to leave it unattended?\u201d\u201cWho said I left those clothes unattended?\u201dNo way. I valued it more than any other clothes and kept it in a box in my dressing room. The evidence was that clothes that were nearly 10 years was still intact without any damage.\u201cNo? Cecily found it in a box unattended.\u201d\u201cI put it in the box, that\u2019s right\u2026 wait, she found it? Not a maid, but her?\u201d\u201cDo you have any problems?\u201dLooking at that stupid question, Philen seemed to have no idea what the problem was. Well, I wouldn\u2019t have asked that if I knew.\u201cThe dressing room is my private space.\u201d I pointed out his mistake with a prickly eyebrow.\u201cNo matter how the Duke is the owner of the mansion, it is against the law to let anyone into my private space without my permission.\u201dEven if a servant or a maid had come in, I would have been in a bad mood, but I mean that woman\u2026I felt even worse. My stomach boiled at the thought of her going through my clothes and jewelry box.\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d Philen made excuses with an annoying expression. \u201cCecily had to greet the guests, but she didn\u2019t have anything else to wear. The clothes she had are too shabby, and the ready-made dresses don\u2019t fit her.\u201d\u201cThen you should have come and asked me to lend her my clothes.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t talk to the Lady because you were in a meeting.\u201dIt was a lame excuse. Even during the meeting, if there was anything to say, I could always answer it. I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t think to ask me for permission from the start. It was so ridiculous to make such an excuse.When I stared at him, Philen sighed. \u201cTherefore, if the Lady had ordered Cecily\u2019s clothes earlier, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201dWhat are you saying now\u2026\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s my fault that this happened?\u201d\u201cIf you look at it, it is. I wouldn\u2019t have done that if the Lady had taken care of her in advance.\u201dI was dumbfounded that no words came out. I didn\u2019t do anything because I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was just swallowing the air and looking at Philen with bewildered eyes when I heard a whimper somewhere.\u201cSo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt was Cecily.She dyed the tip of her nose red and wiped her moist eyes with the back of her hand.\u201cThis is because of me\u2026\u201dHer face looked pretty because she was originally beautiful.\u201cThis wouldn\u2019t have happened if I only had clothes\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dShe seemed pitiful to me, seeing her shoulders drooping, crying, and apologizing repeatedly. But in the eyes of other people, would it be excessive?Not only outsiders, but also maids and servants looked at Cecily with pitiful eyes, and once in a while, their gaze towards me was cold.There was a flurry of eyes saying that it was too harsh just because of a piece of clothing.\u201cHa.\u201d Vain laughter came out.I could make excuses, but I didn\u2019t want to because I felt so pathetic\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dPhilen wiped Cecily\u2019s tears directly with his handkerchief.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if you do it.\u201d Philen consoled Cecily in a friendly voice like I wasn\u2019t here.Before coming here, I thought Cecily was a stranger, but it seemed that the stranger was me.No laughter came out anymore. My situation here felt so stupid.\u201cI\u2019ll go back to my room.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Misa was surprised at my words and looked at me. \u201cBut My Lady, you have to see what you\u2019ll wear at the banquet\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see them later. Bring them to my office once it\u2019s done.\u201dIf I stayed here longer, I would be angry. I didn\u2019t think I would see anything good.I came out of the parlor as if I were running away.*****My fight with Philen in the parlor spread throughout the estate.\u201cDuke Williot is terribly in love with the new mistress. I heard she had Duke Williot\u2019s baby.\u201d\u201cThat must have upset the young lady. She was cruel to her and didn\u2019t give her any clothes.\u201d\u201cHumph. Of course. Even if it\u2019s me, I wouldn\u2019t have given my clothes to the mistress.\u201d\u201cThen what\u2019s gonna happen to our young lady? Are they two breaking up their marriage?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think so. The nobles are good at separating their home business and the mistress.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u2026was the rumor circulating in the estate now.I was prepared for the rumors from the time I argued with Philen in front of outsiders, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable listening to it.In the midst of these rumors, the fact that I had to leave the estate and go to the capital with Philen and that woman made me feel even more uncomfortable. Even the things I hadn\u2019t finished yet had also been hampered.I wanted to finish it all, but I couldn\u2019t to not attend the celebration party for the new emperor\u2019s coronation, so I had no choice but to get on the carriage heading to the capital.I rode the carriage alone, while Philen and Cecily rode the carriage together.The servants looked at me with sad eyes, but I didn\u2019t care. On the contrary, I was okay with it. It was more difficult to ride a carriage with her all the way to the capital. It\u2019s much better to get sympathetic gazes.Misa wanted to go with me, but she stayed in the estate because she had to manage the mansion on my behalf. Instead, Sarah was the one who went with me.It took about four days by carriage from the Duke\u2019s estate to the capital.In the meantime, it was four days in total until the break time by stopping by the village in the middle.When I was moving, I sat still. I slept enough at the inn, but my first carriage trip since I was born was harder than I thought.\u201cPhil, eat this.\u201d\u2026no, there was something harder for me than the carriage trip.\u201cAh.\u201dIt was Cecily and Philen.Cecily fed Philen the strawberries, and Philen ate them with a happy smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThey didn\u2019t stop there. They just chatted.Since they were in the same carriage, they would have talked a lot. I wondered how they could have so much to talk about.Sarah, who was staring at Cecily and Philen with an angry look, took the strawberries from somewhere and gave them to me.\u201cDon\u2019t lose, go and feed the strawberries to the master!\u201d\u201cEnough. It\u2019s just unsightly to do that.\u201d\u201cBut, but\u2026 I\u2019m so angry!\u201d Sarah shouted, stamping her feet. \u201cMaster is too much! I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re showing off like that when My Lady is watching!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think of Philen very much.\u201d I replied casually, mindlessly fiddling with the leaves. \u201cHe\u2019s just eating because that woman feeds him.\u201d\u201cUrgh, urgh.\u201d Sarah clenched her fist in frustration and pounded her chest.I envy you. I might be angry like that. I want to, but I can\u2019t.Philen and Cecily\u2019s love affair continued until we arrived in the capital.I tried not to see them as much as I could, but they kept standing out to the point that my efforts were overshadowed. I wondered if they were deliberately appearing in front of me.When we arrived at the Duke\u2019s residence in the capital through their love affair and long carriage trip, both my body and heart were exhausted.\u201cIt\u2019s harder than I thought.\u201dAs soon as I grabbed the escort knight\u2019s hand and got off the carriage, his eyes turned to the voice in his ear.Philen was getting off the carriage, supporting the exhausted Cecily. To be precise, the support was almost hugging. It was safe to say it like this.The owners of the capital mansion, who had never seen Cecily before, looked at Cecily, Philen, and me alternately in surprise.The gaze was burdensome and I wanted to rest, so I hurriedly entered the mansion.\u201cI\u2019ll guide you to your room, My Lady.\u201dThe quick-witted butler instructed the maid to guide me to my room.It was a sunny room with a large window. I liked it now, but if it rained, it would be a more frightening place to me than any other place, so I shook my head.\u201cI want to go to another room. Is there a room without windows?\u201d\u201cYes? A room without windows?\u201d The maid asked back in surprise.Just by looking at the reaction, I could tell there was none.Obviously. Most of the rooms used by nobles had large windows so that the sun could be well lit. I couldn\u2019t ask for a maid\u2019s room, so I came up with an appropriate compromise.\u201cThen, please guide me to a room with a small window.\u201dAt my end, the maid thought about it for a while and then guided me to the room at the end of the west corridor.There was also a window here, but the window was smaller than the previous room.\u201cIs this okay, My Lady?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dMy room was decided here.Watching the servants diligently move my luggage and the maids organize, I could feel someone\u2019s presence behind me.\u201c\u2026Leila?\u201dIt was Philen. Cecily was next to him.\u201cLe\u2026 no, Lady Thebesa. Why are you here?\u201d Philen, conscious of other people\u2019s eyes, asked in honorifics.\u201cThis is my room, so I was organizing my luggage.\u201d\u201cI know that Lady Thebesa\u2019s room is not here.\u201d\u201cYes, but I like this place better, so I\u2019m going to go here.\u201d\u201c\u2026did you choose this room on purpose because you knew Cecily\u2019s room was right next to it?\u201dWas her room right next to it? I just knew it. If I had known in advance, I would never have chosen this room.\u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019ll lie about this.\u201d I replied bluntly because I was annoyed that such things would be misunderstood.But Philen rarely believed me. His suspicious look stuck to me, and there was no sign of falling off.\u201cYou know, Phil.\u201dIt was Cecily who unexpectedly removed Philen\u2019s gaze. Cecily called Philen\u2019s nickname and spoke in a poignant voice.\u201cCan\u2019t you share the room with me?\u201d Her innocent eyes were sadly folded. Cecily continued while leaning over Phil\u2019s arm. \u201cTo be honest, I was a little anxious about coming to a strange place and using the room alone. I think I would be okay if Phil stayed by my side.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay.\u201dPhilen glanced at me, then gently wrapped Cecily\u2019s shoulders and hugged her.\u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201dThe position was reversed. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off Philen, who was leaving with Cecily.\u201cMy Lady.\u201dSarah sadly called me, but I could feel the gaze of other servants looking at me with pitiful eyes, but I couldn\u2019t move a single step.The word \u2018breakup\u2019 came even closer.*****If I broke up with Philen, I would return to the ordinary Lady Thebesa. But what could I do, a 24-year-old ordinary Count Lady, who wouldn\u2019t be welcomed at home?When I thought about it, nothing came to my mind. I thought about a decent job that women could do, such as a clothes designer or embroidery, but it was considered a disgrace for a noble lady to have such a job.By the way, I was much less, much more dexterous. I heard criticism worse than embroidery. The embroidery at the age of 15 was embroidered by a 5-year-old child.However, there was no way that I could take such a line of work as a job. I didn\u2019t even want to, and what I was good at was subjects that the nobility often learn such as philosophy, accounting, and politics.I could use this to become a tutor, but the problem was that in order to become a tutor, I had to marry. Unmarried tutors were not preferred by the nobles, saying that they risked seducing naive children. Moreover, tutors couldn\u2019t work when they got older. It wasn\u2019t a stable job with a fixed income.But why am I already thinking about getting broke? I haven\u2019t even broken up yet.I laughed a little and shook my head.Philen\u2019s changed attitude in the last few days would have been quite shocking. Countess Thebesa\u2019s visit also played a part.It was wiser to try to keep what was right in front of you than to be afraid of something that hadn\u2019t happened yet and find a way to deal with it.Let\u2019s keep my place somehow. By all means.With that in mind, I remembered the abortion pill that Countess Thebesa gave me. If I used it, I would be able to secure my place\u2026 As expected, I hated it.\u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201dI was in a tight situation where I couldn\u2019t do this or that. I wanted to take a walk. But, I was reluctant to go because Cecily occupied the mansion\u2019s garden under the pretext of prenatal education. I didn\u2019t want to meet her because I didn\u2019t have anything good to do with her.\u201c\u2026If I leave the mansion, I won\u2019t bump into her.\u201dYeah, that would do. Why didn\u2019t I think of this earlier?I thought it would be better to look around the capital and to relieve my frustration, so I took Sarah and went straight out of the mansion.I just left the mansion, and my frustration was relieved. I smiled lightly and looked out the window.\u201cMy Lady, it\u2019s been a while since I last saw you smile.\u201d Sarah, who was sitting across from me, looked at me with a twinkle in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I have seen it since we came to the capital.\u201dDid I?\u201cThere are a lot of interesting things in the capital. There are a lot of delicious things! So let\u2019s have fun until you feel completely relieved, My Lady.\u201dWhen I was relieved like this, it was useless to return to the mansion. The moment I saw her and Philen\u2019s faces, I would feel low again.Just the mere thought of them sent the good feeling away as if it\u2019s plunging again. I didn\u2019t have to make Sarah feel bad by telling her that.\u201cYeah, let\u2019s do it.\u201d I smiled falsely and nodded.After a while, the carriage reached a crowded street. The distance was wide enough for the carriage to go around, but there were too many people to move forward.\u201cLet\u2019s walk from here.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ll have to walk for a long time. Would you be okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dI knew this would happen, so I came with Mary Jane shoes on purpose. There was no problem walking for a moderately long time with this.As I got off the carriage, an escort knight followed me.\u201cI\u2019ll only take Sarah with me. Don\u2019t follow me.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not going to ignore my order, are you?\u201dWhen I spoke with a stern face, the escort knight was forced to step back.I took Sarah into the crowd without an escort knight. Sarah stuck closely in case she would miss me.As if only the entrance was blocked, it became quiet when I went inside. There were almost no people inside.Obviously, I was wondering about the difference. As I looked around, I realized that this was a residential street, not a shopping street.\u201cIt looks like we have gone the wrong way.\u201d\u201cI know, right? Let\u2019s go back, My Lady.\u201dIt was when I turned around in sympathy with Sarah.\u201cGo, let go!\u201dI heard a girl shouting somewhere. I turned my head to the source of the voice. Then I saw a giant man with a knife mark on his face holding onto a girl\u2019s arm.\u201cLet my sister go!\u201dThe child who looked younger than the girl was desperately holding the man\u2019s leg.\u201cWhy is this little one so annoying!?\u201dThe man violently kicked the child\u2019s belly with one foot that was the size of the child\u2019s face.\u201cArgh!\u201dThe child floated in the air, then flew away and fell to the ground.\u201cLily!\u201d The girl anxiously called the child\u2019s name with a tearful face.The man roughly pulled the girl\u2019s wrist. Because of that, the girl fell to the ground, but he didn\u2019t care at all.\u201cDon\u2019t do anything useless and follow me! Do you know how much money you have to pay me back?!\u201dHe tried to grab the girl\u2019s hair and drag her away.Listening to the conversation, it seemed that the girl borrowed money from the man. Even so, the man\u2019s behavior was too much.I frowned at the ruthless violence against the child. Sarah also looked at them in dismay.I just hated getting involved in troublesome work. My work alone was enough to burst my head.\u201cWait.\u201dHowever, this couldn\u2019t be ignored.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked back at me with an irritated face. He looked me up and down and shook his hand in annoyance.\u201cYou seem like a precious young lady. Don\u2019t interrupt me and go.\u201d\u201cTo whom that rude man dares\u2026!\u201dWhen Sarah got angry at the rude man\u2019s attitude, I raised my hand to calm her down.\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d\u201cWhat am I doing? Of course, I\u2019m collecting money.\u201dThe man answered my question obediently while giving a full look of annoyance.\u201cThese kids borrowed money and they haven\u2019t paid it back for more than six months. So would I be angry or not?\u201d\u201cOf course you\u2019ll be angry.\u201d\u201cRight? As expected, a well-educated girl knows well.\u201dAt my answer, the man smiled triumphantly, and the girl, who looked at me like a savior, bowed her head.\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t have money, don\u2019t you think she should pay it back with her body? I\u2019m taking her with me, as the saying goes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re trying to sell the girl to a brothel?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s one of those ways too.\u201dUnable to say the words confidently, the man swallowed his words.\u201cHow much money do these kids have to repay?\u201d\u201cWhy? Will you repay me for them?\u201dOrdinary nobles might have shouted that they would pay him back right here, but I had no intention of doing so.\u201cNo. Why should I do that?\u201dAs I answered coldly, the man scratched his head as if he was speechless.\u201cThen why are you asking?\u201d\u201cI just asked because I was curious. Can\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t\u2026 Well, I\u2019m not saying that I can\u2019t tell you. The total is 500 gold.\u201dConsidering the monthly living cost of a commoner\u2019s family of four was about 10 gold, it was quite a lot of money. I couldn\u2019t believe these kids borrowed such a large amount of money.As I looked at the girl in surprise, she shouted with a vein on her neck.\u201cNo! The money I borrowed was 30 gold first! But suddenly he told me to pay him back 500 gold!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interest, interest. If you borrowed money, it\u2019s natural to repay with interest too, right?\u201d\u201cInterest\u2026\u201dShe borrowed 30 gold, and six months later, it became 500 gold\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re saying the interest rate is 60%?\u201dAt my words, the man looked at me in great surprise.\u201cThe highest interest rate for the loan business set by the empire is 30%.\u201dI kept talking, looking straight into the shaking man\u2019s eyes.\u201cYou got 30% more?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s all for a reason\u2026\u201dUnlike before, when he was confident, his voice was shaking. The man couldn\u2019t even look me in the eye properly.\u201cEnough.\u201dWhatever the man said, I had no intention of listening, so I cut his words firmly. There was no reason to listen.\u201cYou can make excuses in the courtroom. They\u2019ll give you a verdict.\u201d\u201cNo, something so trivial even to the court\u2026\u201d\u201cOr do you want me to give you a verdict?\u201dI spread out the fan I was holding so that the man could see it well.\u201cViolating Imperial Law, committing fraud against young children, and daring to dishonor me, a noblewoman.\u201dOn the fan, the crest of the Duke of Williot was engraved in a large size.The man\u2019s eyes widened like a rabbit, whether he recognized the crest.\u201cIf you add it all up, you\u2019ll get a thousand gold.\u201d\u201cWh, what kind of nonsense\u2026! Do, don\u2019t cheat!\u201d\u201cAh, you even spoke informally to me, so there\u2019s an additional fine.\u201dAt my words, the man\u2019s eyes shook even more.I mean, why did you speak informally while I\u2019m saying the sentences? They say if you have a bad head, your body will suffer, and that\u2019s right.\u201cAnd you told me not to cheat, didn\u2019t you? Do you want to bet if my words are fraudulent or not?\u201dI smiled gently, covering my mouth with the open fan.\u201cIf it\u2019s less than I said, I\u2019ll pay all the fines as well as the money these kids borrowed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? Would you like to bet?\u201dAt my words, the man hesitated and quickly looked around me. It was so fast that I could hear the rolling of his eyes.\u201c\u2026a precious young lady wandering around without an escort knight.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes glistened after confirming that there were no escorts or spectators. The man threw the girl\u2019s hair and pulled out a dagger from his waistline.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid. Do you know what will happen?\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to do to me?\u201d\u201cNot to the extent that I am fearless, I lost my cowardice.\u201dThe man shuffled briefly and then rushed towards me.Sarah screamed a little and stuck behind me. On the other hand, I looked at the man calmly.I was worried if the man made the girl or the child\u2019s life as a hostage and threatened me, but he ran to me.I\u2019m grateful for it.When I tried to fold the fan and stop the dagger swinging by the man\u2026Kangg\u2013A sword popped out from behind and blocked the dagger.\u201c\u2026?\u201dWith a sharp bursting sound, the dagger held by the rude fell to the ground. The sword that popped out didn\u2019t stop there, but struck the rude.If it was a sword blade, a terrible scene would have unfolded, but fortunately, it was a sword\u2019s back, so it ended up to the extent that the man fell behind.\u201cThank you for being at the front, Lady.\u201dStill, I was surprised. I stared at the rude man with my eyes blinking, and someone appeared next to me.I turned my head and checked the opponent.\u201cIf not, his throat would have blown away.\u201dNo matter how low-heeled it was, the man was tall enough to have to look up. His blue hair that resembled the sea was attractive. His shoulders were moderately wide, and his appearance was as beautiful as someone\u2019s painstaking sculpture.Overall, he was a handsome man, but the most captivating thing was his transparent, sparkling eyes like sapphire.Beautiful.Without knowing, I stared into the man\u2019s eyes.As if he felt my gaze, the man looked back at me.Soon, the blue eyes folded beautifully. His lips went up smoothly, drawing a line.\u201cAh.\u201dOnly then, I came to my senses and lowered my head in surprise.Crazy. Staring at the face of an outsider.My face was burning hot.As I lowered my head with a fan covering my face, the man raised the corner of his mouth smoothly and smiled mischievously.\u201cYou son of a b*tch!\u201dAs soon as the rude found an opportunity, he charged towards him.\u201cCareful..!\u201dBefore I even shouted, the man\u2019s hand moved first.The man struck the rude\u2019s face with the sword handle.\u201cUgh!\u201dBlood spattered like a fountain from the rude\u2019s nose. Perhaps, his nose bone was broken.The dagger dropped. And then, the shocked rude was kicked away by the man and flew away. The rude grabbed his nose and wanted to charge him again after a stagger.\u201cAre you coming at me again?\u201d The man grinned as he pointed the tip of his blade to the side. \u201cThen, I will cut your neck with this part.\u201dAt the eerie threat, the rude stunned, and soon ran away without looking back. It was so ugly to see him running away that ridicule came out.\u201cPuh ha ha! It serves you right!\u201d Sarah laughed openly at the rude.When the rude completely disappeared from sight, the man put his sword in the scabbard he was wearing and looked at me.All of those actions were natural and graceful, like flowing water. Even with the same etiquette education, there were people who act unnaturally, and there were people who act naturally as they used to, and this man was the latter. The man seemed to be born with nobility by nature.In other words, it was possible to know by looking at the clothes worn by the man who was not of an ordinary status.Is he the Duke of Balon?I had never seen him before, but I knew Duke Balon\u2019s son was my age. This guy also looked like my age, so there was a good chance.If not, it didn\u2019t matter. The important thing was that this man was a nobleman and a benefactor.I was going to express my gratitude, but the girl came running holding the child\u2019s hand.\u201cTh, thank you!\u201dAnd she bowed her head to the ground.\u201cThank you for your help, thank you very much.\u201d\u201cI just did the natural thing, so you don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201dI smiled lightly and cleaned up the girl\u2019s messy hair. I also wiped the dirt off her face.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you need the money for, but it\u2019s very dangerous to use a private loan. The same thing may just happen again, so don\u2019t use it in the future.\u201d\u201cYes, Yes. I will keep that in mind. Thank you so much, My Lady.\u201dThe girl and the child quickly disappeared after bowing down again and again.Can I just let them go?I was worried that the rude man I saw earlier would harm the kids. I had to tell the guard on the way back.\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a warm heart, but you\u2019ve just been very reckless.\u201dThinking so while watching the kids got farther away, I turned to the man at his words.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, the Lady would have been badly done by that rude.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you are so conclusive.\u201dWhen I replied a little bluntly, the man looked at me unexpectedly. Curiosity abounded in the blue eyes.\u201cThen, you mean I\u2019m wrong?\u201d\u201cYes. I could protect myself without you, My Lord.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a great confidence.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m really confident.\u201dAt my repeated words, the man smiled and folded his eyes.He was mysterious and beautiful, like a fairy, but strangely decadent.There\u2019s such a beautiful man in this world. I knew it for the first time. It seemed that this man was prettier than Cecily without adding any lies. And yet, he didn\u2019t feel weak at all. Rather, the man was strong and overbearing. It felt like seeing a beautiful beast.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, may I ask you how you were going to defeat that rude?\u201dYou\u2019re a curious person.Because it wasn\u2019t a bad curiosity, I replied obediently.\u201cThis is it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s not life-threatening, but you can\u2019t move for two days.\u201dI lightly pressed the handle of the fan. Then, the needle disappeared into the fan rib.The man whistled interestingly. \u201cThis is my first time seeing this kind of fan.\u201d\u201cOf course it is. I made this myself.\u201dThe position of the next duchess was more life-threatening than I thought. In particular, when the Duke couple died, the mansion was in danger. Numerous people attacked Philen with me aiming for Duke Williot. When Philen went to the war, the attack became more severe.There were escort knights, but they couldn\u2019t keep protecting every minute. And I couldn\u2019t trust them completely. In fact, there were times when they attacked me under the guise of a servant or an escort knight.There were also times when those who I believed betrayed me, and I realized it then. I couldn\u2019t trust anyone. I had to protect myself.I thought about learning swordsmanship, but it was unacceptable in nobility society for the noble Lady to learn swordsmanship. The noble lady in their heads was like a flower in a greenhouse which had to be protected.Above all, I wasn\u2019t good at swordsmanship at all. I thought it would take at least 10 years to learn swordsmanship enough to protect myself.I was wondering if there was another way, and what came to mind was carrying self-defense goods. But, the self-defense goods sold on the market were just too inconvenient and useless to carry around.\u201cSo I made it myself. Something that\u2019s easy for me to use.\u201d\u201cAmazing.\u201d The man\u2019s eyes glistened with genuine admiration.I didn\u2019t mean to hear that answer. I was shy for nothing, so I turned and coughed. \u201cAnyway, I want you to get rid of the prejudice that women can\u2019t protect themselves. I can protect myself enough.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way, but I apologize if it sounded like that.\u201d The man lowered his head lightly with his hand on his chest.I shook my head at the impeccably polite apology. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to ask for an apology either.\u201dI handed the fan to Sarah, grabbed the hem of my skirt, and bent my knees lightly. \u201cAnd thank you. Thanks to the Lord, I was safe.\u201d\u201cIt was nothing.\u201d The man replied with a cheerful smile.Unlike the overbearing atmosphere, he was a gentle man. It would have been nice if Philen was this polite and kind.What am I thinking now?Comparing your fianc\u00e9 to another man. It was a stupid thing to do. It was tantamount to self-painting my face. I quickly erased the delusions that came to mind.\u201cThen I, may the glory of the empire always be with the Lord.\u201d\u201cI hope the glory of the empire will always be with you, too.\u201dI said goodbye to the man and turned around. Sarah followed me with a regretful face.\u201cHe was really handsome and beautiful, the Lord.\u201d In a dreamy voice, Sarah shared a review of the man she had just met. \u201cIt would be great if I could have such a beautiful person beside me.\u201d\u201cSo you want to go to that man?\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Sarah shook her head in surprise at the joke I threw. \u201cI will serve My Lady forever! So if you become the duchess, please don\u2019t abandon me. My Lady.\u201dI laughed awkwardly instead of answering Sarah. Then Sarah cried and wept. \u201cAre you going to abandon me?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you answer me?\u201dThat\u2019s because I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be the duchess.Just a while ago, I thought I would be the duchess, but doubts arose after Philen brought Cecily in.I wonder if I can become the duchess.But if I were to really become the duchess, I had no intention of abandoning Sarah.\u201cI won\u2019t abandon you, Sarah.\u201d\u201cReally, My Lady?\u201d\u201cYes. I like you.\u201dAt my answer, Sarah smiled and shouted. \u201cI really like My Lady too!\u201d*****I stopped by the capital guard to report the affair of the loan shark before going on a full-fledged tour of the capital.The guard was crowded with people. On one side, I heard a wailing sound.As I approached the reception desk, the man sitting at the reception desk looked me up and down. Soon, a businesslike smile appeared on the man\u2019s face who realized that I was a noble.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to report.\u201d\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201dI told the man what happened with the loan shark, except that the loaner deliberately acted disrespectfully or threatened me. It was because I didn\u2019t want to be talked about by people for nothing.\u201cAh, is that so?\u201dThe man who heard my story nodded as if it was a little annoying.\u201cIf you fill out the report here, we will review it and take action.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to strengthen the patrol?\u201d\u201cWe want to do that too, but we\u2019re short on manpower\u2026\u201dLie. It was a red lie. It\u2019s just commoner affairs, so it\u2019s bothersome to deal with. I couldn\u2019t believe this kind of guard was the one who took charge of the capital\u2019s security.If it was Williot\u2019s estate, I would visit the official in charge right away, but this was the capital. I couldn\u2019t do that, so I took a deep breath and controlled my feelings that were a little bit intense.\u201cOh, there\u2019s something I haven\u2019t said.\u201d And so, I told all the stories I didn\u2019t mean to tell.The man shouted in excitement when I showed him the crest of Duke Williot on the fan.\u201cNo, oh my God. There\u2019s such a b*st*rd. You! I\u2019ll catch you right away!\u201dThe man\u2019s attitude completely changed from before, and a smile came out of nowhere.I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine now.At last, I was relieved and went out to look around the capital with Sarah.While looking around the capital for a long time, I realized that someone was following me.Who is it?I glanced back with great vigilance.There was a man who stood out among the crowds. He was wearing a hood, but his presence couldn\u2019t be hidden.\u201cMy Lady, the one who wore the hood over there. He\u2019s the one who helped us earlier, right?\u201d Sarah also found the man and asked me.I nodded lightly, stopped walking, and looked at him. He also stopped walking and pretended that he wasn\u2019t.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The man smiled brilliantly.The reason why it didn\u2019t look nasty was probably because of his appearance of a dazzlingly beautiful man.\u201cI\u2019m just on my way.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cIs there a reason for me to lie about this?\u201d\u201cThen go ahead.\u201dI stepped aside to tell him to go, but the man didn\u2019t even move. He just looked at me with a troubled face.With that expression, I immediately noticed that the man had lied, so I twisted my lips and asked him. \u201cAren\u2019t you the one who said that there\u2019s no reason for you to lie about this?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve lost my tongue.\u201dThe man put his hand on his chest and politely bowed his head.\u201cI will correct it. I have something I want to ask the Lady.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked nervously.It wouldn\u2019t be an ordinary question seeing he followed me along just to ask the question.\u201cHow did you know that the rude would get 60% interest?\u201dThe question that came back after being nervous was absurd. I looked at the man with absurd eyes. \u201cIs that all you want to ask?\u201d\u201cNo. I wonder how you knew that the empire\u2019s interest rate for the loan business was 30%, and how you knew that the fine to be imposed on that rude was over a thousand gold.\u201dAt first, I was wondering why he was asking me these things, but soon I realized why, and burst into a small laugh.\u201cTo the Lord, it\u2019s amazing that I, who is a noble lady, know these things well.\u201d\u201cYes. Usually noble ladies don\u2019t even study these things.\u201d The man, who told the truth without hesitation, looked at me. \u201cDid you feel bad?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s natural.\u201dAs he said, there were very few noble lady, who studied these things.There was no way I would study these things that could give me a headache when I wasn\u2019t going to be an official or someone who was going to rule a territory.But I had to. I had to rule the estate on behalf of the irresponsible Philen.I could leave it to the aides and stamp the documents just like a scarecrow, but I didn\u2019t want to do that, so I studied everything. Tax laws, administration, politics, and everything you need to govern your territory. However, it was a fact that was not known to the public.If the fact that I, who\u2019s not the real Duchess of Williot, was in control of the duchy and estate was known, the duke\u2019s prestige would fall to the bottom. So people only knew that most of the aides worked, and I only stamped them.\u201cI\u2019m interested.\u201d Because of that, I made a rough excuse. It was true that I was interested, so it wasn\u2019t a big lie.The man looked at me with his eyes narrowed, wondering if he could believe what I was saying.I was stabbed by my conscience for no reason. So I looked at him sharply, facing the gaze. \u201cWhy? Is the Lord dissatisfied with my interest as a woman?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201dThe man smiled and shook his head without any signs of embarrassment.\u201cIt was just a little strange. As the Lady said, most women usually don\u2019t care about this.\u201dIt didn\u2019t seem like he was simply lying to escape the situation.\u201cI see.\u201dI wasn\u2019t really angry, I didn\u2019t say much because it was simply an act to avoid a guilty conscience.\u201cIs everything you\u2019re curious about solved?\u201d\u201cFor now.\u201dFor now?It was a dubious answer, but I didn\u2019t want to talk to the man anymore, so I passed it lightly.\u201cWell then.\u201dAs I said bye to the man and turned around, he suddenly shouted.\u201cI look forward to seeing you again next time. Lady Leila Thebesa.\u201dHow, my name\u2026?I looked back in surprise, but the man had already disappeared without a trace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI was curious how he knew my name, but the question was resolved sooner than I thought.He saw the crest on the fan.Currently, I was the only noble lady who could confidently carry objects with the crest of the Duke of Williot. So it was natural for the man to realize that I was Leila Thebesa because according to Countess Thebesa, I was quite famous in the social world. Of course, I wasn\u2019t famous in a good way.He knew who I was and disappeared without introducing himself. I thought he was a polite man, but I guessed he wasn\u2019t.\u201cSarah, do you happen to know which family the man you saw earlier is from?\u201dSarah, who hadn\u2019t been working as a maid for five years, couldn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know. But I still asked her in case she knew, and Sarah shook her head.\u201cNo. Shall we find out?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to do that because it seemed like I was doing a background check. Furthermore, seeing the man\u2019s actions, it was clear that he was more than a count\u2019s family member.At that level, I would see him at the Emperor\u2019s coronation celebration party, so there was no need to be nervous at all. All I had to do was relax and wait.As I was looking around the capital, the sky had already turned red.I had to go back to the mansion and check out the clothes and stuff. There shouldn\u2019t be any mistakes as this banquet was the first stage for Philen\u2019s social debut. I had to show my perfect self. Taking this opportunity to strengthen my position as the next duchess.\u2026I need to talk about marriage as well.\u201cHaa.\u201dThe word marriage weighed heavily on my heart that a sigh came out.Sarah, who was following, looked at me anxiously. \u201cAre you okay, My Lady?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dNone of it was okay, but I couldn\u2019t tell Sarah the story.\u201cIt looks like the sun will set soon, so let\u2019s go back to the mansion.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send an errand boy to the mansion and call the carriage.\u201d\u201cNo. Don\u2019t be bothered, let\u2019s just ride a public carriage.\u201d\u201cBut public carriages are uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI even got on a carriage that was more uncomfortable than a public carriage, so it was nothing. It wasn\u2019t long-distance too.It was a waste of time to call and wait for the carriage, so I headed to the mansion in a public carriage.The guards, who were watching the public carriage approaching the mansion, ran in surprise when I got off the public carriage.\u201cMy Lady, why didn\u2019t you call the carriage?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dHow many times do I say that it\u2019s okay today? It becomes more and more annoying.I waved my hand while thinking what I should do, and went into the mansion.Dalgdak\u2013No, I tried to enter, but I couldn\u2019t because the carriage stopped in front of the mansion.A sword entangled with roses. It was the crest of the Duke of Williot.Is it Philen?At other times, of course, I would have thought Philen was riding, but not after Cecily appeared. There was also a possibility that she was riding.\u201cLeila.\u201dFortunately, it was Philen, not Cecily, who got off the carriage. There was no Cecily.\u201cYou should call me Lady Thebesa, not Leila, Duke Williot.\u201d I smiled and pointed out his mistake.Pilen didn\u2019t say anything, even with a dissatisfied face.It was something he suggested first, so he couldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201cAs I always think, Lady Thebesa is inflexible.\u201d\u2026I thought he couldn\u2019t, but I was wrong. It was out of common sense, but it wasn\u2019t surprising. This wasn\u2019t the first time Philen was doing something outside of common sense.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cIs it fun to live in such a hard world?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m having fun.\u201dWhen I asked what his problem was, Philen sighed and shook his hand.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Talking with the Lady only hurts my head.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun talking with Leila.\u201dAuditory hallucinations were heard in the blowing wind.\u201cLeila knows a lot of things. I envy you. I want to be smart like Leila.\u201dThe past Philen, who was smiling brightly, overlapped with the present Philen with a dissatisfied face.My heart ached at the faint memories. The front of my eyes was blurred. I felt even sadder knowing that I couldn\u2019t go back to that time again.\u201cAre you crying?\u201d\u201c\u2026cry.\u201d I replied bluntly, wiping tears around my eyes with a handkerchief. \u201cIt\u2019s because there\u2019s dust in my eyes.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dust these days.\u201d\u201cUhh, really.\u201dAs Philen believed me, Sarah, who was behind me, breathed in a frustrated sigh. As if to represent my feelings.\u201cMore than that, Lady Thebesa.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDo women like chocolate cake?\u201dWhy is chocolate cake out of nowhere?\u201cAh.\u201dOnly then did I see a box of cake Philen was holding in his hand, and I let out a small exclamation.\u201cDid you buy a chocolate cake?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know what she liked, so I asked the store owner and he recommended this one.\u201d Philen smiled shyly as if he had never bought something like this before.When I heard him say that, I didn\u2019t think he\u2019s going to eat it.If you don\u2019t give it to me\u2026\u201c\u2026is it for her?\u201dCecily, I didn\u2019t want to put her name in my mouth, so I roughly referred to it, but in this case, Philen, who was quick-witted, nodded.\u201cCecily wanted to eat a cake.\u201d\u201c\u2026what about mine?\u201dIt was unintentionally spoken. I was surprised when I said it. Philen stared at me because he didn\u2019t know I was going to say this.There\u2019s a moment of silence. As the sun went down, the cooler air passed through my skin.\u201cI didn\u2019t know the Lady had a sweet tooth.\u201d It was Philen who broke the silence first. \u201cYou don\u2019t really like cake before. I thought it was like that.\u201dOf course, I didn\u2019t like it, but I didn\u2019t dislike it either.\u201cIf you want to eat cake, you can buy it yourself, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d He said, looking at me a little dumbfounded.\u201cYou\u2019re not a child and don\u2019t bother me with that, Lady Thebesa.\u201dSo Cecily is a child, that\u2019s why you buy it yourself?It was so absurd that I couldn\u2019t speak. Philen left me blank and went into the mansion first.Philen had never bought me a present with his own hands before. Even for my birthday present, he ordered the butler to prepare it. He didn\u2019t even know what the butler gave me. I couldn\u2019t believe he bought the cake for her.\u201cHa.\u201dBeing left alone, I sat down, unable to overcome various emotions such as disappointment and anger.\u201cMy Lady\u2026\u201dSarah felt sorry and hugged me tightly.*****\u201cChocolate cake!\u201dCecily\u2019s eyes sparkled brilliantly when she saw the chocolate cake Philen bought.Philen smiled happily. He cut the cake and put it on a plate. Cecily\u2019s face, who took a big bite of the cake with a fork, was dyed with happiness.\u201cDelicious! Where did you get this delicious thing?\u201d\u201cI asked another nobleman. The place that sells delicious cakes.\u201d\u201cDid you do that for me? I\u2019m happy!\u201d Cecily was overjoyed and snapped a piece of cake.He was worried that she didn\u2019t eat well because she had such a small mouth. If she ate well, the baby in her belly would be healthy.\u201cEat more.\u201dPhilen put a new piece of cake on Cecily\u2019s empty plate.\u201cCan I just eat it with the cake? I\u2019ve always wanted to do that.\u201d\u201cWhatever you like.\u201dPhilen had no intention of eating anyway, so he gladly allowed it.Cecily, who had been eating deliciously while scrambling the cake, suddenly groaned while holding the fork.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cDid Lady Thebesa get the cake too?\u201d\u201cHmm, I don\u2019t know. Why are you asking?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to eat this delicious cake by myself.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201dPhilen gently swept Cecily\u2019s greedy hair.\u201cBut there\u2019s no need to worry about that. Leila doesn\u2019t like cakes.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like a bite?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have a bite.\u201dAt Philen\u2019s answer, Cecily agonized for a moment, then removed some cake that seemed to be eaten by a mouse and moved it onto her plate.\u201cWill you eat this much?\u201d\u201cYou want to give it to Leila?\u201d\u201cYes. I can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can\u2019t, but\u2026\u201dHer thought of Leila was pretty, but it bothered him to give her the leftover cake. It was obvious that it was leftover, even though the shape was intact.\u201cIn our kingdom, there\u2019s a custom of sharing good food, even if it was eaten. Even more in the family.\u201d Cecily looked up at Philen, smiling spotlessly. \u201cLady Thebesa is like my family now, so I want to give it to her. Your baby will want it too.\u201d\u201c\u2026right.\u201dThe heart was more important than the shape. It might seem a bit weird, but if it conveyed Cecily\u2019s pretty heart, even Leila would definitely understand.\u201cButler.\u201dPhilen immediately called the butler and put his thoughts into action.*****\u201cCake?\u201dBarely enough to stop crying, I returned to my room and shook off the remaining sadness.Sarah smiled brightly and nodded. \u201cYes! Master sent My Lady a cake! Even if he said something like that, he must have been bothered!\u201dHmm\u2026 I wonder?Philen, who I know, wasn\u2019t the type to care about this. I was puzzled, but I got it.The butler came with a pretty cake box. It was the box I saw earlier.Are you giving me the same cake as Cecily\u2019s?I didn\u2019t feel very good because it was like I forced myself to accept it.Sarah quickly set the tea-table. I didn\u2019t open the cake box on purpose. It\u2019s just like waiting for me to open it.I opened the box as Sarah wanted. And\u2026\u201cThis, what is this!\u201d Sarah shouted as she saw the cake that anyone could tell that it had been eaten.I also looked at the cake in surprise.\u2026did he give me the cake she ate?As I looked at the cake silently, the butler stuttered and explained. \u201cIn, in her kingdom, there\u2019s a custom of sharing good food, even if it was eaten\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t listen to the butler and put the cake box down nervously again.\u201cTake it and throw it away.\u201dPhilen, how far do you have to go to make me feel miserable?Who am I to you?Do you think I\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e?I sincerely wanted to look inside his mind.I curled up on the sofa and buried my face between my knees.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPhilen\u2019s interest and actions were also for Cecily, but what made me saddest was my position to care about her even in this situation.Did Countess Thebesa feel this way when she took care of my mother, who was pregnant with me?Probably so.That\u2019s why she hated me so much, criticized me, and spoke harsh words.I understood Countess Thebesa\u2019s situation. It didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t hate her. I still trembled at the thought of Countess Thebesa.I smiled bitterly and looked at Philen\u2019s top, which matched mine.As a designer who had been in charge of the Duke of Williot\u2019s clothes for generations, the clothes were perfect. Not a single stitch was disheveled.The point, the handkerchief, was also being checked together, and Sarah, who was looking at the accessories, spoke carefully.\u201cUm, doesn\u2019t My Lady embroider a handkerchief?\u201d\u201cEmbroider?\u201d\u201cYes. I heard that this banquet is Master\u2019s first social debut. When men make their first social debut, it is customary to bring a handkerchief embroidered by their family member or fianc\u00e9e.\u201dRight. Come to think of it, there was such a custom. It\u2019s been a long time since I did embroidery, so I forgot how to do it.\u201cDid you forget how to do it?\u201d\u201cMmm. I\u2019ve had nothing to embroider.\u201d\u201cWell, the Duke was still at war, and My Lady was busy. You probably didn\u2019t have time to embroider as a hobby.\u201d\u201cEven if I had time, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201c\u2026come to think of it, Sarah, you never see me embroidered.\u201dThe last time I embroidered was right before Philen went to war.After Philen went to war, Sarah, who entered the mansion, couldn\u2019t have seen it.Originally, I wasn\u2019t going to make it even then. But, because of the superstition that if a loved one enters the war with an embroidered handkerchief, he will return safely. So I was forced to make it.At that time, Philen said something when he saw the handkerchief I had embroidered. He laughed a lot, asking if this was our family\u2019s crest.When I told him not to carry it with him, he quickly put it in his inner chest pocket and kissed the back of my hand saying that he would definitely return safely. It was a faint memory.At other times, I would have laughed happily as I recalled the past, but now I couldn\u2019t. Just thinking about it made my mouth feel as if I had chewed a very bitter herb.I looked down at the colorful handkerchief. No matter how much I hated it, Philen was my fianc\u00e9 and I was his fianc\u00e9e. I couldn\u2019t let Philen be flawed by other people on his first social debut. Even more, because it\u2019s a disgrace to my face.\u201cSarah, get ready to embroider.\u201dOnly three days left until the emperor\u2019s coronation banquet. On the day and the day before, I was going to get busy with other things, so I actually only had one day left.I had to finish the embroidery in time, so I put aside the other works and focused on embroidery.\u201cUgh.\u201dBlood was formed on the finger pierced by the needle.Sarah, who was sitting across from me, hurriedly brought a tissue and wiped the blood off my finger.\u201cYou\u2019ve been pierced 22 times so far with this.\u201d\u201c\u2026that many?\u201d\u201cYes. Thanks to that, your fingers really are like a beehive.\u201dIs it that many? I don\u2019t know.Sarah wiped off the blood and applied the ointment over it.\u201cBut your index finger with the thimble is fine. I think My Lady should wear a thimble all over your left hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026don\u2019t make fun of me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not making fun of you, I\u2019m telling you because I\u2019m worried.\u201dSarah put the ointment back into the box and breathed another deep sigh.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you couldn\u2019t embroider. That\u2019s surprising. I thought you\u2019d be good at embroidery because you were good at everything else.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true. There are many things I can\u2019t do either. I can\u2019t cook and I can\u2019t dance.\u201d\u201cFor cooking, you probably never cooked before, but you can\u2019t even dance?\u201d,\u201cMmm. I\u2019m not good at it. I have no sense of rhythm.\u201dThanks to the effort I made, I was able to dance the waltz naturally to some extent, but the problem was that I couldn\u2019t match the beat. It was only possible to follow my partner\u2019s movements by paying close attention.Fortunately, Philen has a sense of rhythm, if not, both of us would have been ridiculous.\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing. There are things that even My Lady can\u2019t do.To Sarah\u2019s exclamation, I replied with a light smile. \u201cOf course there is. I\u2019m a human being, too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Ah, there\u2019s blood on the handkerchief. The blood needs to be washed out as soon as possible, so I\u2019ll wash it right away.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for troubling you.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? Of course, it\u2019s something I have to do anyway. Then I will be right back.\u201dSarah quickly disappeared.When I had time to take a break, I relaxed my stiff shoulders and neck. Then I looked around at my hands.\u201cIt looks like a real beehive.\u201dRed dots were embedded like a beehive all over my left hand, except for my index finger with a thimble.The wound that was pierced several times in the same place was quite large and ugly. I should wear gloves for the banquet because I couldn\u2019t show other people these ugly hands.Sarah returned as I wiped off the blood of the wounds that hadn\u2019t healed and was cleaning up the clustered scattered threads.\u201cTada, I took the blood out perfectly!\u201d\u201cYeah, good job.\u201d\u201cHehe.\u201dSarah blushed at my compliment and grinned widely.I was tired as the night was deep,\u00a0 but I had no time to sleep. I had to finish the embroidery by tomorrow.I tried to endure the drowsiness and concentrated on embroidery again.*****Thanks to staying up all night, I was able to finish the embroidery safely.Although I had been pierced ten more times since then, and my left hand had become worse than a hive, it was fine. Because it was important to finish the embroidery.I looked at my embroidery with great emotion.If I had done it alone, it would have been a mess that would be embarrassing to show, but thanks to Sarah\u2019s help all night, it looked pretty good.Of course, compared to the craftsmen, it was infinitely lacking, but I was satisfied. It was, arguably, the best work of my life.\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, My Lady!\u201d Sarah, who stayed with me all night, clapped her hands with great joy.\u201cLet\u2019s go and show it to the Duke, My Lady.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cOf course! If you don\u2019t show it now, it will be meaningless!\u201d\u201cBut my look is a mess\u2026\u201dI stayed up all night, so my skin was dry and there were bags under my eyes.I was ashamed to go to Philen because I always showed him a neat, tidy appearance.\u201cSo let\u2019s go now!\u201d Sarah said, pounding her chest as if she was furious.\u201cIt\u2019s appealing to the master that My Lady has worked so hard to embroider it yourself! That way, it will work better!\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cOf course! So let\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cBut let\u2019s wash our faces before we go.\u201dSarah said it was okay, but I wasn\u2019t.No matter how much I thought about it, I was ashamed to show this shabby appearance to Philen, so I washed my face and tidied myself neatly to some extent.Then I took the handkerchief box and headed to Philen\u2019s room.My heart was pounding for nothing. It felt like I was back as an immature adolescent girl.Just in time, Philen came out of the room.Philen stood out even from a distance thanks to his sharp height. It seemed to be because his dark blond hair was reflected in the sunlight. Wherever he was going, he was always dressed neatly.\u201cDuke.\u201dWhen I called, Philen, who was instructing the butler, turned to me.\u201cLady Thebesa?\u201dHe looked puzzled.Well, it\u2019s understandable because I hadn\u2019t been looking for him first lately.I never thought I\u2019d come to him for something like this, either.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dThere was nothing to lengthen the words. After showing him the embroidered handkerchief, I said\u00a0 \u2018this was your first social debut, so I prepared it\u2019, and it was over. It was very simple.But why doesn\u2019t that simple word come out easily? Why can\u2019t I say this easily when I say other things easily?My rolled-up lips dried up. My hand that held the box containing the handkerchief slightly tightened.It was when I took the courage to open my mouth again while hesitating with my eyes on the edge of his neck without looking straight at him.\u201cPhil.\u201dI heard a sweet voice mixed with charm.Cecily, it was that woman.Cecily, who was wearing a thin gown and a blue necklace, held out a handkerchief to Phil without thinking to hide her semi-exposed, big breast.\u201cYou left this behind.\u201dThe handkerchief was embroidered with a sword entangled with roses, the crest of the Duke of Williot. It was a very delicate and beautiful embroidery even at a glance. It was beyond comparison with the embroidery I put in.Who is the person who embroidered that? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 this woman?Suddenly, I bit my lips and looked at Cecily.\u201cOh my goodness.\u201dCecily, who discovered me belatedly, smiled, folding her eyes beautifully.\u201cGood morning, Lady Thebesa.\u201d\u201c\u2026good morning.\u201dShe smiled kindly and greeted me. I couldn\u2019t ignore it, so I forced myself to smile and replied briefly.I wish I\u2019d done talking to Cecily, but unfortunately, my wish didn\u2019t come true.\u201cThere was something I wanted to ask for understanding from the Lady, and that\u2019s great.\u201dCecily showed me the handkerchief, curling up her thick lips smoothly.\u201cThe Lady said she couldn\u2019t embroider, so I put it in her place instead. What do you think?\u201dHer long eyelashes fluttered lightly like butterfly wings. Her eyes looking at me glistened cheerfully.\u201cThis banquet is Phil\u2019s first social debut.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut Phil and the Lady could be embarrassed if they attended without an embroidered handkerchief, so I embroidered it on the Lady\u2019s behalf.\u201dCecily looked at me with an innocent smile, as if she had no malice as if she wanted praise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This absurdity made what I couldn\u2019t say seemed to disappear.What did you mean you\u2019re doing it on my behalf? Wouldn\u2019t I know if I asked for it? I didn\u2019t say anything, but I guessed it was funny to me.I even removed the smile I was barely making and looked at Cecily coldly.Cecily was a little perplexed looking at me, whether she noticed it or not.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201dAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know why I looked at you this way?I spontaneously gained strength around my lips. My head was burning.Whenever there\u2019s Philen, I didn\u2019t want to argue with this woman, but I thought I needed to say a word.\u201cCecily worked hard to embroider for the Lady and me, even though she wasn\u2019t a single body.\u201d Philen looked at me with pathetic eyes. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t thank her, instead you looked at her with such eyes. I can\u2019t help but feel that the Lady is so pathetic.\u201dMy head throbbed as if I had been hit by something hard. My mind became confused and my eyes were blurred. It wasn\u2019t because of tears. I wasn\u2019t emotional enough to cry for this kind of thing. And I didn\u2019t want to cry in front of Philen and this woman.It didn\u2019t take long for me to recapture my swaying emotions. I gently closed my eyes, then opened them and spoke.\u201cI\u2019m not being too much, I\u2019m sure the Duke was the one who\u2019s being too much.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m being too much?\u201d\u201cNo matter how this woman has the Duke\u2019s child, she is a mistress. She can\u2019t go out proudly with the Duke in public, and she has to live in the shadows for the rest of her life.\u201dCecily\u2019s face turned pale at my words. Cecily staggered and leaned against Philen.Philen looked at me, supporting Cecily.But knowing that I would recoil with fear, I twisted my lips and didn\u2019t stop talking. \u201cSuch a woman dared to invade my authority as a fianc\u00e9e, am I supposed to be generous to her?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an invasion. She said it was a pure heart for the Lady and me.\u201d\u201cUnsolicited favors are often referred to as useless pricks.\u201d\u201cLady Thebesa!\u201d His shout rumbled down the hallway.Servants\u2019 eyes were focused. Those who weren\u2019t here began to gather.I couldn\u2019t believe we\u2019re fighting over a mistress. What an unseemly figure she was.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you if you want to bring that handkerchief to the banquet, Duke. But don\u2019t tell anyone that I was the one who embroidered it.\u201d Feeling the need to close the conversation, I concluded. \u201cBecause I have no intention of answering that way.\u201dSocial circles implicitly allow the nobles to have a mistress, but as I said, they couldn\u2019t bring them to the public. It\u2019s because they know it\u2019s a shame that they don\u2019t dare.But what would happen if Philen attended the banquet wearing a handkerchief embroidered by a mistress? Certainly, the other nobles would criticize Philen for his immorality and point their finger. I would also criticize him for not cracking down on his conduct, but it didn\u2019t matter.It was a hundred times better for her to be cursed at than lying that I was the one who embroidered the handkerchief.No matter how ignorant he was, Philen was also a noble.\u201cLady!\u201dPhilen shouted angrily because he knew these basics well. His voice was so loud that it rang loudly in the hallway.But I wasn\u2019t afraid at all. Rather, I bowed my head to Philen with a smile that was close to ridicule and then left.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dSarah, who was watching the situation nervously from behind, hurriedly followed me. She called me, but I didn\u2019t look back.As I almost ran, I left the mansion and got into the waiting carriage.\u201cMy Lady?\u201dThe coachman, who was repairing the carriage, looked at me in surprise.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes? But, this carriage is the Duke\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is not a single carriage in the mansion, and he can take another carriage, so let\u2019s go right away.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dWhen I spoke with a voice overwhelmed with anger, the coachman hurriedly got onto the driver\u2019s seat.Soon, as the carriage departed and the mansion completely disappeared, I breathed deeply, releasing the tight tension.\u201c\u2026 \u201cThen I smiled bitterly at the handkerchief box I was holding in my hand and my left hand that had become a beehive.I spend the night saving time to eat for what? And until my hands reached this point. Was it to embroidery this handkerchief?I felt particularly pathetic today.*****Philen planned to go out, but suddenly he had to postpone his plans a little.It was because Cecily collapsed in shock after hearing Leila\u2019s verbal abuse. She didn\u2019t lose her mind, but she couldn\u2019t stand on her two legs properly.Philen hurriedly laid Cecily on her bed and told the butler. \u201cCall a doctor right now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Cecily said with a pale face. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to call a doctor.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? You have a bad complexion like this, so I need to call a doctor. What if something happened to the baby?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really okay, Phil.\u201d Cecily grabbed Philen\u2019s arm with her small trembling hand. \u201cI just need you to stay with me.\u201d\u201cCecily.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Honestly, I hate it when another man touches me.\u201dShe begged him not to call a doctor, so Philen was forced to accept it. Instead, he decided to change his plans completely so he could stay with Cecily.After lying down a little bit, Cecily raised her body and leaned her little head on Philen\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIs it my mistake?\u201d She muttered in a gloomy tone. \u201cIt\u2019s better to go to Lady Thebesa later and apologize separately, right?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. Cecily, there\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done wrong.\u201d Philen replied, gently sweeping the hair over Cecily\u2019s face. \u201cLeila is the one who did the wrong thing. So she should be the one who has to apologize to you.\u201dAt Philen\u2019s reply, Cecily looked at him with a slightly surprised look. \u201cDo you really think so?\u201dPhilen asked back with a stern face. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m lying?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dPhilen smiled lightly because it was cute to see Cecily shook her head with her eyes round.\u201cJust kidding.\u201d\u201cPhil so\u2026\u201d Cecily rolled her eyes and hugged her belly.\u201cYou surprised me. The baby is also surprised and is starting to kick.\u201d\u201cOops, I owe my baby an apology.\u201d Philen caressed Cecily\u2019s belly and said gently. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, My baby.\u201dIt was the image of a loving father who loved his children.Cecily\u2019s eyes, staring at Philen, sank strangely.Unaware of the fact, Philen kissed Cecily\u2019s belly lightly and then kissed Cecily\u2019s lips.\u201cDon\u2019t mind it anyway. As I said, there\u2019s nothing you\u2019ve done wrong.\u201dCecily replied with a depressed look. \u201cBut, Lady Thebesa looked furious.\u201d\u201cLeila has been that way for a long time.\u201dLeila had been greedy since she was young. If someone else invaded her territory, she became furious. It was the same with Philen. So Philen had to suffer many times.Still, he thought she would have learned mercy and tolerance as she became an adult, but he was mistaken. Leila was the same as before. No, it seemed to be stronger than before.\u201cTsk, how are you going to survive in the social world with that temper?\u201d Philen, who worried about Leila, lightly clicked his tongue.Cecily looked at Philen and carefully spoke out. \u201cAccording to the Lady, the Empire does not recognize the existence of a mistress\u2026 Is that right?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t recognize it, but they don\u2019t say anything outright. So you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201dEven though he said she didn\u2019t need to worry, Cecily\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t very good. Philen leaned. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo. If I wasn\u2019t recognized, I wonder what would happen to my baby.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a useless worry.\u201d Philen hugged Cecily\u2019s slender shoulders from behind and continued. \u201cThe child you gave birth to will definitely be registered as the eldest child of the family. Everyone will acknowledge him.\u201d\u201cWill Lady Thebesa acknowledge him too?\u201d\u201cOf course, as a foster mother, she has the duty to raise the children well. Of course, she has to acknowledge him.\u201d\u201cWhat if she doesn\u2019t?\u201dWhen the question came back, Philen\u2019s eyebrows were wrinkled. \u201cWhat do you mean? Did she say that?\u201d\u201cNo. She\u2019s not, but I\u2019m a little worried when I see Lady Thebesa\u2019s actions today.\u201d Cecily caressed her belly and muttered. \u201cI\u2019m worried that the Lady will abuse my child.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d Philen said in a short reply. \u201cIf Leila doesn\u2019t fulfill her foster mother\u2019s duty, that means she doesn\u2019t fulfill her duty as the mansion\u2019s hostess. When that time happens, I\u2019ll put everything down and make her leave the mansion.\u201dThat meant he was divorcing Leila. Divorce.Cecily leaned against Philen\u2019s chest, chewing the words secretly.Philen gently caressed Cecily\u2019s belly. \u201cYour belly is not as big as I thought.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cMmm. Usually, around this time, I heard it was very noticeable, but I can\u2019t tell. Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re skinny.\u201d\u201cOther people say it\u2019s pretty obvious.\u201d\u201cNot in my eyes.\u201d Philen\u2019s eyes, looking at Cecily\u2019s belly, were endlessly sweet and tender. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the baby to come out.\u201d\u201cPhil seems to be particularly fond of children. Is there a reason?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d Philen pondered for a moment, then shrugged. \u201cThere is no other reason, but if I have to say, maybe it\u2019s because I want to be a good father, unlike my father?\u201d\u201cIs your predecessor, Duke Williot, a good father?\u201d Cecily spoke and hurriedly covered her mouth with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I asked a very rude question.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s no wonder you\u2019re curious when I say that.\u201d Philen said insignificantly. \u201cMy father was definitely a good man, but he wasn\u2019t a good father. So, unlike my father, my dream is to become a good father to my child.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI wanted to go to a quiet place where there were no people, so I asked the coachman to take me to such a place.The coachman took me to a deserted mountain outside the capital.It was a beautiful place with a clear view of the capital. I liked it even more because there were no people and it was quiet.\u201cGo back now. You can pick me up in about two hours.\u201d\u201cBut My Lady, there\u2019s no escort knight, no maid, and leaving My Lady alone\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I want to be alone, so please leave me alone.\u201dAt my order, the coachman was forced to go.Being left alone, I sat under a tree that was too large to be hugged by several men and looked at the capital.It was closer to being carried away than looking at it.I gave up thinking because when I thought of something, Cecily and Philen would come to my mind. And yet, I kept thinking of what they said. In particular, what Philen said became a sharp dagger and shredded my heart.I knew that Philen didn\u2019t mean to say anything bad. I bet he had no idea what Cecily did wrong.That\u2019s why I hated it even more. I would rather hate him openly if he said it with malice, but I couldn\u2019t because it came from ignorance.\u201cOur Philen isn\u2019t very tactful, but please understand him with a broad mind.\u201dSuddenly, I remembered what the predecessor Duchess had said.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a bad heart. So please, teach him well. Okay?\u201dThe young me naively believed it. I had no choice but to believe. Young Philen was stubborn as the predecessor Duchess said, but he listened well when I told him.So, even though it\u2019s frustrating once in a while, even though I was hurt by what he said casually, I thought it was okay to stay this way because this place was better than Count Thebesa\u2019s.But I\u2019m wrong.It was as painful as it was at Count Thebesa\u2019s. It was so painful that my tears flowed down on their own.There\u2019s no one around, but someone could hear me. So, I buried my face between my knees and cried as loudly as I could.I was crying desperately, hoping that the wounds of my heart would be washed away as much as the tears poured out.As I was crying, I suddenly felt someone\u2019s presence.\u201c\u2026?\u201dI looked up and saw a luxurious handkerchief. When I looked up a little more, I saw a familiar face.It was that man. The man who saved me from that rude.But, why was this man here?\u201cWhy are you crying in a place like this?\u201dAh, right. I was crying.I hurriedly wiped my tears because I was embarrassed for showing this ugly appearance to someone I wasn\u2019t even close to.\u201cYou\u2019ll hurt your eyes.\u201dThe man grabbed my urgent hand. Then he gently pressed my tearful eyes with his handkerchief. It was a kind touch.\u201c\u2026.I will do it.\u201dI was not used to receiving such kindness from a stranger. So I took the handkerchief irreverently from the man.The man looked slightly embarrassed. \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dWhen he realized his mistake a little late and tried to apologize, the man loosened his mouth. \u201cGo ahead and wipe your tears.\u201dI wiped my tears with his handkerchief without refusing the man\u2019s consideration.In the meantime, the man sitting casually next to me looked at the clear sky without a single cloud and asked.\u201cMay I ask what made you cry so sadly?\u201d\u201c\u2026if I tell you, will you solve it?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s something I can do.\u201dI was just asking, but his answer was a little comforting. I smiled dimly and responded to him, who was smiling.\u201cThank you for saying that.\u201d\u201cI meant it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNothing. The tears here are still less wiped.\u201dThe man\u2019s fingertips grazed my cheek. On the outside, they were clean hands without any calluses, but they were surprisingly hard. Was it because of swordsmanship?I looked sideways at the sword the man was wearing on his waist. The handle was worn out a lot. It seemed that it wasn\u2019t just for self-defense.Suddenly, the sword that Philen was using came to mind. His sword handle was also very old.\u201cMy Lady.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?!\u201dI opened my eyes wide in surprise when something slipped through my open lips. Soon the sweet strawberry flavor spread in my mouth.This is\u2026 strawberry candy?\u201cWhen I was depressed, eating strawberry candy made me feel better.\u201dThe man\u2019s eyes were beautifully curved. I never knew a man could make such a fascinating eye smile.\u201cI hope it works for the Lady, too.\u201dThis man, he\u2019s worried about me. His kind favor made me feel better. Maybe it\u2019s because of the sweet strawberry candy rolling in my mouth.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. By the way\u2026 \u201cThe man\u2019s eyes suddenly stuck on the handkerchief box next to me.I hurriedly tried to hide the box, but it was already found by the man. To make matters worse, the handkerchief inside came out as the box was opened by my urgent hand.The tacky embroidery was clearly revealed.The man\u2019s hand touched the handkerchief before my rushing hand. He checked the handkerchief and whistled a little.\u201cIt\u2019s a handkerchief. Such a simple handkerchief, right?\u201dAs expected, I immediately recognized him as a noble\u2019s son.I nodded and held out my hands. \u201cPlease give it back.\u201d\u201cLooking at the crest, is it for your fianc\u00e9?\u201dI was confused about how to make him return it without being ridiculous.I replied with a sigh. \u201cNo. It\u2019s something to throw away. So please give it back to me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a decent handkerchief. Why do you want to throw it away?\u201dThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a handkerchief that I didn\u2019t need anymore.As I hesitated, unable to tell the truth, the man\u2019s eyes narrowly folded. His gaze went a little down.I wondered what he was looking at, but I soon realized that what he was looking at was my left hand, which had become a beehive. I hurriedly wrapped my hand.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201dThe man made a strange sound and tilted his head. Then, he grabbed the handkerchief.\u201cLet\u2019s do this. I\u2019ll have this handkerchief.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cAh, I will correct it. You throw it to me.\u201dWhat kind of nonsense is this?I refuted the man\u2019s words. \u201cDon\u2019t be weird. Why does the Lord have it?\u201d\u201cBecause I want to have it.\u201dThe man answered as if I was asking what was so obvious. I shook my head and held out my hand again. Of course, I only extended my right hand without a wound.It was rude, but I couldn\u2019t help it because my left hand was covered with wounds.\u201cIt\u2019s a tacky handkerchief. It\u2019s not something the Lord would have. So please give it back.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a tacky handkerchief.\u201dUnlike the beautifully raised corner of his mouth, the man\u2019s eyes looking at me were terribly serious.\u201cIt\u2019s a handkerchief that the lady has worked so hard on, so it couldn\u2019t be tacky, right?\u201d\u201cBut the embroidery is weird\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s just pretty.\u201dPretty? It can\u2019t be.As I looked at him with disbelief, the man burst into small laughter.\u201cMy eyes are correct.\u201dThe man suddenly reached out and kissed the back of my left hand lightly, which was covered with wounds.\u201cDon\u2019t think of me like a bunch of idiots who are fooled by its fancy appearance and throw it away without knowing the true value.\u201d\u201cI, I don\u2019t think so.\u201dI was embarrassed, letting him see my wounded hand, so I hurriedly pulled out my hand.The man smiled slightly and slipped the handkerchief into his inner chest pocket.I\u2019d like to ask if it\u2019s a handkerchief that was embarrassing to show other people, but I gave up because I wouldn\u2019t be willing to hear about it.It\u2019s not very important, and I didn\u2019t want to spend my energy. I was too tired for that. And that handkerchief would be better off going to someone who needed it than being thrown away.\u201cCome to think of it, there are a few things I want to ask when I see the Lady.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about taxes. I have a problem, and I hope that the Lady can help me.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t it be faster to ask the official in charge?\u201d\u201cI already asked. But it doesn\u2019t work out, so it\u2019s a problem.\u201dYou\u2019re asking me, a Lady, about things that even the officials in charge couldn\u2019t solve?It was strange. Usually, noble\u2019s sons didn\u2019t talk about this with a Lady.At best, it was all about gossip around the social world, gossip of nobles, or useless love stories.Of course, my aides asked me a lot of things, such as the welfare of the estate and taxation, but that was because I was acting as a Duchess and Duke\u2019s representative.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can be of any help.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to feel too pressured. I\u2019m just asking for your opinions.\u201dIf that\u2019s the case, I nodded in the sense of course.After that, we exchanged questions and answers. When I said what I thought about the problem the man came up with, he put his ideas out, and I put my thoughts on it.It was a rather tiresome and tiring discussion method that could be done at meetings, but oddly enough, it didn\u2019t feel like that at all.Rather, it was pleasant and fun. I had a good conversation with the man. I\u2019ve never met such a good conversation partner.It seemed to be the first time other than the former Duke of Williot and his wife.\u201cI have a good conversation with the Lady.\u201dFortunately, the man also thought so.\u201cI know, right? But I\u2019m sorry for not being able to help.\u201d\u201cNo. It was helpful enough. Thank you, Lady Thebesa.\u201d\u201cNo. It was a pleasant conversation for me.\u201dAh, come to think of it, I don\u2019t know the name of this man yet.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, may I ask your name, My Lord?\u201dWhen I asked his name, I noticed it. The man smiled strangely.\u201cLet\u2019s guess it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI got the Lady\u2019s name right, so My Lady, guess my name.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhy does it have to be that way?It was a little absurd, but it sounded fun, so I said the first name that came to mind.\u201cAre you Lord Balon?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen Lord Illizai? If not, Lord Logan?\u201dI tried to name a few sons around my age whose ranks were greater than the Count. But they\u2019re all wrong.What on earth is this man\u2019s name?There was a feeling that I had to find it out.\u201cPlease give me a hint.\u201d\u201cThe hint is my hair.\u201dHair?I looked at the man\u2019s hair.Blue hair, shining brightly under the sunlight, gently fluttered in the wind.When I just looked at his hair and barely got the hang of it, the man curled up his lips.\u201cYou are very smart but ignorant on the other side.\u201d\u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dThe man rested his chin. He thought for a moment, then flicked his finger.\u201cLet\u2019s do this. Find out my name until the banquet.\u201d\u201cIt looks like you\u2019re attending the banquet.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThen, it was right that he was a noble whose rank was greater than the Count. Since nobles whose ranks below the Baron couldn\u2019t attend the Emperor\u2019s coronation party.More than that, when I thought about attending the banquet, my mood that had improved so much went down again.A sigh came out.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to attend the banquet?\u201d Asked the man, who noticed my mind like a ghost.He already caught me. Even if I denied it, nothing changed. So, I nodded softly.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cMay I ask why?\u201dIf I attend the banquet, I\u2019m sure other nobles will whisper to each other when they see me and Philen.Words that I couldn\u2019t say rolled around in my mouth.I sighed and looked at the ground.Unless Philen was brainless, he wouldn\u2019t attend the banquet with a handkerchief embroidered by Cecily. But that didn\u2019t mean he was going to attend with my embroidered handkerchief. I had no intention of giving it to him.Seeing he was a nobleman who made his first social debut without a handkerchief, it was a perfect topic for nobles who like to gossip.My mind darkened at the thought of being cut mercilessly by them. And aware of that, the thought of forcing a smile in front of them made me disillusioned and bit my lip.\u201cThe Lady has all the bad habits.\u201dThe man\u2019s cold fingertips touched my lips.I was startled and pulled myself back.With an awkward look, the man raised his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was afraid you\u2019d blight your lips. I surprised you, My Lady.\u201d.\u201cAh, no.\u201dI was surprised, but if I said yes, the man would be embarrassed, so I shook my head.\u201cI was just surprised because I was thinking about something else. There is no need for the Lord to apologize.\u201d\u201cThat makes me feel a little at ease.\u201d\u201cI hope you do.\u201d\u201cMay I ask what you were thinking?\u201dAs I stared at him silently, the man hurriedly added. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you with a strange thought. I\u2019m just worried because My Lady\u2019s complexion isn\u2019t so good, so don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201dMy complexion doesn\u2019t look so good, huh?I swept my face. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t see for myself what kind of face I had.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was just worried about the party.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but say that I was worried, and I couldn\u2019t say it honestly, so I replied roughly.\u201cThis party is my first social debut, so I have a lot of worries about it. What if I make a mistake?\u201d\u201cBecause of the long war, there are many ladies and lords who had this party as their first social debut.\u201dThe man spoke slowly, taking my hair off my face and letting it go.\u201cSo don\u2019t worry too much. My lady will surely be able to do well.\u201dHis kind behaviour and tone of voice calmed my anxious mind. I smiled lightly and looked at the man.\u201cMy Lord is very kind.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes. You must be popular with other ladies.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very popular, indeed.\u201dAs if it was only natural, the man who admitted my words turned mischievous.\u201cBut I\u2019m only doing this for people I\u2019m interested in. I don\u2019t do this with people I didn\u2019t interested in.\u201dPeople.It would have been burdensome if he said \u2018women\u2019 that he\u2019s interested in, but it wasn\u2019t burdensome at all when he said \u2018people\u2019.Rather, it made me feel better that he seemed to see me as a person, not just a Lady.\u201cYou speak so well.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m flattered.\u201dAfter that, while we were having a few more trivial conversations, I saw Duke Williot\u2019s carriage down the hill.It\u2019s time to go, huh?Too bad. I wanted to talk a little more with this man.\u201cAre you sure you want to have that handkerchief?\u201dBefore I left, I asked the man once again if he was willing to give back the handkerchief.The man slowly opened and closed his eyes. \u201cDo you hate me having the handkerchief?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, it has Duke Williot\u2019s crest engraved on it. It\u2019s not something you can use anywhere, I\u2019m telling you.\u201dI was worried that if he used it, he might cause strange misunderstandings to other people.The man smiled clearly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d Then he leaned slightly and put his lips near my ear.I was startled by the distance. It\u2019s so close that I could hear the sound of his breathing.I quickly closed my eyes.Perhaps it was funny to see me like this, so the man laughed a little and continued in a subtle yet bizarre voice. \u201cI\u2019m going to hide it where only I can see it and secretly use it.\u201dSoon his lips moved away, but my earlobe was hot as if he was still close.I replied bluntly, touching my ears for no reason. \u201cYou make a peculiar statement that you won\u2019t show it to anyone.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m a little bit peculiar.\u201d\u201cMy Lady!\u201dI heard the coachman calling me. Now it was really time to go.As I stood up from my seat, the man grabbed my arm.\u201cI want to ask you one more thing.\u201d\u201cIs it about taxes again?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s about the Lady.\u201dAbout me?\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cDo you have any plans to become an official?\u201dAt his words, I looked at the man, slightly startled.\u201cAre you kidding me now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201dThere was no lie found in his plain answer.\u201cIt seems that the Lord doesn\u2019t know that women can\u2019t be officials.\u201dAt my answer, the man tilted his head slightly, as if he was wondering.\u201cI know there\u2019s no such law.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no law, but there\u2019s custom.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a custom, is it absolute?\u201dThat said, customs were sometimes more terrifying than laws. Because it made you embrace false hopes that you couldn\u2019t achieve, and gave you a sense of despair when those hopes were shattered.I had experienced it myself. So, I knew how great the feeling of despair was. I absolutely didn\u2019t want to have the same experience again.\u201cI\u2019d like to stop this useless conversation.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore, so I answered firmly and tried to stand up, but the man persistently asked.\u201cIf the Lady had the opportunity to become an official, would you take it?\u201dI didn\u2019t know why he\u2019s so obsessed with it, but I answered honestly.\u201cOf course I will take it.\u201dAt my answer, the man smiled contentedly and let go of my wrist.\u201cThe answer, please don\u2019t forget it.\u201dThe added words were significant.I wanted to ask what he meant by asking that kind of thing, and why he\u2019s here. But the coachman just arrived up the hill to pick me up, so I had to turn around without asking anything.*****The man who spoke with Leila reappeared at the Imperial Palace.The guards guarding the Imperial Palace, as well as the maids and servants, bowed deeply in surprise when they saw the man.The man, who was walking without giving them a single glance, stopped in front of a room. And without knocking, he opened the door and went in.Sitting at a desk full of papers, a young man, who was struggling with the documents, raised his head and looked at the man.\u201cOh my God, who is this?\u201dThe young man who found the man said sarcastically.\u201cIsn\u2019t it our Emperor, Kalian de Cheffel Yousveldia, who left me with a lot of work and went out to play?\u201dSeeing him sarcastically calling out his full name, he must have been very angry.Well, he left so much work behind, so it was understandable.The man, Kalian, smiled and picked up some of the piles of papers piled up on the desk.\u201cDid you finish a lot?\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019ve finished a lot?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dWhen Kalian answered in a goofy tone, the young man grabbed the back of his neck with a blushing face.\u201cYour Majesty, is Your Majesty\u2019s dream to make me overworked?\u201d\u201cNo way. I cherish you so much.\u201dCherish? What a bullsh*t!The young man screamed silently and complained to the man.\u201cThen why are you giving me so much work?\u201d\u201cBecause I trust you.\u201d\u201cThen don\u2019t trust me!\u201dThe young man, who shouted in tears for a moment, hurriedly avoided his eyes when Kalian looked at him with cold eyes.\u201cPlease, Your Majesty.\u201dThe young man begged as he looked at Kalian with teary eyes.\u201cPlease just fire me. Or, would you accept my resignation?\u201d\u201cRejected.\u201dKalian refused immediately and checked the documents.The young man endured the rise in his blood pressure and begged Kalian once again.\u201cIf not, please hire another aide. How can I be the only aide when there\u2019s so much work to do!\u201d\u201cVer, how can I when there\u2019s no one to trust but you?\u201dWhen Kalian answered as if he was asking what was so obvious, the young man seriously thought about betraying Kalian\u2019s faith. Then, even if he spent the rest of his life in prison, he didn\u2019t have to worry about dying from overwork!\u201cHowever.\u201dKalian put down the documents he was looking at and continued.\u201cI\u2019ll have to hire a new aide sooner or later.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

About one.\u201d\u201c\u2026if you\u2019re serious about hiring one, let\u2019s hire three more people.\u201dWhen Ver made a suggestion, Kalian smiled faintly.\u201cShould I cancel this?\u201d\u201cNo! No way! Yuhuu, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to hire one! Ahahaha! I am very happy!\u201dIt was a pity that only one person was hired, but Ver accepted it quickly because he was in such a pitiful situation.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get the letter of recommendation from the nobles right away\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s give a test, not a letter of recommendation.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you want to give the official government test?\u201dWhen Kalian nodded, Ver\u2019s heart filled with false hope.Although the official government test did exist in the Empire, it was rarely practiced.Most of the officials were recommended by nobles. It was composed of graduates who graduated from the academy with excellence.He didn\u2019t know what kind of wind suddenly blew for him to give the official government test. It annoyed him because it meant that he had to prepare a lot to give the official government test.\u201cWhen should I do it?\u201dHe asked because he had to. Ver was willing to take the hassle because if Kalian changed his mind, it would be a big deal.Kalian immediately replied as if he already had something planned in his head.\u201cDo it in a month.\u201d\u201cIt may be a little tight, but\u2026 All right. Should they only do administration for the subject?\u201d\u201cNo. Let\u2019s do administration, tax law, politics, welfare, etc.\u201dVer\u2019s hand, which was writing down Kalian\u2019s words, stopped. Ver looked at Kalian with a bewildered look.\u201cYour Majesty, do you really want to hire an aide?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut you want to include it all?\u201d\u201cIf they want to be my aide, that should be enough.\u201d\u2026I shouldn\u2019t have asked.Ver gave up and wrote down his words.The dream of a new aide coming in was slowly fading away.\u201cI understand. Then I will prepare it as it is and announce it as soon as the banquet is over.\u201d\u201cOne more thing.\u201dWhat else are you going to add here!Ver looked at Kalian in dismay, but Kalian continued with a casual look.\u201cMake sure to include the phrase \u2018Women can apply, too.\u2019\u201d*****After that incident, not a single word was spoken between me and Philen.In the past, we used to have a simple conversation when we ran into each other, but now we didn\u2019t even have one.Time passed and it was the day of the Emperor\u2019s coronation celebration party.The celebration party was held for two days, in which I participated only on the first day. Because the party the next day was only available to men.I woke up earlier than usual to get ready for the party. I took a bath with hot water and then got a massage. They applied scented oil all over my body, and I smelled like sweet roses because of that.After wearing underwear and a corset, I wore a silver dress that sparkled like the melted moonlight.\u201cWow, how come you fit it so well?\u201dSarah, who was helping me dress up, trembled with twinkling eyes. The other maids agreed and nodded their heads.\u201cYour hair is as dark as the night sky, so the silver dress suits you very well.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course! No one can pull off a silver dress as well as you, My Lady!\u201d\u201cYes! You\u2019re so beautiful, My Lady!\u201dThey\u2019re saying it like that because I was the owner they served.Instead of scolding them, I smiled softly because they were such good flatterers. And obviously, the dress was beautiful even to me.The pearl powder, sprinkled over the hem of the dress, shimmered like a star whenever it caught the light. The dense droplet diamond, attached to the chest line, stood out.The duke\u2019s designer said that it was a work of satisfaction that made one praise a lot until their mouth dried, and it was worthy enough.As Sarah said, it went well with my dark hair.It was a dress that I liked for the first time in a long time. I thought it would be good to give a reward to the designer when I returned to the estate.My hair was neatly curled up and secured with a pin adorned with pearls. I sprinkled pearl powder on my hairWhen everything was ready, it was time to start slowly. We had to leave now so that we could arrive at the banquet hall on time.\u201cWhat about the Duke?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s already ready and waiting in the hall.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI hurriedly left the room because I didn\u2019t want to keep him waiting so long.Did I do something wrong?\u201cOh, my!\u201dOr did she do something wrong?Cecily, who popped out from the corner of the hallway, spilled juice, and the clean and dazzling silver dress gradually turned red.\u201cMy, My Lady!\u201d\u201cO, oh my goodness!\u201dThe screams of the maids resounded desperately in the hallway.Sarah, who came to her senses quickly, wiped it hard with her sleeve, trying her best to stop the stain from spreading, but it was in vain. Because this was beyond human control.I stood stunned and stared blankly at the dress, which lost its original color and was dyed red.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI turned my head when I heard a clear voice mixed with perplexity.Cecily was looking at me with great regret.When our eyes met, she smiled awkwardly. Tears filled her blue eyes.\u201cOut of the way and hurry back to your room, stop\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dMy anger rose to the top of my head, but I couldn\u2019t be angry with the person who bowed her head, holding onto her belly and apologizing repeatedly for her wrongdoing.I didn\u2019t know if it was intentional or not, but now, her actions looked like a mistake to anyone. It might be intentional under the guise of a mistake, but that\u2019s the truth only Cecily knew. It wasn\u2019t something I could guess and reproof.\u201cHuu.\u201dIf I got angry in this situation, I would be the bad one, so I endured it with patience.I had no intention of accepting Cecily\u2019s apology. Whether it\u2019s a mistake or intentional, it\u2019s her fault, so she had to bear with it.I turned to Sarah, ignoring Cecily who bowed her head.\u201cSarah.\u201dSarah, who was very anxious and still wiping my red dress, looked at me with tears in her eyes.When I saw Cecily\u2019s tears, I didn\u2019t feel anything, but when I saw Sarah\u2019s tears, I felt bad. I felt sorry for no reason.If I hadn\u2019t rushed and looked ahead while walking, this wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201cHow many extra dresses do we have in the mansion now? Do we have another silver dress?\u201dRather than arguing whose fault it was, the important thing now was to change the dress and attend the banquet as soon as possible. It wasn\u2019t another banquet, it was the emperor\u2019s coronation banquet. Being late was impossible.\u201cIt\u2019s in the estate. This is the only silver dress we brought here.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThen, what should I do?I bit my lip and thought fast.It wasn\u2019t difficult to change only the dress, but the problem was the makeup and accessories to suit the dress. There wasn\u2019t enough time to change everything.More than that, this dress was paired with Philen. If I was the only one wearing a different color here, it wouldn\u2019t go well with him. But there\u2019s nothing I could do if there\u2019s no other silver dress.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a silver dress, so bring a dress that\u2019s as similar as possible. Just in case you don\u2019t know, I brought my jewelry box and some shoes.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dSarah and the maids nodded and disappeared quickly. I grabbed a passing servant and gave another order.\u201cGo to the hall and tell the Duke to go to the banquet hall first, as I\u2019m a little late due to a problem.\u201dCecily\u2019s story was spreading around the social world and it\u2019s very noisy. If Philen and I attended the banquet separately, it would get noisier, but there\u2019s nothing we could do about it. Because both couldn\u2019t be late for the emperor\u2019s coronation banquet. At least one had to go first.The servant disappeared, and I turned around to change my dress.\u201cExcuse me, Miss Thebesa.\u201dCecily called me like that, but I didn\u2019t look back. Some had to change the dress hurriedly, while others didn\u2019t want to see her face. Because if I saw more, I would be really angry.It would make things more complicated if Cecily collapsed like before, so I suppressed my anger and headed to my room.*****\u201cDuke Williot has arrived.\u201dAt Ver\u2019s words, Kalian, who was sitting languidly on the sofa with a bored face, came to life. He slowly got up from his seat.\u201cHe came alone.\u201dFor a moment, at Ver\u2019s subsequent words, Kalian doubted his ears and looked at Ver.\u201cAlone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHis fianc\u00e9e isn\u2019t coming with him?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dVer replied with a very annoyed look because he was asking the same thing.If it was usual, Kalian would have said something like, \u2018what is that expression?\u2019, but not now.\u201cHmm.\u201dThe fact that Philen came alone drew all his attention. There\u2019s no time for him to read Ver\u2019s expression.\u201cWhy did he come alone?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Shall we find out?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s too late to find out now.\u201dKalian muttered to himself and sat back down.Kalian recalled a woman with hair and eyes as dark as the night sky.Leila Thebesa.He had never seen her before, but he knew her name.He couldn\u2019t not know. Because she was famous in the social world in many ways. Of course, she wasn\u2019t famous in a good way.The daughter of a powerless provincial nobleman, and a lady who was brought in from outside. She was lucky enough to have a relationship with the duke\u2019s son. No one knew what she did, but the duke couple cherished her dearly like their own daughter.For that reason, there were rumors that she was a daughter that Duke Williot brought from outside. The rumor was quelled by the fact that Leila had black hair, not bright blonde, the symbol of the Duke of Williot, but it sparked another rumor.It was rumored that Leila was Duke Williot\u2019s mistress. However, the Duke and Duchess of Williot were rare lovebirds in the social world.Thanks to this, the rumor was quickly silenced, but it sparked another rumor, and people were constantly jealous of Leila.Then, when the Duke and Duchess of Williot died suddenly, Philen Williot, who was still young, became Duke.Here and there, they began to move to swallow the Duke of Williot. No one worked openly, but there were quite a few who worked secretly.But strangely enough, the Duke of Williot was never shaken. It stood strong like an iron fortress.Kalian, who was the prince at the time, thought it was very strange. Because Philen Williot he knew wasn\u2019t a very clever man. He was rather stupid. No, was he ignorant? Or was he naive?It\u2019s hard to define which one, but Philen Williot wasn\u2019t good enough to block a cunning plan, that\u2019s for sure.But how did he block it? Did the duke\u2019s family have an outstanding aide?Kalian, who was secretly investigating out of curiosity, discovered a surprising fact.The fact that it wasn\u2019t Philen Williot, not an outstanding aide, but a young girl who just had an adult ceremony that supported the Duke of Williot, who was as precarious as a candle before the wind.The girl was Leila Thebesa.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he confirmed that all of that was true, he got curious.It was purely out of curiosity about a woman named Leila Thebesa. He was very curious to see how a young girl could do a job that even an adult couldn\u2019t do. If possible, he wanted to meet and have a serious conversation.However, as he went to war, Kalian\u2019s curiosity for Leila was folded and stuck in a corner.It wasn\u2019t long ago that his curiosity re-emerged when he met her and dealt with a rude person.Kalian snuck out of the Imperial Palace to find something he was looking for and wandered the streets. He happened to witness the scene.He didn\u2019t know who she was at first, but he recognized her when he saw the Duke of Williot\u2019s crest engraved on the fan she was holding.That woman was Leila Thebesa.The curiosity that had been put aside rekindled, and he got interested. His interest grew more as he talked with her, and it turned into greed.There was no such thing as greed for the opposite sex. It was his greed as an emperor to have someone as capable as her by his side.Leila was too good to be around a fool like Philen Williot. Very much. He wanted to let Leila swim freely in the bigger water.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dKalian woke up from his thoughts at Ver\u2019s calling and looked at him with blurry eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go to the banquet hall.\u201d\u201cIs Duke Williot still alone?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if his fianc\u00e9e, Miss Leila Thebesa, is here\u2026 Yes. Miss Leila Thebesa isn\u2019t here yet.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThere\u2019s no way she\u2019d be absent on such an important day. Maybe something happened on the way here.He was worried. He was seriously thinking about whether he should look into it, but Ver spoke up again.\u201cYour Majesty, you must go to the banquet hall now.\u201d\u201cDelay it.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dDelay it? What kind of bullsh*t is that?Mumbling inwardly the words he couldn\u2019t bring to say, Ver looked at Kalian.Whether or not he knew Ver\u2019s mind, Kalian leaned deep into the backrest and continued.\u201cThe person I\u2019m waiting for hasn\u2019t come yet, so let\u2019s wait a little while before going.\u201d*****I changed into an ivory-colored dress that was similar to the silver dress and hurriedly headed to the banquet hall.However, it was much later than expected. It was already time for the banquet to begin.Coming later than the emperor was a great disrespect. There was nothing to say if the Emperor deplored this.In that case, I\u2019d have to deal with it on my own so that it didn\u2019t damage Philen.I made up my mind and entered the banquet hall.The banquet hall is usually closed when the banquet begins, but strangely, it was still open.Don\u2019t tell me, the banquet hasn\u2019t begun yet?I cautiously entered the banquet hall with half anticipation and half worry.Perhaps the banquet hadn\u2019t really begun yet, the emperor\u2019s seat was empty, and no one was dancing. People were gathering in groups and talking.I came here prepared to be greatly humiliated, but I couldn\u2019t believe the banquet hadn\u2019t begun yet.The string of tension that had been tightened was loosened. I was truly relieved and rubbed my chest.\u201cWhat a relief\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you relieved for?\u201dI turned my head when I heard Philen\u2019s voice next to me.Philen, who had approached me, was looking down at me with a blunt face.His silver suit matched him well as if they were one body. Thanks to the suit, his dark blonde hair stood out even more.I wish I could wear the silver dress too. I felt sad again.\u201cDo you know how much trouble I\u2019ve been through when you came late, Lady Thebesa?\u201dWhatever the reason, it was true that I was late.So, as I was about to say sorry, his handkerchief caught my eye.The handkerchief had an elaborately embroidered crest of the Duke of Williot.Don\u2019t tell me, he came wearing the handkerchief that Cecily embroidered?No, it didn\u2019t seem like that. When I thought about it, the handkerchief was much older than Cecily\u2019s.So what\u2019s that? Who made it? No way\u2026 Did he have another lover?I had all kinds of weird thoughts.As I stared at the handkerchief, Philen gave a bitter expression and fiddled with the handkerchief.\u201cIt was made by my mother a long time ago. If I come without doing anything, not only me but also the lady will be in their gossip.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dOh my gosh. What was I thinking now? How dared I doubted what the Duchess made.I was embarrassed and ashamed. And I missed the Duchess again, so I stared at the handkerchief.\u201cWhy do you look like that?\u201dPhilen looked at me and tilted his head slightly.\u201cAre you unhappy with me doing this?\u201d\u201cNo. There\u2019s no way I would do that.\u201dI added hastily, fearing that Philen might misunderstand.\u201cIt just reminds me of the former Duchess\u2026\u201dI suppressed my emotions as much as I could, but I couldn\u2019t stop the emotions from coming out. I thought I would cry if I said more, so I kept my words inside.Knowing how I felt, Philen held out his arm without saying a word. It meant that he would escort me.I wiped the slightly moistened eye area with the back of my hand and gently placed my hand on his arm.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the banquet begun yet?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty said he would be late for some reason.\u201d\u201cReally? \u201cI didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but it was a thousand blessings for me.Thanks to him, I\u2019m not late.When I breathed out a sigh of relief once again.Paang, Pyaam, Pyaam~!The trumpets sounded consecutively to announce the arrival of the emperor.The noisy banquet hall quickly quieted down. The music also disappeared.Soon after, the golden door on the opposite side of the entrance to the banquet hall opened and a man with a large number of people appeared.Blue hair that resembled the neatly raised sea. A mysterious yet decadent look, beautiful like a fairy that anyone would be mesmerized the moment they saw him.\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was the man.No matter how much I rubbed my eyes and checked again, that fact didn\u2019t change.I thought he was simply the son of a high-ranking nobleman, but I never thought he was the emperor.It was a shock. I stared blankly at the emperor.Come to think of it, the characteristics of the imperial family were blue hair and blue eyes. It was proof that he received the blue dragon\u2019s protection.So, that\u2019s why the man said his hair was the hint to find out his name. Now that I realized it, I laughed at my stupidity.I couldn\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t recognize the emperor. I didn\u2019t dare to imagine how deep he would laugh at me.Now, how do I face that man, His Majesty?Since I debuted in the social world, I was sure we would bump into each other a few times.\u201cLady Thebesa!\u201dI was staring blankly at the emperor over something I couldn\u2019t even dream of when Philen grabbed my arm.I turned around to see Philen looking at me with a slightly annoyed look.What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cDo you know how many times I\u2019ve called you?\u201dWas that so? I didn\u2019t hear it at all.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t hear you because I was thinking about something else.\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking so deeply about?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dI couldn\u2019t bear to say that I failed to recognize the emperor and had acted like a fool.\u201cSo what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing either.\u201dPhilen answered with a grim look and turned his head.It\u2019s clear there\u2019s something.Philen\u2019s expression was so bad that I wanted to ask him again, but the emperor\u2019s speech began.\u201cI am very happy to be with you on such a meaningful day as today\u2026\u201dI kept my mouth shut as I couldn\u2019t chat during the emperor\u2019s speech.The emperor gave a speech that seemed to have been memorized in advance. He raised the champagne glass handed to him by his servant.It\u2019s meant to be a toast.Other nobles, including myself, also raised the champagne glasses handed out by the servants.\u201cFor the Cardin Empire.\u201d\u201cFor the Empire!\u201dThe celebration banquet began in earnest with a glass of light champagne.Gentle waltz music flowed through the hall.Instead of having no wife, the emperor came out alone, holding the hand of his half-sister, Duchess Cloud.After the Emperor, who danced first, was finished, the other nobles also went out to dance.\u201cShall we go too?\u201dPhilen reached out to me and asked.I didn\u2019t really like dancing, but I gladly took Philen\u2019s hand.Unless there was a special reason, it was polite to dance once. And I needed to show other people that I wasn\u2019t in a bad relationship with Philen.Fortunately, it was the only waltz that I could dance to, but there\u2019s a chance I would be wrong if I didn\u2019t concentrate.The other ladies danced leisurely while talking to their partners, but not me. I literally just danced.Occasionally, Philen spoke to me, but my mind was filled with dancing, and I had no time to answer.Step right here, step to the right.Ah, I have to turn my body slightly for this part.After turning left at this part\u2026When the waltz passed through the middle and entered the second half, I barely did it.I had never made a mistake so far, so I was able to relax from time to time.With deep relief in my heart, I exhaled heavily. Philen smiled and spoke in a low-pitched voice that only I could hear.\u201cAs I\u2019ve thought before, you\u2019re really a terrible dancer.\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re not a good dancer either.\u201d I responded bluntly to his rhythm.Then Philen laughed a little louder and hugged my waist tightly.\u201cYeah, but enough to lead you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re good, really.\u201d\u201cDid you just know that I\u2019m good?\u201dHis face was full of mischief as if he had returned to his childhood.Looking at that face, I felt as if I had returned to my childhood too, so I smiled a little.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you now. The dress you\u2019re wearing today is pretty.\u201dIt did.\u201cYour hair ornament is pretty, too. You seem to have prepared a lot for your debut stage, right?\u201dAt the following words, my face stiffened and I looked at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I see.He completely forgot that I had prepared a silver dress that was paired with the silver suit he was wearing.I knew that Philen was originally insensitive to this, but it was still disappointing.As I remained silent, Philen tilted his head.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cYou look unhappy. What do you mean nothing?\u201dPhilen frowned slightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Did I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really nothing.\u201dPhilen opened his mouth as if he wanted to keep questioning, but the waltz ended in good timing.I ran away from him and ran out of the hall.Philen tried to come after me, but he was caught by Duke Cloud, so he couldn\u2019t do it.Thanks to this, I was able to ease my emotions by myself, so I headed to the terrace.I was going to stay quiet on the terrace away from the noisy people.\u201cLady Thebesa, right?\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t because a lady had been pretending to know me.It wasn\u2019t polite to ignore someone who spoke kindly. It\u2019s polite to respond appropriately, so I put on a smiling mask on my expressionless face and looked at the other person.As it was the first time I appeared in the social world, I was a stranger to most of them. But this woman knew.\u201cCountess Marissa.\u201d\u201cOh my goodness, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve introduced myself, but you know who I am.\u201d\u201cIs there a noble in the Empire who doesn\u2019t know Countess Marissa?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t empty words, it was the truth. That\u2019s how famous she was. Whether it\u2019s good or bad.I had never appeared in the social world before, so that\u2019s all I could say as far as I knew.Countess Marissa shrugged her shoulders lightly as if it felt good to know.\u201cFor Lady Thebesa, this banquet is your debut stage in the social world, right?\u201cYes. For some reason, my debut was delayed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long war, so there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of stories are you talking about so interestingly?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Lady Thebesa, right? It\u2019s my first time seeing you. I\u2026\u201dWhile I was having a useless conversation with Countess Marissa, I was surrounded by numerous ladies and young children.It was the first time I was surrounded by so many people, so I was a little surprised, but I pretended not to be at all and greeted them with a smiling mask\u201cIt\u2019s your first time in the social world, yet you\u2019re so good.\u201dA lady admired me and praised me. The other lady nodded her head.\u201cAs expected for the next Duchess.\u201d\u201cWhen are you getting married? The Duke is back, so you\u2019ll do it soon, right?\u201dAs expected, there\u2019s a talk about marriage. I knew this would happen, so I was trying to run away. But the sweet champagne suddenly felt bitter. I forced a smile and nodded my head.\u201cYes. I should.\u201d\u201cIf you get married, having children is the first, right?\u201dAfter marriage\u2026 is a story about children? I wasn\u2019t surprised by the obvious sequence.I didn\u2019t say anything, but the ladies spoke arbitrarily.\u201cOf course. If you get married too late, does it make sense to have children later?\u201d\u201cIf it were someone else, they would have two children already.\u201d\u201cWell, does it matter if you don\u2019t have children? The Duke already has a successor.\u201dThe tumultuous atmosphere froze suddenly at the sudden words.I looked at the lady who froze the atmosphere.Her fiery red hair was impressive.Like Countess Marissa, she was one of the few ladies I knew beforehand. No, now that she\u2019s married, I should call her a \u2018wife\u2019.I set the glass of champagne on the table next to me and called out the person\u2019s name.I put the champagne glass on the table next to me and called out that person\u2019s name.\u201cCountess Bzantine.\u201dSophia Bzantine. Her maiden name was Sophia Huddlen. The daughter of Duke Huddlen.She was once mentioned as a candidate for Philen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, with me.At that time, people thought that the Duke and Duchess of Williot would naturally choose Sophia, the daughter of the Duke. I didn\u2019t doubt Sophia, either.But contrary to everyone\u2019s expectations, the Duke and Duchess of Williot chose me. They chose me, the daughter of a Count, as well as the daughter of a powerless provincial nobleman.\u201cHow dare you!\u201dSophia was indignant about this and shouted.\u201cYou must have used some kind of trick! Otherwise, there\u2019s no way Duke Williot would choose you over me!\u201d\u201cDid you seduce Duke Williot? Did you lift up your skirt and show him your bottom?\u201dShe even came to Thebesa mansion, said vulgar things, and slapped me on the cheek.Of course, it wasn\u2019t known to the world that she slapped me on the cheek. Even the former Duke and Duchess of Williot didn\u2019t know.Everyone was silent because Duke Huddlen gave away the gold mine as a huge compensation to cover his daughter\u2019s fault.A gold mine on one cheek. The Count and Countess of Thebesa immediately shut their mouths.There\u2019s nothing I could do about it. I wondered if I wasn\u2019t just a daughter but a daughter they really cared about. I had my doubts, though.Fearing Sophia would do anything wrong again, Duke Huddlen found a marriage partner and sent her right away.The marriage partner was Count Bzantine. Although not as good as Duke Williot, Count Bzantine was also a good marriage partner.So Sophia became Countess Bzantine, and I had never met her since then. But I never thought I\u2019d see her in a place like this.It wasn\u2019t a very pleasant meeting, so I looked at Sophia without saying a word.Sophia looked at me as if to chew on me and snorted.\u201cAs expected, people should know my topic. That\u2019s what happens when you covet high places without knowing the topic.\u201d\u201cMadam, what are you talking\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dA lady carefully reprimanded Sophia, and Sophia turned her head with a snort.\u201cDid I say something wrong? It\u2019s true that Duke Williot has a child, right?\u201d\u201cMadam Bzantine.\u201d\u201cI heard that he really cares about the woman with the child. And she was the princess of the Mullis Kingdom.\u201dA smirk spread across Sophia\u2019s lips.\u201cThat woman has a better bloodline than Lady Thebesa.\u201dNow Sophia was sarcastic, pointing out that I wasn\u2019t Countess Thebesa\u2019s biological daughter.Count Thebesa tried to hide it, but there were no perfect secrets in the world.Secretly, it became known that I was a flawed lady.Most of the people here weren\u2019t surprised and looked at me in the eye. It seemed like they already knew.My hands were shaking and my head was pounding.I was lucky to have put down my champagne glass beforehand. Or I\u2019d have dropped it in an unsightly manner.\u201cOh, did I hit the nail on the head?\u201dAs I remained silent, Sophia grinned triumphantly and swayed her fan. It was a face that she had won.Well, is that so? You have to see who\u2019s laughing at the end.I took a deep breath to calm my pounding heart and drew a shallow smile on the spot.\u201cI know, right?\u201dAs I admitted obediently, Sophia frowned and looked at me.\u201cObviously that woman\u2019s bloodline is better than mine, but she is the princess of a fallen kingdom. So it seems unnecessary to discuss her bloodline.\u201dI continued without avoiding Sophia\u2019s gaze.\u201cWhat matters is the present and the future. I will soon become a Duchess, but as a wife, you can never leave your position as a Countess for the rest of your life.\u201dIt meant that I would rise to a higher position than you in the future, although my bloodline wasn\u2019t as good as yours. Because women\u2019s positions were supposed to follow their husband\u2019s after marriage.When I became a Duchess, even if you could talk behind my back, you couldn\u2019t say anything out loud in front of me.The quick-witted Sophia immediately understood what I was saying and distorted her face in disbelief.\u201cWatch your mouth. You seem to think that it\u2019s okay to say things rudely\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s madam who speaks rudely.\u201dI wiped the smile from my lips and looked at Sophia with cool eyes.\u201cCan\u2019t you feel how many eyes are on madam right now?\u201dIt was only when I said that Sophia blushed and turned around, perhaps feeling the stinging gaze around her.\u201cI\u2019ll never forget what happened today, Lady Thebesa! You\u2019ll see!\u201dShe poured out her malice towards me until the moment she left.What the h*ll did I do so wrong?It was absurd and ridiculous.The conversation with Sophia lasted only a few words, but it was as exhausting as a long discussion.I wanted to go back to the mansion and rest.\u201cMy Lady\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, madam.\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t go back yet, so I smiled faintly and apologized to the wife who called me.\u201cI want to rest alone for a while, is it possible?\u201d\u201cYes, Yes. Of course.\u201dI was worried about what would happen if they continued to stick around, but fortunately, they just walked away.I left them sorry and went out to the terrace.Unlike the inside that was muggy due to the heat of people, the terrace was cool due to the cool breeze.I liked that there\u2019s no loud music and no people talking here.Sophia must have been chewing on me a lot while sharing it with others. Bringing up my birth and the story of Philen\u2019s mistress.With that in mind, I didn\u2019t want to go back to the banquet hall again, but I had to go back because Philen would look for me soon.\u201cI really hate it\u2026\u201dI\u2019d rather wrestle with the documents for days.The tight corset for a slim waist was also uncomfortable, and my feet hurt from needlessly high heels.\u201cI want to go back to the mansion.\u201dI grunted softly and leaned against the railing.\u201cI\u2019ve just started, do you want to go back already?\u201dA blue-haired man walked into the terrace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That\u2019s too bad.\u201d\u201cIt was something I would find out one day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dThe Emperor\u2019s lips loosened.\u201cSo, do you know my name now?\u201d\u201cOf course. How can I not know Your Majesty\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, Emperor Kalian de Cheffel Yousveldia.\u201d\u201cYou know it exactly.\u201dThe Emperor, Kalian, slowly walked towards me and spoke.\u201cNow that you discovered that I\u2019m the emperor, can I speak comfortably?\u201dIt was a matter of course. I nodded slowly.\u201cPlease make yourself comfortable, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dKalian spoke casually as if he had been waiting.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI was getting some fresh air.\u201d\u201cWell, the banquet hall is a little hot.\u201dComing to my side, Kalian leaned his upper body on the terrace.The wind gently brushed his hair.Unlike him, who was leaning comfortably, I was tense and my back was straightened.\u201cIt would be uncomfortable to stand like that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cYour tone is completely uncomfortable.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyebrows furrowed in discontent. He suddenly grabbed my wrist and made me sit on a chair on the side of the terrace.How could I sit while the Emperor was standing? It couldn\u2019t have happened.As I tried to stand up in surprise, he gently pressed my shoulder.\u201cSit, don\u2019t stand up.\u201d\u201cBut Your Majesty is standing, how can I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I like standing.\u201dKalian gave a playful wink.\u201cAnd I wear comfortable shoes. The Lady wears uncomfortable heels, right?\u201dAs Kalian stood, he glanced at my heels that were slightly exposed, and clicked his tongue.\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a long time, women are amazing. How could they wear something like that?\u201dI tacitly agreed with him, as I felt the same way.\u201cI will not refuse the favor you have given me.\u201d\u201cYeah. Please do not refuse.\u201dKalian smiled slightly and leaned against the railing.\u201cSo, is the party fun?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lying. You made a very boring face a while ago.\u201dDid you see that? Well, you heard what I said, but you couldn\u2019t have seen it.As soon as the lie was exposed, I put on an awkward face.I thought he would rebuke me for lying to the emperor, but surprisingly he didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cActually, I\u2019m bored too.\u201dRather, he agreed with me and sat down next to me.\u201cIt\u2019s better to look at the documents than to have a party or something.\u201dI looked at him, slightly surprised that he was thinking the same thing as me.Kalian, whose eyes met mine, closed his eyes beautifully and smiled. With his back against the black night sky, he was more beautiful than usual. He looked like a real fairy.\u201cWhy are you staring at me like that?\u201d\u201cAh, sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cI wish you could tell me why you stared at me like that instead of saying sorry.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say it. How could I say that I stared at him because he was so beautiful?I kept my mouth shut because it was something I couldn\u2019t dare to spit out.Kalian stroked his face with a serious look.\u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cThen, do I look ugly today?\u201dThat can\u2019t be.It made me laugh seeing him saying that so seriously.\u201cFufu.\u201dI let out a small laugh and Kalian looked at me silently.Oh, no, I shouldn\u2019t have laughed like this.I quickly closed my mouth and lowered my head.\u201cI made a big mistake\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see you in that way. I just thought it was pretty.\u201dThe moonlight shone brilliantly over his blue hair.Kalian smiled with a more beautiful smile.\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I looked at the Lady because you were so pretty.\u201dIf another man had said such a thing, I would have thought he was flirting with me, but strangely enough, Kalian\u2019s words didn\u2019t sound like that.What he said was plain without any evil intentions. So it wasn\u2019t burdensome, but instead, it was embarrassing. Because he really meant that from the bottom of his heart.I turned my head with burning cheeks. And Kalian smiled lightly and looked at me like that.I was glad that it didn\u2019t look like a mockery. Barely calming my face, I coughed lightly and looked back at him.\u201cYou\u2019ve been making fun of me ever since.\u201d\u201cI never made fun of you.\u201dKalian tilted his head slightly. The moonlight poured down over his swaying blue hair.\u201cI\u2019ve been telling the truth, but the Lady keeps thinking I\u2019m making fun of you.\u201d\u201cDo you speak to other people like this too?\u201d\u201cYeah. To whomever I like.\u201d\u201c\u2026does that mean Your Majesty likes me?\u201d\u201cI like you.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dIt was a reflex question because I was so curious.It might feel a bit rude, so I shut my mouth and looked into his eyes. Fortunately, there was no sign of annoyance on his contemplative face.After thinking for a while, Kalian opened his mouth as if he had reached a conclusion.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhen I asked back in confusion, Kalian looked at me as if he didn\u2019t understand.\u201cShould there be a reason why people are attracted to people?\u201d\u201c\u2026isn\u2019t it normal?\u201d\u201cFor example, like what?\u201dLike what\u2026After being silent for a while, I gave a few reasons that came to mind.\u201cBeautiful, or smart.\u201d\u201cIs that all about the Lady?\u201d\u201cThe, There\u2019s no way!\u201dI didn\u2019t mean it that way!Embarrassed, I raised my voice in denial, and Kalian laughed out loud.\u201cIt seems that the Lady doesn\u2019t know your worth well.\u201dMy worth?When I blinked at the incomprehensible word, Kalian smiled a little.\u201cThe Lady really doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for. Because it\u2019s also fun to mine and process undeveloped gemstones.\u201dKalian smiled strangely and stroked his chin.\u201cSo I ask you, what kind of emperor do you think I am?\u201dIt was a question out of the blue.What should I say without offending him?Rumor has it that the new emperor was a ruthless man with no sympathy, but he wasn\u2019t the emperor I met. He was a warm and kind man. He knew how to be considerate of other people.But since this was my very subjective opinion, I couldn\u2019t say that he was a good person. And I couldn\u2019t say he was a bad person either.After thinking for a while, I came up with the most sensible answer.\u201cI think you are smart.\u201d\u201cSmart. If Ver hears it, he will pass out.\u201dI was worried about what would happen if he felt offended, but looking at his expression, it seemed that it wasn\u2019t the case.That\u2019s a relief. I sighed deeply and rubbed my chest.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to think highly of me, but I\u2019m not as smart as the Lady thinks I am. I just have a little exceptional brain for tricks.\u201dKalian smiled mischievously and tapped his head with his index finger.\u201cThanks to this brain, I was able to survive until now and become the emperor.\u201dKalian\u2019s lips drooped for a long time.\u201cOtherwise, I would have died a long time ago.\u201dDied\u2026 The somewhat eerie word sent shivers down my spine.Kalian smiled mischievously again as I stared at him silently with a stiff expression on my face.\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, so don\u2019t be so stiff.\u201dIs that really a joke?I thought it was like that when I saw his mischievous smiling face, but his eyes were terribly cold.They often said, \u2018Eyes reflect the window of the heart.\u2019Anyway, it seemed like he was trying to pretend it was a joke as I stiffened because I was too surprised.Then, there was only one answer and one reaction I had to show. It was to smile brightly and say, \u2018I see.\u2019\u201cMy Lady?\u201dFor some reason, I couldn\u2019t do that. No, I knew exactly why.Kalian\u2019s eyes, which were cold with old wounds, were so familiar as looking in a mirror. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t turn it over as a joke.\u201cI must have made you uncomfortable again.\u201dKalian stroked his chin as if he were in trouble.How dare I make the Emperor feel like that.I hurriedly lowered my head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear you say sorry.\u201d\u201cAh, sor\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201dKalian cut off my words.I didn\u2019t know what to answer, so I kept my mouth shut.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dA man came silently and called him.It was a man with dazzling silver hair. Looking at the uniform he was wearing and the sword he had around his waist, he seemed to be Kalian\u2019s escort knight.When the man\u2019s eyes met mine, he slightly lowered his head. I greeted him as well.Then, the man looked at Kalian with an expressionless face.\u201cYou have to go.\u201dAt those words, Kalian sighed a little and nodded.Are you going?Then I had to see him off, so I got up in a hurry.\u201cArgh!\u201dMaybe because I suddenly stood up, my body staggered greatly without any strength in my legs.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dFortunately, thanks to Kalian, the mishap from falling was prevented.Embarrassed that I had stumbled so badly, I lowered my head with a red face.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I\u2019m sorry, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cAt times like this, it is better to say thank you than to say sorry.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWhen I said it quickly, Kalian smiled and let me go.\u201cIf there\u2019s any inconvenience, I\u2019ll call the palace doctor.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dKalian tapped my shoulder and went inside.The man who came to call him lowered his head to me and went inside.I was alone in an instant. Loneliness enveloped my body.Even though I was alone earlier, I didn\u2019t feel lonely at all, but now I\u2019m strangely lonely.I missed the sound of people talking.Should I go inside now?Philen would look for me soon, so I thought it\u2019s better to go in.Cheolkeog\u2013Before I could open the terrace door, the door swung open and Philen came in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI blinked my eyes out and looked at him.Philen was looking down at me with dreadful eyes. He looked angry.Why is he so angry? Don\u2019t tell me, he heard about what happened between me and Sophia earlier?\u201cWhy\u2026\u201dI thought I need to ask for sure rather than guessing. But as soon as I opened my mouth, Philen grabbed me hard on the shoulder and asked fiercely.\u201cWhy are you cheating?\u201dCheating? Who? Don\u2019t tell me, me?Ridiculous. At his words that were so out of the blue, I looked at him with a dumbfounded expression.Thinking that my expression was positive, Philen made a more harsh impression.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you openly cheated on me in a place like this. So audacious.\u201d\u201c\u2026who is cheating?\u201dI frowned and pushed away his hand that was holding my shoulder painfully.There\u2019s no one here, so I spoke informally.\u201cI don\u2019t know where or what you heard, but I never did.\u201d\u201cI saw it with my own two eyes, okay?\u201d\u201cYou saw it with your own two eyes\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me, are you talking about me having a conversation with His Majesty?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. You even hug His Majesty.\u201dHa. I didn\u2019t think it would be because of that.I answered irritatedly, pressing down the middle of my forehead.\u201cI didn\u2019t hug His Majesty. His Majesty caught me because I was about to fall. I was simply getting help.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to believe that?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re free to believe it or not, but I am innocent.\u201dWhen I spoke confidently without batting an eye, Philen\u2019s expression shook slightly.\u201cThen why did you smile so brightly in front of His Majesty?\u201d\u201cThen, do you want me to frown when talking to His Majesty? Hmm? Should I yell in a fit of irritation?\u201dPhilen, who kept his mouth shut as if at a loss for words, said sulkily.\u201cYou, you\u2019ve never smiled so lightly in front of me.\u201d\u201cI never smiled lightly.\u201dLike all nobles, it was just a decent smile for hospitality.\u201cAnd the reason I didn\u2019t smile in front of you is because there\u2019s nothing to smile about. You\u2019re doing weird things these days, so how am I supposed to smile?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing weird things?\u201dWhen Philen asked as if he had no idea, I was blown away.As expected, Philen really didn\u2019t know what he had done wrong.From where should I start teaching him this?No, would he understand if I taught him?I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t understand.Rather, it was obvious that he would treat me like a strange woman.\u201cPerhaps, is it because of Cecily?\u201dFortunately, it seemed like Philen didn\u2019t sell his tact completely because he asked that.As I silently affirmed, Philen sighed.\u201cAs I said before, I\u2019m taking care of her because she has my child. I\u2019ll send her out of the mansion as soon as the child is born.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t trust you at all.\u201dI retorted and he said frustratingly.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\u201cLook at how you\u2019re treating her now. Who will believe you? No one will believe you.\u201d\u201cBut you still have to trust me.\u201d\u201cYou have to do something that will make me trust you.\u201dThe mouth that burst once couldn\u2019t stop.I started taking out everything I had kept inside.\u201cWhatever you do, you run to her, you move only for her, you don\u2019t pay any attention to me at all. So, how can I trust you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because Cecily is alone and Leila, you can handle it on your own\u2026\u201dWhy can\u2019t you know that I did it because I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have a hard time?\u201cEven if she has your child, I\u2019m the one you should take care of first. Not her.\u201dI gave strength to my eyes and looked at Philen.\u201cTell me honestly. Are you really thinking of marrying me? You\u2019re not trying to make her a Duchess, are you?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe a single word you say.\u201d\u201cLeila.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s true, show me by your action so I can trust you.\u201dFor example, Cecily, kicked her out.I wanted to say that, but I didn\u2019t say it because it seemed like I was being too childish.After all, she had Philen\u2019s child.That alone gave Philen enough reason to keep Cecily.At my words, Philen thought for a moment and then said with a determined face.\u201cI just have to show a certain action so that you can trust me, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dPhilen grabbed my hand tightly and led me into the hall.It was so serious that the eyes of the scattered people were focused on us.Because of this, I missed the chance to shake off Philen\u2019s hand, and I had no choice but to follow him.The place where Philen took me was in front of Kalian.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dKalian, who was talking with other nobles, looked back at Philen.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Duke Williot?\u201d\u201cI am here to ask Your Majesty\u2019s permission.\u201dPhilen spoke with a face more determined than ever.\u201cI, Philen Williot, want to marry Leila Thebesa, so please allow it.\u201dWhat is this again?I was bewildered at the sudden remark and looked back at Philen.Kalian also looked bewildered.There was a heavy silence in the banquet hall. Everyone was holding their breath and staring at us.\u201cHa.\u201dThe first person to break the silence was Kalian.He answered with a smile fresher than ever.\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d*****Kalian smiled as he looked at Philen, who was shocked by his refusal.That meant he thought he would allow it.There were too many reasons for refusing Philen\u2019s request. Half of them were reasons that most nobles here knew.Unfortunately, it seemed like the young duke in front of him had no idea why Kalian refused.Well, if he had known, he wouldn\u2019t have come with such mettle and said it.What a foolish, stupid man he is.Kalian tilted his lips at an angle. He looked at Leila, who was standing next to Philen.From the look on her face, Leila seemed to know why Kalian refused Philen\u2019s request.Yet, her calm, thoughtful face was impressive. She could stay calm even in this situation.Kalian\u2019s cold eyes were dyed warmly. His gaze was fixed on Leila for a while.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dThen he heard Philen calling and turned his gaze to him. His warm gaze froze again.\u201cMay I ask why you don\u2019t allow it?\u201dNot only is he a fool, but he also has a hobby of digging his own grave.Kalian asked Philen without hiding the sneer that erupted out of him.\u201cAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know, Duke Williot?\u201d\u201cPerhaps\u2026\u201dWhen Philen put his doubts on top of his vigilance and was about to ask Kalian.\u201cOf course, the Duke knows why, Your Majesty.\u201dLeila took a step forward and gently interrupted the conversation.Kalian\u2019s gaze shifted to Leila again.Leila gently held Philen\u2019s hand and warned him not to say any more before continuing.\u201cWhen there\u2019s a great ceremonial in the imperial family, there\u2019s no way the duke is unaware of the custom that nobles do not hold separate ceremonies for three months.\u201dAt Leila\u2019s added words, Philen\u2019s eyes shook slightly. His earlobes turned a little red. He seemed to have finally figured it out.And Kalian, he was the only one who could see Philen\u2019s stupid face that was cleverly covered by Leila. That was probably why she took one step forward.I can\u2019t believe you think that far.Kalian once again admired Leila\u2019s ability. He wanted her even more.\u201cHe knew that.\u201dWondering how far Leila could make excuses, Kalian deliberately asked back.\u201cBut why did he come to ask my permission?\u201d\u201cHe needs permission to get married now so that we can get married within this year.\u201dLeila answered as if she had been waiting.\u201cAs Your Majesty knows, the higher the nobility, the longer it takes to get married because you have to go through various complicated procedures from the preparation process to the wedding.\u201dNobles\u2019 marriages took at least six months and up to a year. The imperial family took longer than that.\u201cSo Your Majesty, the Duke wanted to marry me within this year, that\u2019s why he tried to get permission from you first. Isn\u2019t that right, Duke?\u201dLeila smiled shyly and asked Philen.Anyone could tell that it was the figure of a fianc\u00e9e who truly loved her fianc\u00e9.\u201cO, of course.\u201dPhilen nodded reluctantly.Upon hearing the desired answer, Leila stepped back, still with a shy face.As a result, when Philen\u2019s slightly red ears were exposed, the onlookers murmured, regardless of age or gender.\u201cLook at those red ears. I think Duke Williot likes his fianc\u00e9e a lot.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why he wanted to get the permission to get married in advance.\u201d\u201cI thought their relationship was neglected because of his mistress, but I guess not.\u201d\u201cWell, a mistress is a mistress and a legal wife is a legal wife.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t because of Philen\u2019s blushing earlobes, but it didn\u2019t matter to those who believed in what they saw.Public opinion, which was stirred by Philen\u2019s sudden action, changed for the better with Leila\u2019s improvisation.Everyone cheered for Philen\u2019s courage and envied Leila, who was loved by Philen.\u201cI see.\u201dIf he kept arguing here, he\u2019d be the fool, so Kalian ended the conversation.\u201cBut since I\u2019m a little petty, I want to talk about this again in a month. Can you wait that long, Duke Williot?\u201d\u201cOf course, Your Majesty.\u201dThe conversation, which was as dangerous as walking a tightrope, ended safely.Kalian drank champagne and looked at Leila as she turned around, tired like a soldier returning from war.I want her no matter how many times I look at it.She was too talented to be left to rot for the rest of her life next to that idiot.He wanted to let her talents unfold to her heart\u2019s content in wider water.To do that, he had to get her as his assistant as soon as possible.I have to settle the official government test fast.If Ver heard it, he would be shouting, but that\u2019s how greedy he was to Leila\u2026Kalian thought so and called Ver, who was happy without having an idea what was going on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPhilen\u2019s unexpected action made my heart pounding as the storm had passed.I was glad it worked out, otherwise, he would be a laughing stock among people for a long time.Not only Philen, but also me who was beside him.It was terrifying just to think about it.Once again, I swept my chest relieved that I had made it through safely.But, on the other hand, Philen looked displeased.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Duke?\u201d\u201c\u2026no, nothing.\u201dWho would believe you if you said no with that face?I was curious, but it seemed like he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so I didn\u2019t ask deeply.Then Philen\u2019s face became a little more discontented.His sour look continued throughout the party.The other nobles looked at us strangely, so I stabbed him in the side to tell him to take care of his expression, but it didn\u2019t work.It was the same in the carriage on the way home from the banquet.As he looked out the window with the words \u2018I\u2019m sulking\u2019 all over his body, I had no choice but to ask him again.\u201cWhat on earth is the matter with you?\u201dAs soon as I spoke, Philen asked back as if he had been waiting.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me beforehand?\u201dThat\u2019s what he said.I didn\u2019t know what he meant, so I just stared at him, and Philen added.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me beforehand that there was such a custom?\u201dCustom?Ah, was he talking about not holding another ceremony when there\u2019s a great ceremony in the Imperial Palace?From his appearance earlier, I thought he knew.Ridiculous. Why did he act on his own and then question me?This time, as I stared at him dumbfoundedly, Philen put deep wrinkles on his forehead.\u201cDid you want to see me humiliated by the Emperor?\u201dWhat on earth is going on in your head to be able to think like that?I really wanted to look into his head.\u201cThere\u2019s no way I would want that.\u201d\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell me beforehand?\u201d\u201cDid you give me a chance to talk?\u201dWhen I answered back as if it was ridiculous, Philen said in a muffled voice, as if he had just remembered that he hadn\u2019t done so.\u201cBut, it would be better if you told me in advance.\u201d\u201cHow could I know what you\u2019re going to do, when you\u2019re going to do it, and tell you in advance? I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t foretell.\u201dThen, I kept my mouth shut when I was about to say that I never thought he would have forgotten such basic common sense.If I told him that far, that proud Philen would definitely run amok.Even now, when I pointed out his mistakes, he kept his mouth shut and had a sour look on his face.He knew what he had done was wrong, but he didn\u2019t want to admit it because of his pride.Seriously, his pride was unnecessarily strong.Well, it was natural for his pride to be so strong as he lived his life as the son of the duke, the pinnacle of the nobility, but at this time, it was a little frustrating.The thought of living with him in the future made me suffocated and darkened my eyes.I, am I really okay with this?I had this question, but the answer was set.Even if it wasn\u2019t okay, I had to endure it unconditionally.If it\u2019s not for this position, I would be a worthless count lady.If so, it would be a more difficult ordeal than it was now, so I had to endure it somehow.There had been no conversation between us since then. It was such a heavy silence. But it wasn\u2019t burdensome at all. It was rather pleasant. Because I was more tired of arguing with him.Soon after, the carriage arrived at the mansion. Philen opened the door with his own hands before the coachman opened it.\u201cPhil!\u201dCecily greeted Philen passionately.Philen smiled as if he had never been sullen, and hugged Cecily tightly.It was the appearance of a sweet lover no matter who looked at it.Even with Cecily, it was clear that Philen loved her. And he was going to get her out of the mansion once she had the baby?Nonsense.Did Philen think I was an ignorant fool to believe such a blatant lie? Or did he ignore me?I thought it would be the latter rather than the former, and I felt bitter. The question, \u2018Am I okay with this?\u2019, had deepened a bit.I entered the mansion with a slight frown.Sarah followed me after glancing at Philen and Cecily, who still had a sweet atmosphere, with displeased eyes.As soon as I got back to my room, I changed my clothes and sat down at my desk.Even though it looked like eating and idling, participating in a party was physically and mentally exhausting.I wanted to get a good rest, but I couldn\u2019t because I had too much work to do.Other than that, I had to quickly review the documents related to the rainy season and send them to the estate.So I worked hard without taking a break.It was the same the next day.I was too busy to eat, so I stayed in my room, looked at the documents, and roughly settled my meal with a sandwich.The only time I went outside was to see off Philen attending the party. The next day\u2019s party, which only men participate in, was held during the day, so Philen left the mansion a little past noon.For some reason, Cecily didn\u2019t show up, but I didn\u2019t question it much. I was busy with other things right now, so there was no time for me to pay attention to Cecily.I went back to my room and while I was working frantically, I heard a knock.\u201cCome in.\u201dIn the mansion without Philen, the only people who would come to visit me were the servants, so I naturally spoke informally.\u201cAre you busy, Lady Thebesa?\u201dUnexpectedly, it was Cecily who came.I couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019s coming to me.When an unexpected person appeared, I stopped what I was doing and looked at her.Behind Cecily, I saw Sarah stamping her feet helplessly.When our eyes met, Sarah burst into tears. She kept apologizing with gestures, saying she was sorry for being unable to stop Cecily.It was annoying that Cecily came, but I didn\u2019t blame or resent Sarah. Because this was something she couldn\u2019t stop.How could a maid dare to stop a woman who had her master\u2019s child?\u201cGet out of here, Sarah.\u201d\u201cMy Lady, the tea\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201dI had no intention of having tea and chatting with Cecily.After Sarah left, I turned over the document and asked Cecily.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYou seem very busy.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see?\u201dMy words came out bluntly, as she was a very unpleasant person to deal with.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but as you can see, I\u2019m busy. Will you come back another time?\u201dIt was empty words. I didn\u2019t want Cecily to visit me anymore. So I hoped that there would be no face-to-face conversations, and I didn\u2019t want to hear any news from her.\u201cIt\u2019ll only take a minute.\u201dIf someone made it so obvious that they didn\u2019t like me, I would feel bad and just leave. But Cecily didn\u2019t do that, instead, she sat down on the sofa with a soft smile.Who allowed her to sit down? I didn\u2019t even give her permission to sit down.My eyebrows frowned on their own.I was going to say something to Cecily, but when I saw her belly, I held it in.The fact that she was pregnant served as a shield against the criticism of everything she did. There were also times when Philen overprotected her.\u201cI have something to tell you, would you like to sit here?\u201dThat\u2019s why she could lift her chin so high and spoke to me in a commanding tone.I didn\u2019t like her actions, her expressions, and everything she said.So, I looked at the document again and answered.\u201cI told you, I\u2019m busy. If you have something to tell me, come next time.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you have time to talk for a minute?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t.\u201dIt was true, and even if there was, I had no intention of using it for her.\u201cThen just listen to me.\u201dAre you still going to say what you want to say?I pressed my twitching eyebrows and looked at Cecily.If she didn\u2019t go out on her own, I could ask the servant to drag her out. But I couldn\u2019t because I was sure Philen would say something later.\u201cWhat is it about?\u201dIt seemed like it would be best to just listen to what she wanted to say and send her out quickly.When I expressed my willingness to listen, Cecily clapped her hands in delight.\u201cI heard from Phil that we\u2019re going back to the estate next week, is that true?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cAre you going out before then?\u201dWhy are you asking about my schedule all of a sudden? Don\u2019t tell me, do you want to go out together?If that\u2019s the case, I would send her out without listening anymore, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201cThere is something I want the Lady to buy for me.\u201dInstead, Cecily spat out more ridiculous words.I asked Cecily in a bewildered tone.\u201cYou want me to buy something for you?\u201d\u201cYes. I want you to buy me some clothes for my child to wear. Toys too.\u201dIt\u2019s already ridiculous to say in a commanding tone that you want me to buy something for you, and you want me to buy your child\u2019s stuff?The ridiculousness made me speechless.Bewildered, I stared blankly at her, not knowing that the ink on the quill was staining the document.Cecily then asked, tilting her head.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve done wrong?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dTtug\u2013The quill is completely broken.So when the document was covered with ink, I sighed and threw the broken quill into the trash can.\u201cWhy do I have to do that?\u201d\u201cBecause the Lady will be this child\u2019s foster mother.\u201dCecily replied as if I was asking what was so obvious.\u201cA mother should do that for her child, right?\u201dI hated to admit it, but it was true.Philen said that Cecily\u2019s child would be registered in the family register. So, as long as I married Philen, I would become her child\u2019s mother.Even if I didn\u2019t want to.Just like Countess Thebesa did.\u201cI want to go by myself, but as you can see, I can\u2019t stand for long these days because of my big belly.\u201dCecily gently swept her belly and continued.\u201cIf I had been in the royal palace, the ladies-in-waiting would have taken care of me. But since I\u2019m not, I\u2019m asking the Lady, who has a similar status as the ladies-in-waiting.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you get excited here, you lose.I took a deep breath, controlled my pounding heart, and answered with a smile.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dWhen I flatly refused, Cecily opened her eyes wide. It was a face that didn\u2019t know that I would refuse.\u201cWhy?\u201dShe looked obviously surprised, but the way she looked at me was the same as the way Countess Thebesa looked at me.The eyes that were filled with contempt or disdain, many negative emotions.Maybe that\u2019s why I could see Countess Thebesa above Cecily.As I recalled the words she had poured out onto me, my mood dropped sharply.\u201c\u2026get out.\u201dNot knowing wasn\u2019t a bad thing. But I had to tell her that this wasn\u2019t right.If Cecily\u2019s action was purely from ignorance like Philen\u2019s, I could endure it.However, if it was a pretense of ignorance, I had no intention of putting up with it any longer.\u201cStop pretending and get out.\u201dAs I pointed my finger at the door, Cecily tilted her head innocently.\u201cPretending\u2026 I don\u2019t know what Lady Thebesa is talking about.\u201d\u201cStop calling me Lady Thebesa.\u201dI twisted my lips.\u201cFrom now on, call me young lady. Miss Heliode, no, I\u2019ll call you Miss Cecily now. The Heliode surname disappeared when your kingdom fell.\u201dCecily\u2019s face turned white. Then it turned red again.She leaped up from her seat and shouted.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I\u2019m a princess!\u201d\u201cIt should be, \u2018I was a princess\u2019, no?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dAs I corrected her, Cecily\u2019s eyes were filled with venom.She glared at me as if she would eat me up at any moment, but I wasn\u2019t scared at all.Because I had met a lot of people like that while acting on behalf of the Duke and Duchess.And Cecily was on the cute side.\u201cYou, who can no longer use the Heliode surname, are no longer a princess or a noble, but a commoner.\u201dI got up from my seat and walked towards the door.\u201cThe reason I use honorifics to you is because you have his child.\u201dCecily\u2019s venomous gaze clung to me like a leech.\u201cUntil you give birth and leave the mansion, I will treat you to the best of my ability. So, don\u2019t cause any trouble, just keep quiet and get out.\u201d\u201cI am leaving the mansion?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear from Philen? Philen said he will get you out of the mansion as soon as you give birth to the child.\u201dCecily\u2019s wide-opened eyes trembled in disbelief.It seemed she hadn\u2019t heard any of it from Philen.Well, as expected. He didn\u2019t mean it seriously. He was just trying to reassure me at that time.Even though I knew it, I pretended not to know.\u201cI can\u2019t say I will be a good foster mother for that child.\u201dWhen I opened the door, I saw Sarah waiting outside restlessly.\u201cAt least I promise I won\u2019t abuse him.\u201dI winked at Sarah to tell her that I was okay, then turned to Cecily and said, \u201cSo, feel free to leave the mansion after giving birth to the child, Miss Cecily.\u201d*****Cecily, unable to win the fight, left the room with such incredible speed that it was hard to believe that she was pregnant.Since she was caught pretending, I didn\u2019t think she\u2019s going to keep acting in front of me anymore.I didn\u2019t expect her to be easy, but I didn\u2019t expect her to be that easy.But then, when I thought I would bump into Cecily a lot in the future, I felt terrible and it made my head hurt.I took a deep sigh and rubbed my forehead.\u201cAre you okay, My Lady?\u201dSarah asked with a worried look.Instead of answering, I nodded and pointed to the sofa Cecily was sitting on.\u201cTake that sofa away. And change the carpet.\u201dIt was a sudden order, but Sarah politely bowed her head and replied yes without asking why.I asked Sarah to clean the room as well, then headed to the other room with a box, containing the seals of the Duke and Duchess, and the documents.While Sarah was cleaning, I was going to look at the documents in the other room, but no matter how hard I tried to concentrate, I couldn\u2019t.Let\u2019s take a break.It would be better to take a break and look at it again than to keep holding onto it like a fool.I just laid on the sofa and closed my eyes for a while to organize my complicated mind, but before I knew it, I fell asleep.Bang-!How long has it been?I opened my eyes in surprise at the sound of the door opening violently.At the door stood Philen, furious.\u201cWhy?\u201dIt was an abstract question with no subject or object, but I immediately noticed that it had something to do with that woman.From the moment I got mad with Cecily, I expected Philen to come, but then, he really came. I felt bitter.\u201cWhy?\u201dHowever, as if nothing had happened, I stood up and straightened my back, facing Philen\u2019s wrath, and asked back.\u201cWhy are you saying that now? Why did you say such abusive words to her?\u201d\u201cAbusive words? I don\u2019t know what you mean. Did I just tell her the truth?\u201dI closed and opened my eyes slowly, raising my lips obliquely.\u201cIt is true that she is no longer a princess and that she has to leave the mansion after giving birth to the child.\u201d\u201cDid you have to say such harsh words to a woman who was still shocked by losing her country?\u201dPhilen looked at me with his eyes gleaming.\u201cDon\u2019t you have any consideration? As a woman, how can you shock a pregnant woman so much when you too will be a mother in the future!\u201dMy heart was pounding at the pouring criticism.\u201cAnd I should be the one who told her about getting out of the mansion. Not you!\u201d\u201cSo did you tell her? Isn\u2019t everything I say true?\u201dPhilen didn\u2019t answer.As expected, he didn\u2019t say anything.I was glad he didn\u2019t say anything.Certainly, Philen would have coaxed and soothed her, saying that he would never do anything like that.It was expected. I laughed a little because I was speechless.\u201cSee? It seemed like you couldn\u2019t do it, so I just did it for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026who are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201cYeah, fianc\u00e9e.\u201dPhilen twisted his lips.\u201cNot Duchess of Williot.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cLeila, I think you\u2019re mistaken because you\u2019ve been living under the Duke of Williot for over 10 years. But you\u2019re not yet Duchess of Williot.\u201dHis reproachful gaze and his pouring words pierced my heart cruelly.\u201cSo, don\u2019t even think about getting involved in the affairs of the mansion anymore, and don\u2019t even think about arguing.\u201dI couldn\u2019t look straight at Philen and looked down obliquely.\u201cThat is not your role. You\u2019re still a count lady. I want you to be aware of your position right now.\u201dRight. It\u2019s not my role.Because I\u2019m Leila Thebesa, not Leila Williot.But for what purpose have I been doing his job so far?Why did I spend all ten years for the Duke of Williot?\u201cFill in what Philen can\u2019t, as Duchess, please take good care of Duke of Williot, okay?\u201dYeah, it was for the Duke couple.I did my best for them who treated me like their own daughter and cared for me\u2026But he didn\u2019t acknowledge me. Just because of that woman.Tears filled my eyes and my eyes became blurry. My hands clenched tightly by themselves. And I bit my lip until it bled.\u201cDid you understand what I said?\u201dPhilen looked at me coldly and asked.It was confirmed.He stabbed a sharp sword into my already dying heart again.All kinds of bad emotions, such as regret, lamentation, and despair, raged in my heart.It swept through my heart like a storm, and what\u2019s left behind was\u2026 giving upAfter giving up, I was no longer angry.It\u2019s just that I felt so pitiful for myself, who had sacrificed for the Duke of Williot until now.I felt like a fool to believe that I would become a duchess.I looked at Philen with tears that had dried up in my eyes.\u201cI got it.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d\u201cThen I won\u2019t do it anymore.\u201dI\u2019m sorry, Duke. Duchess.You cared for me so much.You repeatedly asked me to take good care of the Duke of Williot\u2026I don\u2019t think I can do that anymore.I took out the seals of the Duke and Duchess from the box and put them down on the table.\u201cAs you said, I\u2019m Leila Thebesa, so I won\u2019t do the Duke of Williot\u2019s job anymore.\u201dAt my words, Philen looked at me with precipitous eyes and opened his mouth.\u201cHave you been this irresponsible?\u201dIrresponsible?What else is this\u2026..\u201cI\u2019m irresponsible?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not? You\u2019re throwing away your job just because you argued with me, no?\u201d\u201cHa?\u201dWhat was this again?Such a talent to embarrass himself with every word he said.A good for nothing talent.I swallowed a laugh and glared at Philen.Philen didn\u2019t avoid my gaze and faced me confidently.\u201cYou have to say it correctly, Philen.\u201dWill you be able to keep confident even after hearing this?\u201cIt\u2019s not me who\u2019s irresponsible, it\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense is that?\u201d\u201cDid you forget? Whose job is this originally.\u201dI picked up the documents on the table and waved them in front of Philen\u2019s eyes.\u201cOriginally, it\u2019s your job, Duke Williot. Because you didn\u2019t do it and threw it away, I\u2019ve been taking care of it all this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s not me who\u2019s irresponsible, it\u2019s you, Philen.\u201dWhen I looked at Philen to see if he could refute it, he bit his lip.The confident look on his face had long since collapsed.Philen looked at me with a stiff face.Anyone would know that he\u2019s afraid if he looked like that.\u201cThe Duchess\u2019s job isn\u2019t yours, but it\u2019s not mine either.\u201dI snorted and put the documents back on the table.\u201cAs you said, I\u2019m Leila Thebesa, not the Duchess of Williot.

I\u2019m just trying to be aware of my position and act as you said.\u201dPhilen\u2019s jaw tightened.His deep wrinkled eyebrows looked very displeased with the situation.\u201cIs this how it\u2019s supposed to turn out?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dI shrugged lightly as if I didn\u2019t really know anything.\u201cThen, it seems like we\u2019re done talking. Can I leave now? I am tired.\u201dPhilen didn\u2019t answer, but I took it as a positive affirmation and left the room.*****When I went back to my room, it had already been cleaned. The sofa and carpet that were asked to be replaced were also replaced with new ones.Sarah, who was working on the finishing touches, found me and smiled brightly.\u201cI was just about to go report to you, but you came first.\u201d\u201cSomehow.\u201dThe smile on Sarah\u2019s face disappeared at my indifferent answer.\u201cMy Lady, what happened?\u201d\u201cDo I look like something has happened?\u201d\u201cYes. You don\u2019t look well.\u201dIs that so?I checked my face in the mirror.It was an ordinary face, no different from usual. It didn\u2019t look bad or weird at all.\u201cOh, by the way, while you were away, I got a letter from the West.\u201dSarah approached me and gave me the letter she had taken beforehand.\u201cI think it was a letter from the aides\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dI raised my hand to cover Sarah\u2019s mouth.\u201cFrom now on, all letters from the aides should be delivered to the Duke.\u201d\u201cYes? But, it says it\u2019s a letter related to work.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why. Now, the Duke of Williot\u2019s work will be done by the Duke. So bring it to him.\u201dThen, I handed over all the documents I brought with me to Sarah.\u201cAnd bring all of this to the Duke.\u201d\u201cBy any chance\u2026 Did something happen between My Lady and the Master?\u201dThe quick-witted maid was convenient and uncomfortable.I waved my hand to tell her that she should just leave, replacing my answer in silence. And Sarah went out quietly.Left alone, I threw myself down on the bed without changing my clothes.I had a headache.I felt rather heavy even though I had unloaded my burden.I was anxious too.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI covered my eyes with my arms and muttered.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Leila. You did well.\u201dAfter all, the duke\u2019s job would be passed on to Philen when he returned to the estate after the banquet was over.It was a little upsetting to let go of the Duchess\u2019s job, but\u2026 I had no regrets.Even if the same situation was repeated over and over again, I would have made the same choice.So there\u2019s no need to be anxious.Everything would be okay.I had been comforting myself for a while, but it\u2019s all in vain.*****\u201cHa!\u201dBack in the room, Philen dumped the seals and documents he had brought on his desk.If Leila bent a little and apologized, he would accept it as if nothing had happened.However, instead of apologizing, she replied back as if she was great, and then he too became angry and said something harsh.But Philen didn\u2019t think he was wrong. Because Leila was the one who started everything first.If she treated Cecily a little warmly. No, if she had lowered her pride when he came, he wouldn\u2019t have said it that far.He knew well what Leila had been through, that\u2019s why he tried to put up with it even if she was being rude. But, she became more arrogant.How dare you say that to me.\u201cI have to get a proper apology this time.\u201dHe was determined not to let it pass.Tok, tok.A knock was heard.\u201cMaster.\u201dIt was the butler of the mansion.In the butler\u2019s arms, there was an armful of documents.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cYoung Lady Thebesa asked me to bring it to you.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dDoes this woman really want to do it?Philen held back his annoyance and shook his head.The butler, who noticed that he wasn\u2019t feeling very well, asked cautiously.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean what should we do? It\u2019s my job, so I have to do it. Leave it on the desk.\u201dThe butler put the documents down on the desk and quietly left.Philen glared at the quickly increased documents as if they were Leila.\u201cYou think I couldn\u2019t handle it?\u201dAlthough he had never officially worked as a duke, he was still the successor.As he had been educated as a successor from the moment he began to walk, he knew very well what to do.He knew there\u2019s a difference between theory and practice, but it wouldn\u2019t be as difficult as a war to deal with just scraps of paper, right?Thinking that it was a piece of cake, and the only thing lacking was the help from the aides, Philen picked up the document arrogantly and began to read it.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut soon his confident face slowly collapsed.Philen squinted his eyes and read through the document several times, but he couldn\u2019t understand what it was about.All he understood was that the rainy season was approaching and that the river bank had to be repaired just in case.How the process worked, how much it cost, how much risk there was, and how long it had to be done was written down, but he didn\u2019t understand any of it.And what he didn\u2019t understand the most was the amount.Only to prepare for the rainy season, a month\u2019s worth of the estate\u2019s operating expenses went into it.\u201cWhy does it cost so much money?\u201dDon\u2019t tell me, did we spend this much money every rainy season?If so, someone must have stolen it from the middle.Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to spend this much money every time.And there\u2019s no way Leila was the one who stole the money.Is there a culprit among the aides or middlemen?Or the culprit could be the wizard who was called in case of an emergency.We need to go back to the estate to check who the culprit is.\u201cYou pretended to be smart, but it turns out you were stupid.\u201dIt was funny that Leila didn\u2019t figure it out after doing it for years and he discovered what she didn\u2019t figure out at once.After solving everything without her knowledge, I will surprise her.Then she won\u2019t be as proud as she is now.She won\u2019t be able to ignore me.Just thinking about Leila\u2019s embarrassment made him laugh with joy.As he remembered, the rainy season in the Tephra territory he ruled was three weeks from now.It was written in the document too.It meant that they had to finish preparing before then.I have to send this document ahead of time.That way, all preparations could be completed before the rainy season began.He had to revise the amount before sending the document, but he had no idea how much he should revise it.If there were aides, he would discuss it with them, but inevitably there was none.Then what should he do?\u201c\u2026should I discuss it with Leila?\u201dAt the sudden thought, Philen shook his head.What a crazy idea.Why would I talk with her who didn\u2019t even know there was something wrong?Moreover, I didn\u2019t want to talk to her now.It wasn\u2019t just now. I wouldn\u2019t say a word until she bent and apologized.Never.Then Philen, who was contemplating what to do, decided to find precedents.If he looked at the precedents of the previous Duke of Williot\u2019s work, he might be able to solve this by himself.\u201cBring the key to the study.\u201dIt was when Philen, who had been given the key to the study by the butler, was about to go to the study with the document.\u201cPhil?\u201dCecily was here.She hugged Philen from behind.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been looking at the document.\u201d\u201cThen you won\u2019t be able to stay with me.\u201dCecily said with a gloomy look.\u201cI wanted Phil to stay by my side but because of Lady Thebesa\u2019s work\u2026\u201dHow could he say no when she spoke in such a sad tone?\u201cNo way.\u201dPhilen put the document he was looking at on the desk, then turned to look at her.\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you.\u201d\u201cReally? But don\u2019t you have to work?\u201d\u201cI can work on it later.\u201dAt Philen\u2019s answer, Cecily threw herself into Philen\u2019s arms as if she was very happy.Then she glanced at the document that Philen had put down.Preparing for the rainy season, risks, and\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re barely gaining weight even though you\u2019re pregnant.\u201dCecily\u2019s gaze that was scanning the document turned to Philen.Philen lightly pinched Cecily\u2019s pale cheek.\u201cYou\u2019re so skinny. Who would think you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d\u201cNo. I gained a lot of weight.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t gained weight anywhere other than your belly. Well, this was originally big.\u201dPhilen\u2019s hand gently passed through her chest.Cecily\u2019s face flushed brightly at the touch with bad intention and patted him on the chest.\u201cPhil, you idiot.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll be the only one who can call me an idiot.\u201dPhilen smiled and hugged Cecily affectionately.Cecily snuggled into Philen\u2019s arms and glanced again at the document that Philen had put down.The word wizard, to be exact.Cecily\u2019s eyes trembled slightly.Cecily bit her lip nervously, then looked up at Philen.\u201cPhil, I have a favor to ask.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cPromise me that you\u2019ll listen first.\u201dWhen Philen didn\u2019t answer yet, Cecily quickly added.\u201cIt\u2019s about our child.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll listen.\u201dOnly then did Cecily smile brightly and say what she wanted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was impossible.In the end, I stayed up all night with my eyes wide open, sitting quietly on the sofa and doing nothing.Even though I had no desire to do anything, there was nothing to do.After handing everything to Philen, all I had left was free time.When I was doing the Duke and Duchess\u2019s work, I was so busy that a day wasn\u2019t enough. And then, I suddenly became free, so I didn\u2019t know what to do.Should I read a book? Yeah, I think that\u2019s a good idea.Having made the decision, I headed straight to the study.But, the door to the study was firmly locked.Of course, I thought the butler would have the key, but he didn\u2019t.\u201cMaster holds the key to the study.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t the keys of the mansion originally kept by the butler?\u201d\u201cYes, but last night, Master asked me to bring him the key to the study, so I gave it to him.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dPhilen and the study. What a bad combination.I was surprised when I heard that he took the key to the study, not the key to the training ground.Ah, did he take the key to the study because of the documents?Other than that, there was no reason for Philen to take the key to the study.I thought he would be coasting, it turned out he\u2019s working hard. It was a little unexpected.\u201cDo you not have any extra keys?\u201d\u201cThe study is an important place. So, for security reasons, only one key was made. If it is lost, we have to change the lock.\u201dThat meant I had to get the key from Philen if I wanted to go to the study.What should I do?If nothing happened yesterday, I would have gone to him. But that\u2019s not the case so I agonized about it. It was uncomfortable to meet him.\u201cIs the Duke in his study now?\u201d\u201cNo. He\u2019s still asleep.\u201dThen I don\u2019t want to go see him anymore. Because Cecily is in his room.After agonizing about it, I finally decided not to go.The desire to not meet Cecily and Philen was greater than the desire to read a book.I couldn\u2019t read a book, so I was contemplating what to do with the rest of my free time, but then a maid came to me with a magic communication tool.\u201cMy Lady, Aide Tail Wizard has contacted you.\u201dThe reason why Baron Wizard contacted me could be roughly guessed without hearing it. I was sure he\u2019s asking about the rainy season.I had given all of it to Philen, so it was right to tell her to take the magic tool to him, but I didn\u2019t.My guess could be wrong. So I thought it would be better to hear what was going on and decide.I accepted the magic tool from the maid.As I lightly rubbed the communication tool, Baron Wizard\u2019s face appeared.[It\u2019s been a while, My Lady.]\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Baron Wizard. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d[I\u2019m contacting you to ask about the rainy season.]It was as expected. I sighed lightly and answered.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it was out of my hands.\u201d[Yes? What do you mean\u2026]\u201cThe Duke took it with him. From now on, the Duke will take care of everything in the mansion himself.\u201dAt my words, Baron Wizard\u2019s look became subtle. It wasn\u2019t a very pleasing look.\u201cNow that that\u2019s the case, you should contact the Duke directly.\u201dIt didn\u2019t change whether he liked it or not.This was also right. It was unusual for me to handle the affairs of the Duke of Williot.\u2026was it really unusual?[If the matter has been passed on to the Duke, it may take a long time to process. Because the Duke is still inexperienced in this work.]Baron Wizard, who was silent for a moment, spoke in a sigh.[I don\u2019t know about anything else, but I need your approval for the rainy season as soon as possible\u2026 Can\u2019t you be in charge of only this matter?]\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s for me to decide, Baron Wizard.\u201d[That\u2019s true.]Baron Wizard\u2019s expression clouded.After rubbing his face with his hands, the baron asked me carefully.[Could you please check how far the Duke has progressed?]\u201cIsn\u2019t it better to check it yourself?\u201d[I want to do that, but unfortunately, the time for the magic communication tool has run out.]Come to think of it, Baron Wizard\u2019s face looks blurry from some point on.Magic communication tool is a magic tool that uses magical power. It takes two days of charging to use it for 10 minutes.[So please, My Lady. And if possible, please send the document here by today. So that we can prepare before the rainy season arrives\u2026.]Before Baron Wizard\u2019s words could be finished, the magic communication tool was turned off.It couldn\u2019t be helped. I had no choice but to go check it myself.I didn\u2019t want to meet Philen, but I couldn\u2019t let my personal feelings prevent me from doing what I had to do.For a moment I wondered if this was the right thing to do, but I didn\u2019t give it much thought.Now that I was meeting Philen, I was going to get the key to the study.I headed straight to Philen\u2019s room, took a few deep breaths, and then knocked on the door carefully.Tok, tok.The knocking sound was unusually loud.Even though it was late in the morning, there was no answer as to whether he was still sleeping.I\u2019ll knock one more time and if there\u2019s no answer, I\u2019ll come back later.I knocked again, and this time the door opened, whether it was fortunate or unfortunate.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dIt was Cecily. She wore only a shawl over a thin nightgown.The exposed nape of her neck showed red spots. Her skin was white, so the red spots stood out.And the glistening blue jewel above them, I felt its quality.Did she wear a necklace when she slept? It\u2019s unusual.\u201cThe Duke?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still sleeping. He overworked himself a little last night.\u201dCecily said so and stroked the nape of her neck.I frowned at the obvious intentional behavior, but I didn\u2019t say anything.I would be the only one who would get tired if she told Philen again.I didn\u2019t want to waste unnecessary emotions anymore.\u201cWhen does he wake up?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that based on Phil\u2019s mood?\u201dCecily snapped with a vicious look. The wariness was evident on her face.She seemed to have decided to take off her mask and threw it away when talking to me.Well, it didn\u2019t really matter. This was much better than putting on a nice mask and pretending to be kind.\u201cThen, when the Duke wakes up, let him know that I have come. Tell him I want to meet him.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do that.\u201dSuddenly, Philen appeared behind Cecily.As soon as she saw Philen, she put on a nice mask.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Lady Thebesa?\u201d He asked, looking at me with sleepy eyes.\u201cAre you here to apologize for yesterday?\u201dApologize. I smiled a little and looked at Philen.\u201cDo I owe you an apology, Duke?\u201dAt my words, Philen woke up and looked at me with quiet eyes.I looked him in the eye and told him why I was here.\u201cI\u2019ve got a contact from Baron Wizard. Not knowing that I had handed everything to the Duke yet, he contacted me.\u201d\u201cBaron Wizard? For what business?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the rainy season preparation. As the Duke knows, the rainy season is approaching, so he asked you to send him the approved document quickly so that they could prepare it.\u201d\u201cAh, that.\u201dAs he nodded his head as if he understood, he seemed to have read the document.I guessed he didn\u2019t play with that woman all night.I felt like an idiot just because I was glad about that.\u201cI was actually going to review it, and approve it, then send it to the estate today. So I\u2019m asking you, Lady. May I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cPlease ask, Duke.\u201d\u201cIs the Lady the one who wrote the document? Or is it the aide?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re asking the first person who wrote the document, it\u2019s the aide.\u201d\u201cThen, did the Lady finish reading the document?\u201dHe\u2019s asking what\u2019s obvious.I nodded.\u201cHa.\u201dPhilen laughed and looked at me.Why is he like that?Are there any problems with the document?There\u2019s no way. I had corrected all the wrong parts.The document handed to him was the final document that was left for only final review.\u201cIs there something wrong with the document?\u201dI asked him carefully, wondering if he discovered a problem I hadn\u2019t noticed, but Philen turned around, shrugging lightly.\u201cThere is, but I won\u2019t tell the Lady. It has nothing to do with the Lady now. I don\u2019t even need any help from the Lady.\u201dDon\u2019t even need my help, huh?\u201cSo in the future, I hope that there will be no conversations like this with the Lady. Let\u2019s go in, Cecily.\u201dPhilen was cold like a frost breeze to me but warm like a spring breeze to Cecily.Cecily, conceited of that fact, entered the room arm in arm with Philen.I was well aware that Philen liked and cherished Cecily more than me, but it was shocking every time I saw it.I stood there for a long time like a third wheel. Then I realized one thing later.It was a very minor thing that didn\u2019t fit the current situation. The fact that I couldn\u2019t ask him for the key to the study.*****\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dVer, who came to report to Kalian, glanced at what Kalian was looking at.\u201cHandkerchief.\u201dIt was also a handkerchief engraved with the crest of the Duke of Williot.Why is he holding that?Looking at him in wonder, Kalian smiled and held out the handkerchief.\u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty?\u201d\u201cSorry. Pretty?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, has your eyesight deteriorated? Should I get you glasses?\u201dVer indirectly expressed that the handkerchief was bad.Then Kalian, who\u2019s sensitive at his remarks, kicked Ver\u2019s desk.As the papers piled up on the desk poured down, Ver screamed.\u201cWhat, what are you doing?!\u201dKalian replied in a sassy tone.\u201cAs you said, my eyesight deteriorated and I couldn\u2019t see, why?\u201dLie! You did it on purpose!Since his opponent was the emperor, Ver couldn\u2019t say that and just swallowed his anger inside.\u201cHow\u2019s your test preparation going?\u201d\u201cI have something to ask you about that.\u201dVer picked up some of the papers that were scattered on the floor and held them out to Kalian.\u201cWill it do if the level of difficulty is like this?\u201dAfter checking the papers that Ver handed over, Callian twisted his lips.\u201cAre you kidding me? Are you going to pick only the idiots one?\u201d\u201c\u2026this is difficult, too.\u201d\u201cYeah, right. I bet it is.\u201dKalian answered firmly and tore the papers.No. The questions that scholars have worked hard day and night for days\u2026!Although Ver was in despair, Kalian tore the papers into shreds without hesitation and threw them into the air.The torn pieces of paper fluttered like snow.\u201cMake it again. Ten times more difficult than it is now.\u201d\u201cTen times?!\u201dVer was enervated and looked at Kalian.\u201cDo you really have any intention of hiring an aide?\u201cOf course.\u201dKalian smiled with his eyes sparkled.\u201cI\u2019ve already had someone in my mind. Of course, it will be decided after the test is taken.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPhilen said he didn\u2019t want to talk to me about work, but if he didn\u2019t send the document today, I was thinking of going back to him.I couldn\u2019t help it. Otherwise, the preparation for the rainy season would be delayed and the people would suffer.I couldn\u2019t let it happen just because of my private quarrel with Philen.Fortunately, Philen sent the document to the estate late in the afternoon.After hearing the news from the butler, I was relieved and put my mind at ease.Other than that, there was nothing urgent.Of course, there\u2019s always a lot of work to be done, but I decided not to care if Philen was dealing with it or fooling around with Cecily.Because I really thought it would be good to get my hands off now.I didn\u2019t know about the Duchess\u2019s, but I decided that it would be better in many ways not to intervene in the Duke\u2019s affairs now that Philen had returned.It was that evening when Philen returned the key to the study to the butler.The butler got the key to the study. He remembered and brought it to me right away.Thanks to him, I was able to spend my free time reading books.What I had read was [The Welfare Trends of the Continent]\u201cThis is an interesting book!\u201dThen, it was a book that had a significant title on its cover. [Do Not Break the Red Rose].What book is it?I opened the book out of curiosity and quickly closed it after reading an unfamiliar love affair scene.I only read a few sentences, but my face was burning up.Sarah laughed out loud at me.\u201cWhat are you so ashamed of when you\u2019re a grown-up, My Lady?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2026\u201dI was embarrassed and couldn\u2019t get the words out. I hurriedly gave the book to Sarah.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in books like this, so take it back.\u201d\u201cCome on, keep reading and you will change your mind.\u201d\u201cFo, forget it. I won\u2019t read it. Go take it back.\u201dSarah clicked her tongue in regret and took the book.I opened another book as I tried to soothe my blushing face.In this thick book, the philosophy of the famous philosopher, Sestein, was written in an easy-to-understand manner.It was a famous saying that gave useful and very important advice altogether.I wanted to keep it deep in my head, but I couldn\u2019t because of the terrible book Sarah brought.The sentences that I read briefly popped into my head.[Sessie kissed the lips of her beloved lover. He groped her chest, lowered his hand a little more\u2026]Tak-I closed the book aloud.As I didn\u2019t look at the text, the thoughts that had been disturbing my head disappeared.I guess I\u2019ll have to give up reading here.Then what should I do? It was too early to go to sleep. Because it was still noon now.As I was contemplating what to do, the invitation to the tea party on the table caught my eyes.After the banquet, the nobles sent me invitations every day.They were persistent even though I refused several times.There were even cases where they came to ask for me to come, saying \u2018even once is fine.\u2019 They wouldn\u2019t be able to get anything from me though.I sighed deeply and checked the invitations. When I found an invitation with a blue-violet crest on it, I stopped.Blue-violet. It was the crest of Count Bzantine.Count Bzantine couldn\u2019t have invited me, so that meant Sophia, that woman invited me.Why would this woman invite me?I stared at the invitation and pondered over it, but no matter how much I thought about it, there was only one thing that I could think of.She\u2019s trying to avenge what happened at the banquet.Otherwise, this woman wouldn\u2019t have invited me.You\u2019re doing something ridiculous, Sophia.I tore the invitation in two, laughing softly.As I was checking the other invitations, Sarah, who had gone out, came into the room with a slightly refreshed face.\u201cMy Lady, have you heard the news?\u201dI answered with my eyes fixed on the invitations.\u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is hiring a new aide!\u201dHearing those words, I suddenly remembered the conversation I had with Kalian before.\u201cDo you have any plans to become an official?\u201d\u201cIf the Lady had the opportunity to become an official, would you take it?\u201d\u201cThe answer, please don\u2019t forget it. Lady Leila Thebesa.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, because of me\u2026\u201d\u201cYes? What did you say, My Lady?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201dI put down the invitations I was looking at and looked at Sarah.\u201cSo, there\u2019s an announcement about hiring an aide?\u201d\u201cYes! In addition, they wrote in large letters in the official notice saying that this time they\u2019re also hiring women! Because of it, everyone\u2019s going crazy!\u201dAlthough it was never explicitly stated that women wouldn\u2019t be picked for the official test of the Empire, it was the first time such a clear statement was made.\u2026I think it\u2019s because of me, too.Even if it wasn\u2019t because of me, it didn\u2019t matter.The important thing was that I had the opportunity to become an official.Besides, I liked the fact that I had to take a test rather than special recruitment.If Kalian had chosen me as a special recruit, I would have hesitated to become an official. Because there would be a lot of rumors around.But then, it wasn\u2019t just a test. If it was to compete fairly with others, I would agree all the way.So let\u2019s do it. I made a promise to him, and it\u2019s not polite to throw it away when he gave me the chance.\u201cSarah, please investigate the official notice in detail.\u201d*****The test date was about a month later.There were a total of seven subjects, including administration, tax law, politics, and welfare.I was a little surprised because there were more subjects than I expected, but I fully understood.The emperor\u2019s aide was the closest to the emperor and was an important position involved in politics as well as various administrations.I had to be that capable. It wasn\u2019t a place for an idiot.Can I challenge myself to such a position?I was worried that instead of passing the test after trying for no reason, I would be ridiculed.I had no intention of giving up though.\u201cSarah, get ready to go out.\u201dI went to the largest bookstore in the capital with Sarah.Sarah, who was happy when she heard that we were going out, looked gloomy at the bookstore.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026 like My Lady.\u201dSarah murmured and asked me carefully.\u201cAre you going to go back to the mansion after visiting the bookstore?\u201d\u201cWhy? Is there a place you want to go?\u201d\u201cN, no. It\u2019s not really like that, but since we\u2019re out, take a look around the capital\u2026\u201dIt was cute to see her squirming with her eyes rolling. If I had a younger sister, it would feel like this.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look around the capital on our way back.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dOnly then did Sarah smile brightly and nodded her head.The bookstore was crowded with people, perhaps because of the official announcement that they would hire an aide.\u201cMy Lady, tell me what book you want and I\u2019ll bring it.\u201d\u201cNo need. I\u2019ll pick by myself.\u201dI squeezed through the crowd and stood in front of a bookshelf with books related to politics.As it was a bookstore in the capital, there were many books.Which one should I read? I will take out the book that stands out the most.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to study politics, you should read this.\u201dSomeone from behind pulled out the book that was right next to the book I had chosen.\u201cThis one is more organized than that.\u201dIt was a familiar voice. No way. I turned my head and looked back.Blue hair that resembled the sea and a beautiful appearance.\u201cYour\u2026!\u201d\u201cShh.\u201dKalian put his index finger on my lips.\u201cNo such title outside.\u201dAh, I see. If I call him \u2018Your Majesty\u2019 here, it will attract attention. That was something I didn\u2019t want either.I nodded to signify that I understood, then he pulled out his hand and stepped back.\u201cI saw you when I was passing by here.\u201dKalian smiled brightly and held out the book he had just taken out.[Introduction to Cauldron\u2019s politics].It was a familiar title.\u201cThank you for your recommendation, but I have already read this book.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dKalian tilted his head slightly and pulled another book out of the bookshelf.\u201cHave you read this too?\u201d\u201cYes. I have read this.\u201d\u201cThen how about this one?\u201dTo the point where I wondered if he had researched what I had read beforehand, he pulled out only the books I had read before.When I replied that I had read the fifth book he pulled out, he asked me with a stern face.\u201cTell me about Cauldron\u2019s political ideology.\u201d\u201cWhat did Plant say?\u201d\u201cWhat about Anon?\u201dI was a bit startled by the pouring questions, but I answered them completely as I knew them.\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026\u201dAfter completing all the questions, Kalian burst into small laughter and swept his hair up.\u201cI think I should raise the difficulty of the test a little more.\u201d\u2026hmm? What does he mean?\u201cIt seems to me that you don\u2019t need to study politics anymore. Because this is enough.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can assure you. Your politics will pass without a hitch.\u201dIt was as if he knew I was going to take the official test.It was true, but I was a bit startled that he took it for granted without any doubt. Because some people didn\u2019t usually think so.No matter how many times you promised, a woman taking the official test\u2026\u201cWhat are you thinking so hard about?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe I was thinking about something else before the Emperor.\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry. Your\u2026\u201dWait, he told me not to call him \u2018Your Majesty\u2019.Fortunately, I realized before I made the mistake and shut my mouth.What should I call him if I can\u2019t call him \u2018Your Majesty\u2019?Should I call his name? No way.How dare I call the Emperor\u2019s name.I\u2019ve called his name dozens of times in my head, but it\u2019s possible because it\u2019s only in my thoughts.A thought that should never come out of my mouth.It was the same with the fact that I couldn\u2019t do it on the outside while inside I swore at Philen countless times.So, should I just call him the Lord?I was looking for a suitable title, and perhaps he noticed my concern, he said, \u201cYou can call me Carl.\u201dI was contemplating what to call him, so there was no reason to refuse.\u201cYes, Mr. Carl.\u201dI accepted it, but he frowned slightly as if something was not to his liking.\u201cWhy do you call me\u2026 \u2018Mr.\u2019?\u201dI thought it should be like that, so I blurted out the title, and he laughed.\u201cYou\u2019re removing unnecessary things.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Are you going to look for another book?\u201d\u201cYes. I was going to look for all the books on test subjects.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re studying hard.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because there are so many shortcomings.\u201d\u201cHumble, too.\u201dHe looked proud as if he liked my answer.\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can do it by myself.\u201dThis time, he looked at me as if he was hurt.\u201cWhat a really sharp refusal.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying this because I can really do it alone.\u201dGetting a view on politics was a privilege that no one else had.If I accepted his help here, it would be an unfair evaluation, so I politely rejected Kalian\u2019s help.\u201cReally? Then there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dHe clicked his tongue as if it was a shame and stepped back neatly.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you next time.\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Carl. See you next time.\u201dAfter a clich\u00e9 and polite greeting, I walked to the bookshelf with books on tax.*****Kalian said I didn\u2019t need to study politics anymore, but just in case, I bought some books I hadn\u2019t read that looked good.In addition, I bought more than 10 books on other subjects.Sarah looked at the books I had picked with her eyes widened in astonishment.\u201cAre you really going to buy all of this?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dIf I wasn\u2019t going to buy them, I wouldn\u2019t have picked them.After I paid the bill, I asked the staff to deliver it to the Duke of Williot.\u201cWhere are we going now, My Lady?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dI made a promise to Sarah, so I guessed we would take a look around the capital. Where should we go?After thinking for a while, I decided on my destination.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Handwork Street.\u201dThere were a lot of shops selling women\u2019s favorite accessories along that street.\u201cAh, really?\u201dI thought Sarah would like it, and it was as expected.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get the carriage right away!\u201d\u201cNo need. It\u2019s not that far from here, so let\u2019s just walk.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, too!\u201dThen, I headed down the street with Sarah.There were many street vendors on the street and there seemed to be more street vendors than before.It meant that the empire, which had been chaotic by war, was entering a stable period.As a noble of the Empire, it was a pleasure for me.The street vendors caught the attention of passersby with their fancy and unique goods.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd one thing that caught my attention was the Emperor, Kalian.Although he was wearing plain clothes, his appearance was so noticeable that he drew people\u2019s attention.People of all ages, regardless of gender, passed by and looked at him at least once.I was one of them.I never thought I would see him again in a place like this after we parted ways at the bookstore.It was a little weird to see the emperor so often when people could hardly see him even if they visited the Imperial Palace.What should I do, should I say hello?He didn\u2019t see me, so I could just pass by, but I thought it would be better to say hello just in case.I walked right behind Kalian.He\u2019s still looking at something without noticing I was here.What is he looking at?Curious, I tiptoed and looked over Kalian\u2019s shoulder to see what he was looking at.What he was looking at was a yellow seed.I have seen this seed before. Where did I see it?As I was looking back on my memories, the merchant raised his voice and gave a passionate explanation to Kalian.\u201cThis seed is the seed of a crop that can be planted in the rainy season without any problems. Rather, it grows more rapidly during the rainy season.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhen Kalian showed interest, the merchant nodded enthusiastically.\u201cDidn\u2019t they say the rainy season is coming to the Empire soon? If you\u2019re in an area that suffers a lot from the rainy season every year, take this seed and plant it! There will be no concern of bad harvests.\u201dAh, I was wondering where I saw it, I saw it then.At the merchant\u2019s words, I remembered buying that seed in bulk about five years ago.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll buy it.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t buy it, Mr. Carl.\u201dWhen Kalian tried to buy the seed, I hurriedly stopped him.Only then did Kalian notice that I was here. He looked back at me, slightly startled.\u201cSince when have you been here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been here since that merchant started lying.\u201d\u201cLying? What are you talking about, Miss?\u201dWhen the merchant looked at me as if he was hurt, I smiled.\u201cQuilt.\u201dI said the name of the seed.At my words, the merchant opened his eyes with great surprise.As expected, that seed was the seed of the Quilt.However, \u2018can be planted in the rainy season without any problems\u2019.There\u2019s a degree of lying, and this was already a scam.I explained the Quilt to Kalian, who almost got scammed.\u201cQuilts are mainly grown and eaten by nomads in the desert at the eastern edge. In other words, this merchant is lying when he says it can be planted in the rainy season without any problems.\u201d\u201cHmm, really?\u201dKalian looked at the merchant without hiding his discomfort.When the lie was revealed, the merchant couldn\u2019t look straight into Kalian\u2019s eyes and kept coughing.\u201cEhem, ehem. I, I must have explained the crop description wrong. I\u2019m new to the seed business.\u201dYou sell so many seeds when you\u2019re new in the seed business?Such a completely unreliable excuse.\u201cI, I guess I should study more about seeds.\u201dThe man made ridiculous excuses for a long time before he grabbed his bag.There weren\u2019t many things spread on the stand, so he quickly packed up.\u201cAh, this seed is a gift of apology for my mistake, so just take it! Then, bye!\u201dThe merchant picked up his bag and quickly disappeared.\u201cHe\u2019s a scammer, don\u2019t you think we should go catch him?\u201d\u201cAlready gone.\u201dAlready gone to catch him? Who\u2019s gone?I looked around in bewilderment, but no one stood out.\u201cThere\u2019s no use looking around. You can\u2019t find them, My Lady.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYeah. If the Lady sees them, they\u2019ll have to take their clothes off.\u201d\u201cThen I shouldn\u2019t look for them.\u201dWhen I said it in the sense that it wasn\u2019t that I couldn\u2019t find them, it\u2019s that I didn\u2019t look for them, Kalian laughed.\u201cBy the way, I knew the Lady is smart, but I didn\u2019t know you knew much about crops.\u201dThe blue eyes that looked at me gleamed with interest.\u201cYou surprise me in many ways.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s thin knowledge. It\u2019s not enough to surprise Mr. Carl.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s thin knowledge, what am I to not recognize that this seed is Quilt?\u201dAh, I didn\u2019t mean it that way.As I looked down in fluster, Kalian smiled slightly and waved his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, so you don\u2019t have to be so flustered.\u201d\u201c\u2026if I offended you, I apologize.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really okay. In that sense.\u201dKalian put the pouch of Quilt seed in my hand.\u201cI\u2019ll give it to you. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m looking for, and I think the Lady will use this seed better than me.\u201dI too didn\u2019t need the seed, but I accepted it because it wasn\u2019t polite to refuse.\u201cAre you looking for any seeds?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah.\u201dKalian\u2019s lips tilted obliquely. His eyes sparkled somewhat frighteningly.\u201cThere\u2019s a plant I really want to find.\u201dI didn\u2019t know what plant Kalian was looking for, but looking at his expression, it didn\u2019t seem like he was looking for it for something good.In this case, it\u2019s usually poison.If he\u2019s really looking for poison, what is he going to use it for?I was curious, but I decided not to ask.I thought I shouldn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t want to waste my energy because it was obvious that if I asked a question, I wouldn\u2019t get an answer.\u201cI see.\u201dI nodded and Kalian looked at me with strange eyes.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dIt was already the second goodbye today.\u201cMy Lady.\u201dAs I was about to say goodbye politely and leave, Kalian called me.\u201cWhere are you going now?\u201d\u201cI was on my way to Handwork street.\u201d\u201cThen can you give me a little of your time before you go?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind, but\u2026 may I ask why?\u201d\u201cI need your help.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even need any help from the Lady.\u201dPhilen said he doesn\u2019t need my help, but he says he needs my help.As my wounded heart healed, I was filled with joy.It was such a pleasure to be of help to someone.I smiled brightly and answered vigorously.\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help you!\u201d*****\u201cI\u2019d be happy to help you!\u201dHe asked for help, but Leila smiled with a sparkle in her eyes.Deep dimples were dug under her lips that rose smoothly in line.He already knew she had a pretty smile, but seeing it this way was even prettier.Especially her cheeks, which were as red as an apple, were very lovely.Kalian held her hand, barely suppressing the urge to touch her cheek for a moment.Holding her hand was also somewhat impulsive.\u201cThen shall we go?\u201dLeila opened her eyes wide as if surprised by the sudden contact but still followed Kalian\u2019s lead.Seeing Leila like this, Kalian didn\u2019t like her attitude.Fearlessly following the lead of a stranger.What if something happens to you?Leila said she could protect herself. She was carrying a pretty helpful self-defense weapon, but\u2026 it was something you never knew.Someone who was immune to poison like himself could attack.They might try to do something weird after making her guard down.Damn it, no matter how I think about it, she\u2019s too defenseless.Kalian stopped walking and looked at Leila with a displeased look.\u201cIs the Lady originally this defenseless?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some usually ask questions, you know?\u201d\u201cAh, weren\u2019t we going to Greenery street?\u201dGreenery street was a place where shops selling all kinds of goods related to nature, such as seeds, trees, and flowers, were gathered.Kalian asked, slightly surprised as if Leila saw through his mind.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cYou said you were looking for plants. So, of course, I thought we would go to Greenery street.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dKalian, who tried to provoke her, nodded bitterly.Kalian took a step that had stopped. Leila followed him and said in a low voice.\u201cI hope you find what you\u2019re looking for there.\u201dKalian responded bluntly without looking back at Leila.\u201cWhat would you say if I used it for something bad? For example, I use it to kill someone.\u201dLeila, who was silent for a moment at the eerie words, replied in a still calm voice.\u201cIf it\u2019s Mr. Carl, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reason for that.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean you trust me?\u201dKalian stopped walking again and looked back at her.The serene black eyes and the confused blue eyes met in the air.\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt was great disloyalty for the nobles not to trust their emperor.So she had to trust him, and even if she didn\u2019t, it was the right thing to say in front of him.Of course, Leila trusted Kalian.Not only because he was an emperor, but she found out that Kalian was a good person after a few conversations.If he were a bad person, he wouldn\u2019t have saved her and the girl from that rude.He wouldn\u2019t have comforted her by talking to her, who was crying under the tree.He also opened the way for me to become an official.She received so much help, so there\u2019s no doubting him.This might change depending on how he ruled the Empire in the future, but so far,\u201cI trust Mr. Carl.\u201dA calm smile was drawn on her lips with an honest, plain answer and with no technique at all.That\u2019s not awkward at all. It was a normal smile, but for some reason, Kalian turned his head, slightly frowning.Leila didn\u2019t know that his face had turned slightly red because of that.Even Kalian himself.******The first time I learned about Quilts was about five years ago when there was a famine in our territory and others.Since last year, I was worried because the precipitation had gradually decreased, but as expected, a terrible drought came that year.Thanks to the pre-storage of grain, I could somehow get through that year, but the future was a problem.If the drought continued next year, or maybe even after that, there would be no countermeasures for that, so I searched through all kinds of books to find a way to prepare.That\u2019s when I found the Quilt.An amazing crop that grows well even in desert areas with little rain.I was going to import the Quilts right away, but Muran, a desert country at the time, was at war with the Empire, so I couldn\u2019t import them through the official route.All I got was a little bit from the refugee nomads.So I constantly researched and pondered what other plants could be other than Quilts.So, although I knew more about plants than other people, I wasn\u2019t at the level to help other people.I was excited to help, but what if he found out about my lack of knowledge?I was worried, but fortunately, he asked questions to the best of my knowledge. And I answered him with the utmost sincerity.Every time I answered, Kalian looked at me with interest.His gaze was burdensome, so I smiled awkwardly and turned my head.Then I found a necklace inside a luxurious glass box.A necklace with a blue jewel on a chain made of platinum without any special decorations was familiar.Where did I see it? Did I see someone wearing it at the party?I was staring at the necklace while looking back on my memories, and Kalian, who was talking to the store clerk, asked me.\u201cIs there anything you like?\u201d\u201cNo. There isn\u2019t.\u201dI immediately drew my attention, but Kalian, who noticed that I was looking at the blue necklace, gestured to the store clerk.\u201cI want to see that necklace.\u201d\u201cAs expected, you have an excellent eye for your precious people!\u201dThe store clerk quickly brought the glass box with the necklace along with flattery.\u201cAs for this necklace, it is not an ordinary necklace, but a magic necklace made of spirit stone!\u201dSpirit stone is naturally a jewel with magical power, and because it is so rare, it is several times more expensive than magic stones artificially made by wizards.Apparently, I heard that a spirit stone the size of a little fingernail is worth the price of a mansion.Kalian, who was paying close attention to the spirit stone, asked.\u201cWhat ability does this spirit stone have?\u201d\u201cI will show you. Conversion!\u201dThe necklace sparkled when the employee picked it up and shouted the starter word.What will happen?I looked forward to it, but nothing happened. There was a serious silence in the store.\u201cNothing\u2019s happening.\u201dWhen Kalian said bitterly, the employee smiled triumphantly and held out his left arm.\u201cOh?\u201dIt was then that I opened my eyes wide in surprise when I discovered that the employee\u2019s left arm had turned as bumpy as the orc\u2019s arm.Kalian also looked at the employee\u2019s arm with a slightly surprised look.Seeing the expressions of me and Kalian, the employee smiled proudly and shook his arm.\u201cAs you can see, this necklace can transform any part of your body to your liking. Release.\u201dWhen the employee shouted the starter word again, his arm returned to normal.\u201cWhat do you think? Great ability, isn\u2019t it?\u201dThat\u2019s\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s a useless ability.\u201dI glanced sideways at Kalian as he spoke what I was thinking.The employee was sullen and drooped his shoulders.\u201cI think it\u2019s a great ability\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useless.\u201dWhen Kalian confirmed it once again, the employee became even sadder.It\u2019s a useless ability, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to say that.I smiled awkwardly and comforted the depressed employee.\u201cStill, because it\u2019s a spirit stone, the jewel is so pretty.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dAt my words, the employee looked at me with a bright face.\u201cIf it were a magic stone, it wouldn\u2019t have been able to produce such a subtle color, but as expected, the spirit stone~.\u201d\u201cYou want it?\u201dKalian cut the employee\u2019s words abruptly and asked me.I shook my head firmly.\u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201dMy answer made the employee sullen again, but I couldn\u2019t help it.If I said yes, I thought Kalian would really buy it for me.Even if it was someone else\u2019s money, I didn\u2019t want to spend money on things I didn\u2019t need.Where would I use that magic anyway?And the reason I looked at that necklace in the first place wasn\u2019t because I was interested in it, but because it was strangely familiar.However, I still couldn\u2019t remember where I saw it.If I couldn\u2019t remember, it\u2019s probably not important.I didn\u2019t think much of it and looked back at Kalian.\u201cDid you find what you are looking for?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dIf we couldn\u2019t find it in the biggest store on the greenery street, the other stores wouldn\u2019t have it either.\u201cThat\u2019s it for today.\u201dKalian also thought so, and he said that we should part ways here.\u201cThank you for your time. I\u2019ll remember what happened today and pay you back next time.\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m just glad to have been of any help to you.\u201dSo, when I was about to say \u2018I\u2019ll see you next time\u2019, Kalian held out a box.Inside the box was a necklace with the blue jewel that I saw earlier.When did he buy this?No, more than that, why would he\u2026As I looked at him in bewilderment, Kalian said with a bright smile.\u201cThis is a gift in return for your help today, so please accept it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t find what he was looking for, but I got such a great reward for lending him a little bit of my insignificant knowledge.It was more than I deserved. I was bewildered and waved my hand.\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an Imperial order.\u201dA modest refusal was hampered by abuse of power.It\u2019s an Imperial order, how could I refuse it?\u201cThank\u2026you.\u201dI received the gift from Kalian.Kalian smiled contentedly.\u201cIt\u2019s better than hearing you say \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 or \u2018it\u2019s okay\u2019. From now on, just say thank you to everything I say.\u201dWhat a ridiculous request. How can I say thank you to everything you say?\u201c\u2026is this also an Imperial order?\u201d I asked carefully.If it\u2019s an Imperial order, then I should follow it.\u201cUm, no.\u201dAfter pondering for a moment, Kalian replied refreshingly.\u201cIt is a request.\u201dWhether it was an Imperial order or a request, their weight was the same for me.I nodded resolutely.\u201cThank you.\u201d*****She\u2019s doing exactly what I told her to do.Kalian looked at Leila, smiling inwardly.After the former Duke and Duchess of Williot died, he thought she was an impregnable woman because it was said that she was the timber that supported the precarious the Duke of Williot, but it turned out she wasn\u2019t.She was a naive, sentimental woman. She was also soft-hearted.And at the moment when she had to step forward, it was amazing that she stood up straight without being shaken.He was curious what else she would show him in the future.She was pretty when she smiled too.\u201cMy Lord.\u201dKalian, who was looking at Leila, turned around when someone called him from behind.One of his loyal escort knights bowed politely and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to go back.\u201dIt\u2019s time already?Kalian glanced at the sky reddened by the sunset and looked at Leila again.Leila looked slightly surprised, looking at the escort knight behind Kalian.\u201cWhy do you look so surprised?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2026 Should I say thank you for this too?\u201d\u201cWhat? Haha.\u201dAt the question asked carefully, Kalian grabbed his stomach and laughed out loud.Leila looked at Kalian with a blank look on her face.She has a dense side, too.Somehow, Kalian wanted to tease her, so he replied with a mischievous look.\u201cIf so?\u201dLeila was baffled by Kalian\u2019s answer and rolled her eyes.Her mouth that contained the words she wanted to say, moved slightly to the word \u2018thank you\u2019 repeatedly.Seeing her like that made him want to tease her more.\u201cMy Lord.\u201dHowever, Kalian\u2019s wish was thwarted by his escort knight\u2019s urging.Tsk, Kalian clicked his tongue and waved his hand.\u201cI\u2019m joking. I\u2019ll take back the one I told you to say thank you to everything I say.\u201d\u201cAh, yes!\u201dOnly then did Leila answer vigorously with a bright face.Rather than pretty, her face was elegant and graceful.She was by no means an eye-catching splendid beauty.But strangely enough, he kept looking at her.Is it out of curiosity?Kalian tilted his head and turned around at the unfamiliar thing.And for some reason, he dawdlingly took a regretful step.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019ve seen enough today.\u201d\u201cYou only saw Greenery street.\u201d\u201cCome on, I saw a lot of things there. More than that, I have a question for you, My Lady.\u201d\u201cYeah, ask me.\u201d\u201cThe Lord I saw earlier, does he have a higher status than you, My Lady?\u201dCome to think of it, Sarah doesn\u2019t know who he is yet.\u201cHe\u2019s the Emperor.\u201dThere was nothing to hide, so I answered honestly.At my words, Sarah, who was nodding her head saying \u2018I see\u2019, responded late and opened her mouth wide.\u201cYes? The, the Emperor? He, he\u2019s the Emperor!?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWh, wh, wh, why the Emperor\u2026\u201dIs this such a shocking fact to make her tremble like that?\u201cCalm down, Sarah.\u201d\u201cHow, how can I calm down! I saw the Slaughter Emperor right in front of my eyes!\u201d\u201cSarah.\u201dWhen I sternly called her name, Sarah shut her mouth and bowed her head.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, My Lady. I was too surprised\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Watch your mouth next time. You could be accused of blasphemy for contempt of the Imperial family.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. I will keep that in mind.\u201dSarah nodded with a tense look on her face. I patted her on the shoulder to make her relax.The Slaughter Emperor.What Sarah said lingered in my head.It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t know that the current emperor was called the Slaughter Emperor.I had nothing to do with the emperor, so I just forgot about it for a while.And I couldn\u2019t think of Kalian because he was so much more pleasant and nice than I thought.But it was all true. Kalian killed his father and his blood relatives and became emperor.I understood his actions because he would have been killed if he hadn\u2019t killed them.He was accused of killing his younger half-brothers and the empresses who begged for their lives.That was why he was called the Slaughter Emperor.\u2026he doesn\u2019t look like that though, but I don\u2019t know the truth.I abruptly lifted the necklace that Kalian gave me.The blue jewel on the platinum chain sparkled brilliantly.The necklace\u2019s ability was useless, but it was pretty enough to play a great role even as a simple accessory.\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty necklace.\u201dSarah\u2019s eyes glistened as she thought so too.\u201cIs the jewel a sapphire?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s a spirit stone.\u201d\u201cOh, my God, a spirit stone! As expected, because he is the Emperor, the standard of gifts is really different!\u201dIs that so? I\u2019ve never really thought of it like that.It was just burdensome to receive such an expensive gift. It kept bothering me that I couldn\u2019t refuse because it was an Imperial order.I must make it up to him next time.Otherwise, I won\u2019t feel comfortable.I put the necklace back into the box with a firm resolve.After a while, the carriage arrived at the mansion.Leaving Sarah, who\u2019s paying for the carriage, I went into the mansion first and stopped when I saw the boxes lined up on one side of the hall.At first glance, there were more than 20 boxes.Considering that the servants diligently moved, it meant that there were more than that.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201dThe butler, who checked the box and gave the servants various instructions, answered politely.\u201cIt was purchased by the young lady.\u201dCecily, you\u2019re calling that woman \u2018young lady\u2019?I understood that he couldn\u2019t call her recklessly because she\u2019s a woman who had Philen\u2019s child, but I didn\u2019t like the title \u2018young lady\u2019. Because she and I seemed to be treated the same way.I felt terribly bad.But it\u2019s not wrong either. So if I pointed it out for no reason and it got into Philen\u2019s ear, it would be a headache, that\u2019s why I let it go.It was also because I was more concerned about what was in front of me.\u201cDid she buy all these? Didn\u2019t you buy the things that the Duke needed?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dOh, my God. What did she need so much that she bought so many?When I prepared to attend the Emperor\u2019s coronation party, there were fewer boxes than this. And they were a share for both me and Philen.However, Cecily bought so many things for herself.I opened the big box nearest to me.There was a pretty dress inside the box.A dress with a tight waist design that wasn\u2019t suitable for pregnant women.Another large box also contained a dress that looked difficult for pregnant women to wear.I understood she ordered dresses because she didn\u2019t have clothes to wear, but why did she buy dresses that she couldn\u2019t even wear now?I frowned and opened the other boxes.Small boxes contained shoes, bags, and hats.Smaller boxes contained jewelry such as necklaces and rings. And the big jewels looked expensive even at a glance.How much did she spend?Curious, I asked the butler for a receipt.\u201cI want to see the receipt.\u201d\u201cHere it is.\u201dI read through the list of items on the receipt that the butler gave me.17 dresses. 19 pairs of shoes\u2026 etc.Different types of items and the quantity surprised me. But what surprised me even more was the total amount at the end of the receipt.On the receipt, half-year operating expenses of the estate were written down.No matter how many times I checked it, even rubbing my eyes, the amount didn\u2019t change.In just one day, so much money was spent to satisfy one\u2019s personal greed.\u201cCrazy.\u201dThe Duke of Williot wasn\u2019t poor enough to stumble because of it, Still, it was ridiculous.Most of the dresses in particular were dresses that Cecily couldn\u2019t wear now.As a former princess, there was no way she didn\u2019t know that dresses in fashion couldn\u2019t be worn even after a year. What on earth is she thinking?I wanted to leave only a few and refund the rest, but I couldn\u2019t.It was absolutely impossible. Because all authority had been passed to Philen.Even if I had the authority, I couldn\u2019t change what Philen allowed her to do.\u201cHere.\u201dSo even if it bothered me, I returned the receipt without saying anything.The butler looked at me strangely for a moment, then politely retreated.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dI was about to go back to my room when Sarah rushed to me.Behind her were servants holding an armful of books.\u201cThe books you bought from the bookstore have arrived. Shall we bring them to your room?\u201dAs I was about to answer her, Philen appeared behind Sarah.I swallowed what I was about to say and bowed my head lightly to Philen.Sarah and the servants also bowed hastily to greet him.Philen nodded slightly and looked at the books the servants were holding.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d\u201cThese books were bought by My Lady.\u201dUpon hearing Sarah\u2019s report, Philen looked back at me as if it was ridiculous.\u201cWhy did you buy so many books for nothing?\u201dThe word \u2018for nothing\u2019 pierced my heart sharply.I answered in a calm voice, controlling my slightly trembling heart.\u201cIt\u2019s not for nothing. They\u2019re all books I need.\u201d\u201cBooks you need?\u201dPhilen glanced through the book titles and frowned slightly.\u201cI don\u2019t think you had to buy them. They\u2019re all in the study.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not in the study.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way. I\u2019ve seen them all before. Especially\u2026\u201dPhilen picked up the book at the top.\u201cI\u2019ve certainly seen Belboot\u2019s tax theory in the study.\u201dThat book is in the study?\u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d\u201cYou are so sure, huh?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m sure of it.\u201dWhen I answered without hesitation, Philen frowned.\u201cYou there.\u201dHe ordered the servant to bring the list of books that were kept in the study.After a while, as he skimmed through the list of books brought by the servant, a deep wrinkle appeared on Philen\u2019s forehead.As expected, they weren\u2019t there. It couldn\u2019t have been. Because I went to buy them after checking several times.However, he didn\u2019t believe me and I was disgusted that it came out like this. I tried to ask him again if I was right or not, but I stopped.It was because I didn\u2019t want to cause any trouble by hurting his pride.So I was just going to let it slide, but Philen picked on me.\u201cIt must be nice to have a good memory.\u201dAt first glance, it sounded like a compliment, but it wasn\u2019t a compliment at all when I saw his expression.What\u2019s wrong with him?Why are you so unhappy that I bought the books?A sigh came out automatically, but I didn\u2019t show it.I looked at him calmly and bowed my head lightly.\u201cThank you for the compliment.\u201dHe twisted his lips as if he didn\u2019t like it.Philen asked me, waving the Belboot\u2019s tax theory book he was holding.\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to get involved in the duke\u2019s affairs again, are you, Lady Thebesa?\u201dAh, is that how it is?Only then did I burst out into a small laugh, realizing what Philen was worried about.It was a bit ridiculous, but at the same time, it made sense.Since I bought books like tax law and welfare, it was natural for him to misunderstand.Hesitating might cause some unnecessary misunderstanding, so I answered clearly.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d\u201cThen why did you buy so many books like this all of a sudden?\u201dWhat should I do? Should I tell him the truth?I thought about it for a while and decided to tell him the truth.I thought that would clear up the misunderstanding. And I had to get permission to take the official test.\u201cIt\u2019s because of the official test.\u201d\u201cOfficial test? The test that the Emperor said to hire an aide?\u201d\u201cYes. I intend to take the test.\u201dPhilen laughed a little at my answer. It was clearly a ridicule.\u201cThis test is said to be taken by many talented people who are also asked to take it by the Imperial Academy. Do you think you can pass?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s something you don\u2019t know until you try it.\u201d\u201cAs I thought before, the Lady is full of useless confidence.\u201dPhilen scratched his cheek as if he felt annoyed.\u201cIt\u2019s all baseless and useless confidence.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s useless, so don\u2019t waste your time.\u201dIt seemed like I was hearing a lot of \u2018useless\u2019 words today.But I had no intention of moving according to his will, so I looked straight at him and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my time, so I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d\u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re going to take the official test until the end.\u201d\u201cAnyone in the Empire can take the test, regardless of gender. There\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI bet the Lady will never pass the test.\u201d\u201cWhat if I pass?\u201dIt was unlucky to be resolutely certain. But I was annoyed, so I asked back sternly.Philen maybe didn\u2019t expect me to ask back. He looked at me with slightly bewildered eyes, and then he smiled and raised his chin.\u201cIf the Lady passes this official test, I\u2019ll grant you one thing you want.\u201dI reflexively wanted to ask if it would be possible to get Cecily and her child out, but I resisted.It couldn\u2019t have been possible, and if I asked that, I would be treated as a woman blinded by jealousy again.Even if it was possible, it wasn\u2019t something to be brought out now.I would tell him later after I really passed the official test. That way, I was able to keep Philen from saying no.\u201cThen please notarize it.\u201dThis was about Cecily, and I thought it would be better to have a confirmation, so I asked him to notarize it.Then Philen showed signs of discomfort.\u201cDo you have to go that far?\u201d\u201cWhy? Is there any reason why you can\u2019t notarize it?\u201dWhen I looked at him as if asking him to tell me if there was, Philen smiled.\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll notarize it. Instead, the Lady will also have to grant me one thing.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI nodded willingly.\u201cCan I also make a wish like a Duke?\u201d\u201cWell, yes. What I want is already decided.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cTo Cecily.\u201dI just heard the name, but my body reacted automatically and I flinched. I had an uneasy feeling.\u201cPlease bow your head politely and apologize for what you have done, Lady Thebesa.\u201dAs always, the uneasy premonition didn\u2019t miss.*****I wouldn\u2019t have felt so bad or annoyed if I was asked to apologize to Philen.Even though it was a bit annoying, I would have granted it, but if it was Cecily, it was a different matter.Cecily was a woman who wanted to crush me somehow.What would happen if I bowed my head and apologized?It was clear that she would raise her chin and be proud. Was that all? She would look at me and laugh uncontrollably.Just thinking about it made me annoyed.I never wanted to apologize to that woman.In order to do that, I must pass the official test\u2026 but can I really pass it?I sighed at the sudden question.As Philen said, if many talented people from the Imperial Academy took this test, the chances of me passing were significantly reduced. It could be said that there was none at all.Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have made a bet with Philen.I regretted it, but it was already too late.Now that it\u2019s notarized, there was no turning back anymore.And I didn\u2019t want to disappoint Kalian. I really wanted to repay him for giving me the opportunity.So, let\u2019s study hard and pass the test.With my deepest commitment, I opened a book on tax law.*****I concentrated on studying by reducing not only my sleeping time but also my eating time.Philen clicked his tongue and looked at me, saying \u2018you\u2019re wasting time foolishly\u2019, but I ignored him.The important thing was the test.When I had time to listen to other people\u2019s words, I tried to read at least one more letter from the book.A week had passed since I studied so hard like that. And Sarah told me that he had decided to return to the estate tomorrow.\u201cIf you have any stuff that you must bring, please let me know in advance.\u201d\u201cStuff?\u201dI took my eyes off the book and turned to Sarah.\u201cI was thinking of staying in the capital for a while.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dSarah blinked as if she had never heard of it before.\u201cDid you not hear it?\u201d\u201cYes. And the Duke doesn\u2019t seem to know either because he ordered the butler to prepare two carriages.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSarah said Philen didn\u2019t know either?Ridiculous. I told him that I was going to take the official test, and he was thinking of taking me to the estate?Maybe he didn\u2019t think about it because I didn\u2019t directly say that I would stay in the capital.\u201cWhere\u2019s the Duke?\u201dI thought I should meet and talk with Philen, so I went to see him.Philen was practicing swordsmanship at the training ground.\u201cDuke.\u201dAs if noticing that I had come, Philen looked back at me.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something I want to tell you. Do you have a moment?\u201d\u201cLeave.\u201dPhilen handed the sword to the servant who was standing nearby.The servant accepted the sword and stepped back with quick short steps.Philen also told all the other servants and maids to leave.\u201cYou too leave for a while.\u201dAfter telling Sarah to leave, I went to Philen.Philen sat casually in the shade of a tree and wiped the sweat from his face with a towel.\u201cWhat do you want to tell me?\u201dWithout anyone around, Philen immediately spoke informally.It was the same for me. Since Philen started first, there was nothing to worry about.\u201cI heard you\u2019re going back to the estate tomorrow, is that right?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019ve been in the capital for so long, so I\u2019ll have to go back to the estate soon. That way, I can make sure we\u2019re properly prepared for the rainy season.\u201dHe was right. If I had continued to work as a duke, I would have made the same decision as Philen.\u201cSo, what about it? Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no problem going back. The problem is with me.\u201dPhilen\u2019s hand, which was wiping the sweat flowing down his chin, stopped.\u201cThe problem is with you?\u201d\u201cUntil the official test is over, I\u2019ll stay in the capital.\u201dYeah, it\u2019s just until then, so I thought I\u2019d get a decent answer, but Philen didn\u2019t say anything.Don\u2019t tell me he didn\u2019t understand me even though I explained it so kindly.There was a doubt whether Philen understood me or not.\u201cThere are only three weeks until the test.\u201dThe latter could be possible, so I kindly added an explanation.\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time going back and forth, and it\u2019ll be difficult if I get stuck in the estate because of the rainy season. So I\u2019ll stay in the capital until the test is over\u2026\u201d\u201cYou, have you forgotten what happened this weekend?\u201dPhilen asked, cutting my words.What did I forget? I looked back at my memories, but nothing came to mind.It wasn\u2019t Philen\u2019s birthday, and it was not too late to go back for the anniversary of the Duke and Duchess after the test.\u201cYou seem to have really forgotten.\u201dWhen I didn\u2019t say a word, Philen smiled and shrugged lightly.\u201cYou forgot something important because of the test that\u2019s not going to work. It\u2019s not like you.\u201dIt made me even more upset when he added words that would have made me feel bad even if he said them separately.I said with a hint of displeasure.\u201cThe test that\u2019s not going to work. What are you going to do if I pass?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s obviously not going to work.\u201d\u201cAs I said before, it\u2019s something you don\u2019t know until you try\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I know even if you don\u2019t try it.\u201dThere was a strange sense of confidence in his words. There seemed to be a certain point of trust.What is it? Does he come up with anything to get me down?He\u2019s not the kind of person who would do that.\u201cDo you know Raymond Logan?\u201dOf course. Raymond Logan, the second son of the Logan family that had produced famous scholars for generations and was famous enough to be called the genius of the century.\u201cHe\u2019s taking this official test.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI asked back with a slight surprise at the unexpected remark.\u201cRaymond Logan is already an official. Why is he taking the official test again?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know the details because I\u2019m not the person directly involved, but I heard that he has long wanted to be the Emperor\u2019s aide.\u201dI see. If that\u2019s the reason, it\u2019s understandable. The reason why Philen asserts to me that I could never pass it.\u201cAre you thinking of giving up now?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dWhen I answered firmly, Philen shrugged.\u201cI kindly let you know that you can\u2019t pass it, but in the end, there\u2019s nothing I can do about you still giving it a try.\u201dHe looked like he cared about me just by listening to his words, but I could tell by looking at his eyes that he wasn\u2019t.\u201cYou are free to do that. But I can\u2019t allow you to stay in the capital. There\u2019s a territory inspection this weekend.\u201dCome to think of it, the schedule was next week.Before the rainy season, the duke used to inspect the territory to make sure there were no special incidents or difficulties of the people.But what does that have to do with me? I\u2019m out of the duke\u2019s affairs now.\u201cAre you saying you want to take me to the inspection?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true.\u201dPhilen sighed as if he was getting annoyed.\u201cI don\u2019t want to take you either, but Baron Wizard said that if you, the fianc\u00e9e, don\u2019t come, rumors of a discord between us will arise.\u201dThere\u2019s indeed a discord between us, but there was nothing good to let the people know about it.Only the Duke family\u2019s prestige would be greatly reduced.My face, too.Therefore, it was better to accompany Philen during the inspection of the territory.Haa, I couldn\u2019t help it.I didn\u2019t want to walk around with him, but I couldn\u2019t let my personal feelings keep me from doing what I had to do.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go back to the estate.\u201dAs soon as the inspection was over, I would go straight up to the capital.Then I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about getting tied up in the estate because of the rainy season\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t look very happy.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201dIt couldn\u2019t have been good when my schedule was twisted and I was tired in many ways.I spoke frankly without hiding my feelings.Then Philen frowned and clicked his tongue.\u201cI allowed you to take the official test because you said you wanted to take it, but don\u2019t even think about bragging about it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who? Me?\u201cI would never do that.\u201d\u201cYou just did.\u201dPhilen got up from his seat, rubbing his face.\u201cLet\u2019s stop talking about useless things. I have a lot of work to do.\u201dPhilen let out a small sigh.\u201cI\u2019m busy with the Duke\u2019s work, and I\u2019m so busy that I can\u2019t even catch my breath for a moment to do the Duchess\u2019s work.\u201dOf course, you are. Because I was like that too.After doing it for a long time, it became a little easier for me because I got the hang of it, but for Philen, it would be more difficult because it was his first time doing it.\u201cI haven\u2019t returned to the estate yet, but I\u2019m already like this. I don\u2019t want to imagine what it would be like when I go back to the estate.\u201dPhilen complained while looking at me. It was a look that wanted me to say something.What do you want me to say?After thinking for a while, I came up with a suitable word.\u201cIt must be very difficult. I\u2019ll support you, so do your best.\u201dPhilen frowned at my answer. It didn\u2019t seem to be the answer he wanted.\u201cIs that all you want to say?\u201d\u201cThen?\u201dAs I looked at him, telling him to tell me what he wanted, Philen waved his hand.\u201cForget it. I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m the only one who is tired of talking to a tactless woman like you.\u201dThe words full of thorns irritated me.However, if I kept arguing with him, it would be me who would lose in the end, so I turned around without saying anything.*****After parting ways with Leila, Philen returned to his room and sat down at his desk with an annoyed sigh.There was a pile of documents on the desk for him to look at.Even though he was diligently looking at the documents until he fell asleep, there was no sign of it decreasing.At least the duke\u2019s work was worth it, but the problem was the duchess\u2019s.He started to get sick and tired of trying to take care of the things that a hostess had to do, such as taking care of the family\u2019s affairs and the surrounding high-ranking nobles.So he wanted to hand over the Duchess\u2019s work to Leila.He had said something before, so he couldn\u2019t be the first to say it. That\u2019s why he secretly brought it up.If Leila said \u2018I\u2019ll help you\u2019, he was going to pretend he didn\u2019t win, but instead, she said that.He knew she was tactless, but he didn\u2019t know she would be this bad.\u201cWhat on earth are you good at?\u201dShe was tactless, she wasn\u2019t attractive, and she wasn\u2019t noticeably pretty either.Up until now, he thought she was doing a good job, but looking at the rainy season document, it was confirmed that she was not.\u2026well, other than that part, she didn\u2019t seem to make any particular mistakes.The fact that Leila was good at work was something that even aides acknowledged.Then, what?Every time she said something, it was always about taking the official test that didn\u2019t even work.\u201c\u2026that\u2019s really annoying.\u201dJust thinking about Leila gave him a headache and made him frustrated.Wanting to drink cool water, Philen asked the servant to bring it.After a while, it was Cecily, not the servant, who brought water with ice on the tray.Philen, who had been rummaging through the documents pointlessly, stood up as soon as he saw Cecily.Then he quickly approached and took the tray Cecily was carrying.\u201cYour body is heavy and what if you fall? Why are you doing such chores?\u201d\u201cThis much is fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. From now on, never do this again.\u201d\u201cEven after giving birth?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dCecily smiled pleasantly at Philen\u2019s answer.Philen put the tray on the table first, then personally escorted Cecily to the sofa.Cecily came, and there\u2019s no way to just drink water, so Philen ordered the servant to bring some delicious cookies and sweet tea.\u201cEat the cookies. I\u2019ll finish what I have to do and then idle with you.\u201d\u201cAre you very busy?\u201d\u201cA little. I\u2019ll be done soon, so wait a minute.\u201dPhilen said so, but he still didn\u2019t finish when Cecily finished her tea.Cecily, tired from idling alone, came to Philen\u2019s side.\u201cCan I help you?\u201dHe heard what he wanted to hear from Leila from Cecily.This situation made him laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not something you can do because you\u2019re not living in our estate, and you\u2019re not a citizen of the Empire.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dHe was just telling the truth, but when Cecily became depressed, Philen grabbed her by the waist and put her on his lap.\u201cWhy are you so depressed?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sad because you\u2019re having a hard time and there\u2019s nothing I can help.\u201d\u201cGood girl.\u201dPhilen smiled lightly and pinched Cecily\u2019s cheek.It would have been great if Leila looked half like Cecily.The thought of her made him sigh again.He was catching his breath for a while and talking with Cecily about this and that. Then the butler came with documents saying it was urgent.\u201cCome here.\u201dSeriously, can\u2019t you see me taking a break for a moment?Philen swallowed his irritation and checked the document the butler had brought.Cecily glanced through the documents on the desk in the meantime.As Philen said, there was nothing she could do as she was a princess of a foreign country.But if this\u2026\u201cPhil!\u201dCecily smiled brightly, holding a piece of paper.\u201cI can help you with this!\u201d*****I originally didn\u2019t have much luggage that I brought with me, and I didn\u2019t have much luggage to bring as I was planning to return to the capital after the inspection.I only brought a few books.I took two of them with the intention of reading them on the way to the estate. As I headed to the carriage, Philen was standing in front of it.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dPhilen\u2019s eyebrows rose slightly at my question.\u201cCan\u2019t I be here?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way, but I was asking because you weren\u2019t in the carriage when we were about to leave.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to get on now. So get on, too, My Lady.\u201dPhilen said as he opened the carriage door with his own hands.It was an unfamiliar kindness. I awkwardly got on the carriage.As soon as I sat down, I got up again when Philen got on the carriage.Why are you here instead of in the same carriage as Cecily?I looked at him strangely.Philen sat down and said.\u201cI have something to tell you, sit down, My Lady.\u201dAh, I see.I understood and sat back.Soon the carriage began to rattle.I thought he would just say something and get off, but I was wrong.I felt stuffy sitting face to face with him and the thought about going all the way to the estate.Furthermore, it was even more uncomfortable because Philen didn\u2019t say anything and just stared at me.Am I supposed to start the conversation?As I was about to open my mouth, Philen spoke with a serious look on his face.\u201cI said I would do it, so I tried to be responsible as much as I could be.\u201dI swallowed what I was about to say and listened to Philen.\u201cBut there are many other things to do, and it\u2019s difficult to do this by myself. I\u2019m ashamed of myself.\u201dIt was long, but the point was one.You\u2019re asking for help.I was a little disgusted. He was saying rude things, and then asking for help, but what can I do?Liked or not, he was my fianc\u00e9.I didn\u2019t want to argue about this for nothing, so I decided to accept it.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dIs it about the estate\u2019s matter? Or if not, is it about the Duke\u2019s work?\u201cIt\u2019s about preparing for our wedding.\u201dAs I was trying to guess which it was, I opened my eyes wide, surprised by what Philen said.Preparing for the wedding? I was embarrassed.As I stayed still with my eyes wide open, Philen tilted his head.\u201cWhy do you look like that? Do you not want to marry me?\u201dOf course, I should say no, but for a moment, the words didn\u2019t come out as if there was a thorn in my throat.As I paused without answering, Philen looked at me suspiciously.\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201dI hurriedly opened my mouth because it would be troublesome if Philen misunderstood.There was still an uncomfortable feeling somewhere in my heart, but I ignored it.\u201cI was just a little bewildered because it was so sudden.\u201d\u201cSudden? I already told you at the party that I\u2019m going to marry you.\u201dHe certainly said that, but at the time, I thought it was just a silly act. Because Philen\u2019s actions after that were far from being those of the person who wanted to marry.So I forgot about it, and I didn\u2019t think he would bring it up first.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to do it before winter comes, so the date is October, and the location is at Williot estate.\u201dHe even thought of the date and time.It was a talent to surprise people with every word he said.My heart pounded in surprise at Philen\u2019s words several times.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dOctober was a little tight, but I gladly accepted it.It was because I wanted to quickly become the Duchess of Williot and find stability, even if I was uncomfortable with Philen.I couldn\u2019t keep being such an anxious fianc\u00e9e.\u2026that will give me a reason to refute what Philen is saying.\u201cThen as soon as I get back to the estate, I\u2019ll have to order the dress and the tailcoat. I\u2019ll send out invitations too.\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201d\u2026why are you laughing?Staring at him for his inexplicable behavior, Philen said with a smile.\u201cLeila, you\u2019re the bride. And you\u2019re going to prepare the wedding yourself? People will laugh at you if they find out.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 right.\u201dI nodded in agreement with Philen.It was customary for the closest relatives to prepare wedding arrangements when the parents were not present.The wedding parties rarely did the preparation themselves.\u201cThen who are you going to ask? You\u2019re not going to ask Countess Thebesa, are you?\u201dIf she was conscious of her surroundings and showing off, she would be happy to do it, but I didn\u2019t like it.I thought it\u2019s better to prepare with my own hands and got ridiculed by the people around me.When I asked carefully, Philen smiled lightly.\u201cI\u2019m not that tactless.\u201d\u2026is that so?Well, he knew that Countess Thebesa and I were not on good terms. Also that she was my stepmother.Anyway, who else if it\u2019s not Countess Thebesa?\u201cAre you going to ask Mrs. Holls then?\u201dCountess Holls. She was the wife of Philen\u2019s cousin.Even though they were cousins, they weren\u2019t close, and there was hardly any visitation.After being engaged to Philen for 10 years and living in the duke\u2019s residence, the number of face-to-face encounters was so small that I could count on one hand.Among his close relatives, she was the only one who could help prepare for the wedding.So I asked, and Philen shook his head.Who else if it\u2019s not Mrs. Holls?\u201cCecily.\u201dAs I was looking back at my memories to see if there were any distant relatives who could help, I stopped at the sudden name.\u201cCecily\u2019s going to help.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She knows this kind of thing so well, so she was willing to do it.\u201dI can\u2019t believe you willingly agreed. With whose permission?Lost in words, I smiled and put my hand on my head.Philen looked at me strangely.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201c\u2026what\u2019s wrong?\u201dAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know? Or are you doing this to turn my heart upside down?I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the former from experience.Not knowing was not a sin, but it was a sin enough.My heart was full of bruises after being hit by the stone he threw unintentionally.\u201cIn Mullis Kingdom, there may be no social problems if the mistress prepares for the wedding.\u201dI struggled to swallow the anger and irritation that filled me up. I chewed and spat out one word at a time.\u201cBut it\u2019s the Cardin Empire. Ha, if everyone else found out that the mistress did the wedding arrangements, wouldn\u2019t they laugh at us? I\u2019d rather do it.\u201dWhen I returned what he had said, Philen frowned.\u201cDo you really have to say that?\u201d\u201cWhy? Did I say something wrong?\u201dIt seemed like Philen wanted to say something, but he shut his mouth as if he had nothing to say.The deeply wrinkled brows showed that he wasn\u2019t in a good mood.At other times, I would have looked into his eyes and treated him appropriately, but I didn\u2019t want to do that this time.I would have tilted my head if you said the name of a distant relative I didn\u2019t know, but Cecily\u2026It was so ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t even laugh.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to leave it to her, I would rather leave it to Countess Thebesa.\u201dAs I showed signs of dislike towards Cecily, Philen\u2019s brows became narrower.\u201cYou still don\u2019t care at all.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t care about me, why should I care about her?\u201dWhen I replied without losing, Philen turned his head, clicking his tongue.There was an awkward silence inside the carriage.Philen, who was looking out the window with his mouth shut, sighed deeply and opened the window connected to the driver\u2019s seat.\u201cStop the carriage.\u201dFive carriages, including the luggage carriage, stopped altogether at Philen\u2019s words.As soon as the carriage stopped, Philen got off the carriage without saying goodbye.Beyond the thin carriage door, I could hear his footsteps moving away.I didn\u2019t wonder where he was going. Because he\u2019s probably going to the carriage where Cecily was.I was worried if I had to keep riding in the same carriage with him. That\u2019s why when he got off, I was glad.Then, I was a little worried about the aftermath because he looked angry, but what could I do?The water had already been spilled.So, I thought I should read a book without paying any attention, but I could hardly concentrate.***Rattle, bang!The carriage door slammed shut.Cecily stared at Philen, who was sitting opposite her, with a heavy frown on his face.Judging from the look on his face, it looked like he had a big fight with Leila.Of course, they are.If she listened to those words and stayed still, she\u2019s a saint, not a person.She sent him because she knew this would happen.Cecily smiled with satisfaction inwardly but looked worriedly at Philen on the outside.\u201cI guess it didn\u2019t go well.\u201d\u201c\u2026well, that\u2019s right.\u201dPhilen sighed deeply and opened his arms to Cecily.It means coming to him and acting cute to make him feel better.Cecily hurriedly fell into his arms and squeezed his wrinkled brows.\u201cDon\u2019t be so angry, Phil.\u201d\u201cI want to too, but the thought of Leila makes me annoyed.\u201d\u201cWhat did she say?\u201dInstead of answering, Philen buried his face in her shoulder.It means he didn\u2019t want to tell me.Even without asking, she could guess how Leila would have reacted.Cecily leaned her head on his shoulder without further questioning, as she was sure it would only make Philen feel worse if she asked.Liking Cecily\u2019s behavior, Philen smiled softly and gently stroked her hair.\u201cAs I\u2019ve thought before, I wish Leila was as tactful as you are.\u201dNow let\u2019s put some wedges in slowly.There\u2019s talk about marriage. If I delay it, I\u2019ll miss the timing for the rest of my life.Cecily looked into Philen\u2019s eyes and spoke carefully.\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s tactless, but maybe she thinks that she doesn\u2019t have the need to be tactful about you, Phil.\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201dPhilen\u2019s brows narrowed at once.Cecily didn\u2019t miss the opportunity when Philen responded and continued.\u201cYou have to be tactful when you work and isn\u2019t she good at her job? Then she\u2019s not tactless.\u201d\u201c\u2026that\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cMaybe she\u2019s ignoring Phil\u2026\u201dIt was intentional, but as if it was a mistake, Cecily covered her mouth with her hands, not knowing what to do.\u201cI, I\u2019m sorry. Forget what I just said. This is just my opinion.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201dPhilen\u2019s eyes narrowed coldly. He leaned against the backrest with a small smile.\u201cI have to get my control back. I need to make her know exactly who I am.\u201d\u201cI think you better do that, too.\u201dCecily, who moved to the seat next to Philen, smiled kindly and held his hand.\u201cHow dare she, a Count Lady, ignore you, the Duke. That would never happen in our kingdom.\u201d***Since then, Philen didn\u2019t look for me.I didn\u2019t look for him either.I ran into him at least once during each break, but there was no conversation.We passed each other quietly, treating each other as strangers.There was no conversation between us until we arrived at the mansion.\u201cWelcome back, Master. My Lady.\u201dButlers and servants came out to the front door to greet us.After greeting them with a light nod, Philen took Cecily alone and went into the mansion.The butlers and the servants looked at me, who was left alone.There was pity in their eyes as they looked at me.There\u2019s nothing good about staying here, so I went into the mansion with a calm look on my face.\u201cMy Lady.\u201dAs soon as I entered the mansion, Baron Wizard rushed to me with an armful of documents in his arms.\u201cMy Lady, do you have a moment?\u201d\u201cI do, but what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI have something to discuss with you about the rainy season.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s out of my hands. Please talk to the Duke.\u201d\u201cOf course I will, but before that, I would like to ask you for your opinion\u2026\u201d\u201cBaron Wizard.\u201dBefore the baron could finish his words, Philen suddenly appeared from the east corridor.Baron Wizard swallowed what he was going to say and bowed his head to greet him.\u201cNow, what were you going to say to Lady Thebesa?\u201dIt was a cold voice. Even the gaze that looked at Baron Wizard was cold.\u201cI have a question about the rainy season, so\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking that to Lady Thebesa, not me? Ah, don\u2019t tell me.\u201dPhilen twisted his lips and continued.\u201cAre you ignoring me, too?\u201dIs it my illusion that Philen looked at me for a moment?\u201cHow is that possible!\u201dBaron Wizard jumped and denied Philen\u2019s words.\u201cHow dare I ignore the Duke!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d\u201cThen!\u201dA very scary light flashed in Philen\u2019s eyes.\u201cExplain why you\u2019re asking that to Lady Thebesa, not me!\u201d\u201cTh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stutter, speak properly!\u201dPhilen grilled Baron Wizard as if he was going to eat him right away.The baron, suppressed by his force, was unable to speak properly and trembled. His face turned as pale as a blank sheet of paper.\u201cStop it, Duke.\u201dIt was only then that Philen looked back at me when I stepped up.Dissatisfaction was buried in his gaze towards me.What on earth are you so dissatisfied with?\u201cBaron Wizard was just trying to ask for my advice.\u201d\u201cBaron Wizard, who has worked for the duke for over 30 years, seeks advice from a Lady, who has only worked for a few years. Interesting.\u201d[T*/C: Probably better choice than asking you who only just works\u2026 for a couple of weeks? Well, he\u2019s mad anyway. :|]Unlike his mouth that burst into laughter, his eyes were cold.I didn\u2019t know why, but Philen didn\u2019t seem very happy that Baron Wizard sought advice from me.I didn\u2019t think he needed to think about the baron ignoring him.\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to make it clear.\u201dPhilen\u2019s gaze turned to Baron Wizard again.The baron didn\u2019t dare to look Philen in the eye, so he lowered his gaze for a long time.\u201cNever again discuss or disclose to Lady Thebesa about the affairs of the duke or the territory.\u201dThe word \u2018never again\u2019 was significant.Does that mean he can\u2019t discuss it with me even after I become the Duchess? Or\u2026 does he not want me to become the Duchess?We talked about marriage just a few days ago, but as it turned out badly, I wasn\u2019t quite sure that I could get married to him safely.On the contrary, seeing his words and actions now made me more anxious.The word \u2018breakup\u2019 seemed to flash in front of my eyes.\u201cIf this happens again, you\u2019ll have to take off your aide title.\u201dPhilen left with one last warning.\u201cAre you okay, My Lady?\u201dBaron Wizard spoke carefully. His face was full of worry and concern.None of it was okay, but I didn\u2019t want to make it obvious.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cBut your complexion is not very good.\u201dIs that so?I swept my cheek down awkwardly.\u201cI must have been a little tired from the carriage trip. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cMy Lady\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really okay. Ah, I must be tired.\u201dI created the opportunity to part with him as naturally as possible.I wondered what Baron Wizard wanted to ask me, but I couldn\u2019t ask what it was when Philen had said that.The baron didn\u2019t seem to want to talk either.\u201cThen, see you next time, Baron.\u201d\u201cYes. Have a nice day, My Lady.\u201dCan I really have a good day?I headed to my room with unnecessary questions at the formal greeting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Look at this!\u201dIt was because Cecily and Philen were getting better, while my relationship was like that.I didn\u2019t want to see them, so I stayed in my room and read a book. There were also things to study for the test, which seemed to be an excuse to people.\u201cDo you know what everyone is talking about?\u201dSarah said, huffing and puffing.\u201cThe reason My Lady took the official test is because she and the Duke are going to break up soon! That\u2019s why she\u2019s trying to find a way to live!\u201dDid such a rumor spread? Hilarious.I just laughed silently, and Sarah asked me in bewilderment.\u201cYou\u2019re not, right? You\u2019re not breaking up with the Duke, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sarah. I won\u2019t be the first to bring up the breakup.\u201d\u201cEven after you become an official?\u201d\u201cWell, I hadn\u2019t thought that far.\u201d\u201cIf, if My Lady breaks her marriage with the Duke and leaves the mansion, I will follow you!\u201d\u201cRidiculous. You\u2019re the Duke of Williot\u2019s maid.\u201d\u201cA maid, not a slave! I have the right to choose my job!\u201dThat\u2019s true.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see me quit the duke\u2019s, don\u2019t ever break up with the Duke!\u201dThat\u2019s not up to me, it\u2019s up to Philen.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll try.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try, you have to!\u201dIt was coercion, but I didn\u2019t hate it.Rather, it was adorable as if I was looking at my immature little sister. I smiled and replied that I would.People felt sorry because there was no communication between me and Philen, but I didn\u2019t mind.I didn\u2019t know about Philen, but I was content with my life now.It\u2019s much better than having an unnecessary face-to-face argument with Philen. And I could read books at will.I didn\u2019t know what it\u2019s like in other people\u2019s eyes, but at least for me, peaceful days went on.As time passed, the day came when I had to go to inspect the territory.I woke up early in the morning and went to the bathroom.I didn\u2019t like showing my naked body to other people even to the maids, so I usually washed by myself. But on days like this, I had to get help.And that role was always played by Misa.Misa bathed me earnestly, anointing my body with perfume.\u201cYou will be walking around all day today, so why not wear a simple and active dress rather than a cumbersome and fancy dress?\u201d\u201cSounds good. Let\u2019s do that.\u201dUpon my permission, Misa instructed the maids to bring dresses and accessory boxes.While Sarah was drying my hair, the maids brought the things as ordered.They moved in unison under Misa\u2019s direction and helped dress me up.Pure white chemise dress with lace and ribbon around the chest. It was as active as Misa said, yet neat and elegant.When they finished dressing me up, they put on makeup and spencer on me.After braiding my hair to one side, I wore shabo with a large ribbon and brought a reticule with a handkerchief in it.This was usually the style of young children. So when everything was ready, it seemed like I was dressed too young to fit my age.I was a little worried as I looked in the mirror, but Sarah clapped her hands with her eyes twinkling.\u201cMy Lady, you are so pretty! You look like my age!\u201dSarah was 19 years old this year, and she said I looked like her age.\u201cYou\u2019re too flattering.\u201d\u201cNo! You really look young! Right?\u201d\u201cOf course! You\u2019re so pretty, My Lady!\u201dThe maids nodded in agreement with Sarah\u2019s words.It was a little embarrassing, but it felt good.I thanked them for helping me dress up, and then I went alone.Philen was already ready and waiting for me. After that, Baron Wizard and the other aides and escort knights were seen.Philen, who was talking to the aides, noticed me and paused.His expression hardened subtly.As expected, is it weird?I awkwardly stood in front of Philen.Philen looked at me blankly, then coughed and opened his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty.\u201d\u2026oh?\u2018You\u2019re dressed incongruously.\u2019I thought he\u2019d be hard on me, so I didn\u2019t expect him to compliment me.It was a little embarrassing.I bent my knees slightly, smiling a little.\u201cThe Duke also looks very wonderful.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t empty words, it\u2019s true.He looked really cool in his overcoat with his bright blonde hair neatly tucked away.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Lady.\u201dI thought it would be awkward and difficult for us to go together today as we had been cold for a while, but surprisingly, it started well.I gently placed my hand on Philen\u2019s outstretched hand, hoping that this state would continue until the end of the inspection of the territory.But my wish was shattered from the start.\u201cWelcome, Lady.\u201dCecily was in the carriage.Why is this woman here?I looked at Cecily in confusion.On the other hand, Philen was calm. And rather, he looked at me as if he\u2019s wondering what I was doing instead of getting on it quickly.He maybe had no intention of explaining why Cecily was in the carriage.\u201c\u2026why is she in the carriage?\u201dIn the end, when I was the first to say the word, Philen answered as if it was natural.\u201cCecily said she wanted to look around the territory, so I asked her to join us. Is there a problem?\u201dThere was no problem. It would have been if she were an ordinary guest, not a mistress.But she was Philen\u2019s mistress.What would other people think when they saw the three of us going to inspect the territory together?It was so terrifying that I didn\u2019t even dare to think about it.The thought of pouring gaze and hearing what they would say made me dizzy.I pulled out my hand that was held by Philen and said.\u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201dPeople would gossip if I didn\u2019t go with them, but I\u2019d rather that.At least I wouldn\u2019t hear those words. I wouldn\u2019t see them looking at me strangely.Philen frowned at my words, and Cecily looked at me in surprise.\u201cWhat else is the problem?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no problem.\u201dYeah. There\u2019s no apparent problem.\u201cThen why are you doing this all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d\u201cDo you really need to ask?\u201d\u201cThen tell her to get off.\u201dCecily, who was suddenly pointed out, looked anxiously at Philen with a face that seemed to burst into tears.Philen\u2019s expression was distorted even more harshly.\u201cLeila. That\u2019s enough.\u201dHe growled in a voice that was small enough for me to hear.But I said my mind without batting an eye.\u201cIf you go with her, I won\u2019t go.\u201dAt other times, I would have compromised Cecily moderately, such as never getting her off the carriage, etc, but this time, I didn\u2019t want to.When I didn\u2019t give in until the end, Philen sighed deeply and looked at Cecily.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it seems like you have to make a concession.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.\u201dCecily meekly got out of the carriage.\u201cGo and then, stay with me for a long time.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dPhilen kissed Cecily lightly on the cheek. Cecily grinned and hugged him.It was definitely the appearance of a lovely lover no matter who looked at it.I felt like I was the evil interrupter that separated such lovers.It\u2019s ironic. I\u2019m his fianc\u00e9e, so why should I feel this way?I didn\u2019t want to watch them any longer, so I hurriedly got on the carriage.Philen escorted Cecily to the mansion by himself and then got onto the carriage.Soon the carriage rattled off.\u201cLater, send Cecily a gift of apology.\u201dPhilen, who had been still, suddenly said something that didn\u2019t make sense.I turned to him, raising my eyebrow.\u201cWhy would I?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s depressed because she couldn\u2019t go on her long-awaited outing because of your strange stubbornness. What would you do if it affects the child?\u201dSo, you want me to give her a gift to soothe her depression?It was so ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t even laugh.\u201cIf she\u2019s so pitiful, why didn\u2019t you go with her?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being weirdly stubborn again, you know I can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you, not me, who is being weirdly stubborn. We\u2019re not going to play, do you think it\u2019s right to take the mistress with us to inspect the territory?\u201dWhether he thought so or not, Philen kept his mouth shut. It was even more hilarious. Because he did it on purpose knowing he couldn\u2019t do it.It\u2019s like someone wants me to get angry. It really can\u2019t be what he wants, though.Philen still seemed to have a lot to say to me, but sadly I wasn\u2019t.I didn\u2019t want to talk to him anymore.I turned my head blatantly, and at this, Philen let out a deep sigh.*****The beginning was quite creaky, but the subsequent process was smooth.Since it was his first time doing this, Philen seemed a little nervous, but soon he adapted and took care of the people.Inwardly, I was worried about what would happen if he showed an immature appearance, but it was a relief.I finally felt relieved and looked around the Williot territory where I had lived for 10 years.Located in the southern part of the Empire, Williot territory was quite liveable.The weather was mild all year round, and there\u2019s a large river outside the territory, so there\u2019s no need to worry about water.The land was fertile and the crops grew well.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dAfter looking around for a while, I turned my head when someone pulled my dress.Then I saw a little boy who was only about the height of my waist.His bright eyes were filled with a lot of worries.What worries a child like him has to make him look like this?Worried, I bowed slightly at the boy\u2019s eye level.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cUm, I have something to tell you.\u201dBehind the boy, I saw Philen, who was talking to his aides, approaching this way.\u201cTo me?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe boy nodded his head and looked at me.\u201cI really want the Lord to solve it.\u201dPhilen, who had come right behind the boy, stopped.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My Lady.\u201dWe were greeted warmly by the people in charge who had come out in advance.Philen nodded lightly, then looked back at me.\u201cThe Lady must be tired from walking around all day today. You can rest in the carriage for a while.\u201dIt sounded like he was thinking of me, but he wasn\u2019t.He was afraid that I might interfere with the affairs of the territory, so he wrapped it up with pretentious words and kicked me out.From the look of it, it seemed that the riverbank was repaired well, and there\u2019s no reason to stay against his will.\u201cYes, Duke.\u201dI meekly accepted his suggestion and got back on the carriage.I was able to spend time without being bored thanks to the book that I brought in case something like this happened.I started with Chapter 1, and by the time I was almost finished reading Chapter 2, Philen returned.I closed the book I was reading and asked him with a smile. There\u2019s no one here, so I spoke informally.\u201cDid it finish well?\u201d\u201cOf course. They did what I told them to do.\u201dPhilen replied with a very proud face.It looks like he did a great job.I completely let go of all the remaining anxiety.\u201cWere you reading a book?\u201d\u201cYeah. Because the official test is just around the corner.\u201dAt my words, Philen\u2019s eyebrows slanted slightly.\u201cI have something to tell you about our wedding preparation.\u201d\u2026that story again?It was inevitable because I had to get married, but I wasn\u2019t happy because we had already had this conversation.I looked at Philen nervously.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cAs you said, asking Cecily doesn\u2019t seem like a good thing in many ways, so I won\u2019t do it.\u201dFor some reason, he listened to me.As soon as the tight tension was loosened a little, Philen spit out another ridiculous remark.\u201cThat\u2019s why I called Countess Thebesa.\u201dCountess Thebesa?It felt like I met another vicious beast while trying to avoid a beast.Countess Thebesa was better than Cecily, but that\u2019s still not a good thing. I hated both.But unlike Cecily, Countess Thebesa didn\u2019t threaten my position, so I think she\u2019s better.However, it was absurd to leave the wedding preparation to Countess Thebesa.\u201cYou don\u2019t look good.\u201dAs I looked at him with a frown, Philen smiled and leaned against the backrest.\u201cI\u2019ve left it to Countess Thebesa as you wished, so why are you making that face?\u201d\u201c\u2026as I wished?\u201d\u201cYeah. You told me before that you would rather leave it to Countess Thebesa than Cecily.\u201dI did say that, but I said it just to make it clear that I didn\u2019t want to leave it to Cecily.I didn\u2019t really mean to leave it to Countess Thebesa.No matter how tactless Philen was, he wasn\u2019t an idiot who didn\u2019t notice this.I could tell just by looking at the slanted corner of his lips. He did it on purpose to pick on me.What a childish joke this is.It was so ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t even laugh.Apparently, Philen wanted me to give in and apologize for what happened that day.Such a hilarious intention. I didn\u2019t even have the slightest thought to go the way he wanted.\u201cOkay.\u201dThat was the last pride I had left with nothing.\u201cLet\u2019s leave it to Countess Thebesa.\u201dThe corner of his lips, which had risen gracefully, were hardened as it couldn\u2019t regain its original track.Philen looked at me with cold eyes.Do you think that would scare me?I wasn\u2019t scared at all. I met his gaze with a nonchalant smile.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026you really don\u2019t know why I\u2019m looking at you like this?\u201dNo. I knew it. It\u2019s a problem because I knew it too well.\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dPhilen chuckled and raised his eyebrows. Discontent was etched on his face.He couldn\u2019t control his emotions. What was he going to do with his social life in the future?\u201cCecily said this before.\u201dIs it about her again?If I said I didn\u2019t like her that much, he wouldn\u2019t have said it. But he was really tactless. Or\u2026 he didn\u2019t care about me.\u201cIt\u2019s not that you\u2019re tactless, it\u2019s that you\u2019re pretending to be tactless.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cOther than that, you must have something to say to me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Do you want me to give you an excuse if I deny it?\u201dJudging from the lack of words, it seemed that the answer was correct.That fact was even more ridiculous, so I laughed a little.\u201cIf I give you an excuse, will you believe me, not her?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t know about that.\u201d\u201cNo, I know.\u201dI firmly denied Philen\u2019s words.\u201cBecause you don\u2019t believe me since you said that to me in the first place. Am I right?\u201dI said this, but I really wanted him to say no.Even if he didn\u2019t believe in me, I just wanted him to confirm that he didn\u2019t believe what she said unconditionally.Rattle, bang-!Philen mercilessly got out of the carriage without fulfilling my wish.*****Since the inspection of the territory was over, there was no reason to remain in the estate anymore.\u201cSarah, we\u2019re going to the capital as soon as the sun rises tomorrow, so get ready.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dSarah left to get ready. I was sitting on the couch reading a book when the butler came to see me.\u201cMy Lady, are you going to the capital tomorrow?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dAt my answer, the butler put on an awkward look.What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cTomorrow, Countess Thebesa will come to prepare for the wedding.\u201d\u201cCount\u2026 No, mother?\u201d\u201cYes. The Duke said he would deliver it to My Lady. Did he not say anything?\u201dI said yes with a slight nod. The butler let out a low sigh and said politely.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you postpone your schedule a little bit? Because it\u2019s rude not to let anyone come all of a sudden and we don\u2019t have much time.\u201dWell, what do I do?I didn\u2019t have much free time, but it was difficult to firmly refuse him who spoke so politely.Moreover, it was my wedding preparation. It didn\u2019t make sense to me if the party fell out.Let\u2019s hear him first then decide.\u201cHow long should I postpone my schedule?\u201d\u201cI think two days will be enough.\u201dOnly two weeks left until the official test.Excluding travel time to the capital, my free time was about 10 days.I think it\u2019ll be okay if I take about two days.After completing the calculation in my head, I nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d*****Ver and the scholars had to work overtime for a week to prepare for the official test.It\u2019s all because of the needlessly picky Kalian.Without doing it himself, they had to put up with what he wanted over and over again, such as do this, do that, and so on.When he pointed that out like that, the words \u2018You should do it yourself!\u2019 had stuck in their throats hundreds of times.Still, they felt good because the result came out well.Kalian was also satisfied.Now that they had done all the test questions, they were going to go home.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dKalian stopped them. Ver stepped forward on behalf of the bewildered scholars.\u201cWe\u2019re going home now that we\u2019re done.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t go.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201d\u201cI said you can\u2019t go.\u201dAn eerie smile was drawn on Kalian\u2019s lips.\u201cThe test questions should not be leaked. So, stay in the Palace until the official test is over.\u201d\u201cNo, wait\u2026\u201dWhat kind of bullsh*t is this!Ver opened his mouth wide in bewilderment. The scholars\u2019 reactions weren\u2019t very different.\u201cA soft bed and delicious meals are guaranteed.\u201dAs Kalian clapped his hands, the servants appeared and grabbed their arms one by one from each side, as if waiting.At the same time, Ver, who was grabbed by the arms by the servants, screamed.\u201cThis is confinement! Confinement!\u201d\u201cConfinement, so disappointing.\u201dKalian smiled brightly.\u201cI\u2019m protecting you because I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019ll be bribed by other nobles who took the test.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t ne\u2026\u201d\u201cYou need it. \u201cWhen Kalian clapped again, the servants dragged the scholars away and quickly disappeared.The scholars, who realized that Kalian\u2019s will was firm, were quietly dragged away, but Ver was different.\u201cI, I want to go home!\u201dVer\u2019s scream echoed desperately in the corridor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUnexpectedly, I stayed in the mansion longer and had read all the books I brought with me.Countess Thebesa, who said she would come early in the morning, didn\u2019t come even when the sun was rising in the middle of the sky.Tired of waiting, and a bit bored, I headed to the study to find a book to read while waiting for Countess Thebesa.After the death of the former duke and his wife, I was the only one who used the duke\u2019s study.The real owner, Philen, returned, but he didn\u2019t even come near the study.He did go to the study in the capital\u2019s mansion, but that was only once. After that, he never went there anymore.So when I opened the door to the study without much thought, I stopped when I found a big, elongated silhouette standing in front of a bookshelf.\u201cPhilen?\u201dIt was then did he realize I was here. Philen looked back at me, slightly surprised.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cWhat about you? What brings you to the study?\u201d\u201cI was looking at the document and there was a weird part, so I tried to find it.\u201dI glanced at the book Philen was holding. On the outside of the thick book, the title \u2018Understanding Welfare\u2019 was written in large letters.Philen Williot and books. It wasn\u2019t a good combination. It was even more awkward because I rarely saw him holding a book.\u201cIsn\u2019t it your turn to answer now?\u201d\u201cI was bored waiting for the Countess, so I came here to pick a book to read in the meantime.\u201dPhilen stood aside from the bookshelf without saying a word.I thanked him with an eye gesture, then glanced through the books.I had read almost all the books in the study, so it was harder to find books I haven\u2019t read.I managed to find a book I hadn\u2019t read, but it was in a high place out of my reach.As I was looking around to find something to climb on, an arm stretched out and pulled out the book I wanted.\u201cThis is right?\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Thank you.\u201dI trembled a bit and reached out to receive the book.But Philen stared at the book without giving it to me.\u201cThe philosophy of essay. I don\u2019t think such a difficult book is suitable to read to pass the time.\u201d\u201cIs that so? I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, you brought a bunch of similar books.\u201dPhilen asked in a tone as if he suddenly remembered.\u201cWhat about all those books that you\u2019re looking for new ones?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve read it all.\u201d\u201cAll of that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a lot. There are only four books.\u201dIn the past, when I was busy living with work, I wouldn\u2019t be able to read a single book, but not now.I still even have time after reading the 4th book carefully.\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a duchess now, so why don\u2019t you read a book about the social world rather than a book like this?\u201d\u201cOf course I will. But before that, the official test comes first, so I\u2019ll read that first.\u201dPhilen\u2019s brows narrowed.\u201cYou still haven\u2019t given up on taking it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019d give up after it\u2019s notarized.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to apologize to Cecily for doing something wrong?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s you, would you want to apologize if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong?\u201dI snapped back, and Philen shook his head.\u201cYou needlessly have high self-esteem.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I learned from the former Duchess.\u201dA lady should always be proud.When you shouldn\u2019t yield, even if you had a knife on your neck you should never yield.\u2018Uphold your dignity as a Duchess.\u2019It was something that the former Duchess told me habitually when she was alive.\u201cI\u2019m just doing it faithfully, is there any problem?\u201dPhilen didn\u2019t say anything and kept his mouth shut.Well, if there\u2019s any problem, it meant that his mother\u2019s teaching was wrong, that\u2019s why he couldn\u2019t say it.\u201cSo, what are you going to do?\u201d\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cAbout the official test. If you pass, what are you going to do?\u201dHe said I would never pass, but he was thinking about it.It was a little surprising.\u201cWhat am I going to do? Of course, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\u201cThen who does the Duchess\u2019s work?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll do it too.\u201d\u201cHaa?\u201dPhilen tilted his head as if it was ridiculous.\u201cYou\u2019re going to do two things at the same time? Do you think that\u2019s possible?\u201d\u201cI did the Duchess\u2019s work while doing the Duke\u2019s work, so why do you think it\u2019s impossible?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all possible because it\u2019s the work of the same territory, not the official\u2019s work.\u201dPhilen sighed deeply as if he was frustrated.\u201cFurthermore, it\u2019s the aide of the Emperor. It must be quite a lot of work. Can you handle it while doing the Duchess\u2019s work?\u201dHmm, I guessed he\u2019s right\u2026What should I do then?I hadn\u2019t passed the test yet, so it\u2019s too early to think about it, but it was enough to make me think about it.\u201cShould I hire an aide too?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of aide, who would work on only the Duchess\u2019s work?\u201dPhilen chuckled and smirked.For a moment, I almost said something harsh because I became emotional, but I pressed it hard.Not as much as the duke\u2019s work, but the duchess\u2019s work was quite a lot too. It\u2019s not to the extent that he could ignore it.I didn\u2019t know why he\u2019s talking like that. He should have known it as he\u2019s been working on the duchess\u2019s work.\u201cThe former Duke also hired aides to take care of the estate while serving as the Knight Commander. Why can\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cMy father was a duke, and you\u2019re going to be a duchess. It doesn\u2019t make sense to think about it the same way.\u201dPhilen replied as if I was asking what was so obvious.\u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something. Your job is to support me, take care of the family, have and raise children, just like a mother did.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t forget that.\u201dEvery single word he said was right.The former Duchess also told me the same thing, and I took it for granted that I should do so.I did, but why?Why did I feel more annoyed and upset now than when I took it for granted?Even though I knew there\u2019s no justification to refute his words, I wanted to refute him. I didn\u2019t want to concede it.But I couldn\u2019t find the right word, so I ended up saying nothing and shut my mouth.Philen looked at me and smiled triumphantly.I didn\u2019t know if I could think like this, but\u2026 he was such a jerk.I looked at him as if wanting to hit him with crude words.And it was a pity that I couldn\u2019t.There\u2019s a subtle silence between Philen and me.It wasn\u2019t heavy, but it wasn\u2019t light either. Still, it was awkward.When I was about to say something, I heard a knock.\u201cCome in.\u201dIt was Misa who opened the door and came in. She bowed politely and said her reason for coming.\u201cCountess Thebesa is here.\u201dWas she finally here? What a relief. If I had kept talking to him, I would have been embarrassed in many ways.For the second time in my life, I was pleased with Countess Thebesa\u2019s presence.\u201cThe book, please give it to me.\u201dI reached out to Philen again because I needed a book to read after Countess Thebesa left.Philen looked alternately between the book and me, then put it higher than where it was taken out.What is this\u2026As I stared at him with disbelief eyes, Philen smiled provokingly.\u201cWhy are you looking at me with those eyes, Lady Thebesa?\u201dAre you asking because you really don\u2019t know?\u201cCountess Thebesa awaits. Don\u2019t do this here, let\u2019s go.\u201dPhilen held my shoulder affectionately and walked away.I thought he was pretending to be friendly because there was anyone around, but there wasn\u2019t.I could tell by looking at his mischievous twinkling eyes.They said eyes are the window of the heart.I didn\u2019t know why, but Philen looked very happy.*****The reason Countess Thebesa was late was because the wheel of her carriage was missing.\u201cOh no. When you go back, I will lend you the mansion\u2019s carriage.\u201d\u201cThank you for the favor, Duke.\u201d\u201cYou are the mother of the person who will become my wife. Of course, I have to do this.\u201dIt was a pretense remark, but Countess Thebesa smiled with satisfaction as if she liked it.Then I spoke to Countess Thebesa right away about the wedding preparation.I was leaving for the capital soon. If I had to hear the result of the test before going back, I would stay in the capital for 3 weeks at least. That\u2019s why I wanted to do what I had to do in the meantime.I hurried and Countess Thebesa laughed out loud.\u201cYou seem to have come to your senses now!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say weird things and please look at the dress quickly.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. We have to match the dress.\u201dCountess Thebesa nodded her head proudly.\u201cThe saying \u2018All people are useful\u2019 is just right. The day has finally come for you to help our family!\u201dYou\u2019re free to think what you want, but it seems to be on an abnormal level.I tried to cut her off and said that it would never happen, but I didn\u2019t say anything.Because I didn\u2019t want to give her such advice.My heart was like a chimney, wanting to finish quickly and go back to my room.After talking with the Countess for two days about the wedding preparation, it was pretty much settled.The things that I hadn\u2019t yet sorted out could be done after returning from the capital and the rest would be done by Countess Thebesa.If something didn\u2019t work out, they could send me a carrier pigeon or ask me through the magic communication tool.Anyway, this was all I had to do for now.\u201cSarah, we\u2019re going to the capital tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already ready!\u201dSarah answered vigorously.After stroking Sarah\u2019s hair as a sign that she did a good job, I sat on the sofa and opened a book.I had already read the book, but since it was interesting and there\u2019s nothing else to do, I thought I would go to bed after reading it.Sarah, who was cleaning up the surroundings, spoke as if she had suddenly remembered.\u201cMy Lady, do you like candy?\u201d\u201cCandy? Why all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI made candy with the kitchen staff during the day.\u201dSarah took out a small glass box and showed it to me.Inside were colorful candies. It looked pretty appetizing.\u201cWould you like to try it?\u201dI wasn\u2019t a big fan of sweets, but just one.\u201cThank you for the candy.\u201dI picked the red candy and ate it. The fresh and sweet strawberry flavor spread in my mouth.As I ate the strawberry candy, I suddenly remembered the strawberry candy that Kalian gave me.That strawberry candy was really delicious.\u201cIs it delicious?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cWould you like to try a different one?\u201dI shook my head. I wanted to keep the strawberry flavor that spread in my mouth for a long time.After reading the book moderately, I laid down on the bed.It\u2019s still too early to go to bed, but I had to leave early tomorrow, so I decided to go to bed.Pitch darkness fell comfortably. As I closed my eyelids, the darkness grew thicker.Soon, drowsiness came and I was sucked into the deep and comfortable abyss.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI fell into a deep sleep without knowing the passage of time, but then I woke up startled when I heard a loud bang.****Due to my busy schedule, I won\u2019t do any extra \u00a0kofi chapters at the moment.Lilia~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhat is this sound?I looked around in bewilderment.Soon, I noticed a loud flash of light outside the curtained window. There was also the sound of heavy rain.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201dHas the rainy season already come? No way. There\u2019s still a week left until the rainy season starts.I hurriedly opened the window and looked out.The endless raindrops hit the windowsill and splashed into my face.Because of the dark clouds, I couldn\u2019t tell if it was morning or night.It wasn\u2019t ordinary rain. And it didn\u2019t look like it would stop easily.Rumbling, bang!\u201cHig!\u201dI sat down with my ears covered at the sound of thunder hitting my ears.My body trembled and my eyes were blurred. The hand that covered my ears kept slipping down.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dMisa slammed the door open, ran, and hugged me tightly as I was shaking like a fool.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, My Lady.\u201d\u201cUgh, ughh.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just thunder. There\u2019s nothing to be scared of.\u201dI knew that too. But, what could I do about that that scared me?Misa comforted me, but like a fool, I couldn\u2019t calm myself down and cried endlessly.*****The rainy season started early. It\u2019s a week earlier than expected.It didn\u2019t matter much because we had already prepared for the rainy season, but the problem was me.It was impossible to ride the carriages because of the pouring rain.\u201cIt really can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cI truly apologize.\u201dThe driver bowed more and apologized.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize like that. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201dIt\u2019s all because of the rain.The thunder and lightning had stopped, but the rain was still pouring down.Even though I didn\u2019t know much about horses and carriages, riding a carriage in this weather was suicide.Nine years ago, the former Duke and his wife died in vain and it was because the carriage slipped in the rain.Thinking about it gave me a headache.Sarah asked anxiously as I frowned and ran my hand over my head.\u201cAre you okay, My Lady?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dI looked at the coachman with a smile.\u201cThen when can the carriage be ridden?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t give you a definite answer, but I think it will be possible in about 4 days.\u201dThere were only 12 days left until the test. Excluding the time to go to the capital, there were only 8 days left.It\u2019s a waste of 4 days, but there\u2019s no other way. Because I couldn\u2019t go to the capital through this kind of rain.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll wait for you, and I\u2019ll always be ready to leave. Let me know if it\u2019s possible to ride the carriage anytime.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dThen what should I do with my free time now?Had I known this would happen, I would have brought more books.I sighed at the unexpected situation.I was anxiously looking out the window, hoping the rain would stop soon, when I heard footsteps.I thought it was just a passerby, but the footsteps stopped behind me.Who is it?When I turned my head, I saw Countess Thebesa, who had been dressed lavishly since early hours.\u201cIt\u2019s raining a lot. Come to think of it, it\u2019s rainy season here.\u201d\u201c\u2026it seems like you can\u2019t go back to the mansion today.\u201dJust like I planned to leave for the capital, Countess Thebesa had also planned to return to the Count of Thebesa\u2019s mansion today.The wedding preparation wasn\u2019t complete yet, but she said she would go back for a while because she had business to do.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. The servant told me that the rain would subside in 4 days, so I have no choice but to stay here in the meantime.\u201dThat meant I had to keep looking at this unlucky woman\u2019s face.Cecily, Countess Thebesa.It was literally a mountain over a mountain.It felt like a disaster had come all at once.\u201cI had a conversation with the Duke yesterday. And I heard a weird story.\u201dCountess Thebesa said, rustling her feathered bucha.\u201cAre you thinking of taking the official test?\u201dDid Philen say that, too?\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dCountess Thebesa\u2019s reply was expected.I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll click her tongue saying \u2018what official test\u2019.\u201cWhat official test does a woman take?\u201dAs expected.It wasn\u2019t because Countess Thebesa hated me in particular. It was a normal reaction.Even Sarah, who followed me, was very surprised when I told her that I was taking the official test.Every time they did that, my answer was the same.\u201cThere\u2019s no law that says that a woman cannot take the official test.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but there\u2019s not a single woman who has managed to be an official so far.\u201dThe response to this was the same.\u201cJust because there hasn\u2019t been one doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be in the future.\u201d\u201cReally, who do you resemble to be so stubborn?\u201dCountess Thebesa frowned and folded her fan aloud.\u201cA woman\u2019s happiness comes from her family\u2019s happiness. So, don\u2019t do useless things, please the duke, take care of yourself, and stay quietly attached to the duke\u2019s family.\u201d\u201cHa.\u201dAs I let out a small laugh, Countess Thebesa\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201cIt seems like you found my words hilarious, huh?\u201d\u201cHow can I not laugh when you say that?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSo, are you happy?\u201dI looked at Countess Thebesa with a sneer on my lips.\u201cCount Thebesa has many mistresses, and the son of Thebesa looks happy with gambling. Do you feel happy seeing them like that?\u201dI deliberately touched Countess Thebesa\u2019s weakness.Countess Thebessa was speechless and her face flushed red.Her hand holding the fan trembled. The same goes for her extended eyelashes.\u201cYou b*tch are crazy, huh! Because you\u2019re going to be a duchess soon, you can\u2019t seem to see anything, huh?!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the one who can\u2019t see anything, but it\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think here is the Count of Thebesa, do you?\u201dHere was the Duke of Williot. It\u2019s not a place where Countess Thebesa could do as she will.When I made it clear, the Countess looked around in embarrassment.Although it was early, there were quite a few servants in the corridor.Countess Thebesa\u2019s face turned white as one of them ran somewhere.\u201c\u2026we\u2019ll see, Leila!\u201dCountess Thebesa gave me a venomous glance, then quickly disappeared.When I was young, those words and actions were frightening, but not anymore.There was nothing but laughter that came out. Not because it was pleasant or enjoyable, but because it was ridiculous.\u201cAre you okay, My Lady?\u201dA maid approached and asked.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dI answered briefly and looked out the window.It was still raining. I couldn\u2019t see anything outside the window.It was natural to rain since it was the rainy season, but this time it seemed to be severe.The maximum amount of precipitation might be achieved during this rainy season.\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201dWill I be able to take the official test?It was a hard-earned opportunity and I didn\u2019t want to miss it.I sincerely hoped again and again that the rain would stop in 4 days.*****It\u2019s been 3 days since the rainy season started.9 days left until the official test.It\u2019s time for the rain to gradually weaken, but instead of weakening, it became stronger and stronger.The coachman, who said I could leave tomorrow, said I had to wait 2 more days.Two days. If I spent two more days here, I only had 7 days left.Although there were still three days left, there\u2019s no guarantee that the once-postponed schedule would not be postponed again.And there\u2019s no way to know what might happen on the way to the capital.This made me worried that I might not be able to take the official test.My mouth was dry.I looked out the window anxiously.Rattle, bang!The door opened violently without knocking.It was a servant who opened the door.Perhaps he ran in a hurry, the servant was exhaling a rough breath.\u201cMy, My Lady! We\u2019re in trouble!\u201dRemnants of the past glimpsed over the shouting sound.The old memories of more than nine years. The prelude to the tragedy of the former Duke and his wife.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dWhen I sat down on the floor, the servant rushed to support me.\u201cAre you okay, My Lady?\u201dI wanted to answer calmly that I was okay, but I couldn\u2019t because the words couldn\u2019t come out.My head was throbbing.On the floor, the image of the dead Duke and his wife was drawn like a haze.\u201cMaid! Maid!\u201dWhen the servant called urgently, Misa rushed into the room.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dMisa also rushed to support me.\u201cOh my God, look at the cold sweat.\u201dMisa didn\u2019t mind getting her sleeves dirty and wiped the cold sweat from my forehead.I put myself in Misa\u2019s arms, closed my eyes tightly, and gasped for breath.Fortunately, the image of the terrible past quickly disappeared.I wasn\u2019t perfectly stable, but I regained my composure enough to speak, and looked back at the servant.\u201cWhat\u2019s\u2026 going on?\u201d\u201cAh, we, we\u2019re in trouble, My Lady!\u201dThe servant stomped his feet and shouted.\u201cIt is said that the riverbank downstream has burst!\u201d\u201c\u2026what?\u201dWhat is he saying? The riverbank burst?\u201cDidn\u2019t the riverbank repairs have been completed perfectly already? Why did the riverbank burst?\u201d\u201cI, I also that far\u2026\u201dYeah, you didn\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t a matter for a servant to know.\u201cI need to see the Duke right away.\u201dWhen I heard that Philen was in the office, I headed to the office and found Baron Wizard running urgently from the other side.\u201cBaron Wizard!\u201d\u201cMy Lady!\u201dBaron Wizard approached me almost like running.\u201cDid you hear the news?\u201d\u201cI have already heard that the riverbank downstream has burst. What is the damage?\u201d\u201cIt is said that the rice paddies and fields were all flooded, and the people who lived nearby were swept away by the ruptured river.\u201dThe rice paddies and fields were all flooded, and people were also harmed.I had to come up with measures immediately.To do that, I went into the office where Philen was with Baron Wizard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If it stays like this, there will be no crops left for the fall harvest.\u201d\u201cNot only downstream but also the riverbank upstream is collapsing little by little. As a result, the damage caused by floods is increasing. It must be stopped immediately.\u201dPhilen, who listened to the various opinions of the aides with a serious expression, nodded.\u201cLet\u2019s repair the riverbank first.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201dI tried to follow Philen\u2019s words as much as I could, but I couldn\u2019t stay still when I heard him say that.Only then did the aides realize that I was here and looked at me in surprise.Philen looked at me with displeased eyes.\u201cWhy is the Lady here?\u201d\u201cIs that important now? The important thing is to prevent flood damage!\u201dI strode over to the table they were sitting at and pointed out the window, where the rain was pouring down.\u201cIf we send people to repair the riverbank when it rains so much, there will be more casualties. So now, instead of repairing the riverbank, the priority is to evacuate people and wait for the rain to subside.\u201d\u201cThen what about the crops?\u201dWorrying about crops when people are dying.\u201cYou can grow crops again, but you can\u2019t bring people back to life if they die!\u201dI raised my voice out of frustration, and Philen looked at me in bewilderment.The same goes for the other aides.After a while, Philen, who came to his senses, nodded.\u201cAll right. Then, as the Lady said, let\u2019s discuss how to save people\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no time for discussion! People are dying even at this hour!\u201dIt was frustrating, it was very frustrating.Unable to wait for Philen\u2019s decision, I looked at the guard commander of the territory.\u201cSir Rohen, gather the guards into the mansion\u2019s hall right now. We\u2019re going to save people.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, My Lady.\u201dAs Sir Rohen walked out at a quick pace, I looked at the butler next.\u201cTake out all the carriages we have in the mansion and bring everyone who can drive them. The guards will bring the wounded, who cannot walk on their own, to the carriage.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dAfter the butler was the maid, Misa.\u201cWe will let the victims who lost their homes in the flood stay in the mansion\u2019s annex until the rain stops. Clean up the annex right now, and call all the doctors for the wounded.\u201d\u201cI will do it right away.\u201dAfter Misa went out and I was thinking for a moment about what to do next, I suddenly turned to Philen.He was looking at me with utter absurdity.He seemed to not like me doing his job.Of course.I was told that I should never go into the duke\u2019s work anymore. And now, it wasn\u2019t enough that I meddled, I even took the lead on my own. He couldn\u2019t have liked it.But what could I do?I had no time to explain it to him, to convince him, and to wait for his approval.Every minute and every second was precious.\u201cIf it\u2019s a punishment for breaking the order, I\u2019ll gladly accept it later. If a problem occurs, I\u2019ll gladly accept the punishment for it too.\u201dI bowed my head towards Philen.\u201cRight now, saving people is our priority, so please be generous.\u201dPhilen didn\u2019t answer my request, but there\u2019s no time to wait for his answer.At this time, I had to save as many people as possible.I hurried to the mansion\u2019s hall where the guards were gathered.*****Unexpected floods in the early rainy season.Although there\u2019s series of bad news, the damage wasn\u2019t significant thanks to Leila\u2019s quick response.Was that all?She took care of the flood victims by letting them stay in the mansion\u2019s annex.People praised Leila as it spread widely among the people that it was Leila, not Philen, who led all this.\u201cAs expected of Young Lady Leila! It\u2019s really reassuring to have her here.\u201d\u201cI hope she will soon become the duchess officially.\u201d\u201cRight. I hope she takes care of us for a long, long time.\u201d\u201cBy the way, why did the riverbank burst suddenly?\u201dThe sudden question that popped up out of nowhere spread widely among the people.It was the maid, who worked at Williot\u2019s mansion, who answered their question.The maid told the people that it was Philen, not Leila, who prepared for this rainy season.She told them.That Philen told Leila to never interfere with the duke\u2019s affairs.Everyone who heard the news clicked their tongues altogether.\u201cOh my, the foolish lord almost killed a lot of people because of his needless pride.\u201d\u201cThe Lord, really. If he doesn\u2019t know anything, just leave it to the young lady.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. How competent our young lady is.\u201dThe more competent Leila was, the more highlighted Philen\u2019s incompetence was.Some joked that it would be better for Leila to become the lord and rule the territory.The jokes that people spat out unintentionally became a sharp weapon to some.The weapon that tore someone else\u2019s pride apart.*****It wasn\u2019t as big as the main building, but it was still the annex of Duke Williot\u2019s.It was big enough to accommodate hundreds of flood victims.I was just worried that we didn\u2019t have enough manpower to take care of them all.Thankfully, the worries disappeared thanks to the support from healthy people.After the flood damage had been dealt with to some extent, I investigated why the riverbank burst.That way, the riverbank could be repaired and any deficiencies could be filled in as soon as the rainy season was over.It was originally Philen\u2019s job, but I wanted to take responsibility for what I had decided to do.I carefully looked at the document about the preparation for the rainy season that Baron Wizard brought.I didn\u2019t see anything that could be a problem.It was just as I remembered it.Then what\u2019s the problem?Was it simply because it rained a lot this year?Or poor construction?As I checked the last chapter of the document, thinking about various possibilities, I found a part that was different from my memory.\u201cBaron Wizard.\u201dThe riverbank collapsed not because it rained a lot this year, nor because of poor construction.\u201cWhy is the budget halved?\u201dNo, poor construction was right.There\u2019s no way they could do a proper construction with half the budget than what I had set.\u201cWho cut the budget like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s the Duke.\u201dBaron Wizard answered with a gloomy expression.\u201cI wanted to talk to My Lady about that, but I couldn\u2019t say anything because the Duke kept interrupting me. I apologize.\u201d\u201cThe Baron has nothing to apologize for.\u201dBecause I knew the fact that Philen interrupted me too.Maybe the reason you tried to talk to me before was this.\u201cIf the budget had been reduced, a new document should have been prepared.\u201d\u201cYes. Here it is.\u201dI checked the new document that Baron Wizard gave me.Most of them were similar except for the budget, but there were two notable differences.The wizard\u2019s employment was canceled and the stone used to build the riverbank had changed. It was that.I couldn\u2019t believe he turned the stone into Ahnam, let alone the wizard\u2019s employment.\u201cDid you not explain to the Duke that there\u2019s a lot of \u2018Quan\u2019 in our territory\u2019s water vein?\u201d\u201cI have explained. However, there are many Quan components in other rivers as well, and saying I\u2019m making a big fuss\u2026\u201dBaron Wizard didn\u2019t finish his words, but I could guess what he was going to say.Obviously, Philen ignored his words and pushed ahead.It wasn\u2019t unreasonable for Philen to not understand Baron Wizard\u2019s words.Because no one knew, even the former duke and his wife, that the Williot territory\u2019s water vein contained a lot of \u2018Quan\u2019.I also found it by accident while analyzing various things to solve the drought in the territory.\u2018Quan\u2019 was harmless to humans or animals and plants, but unfortunately, it had very poor compatibility with \u2018Ahnam\u2019.The main factor that rapidly corroded the Ahnam was \u2018Quan\u2019.For this reason, I chose Doreseok instead of Ahnam, which was commonly used to build riverbanks.Doreseok was several times more expensive than Ahnam, and it was difficult to handle, but there\u2019s nothing we could do about it.It\u2019s better than floods that caused flood victims.\u2026am I the only one who thinks so?\u201cSo you did the repair work with Ahnam?\u201d\u201cYes. And\u2026\u201d\u201cAll the repaired parts must have been punctured.\u201dIt was obvious even if I didn\u2019t say it.Baron Wizard smiled awkwardly and nodded.If they removed all the banks made of Doreseok and rebuilt them with Ahnam, they would have withstood even if they were corroded once.However, as only the repair work was done with Ahnam, the thin Ahnam would quickly corrode, resulting in flooding.The amount of damage was several times the amount Philen had saved.The time it took to put it all back together was incalculable in money.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dIt was a disrespectful word to say to the Duke, but there\u2019s no other way to explain my feelings and the current situation other than these words.Baron Wizard thought so too, as he sighed silently.\u201cI need to tell this to the Duke first.\u201dThis was the work for Philen to do in the future.So it would be good to let him know where the problem came from and what to do in the future.\u201cShall I go with you?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll go alone.\u201dThat way, we can talk comfortably.I took all the previous documents and all the new ones that Philen had done.Ah, in case he didn\u2019t know, I had to bring the report about Quan as well. The report just happened to be in my room.After I had everything, my hands were heavy.I left the room with documents in my arms.When I asked the servant where Philen was, he said he was at the indoor training ground.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cUm, My Lady.\u201dAs I briefly thanked him and was about to go to Philen, the servant called me carefully.\u201cI think you better be careful.\u201d\u201cCareful. Of what?\u201d\u201cThe Duke. He seemed to be in quite a bad mood.\u201dPhilen was in a bad mood? Did someone offend him?\u201cThank you for telling me in advance.\u201dAfter thanking the servant once again, I headed to the indoor training ground where Philen was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And do some cleaning again.After checking that there\u2019s nothing else to worry about, I entered the training ground.Philen was wielding a wooden sword half-naked. Thick drops of sweat dripped down on his hard muscles.It was somewhat of an obscene scene, but it didn\u2019t make me excited. Because it\u2019s a scene that I saw often in the past.So I looked at him calmly, and the same goes for Philen.He showed me his bare skin and didn\u2019t falter in the slightest.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here because of the problem of the preparation for the rainy season.\u201dI put down the documents I had brought on the table near him and held out the new document he filled out.\u201cI checked the document you filled out and found that you canceled the wizard\u2019s employment and changed the stone used to build the riverbank from Doreseok to Ahnam.\u201d\u201c\u2026so?\u201dThis time, I presented the report on Quan.\u201cAs you can see here, there\u2019s Quan in our territory\u2019s water vein\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do you call it \u2018our territory\u2019?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not Leila Williot yet. But why did you call this territory \u2018our territory\u2019? It\u2019s \u2018my territory\u2019.\u201dWhat kind of childish pun is this?As I stared at him without saying anything out of absurdity, Philen put down his wooden sword and approached me.\u201cPerhaps, you want to be the Lord?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf not, why are you doing this when I told you not to?\u201dPhilen slammed the document I held out. The papers fell to the floor like snow.\u201cI\u2019m sure I have told you not to get involved in the duke\u2019s work, so why did you meddle as you pleased?\u201dPhilen\u2019s face hardened terribly. He also looked like he was hurt.The servant\u2019s words, telling me to be careful because he seemed to be in quite a bad mood, echoed in my ears.I should have come later.I felt regret that came too late.\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it if you were talking about what happened in the office at that time. People\u2019s lives are in danger if we don\u2019t act quickly\u2026\u201d\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have stepped up, you should have told me!\u201dHis voice echoed loudly in the indoor training ground that was closed off from all sides.\u201cThat\u2019s the rule, you\u2019re not going to say you don\u2019t know, are you?\u201d\u201cOf course I know. But sometimes you have to put people first rather than sticking to rules. That was the case back then.\u201dI calmly faced the fierce Philen\u2019s gaze and explained it as easily as possible for him to understand.\u201cAs I said, it had to be dealt with as quickly as possible. So, I thought it would be faster to step up than to report to you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that. You probably wanted to show off your skills to people.\u201dPhilen\u2019s lips tilted obliquely.\u201cIsn\u2019t it because you want to show that you\u2019re more competent than me and that you fit the position of the lord?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be true!\u201d\u201cWell. I\u2019m not sure I can believe you.\u00a0 How can I believe you when you spread that rumor?\u201dThat rumor?\u201cLast warning, Leila. Don\u2019t do as you please.\u201dA voice as cold as ice pierced my ears.\u201cGet your hands off everything.\u201dPhilen tapped me on the shoulder and walked past me.\u201cIf you ignore my words one more time and do as you please, I won\u2019t let you off anymore.\u201dHis footprints were clearly engraved on the paper that had fallen to the floor.*****I didn\u2019t know with what mind I left the training ground. I was in my room when I came to my senses.\u201cMy Lady. You are here.\u201dMisa found me and rushed to me.\u201cNow in the annex\u2026\u201d\u201cStop, Misa.\u201dI held my throbbing head and waved my hand.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, discuss it with the Duke, not me.\u201d\u201cYes? But\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Duke said he\u2019d do it himself. So, talk to the Duke about it.\u201dWhen I spoke firmly, Misa nodded as if she couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cMore than that, Misa, are there any strange rumors circulating among the people?\u201d\u201cWhat strange rumors do you mean?\u201d\u201cHmm, like I\u2019m more competent than the Duke\u2026 rumors like that?\u201dMisa\u2019s expression darkened in an instant. There really seemed to be a strange rumor circulating.\u201cWhat exactly is the rumor?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a rumor. It\u2019s not something My Lady should care about.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to me to decide. Tell me.\u201dAfter sighing softly, Misa told me the rumor that was circulating among the people.Starting with the story that I was more competent than Philen.Then the whole story about the people that want me to become the lord, not Philen.That\u2019s why Philen reacted like that.It was only then did I understand Philen\u2019s reaction. But it was ridiculous for him to think that I was the one who made such a rumor.Spreading rumors like that wouldn\u2019t do me any good. It just made me lose all my face.But, even if I told Philen this now, he wouldn\u2019t believe me.When the deep emotional gap between him and me was clearly visible, I thought it was an opportunity to go to take the official test.\u2026in many ways.*****I thought Philen would tell Countess Thebesa to stop preparing for the wedding right away, but strangely enough, he didn\u2019t.I never heard of that from Sarah. But rather, I heard he urged her to prepare for the wedding as soon as possible.Are you going to marry me in this situation?What on earth are you thinking, Philen?I really wanted to look into his head.In the quiet cold war, time continued to flow, entering the 7th day since the rainy season began.From the 5th day, the rain gradually became thinner, and by the 7th day, it had hardly rained.People cheered for this, but I couldn\u2019t be happy.It was because there were only five days left until the official test.There\u2019s no time for further delay. I have to go to the capital quickly.I packed a simple bag and hurried to find the coachman with Sarah.However,\u201cWe can\u2019t use the carriage?\u201d\u201cI apologize, My Lady.\u201dThe coachman bowed his head to the ground.\u201cThere is only one carriage available right now, and that carriage will be used by the Duke today.\u201dIt was the result of using carriages to save the people.I had no regrets because I was able to save a lot of people thanks to it, but it still was unbearable.\u201cI don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s a luggage carriage.\u201d\u201cI apologize, but we don\u2019t even have a luggage carriage available right now.\u201dOh my, not even a luggage carriage?I wish I could ride a horse.It was regrettable that I couldn\u2019t learn horseback riding because I was so busy with other things.Then the only option left was to ask Philen to lend me the carriage.I didn\u2019t want to run into Philen as much as possible, but\u2026 there\u2019s no other way.Because I couldn\u2019t give up the official test.There\u2019s no time to lose.I went to see Philen right away, and I ran into him while on the way.Philen wasn\u2019t alone. There\u2019s Cecily next to him.Cecily, who made eye contact with me, tried to bow lightly to greet me, but Philen wrapped his arms around her shoulders.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to greet her like that when your body is heavy.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dCecily looked me in the eye and blurred her words.\u201cYour body is heavy, I\u2019m sure even Lady Thebesa will understand.\u201dPhilen pulled Cecily further into his arms and looked straight at me.\u201cBecause she values people more than rules. Isn\u2019t that right, Lady Thebesa?\u201d\u2026that\u2019s what I said before.I never thought he\u2019d return it sarcastically like this.It\u2019s ridiculous.When I stared at him, Philen smiled the winner\u2019s smile.\u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201dI had nothing to say. What could I say?Why would I be mad at him for returning the words that way? or grumbling over it?Either way was futile.I was just going to offend him for nothing, and I didn\u2019t want to do that as much as greeting Cecily.\u201cWhat the Duke said is correct.\u201dSo when I acquiesced, Philen\u2019s face was subtly wrinkled.Philen looked at me intently, as if trying to gauge my intentions, and opened his mouth.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cI want to go to the capital.\u201dPhilen turned to Sarah behind me. To be precise, to the luggage she was carrying.\u201cThe flood victims issue is not over yet, and you\u2019re going to the capital already?\u201d\u201cNot already. There are only five days left until the official test. Even if I leave now, I\u2019m running out of time.\u201dI took a moment to catch my breath and then added.\u201cAnd thanks to the Duke\u2019s good handling of the flood victims, I don\u2019t need to stay here as I have nothing to do.\u201d\u201cAre you being sarcastic now, Lady?\u201dNow, even if I compliment you, you think I\u2019m being sarcastic?I sighed deeply on the inside but smiled on the outside.\u201cThat can\u2019t be true.\u201dPhilen clicked his tongue as if he didn\u2019t like it and turned away from the topic.\u201cIf you go to the capital, We\u2019ll see each other in two weeks at the most. Have a safe trip, Lady.\u201d\u201cI have a favor to ask you about that, Duke.\u201dFrom now on, it was the main point.I thought I should ask him, but when I was about to say it, I got nervous and squeezed the inside of my sleeve.\u201cThere is only one carriage available in the mansion now.\u201d\u201cSo, are you asking for that carriage?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t use it for long. When I get to the next town, I\u2019ll rent another carriage\u2026\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dBefore I could finish my words, Philen cut it off and flatly refused.I thought he might be nasty to me, but I didn\u2019t expect him to refuse so firmly like that.\u201cJust one day, I only need to use it for one day. I\u2019ll give it back to you as soon as I get to the next town\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s more important to the Lady, saving people or taking the official test?\u201dI was speechless at the sudden question.I didn\u2019t know why he\u2019s asking such a question, but if I had to choose between the two, of course\u2026\u201cSaving people.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go do that now.\u201dPhilen wrapped his arms around Cecily\u2019s shoulders and passed me by.As they approached, the coachman hurriedly opened the carriage door.Philen let Cecily in the carriage first and then looked back at me.\u201cSo, My Lady, who values people more than anything else, please understand with a great generosity.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because it\u2019s all her fault.\u201dWho told her to use all the carriages in the mansion without thinking?The carriage that Philen was riding now was a historic carriage used by the Duke of Williot for generations.Thanks to the servants\u2019 inability to use this and leaving it behind, it was able to stay intact.\u201cAnd since she won\u2019t pass the official test anyway, it\u2019s better for her not to take it. It would be even more disgraceful if she went in vain and fell.\u201d\u201cOh my. Phil still thinks of Lady Thebesa even in this situation.\u201dAs Cecily looked at him as if she was genuinely admiring, Philen shrugged.\u201cNo matter how much I hate her, she is the woman who will be my wife. I have to take care of her.\u201dMy wife.The corners of Cecily\u2019s lips, which went up smoothly, hardened slightly, but Philen didn\u2019t notice it.\u201cAs expected, a kind person. You\u2019ll take care of our child who will be born soon too, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dPhilen nodded as if she was asking what\u2019s so obvious.\u201cThen what about me?\u201dCecily carefully asked what she was most curious about, as the flow of the conversation went as she wanted.By then, Philen erased his smile and looked at Cecily closely.It was as if he was judging what intention she had by saying this.It\u2019s not the time yet.Well, she\u2019s still holding out. But there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll give her room.After completing the calculation in her head, Cecily quickly withdrew.\u201cI\u2019m satisfied with just being able to see my child often.\u201dNot \u2018our\u2019 but \u2018my\u2019 child.Cecily didn\u2019t let go of her monopoly on the child, even while she was withdrawing, and Philen admitted it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll see the child often.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course, I promise.\u201d\u201cIt made me happy.\u201dCecily smiled brightly and fell into Philen\u2019s arms.\u201cI hope our child can be born as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cSame goes for me.\u201dPhilen replied, stroking Cecily\u2019s back affectionately.\u201cI hope he can be born soon.\u201d*****An hour before the official test began.\u201cOf the 200 applicants, exactly 171 have entered the test hall so far.\u201dVer reported to Kalian with a sullen look.Kalian smiled and looked at Ver.\u201cYou seem dissatisfied with me.\u201d\u201cThen, must I not be dissatisfied with you not letting me go home? I\u2019m almost dying because of it!\u201d\u201cI think so, considering your skin is glossy. You have a good complexion too.\u201dOf course, it was.There\u2019s no way his complexion could get worse as he continued to receive delicious meals on his soft bed.Still, it was a palace. It couldn\u2019t be more comfortable than home.\u201cAfter the official test is over, I can go home, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. At that time, even if you insist you don\u2019t want to go, I\u2019ll push you on the back. So don\u2019t worry.\u201dOnly then did Ver smile brightly.Was it that good? This made him feel like he had become a bad boss.Kalian chuckled and accepted the list handed by Ver.He just glanced through it, and he seemed to know who the seven people Ver was talking about.They were that famous. They were people who immediately came to mind when someone saw their names.However.Flutter, flutter\u2013Why\u2026Flutter, flutter\u2013\u201c\u2026isn\u2019t there Leila Thebesa\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cLeila Thebesa, do you mean Duke Williot\u2019s fianc\u00e9e?\u201dEveryone said that when someone mentioned Leila Thebesa.Ver didn\u2019t say anything special or strange.But why do I feel so bad?Kalian stroked his chin and thought for a moment, but couldn\u2019t find the cause.\u201cWhy are you looking for that Lady all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 I heard she took the test, but I couldn\u2019t see her name.\u201d\u201cAh, I remember seeing her name on the applicant\u2019s list too.\u201dVer checked the list that Kalian gave again and nodded.\u201cCertainly, the Lady doesn\u2019t have her name on it.\u201d\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t she take the test?\u201dVer wanted to ask why he was curious about it, but he said his own opinion instead.\u201cWell, I can\u2019t be sure because I\u2019m not the party involved, but if I dare to guess, she must have been scared and ran away?\u201d\u201c\u2026scared?\u201d\u201cBecause there\u2019s a lot of famous people from various fields who took the test. I, too, would have been scared.\u201dVer hated it and clicked his tongue.\u201cIs that so?\u201dKalian answered indifferently. He leaned against the window and looked out the window.It was a face with a lot of thoughts. Dissatisfaction and worries were also seen.Ver asked bluntly.\u201cYou seem dissatisfied and worried that the Lady is not coming to take the test.\u201dKalian smiled slightly awkwardly and looked back at Ver.\u201cIs it too obvious?\u201d\u201cVery. And didn\u2019t you make it obvious on purpose so that I can notice it?\u201d\u201c\u2026you know me too well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been five years since I\u2019ve been with you, Your Majesty.\u201dVer trembled as he spat out the words that made him feel disgusted.\u201cSo, shall we find out? The reason why Lady Thebesa didn\u2019t come to take the test.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dKalian waved indifferently.\u201cIt\u2019s not something you can know right away just by doing an investigation, and you\u2019ll find out only after the test is over, so what\u2019s the use?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201dVer nodded in agreement with Kalian\u2019s words.\u201cThen, there are only 30 minutes left before the test begins, so I\u2019ll go to the test hall now.\u201dVer was the test\u2019s general supervisor. This was also ordered by Kalian.He couldn\u2019t believe other people. So what could he do?It\u2019s not enough to prepare the questions, but also to supervise the test.Being an aide was a harsh job in many ways.Laughing at those who took the test, dreaming of a hopeful future without knowing this, Ver bowed to Kalian.\u201cWait.\u201dKalian raised his lean body.\u201cI\u2019m going too.\u201d\u201cCra\u2026 Hmm, mmm.\u201dVer, who was almost asking Kalian if he was crazy for a moment, swallowed his words in a hurry.Ver had been an aide to Kalian since he was a prince. He was one of the loyalists who stayed by Kalian\u2019s side even during his most difficult times.Kalian took that into account and was very considerate of Ver.Thanks to this, Ver was able to express his opinions more freely than other people, but everything had lines.He knew that it wasn\u2019t okay to ask if he was crazy.At least in this situation.\u201cAre you going to supervise the test yourself?\u201d\u201cIs it wrong?\u201d\u201cThere is nothing wrong with it, but if Your Majesty supervises the test himself, everyone will be nervous and will not be able to take the test properly.\u201d\u201cIf they don\u2019t have that much of a wall, they shouldn\u2019t apply for an aide.\u201d\u2026where on earth did that standard come from?Even if I ask, it will be his own standard.Ver clicked his tongue inwardly and shook his head.He didn\u2019t want to take Kalian with him as much as possible for the poor people who were probably very nervous about the test, but\u2026\u201cThis way.\u201dUnfortunately, Ver had no justification or power to stop him.And so, Ver headed to the test hall with Kalian.\u201cHig.\u201d\u201cYour, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cI, I greet Your Majesty, the Emperor!\u201dAs expected, as soon as they saw Kalian\u2019s face, they greeted him in bewilderment.The commoners who had an audience with the emperor for the first time in their lives fell flat on the floor.Kalian looked around the test hall indifferently.He expected it from the moment he checked the list, but they were all men.There were no women, including supervisors and scholars assigned for scoring.Although it was written in the official announcement that women can take the test, Leila was the only woman who took it.Numerous commoners, even those who had recently become commoners from slaves, took the test, but there were no women.Well, is it obvious?Because there had never been a case in the empire\u2019s history where a woman became an official.There were often times when a woman became an official of the territory, but never once became an official of the empire.It was ironic.The empire\u2019s laws didn\u2019t explicitly state that women are not supposed to be the officials of the Empire.But in the long history of the empire of 700 years, there had never been a woman who became an official of the empire. It was surprising and ironic.He could understand why people took it for granted.Is that why you ran away, Leila Thebesa?When the official test was going to start, his eyes sting.Or maybe she ran away because Philen rebuked saying \u2018what official\u2019 to her?Is that why she\u2019s breaking her promise to me?Even though he didn\u2019t think he would have any lingering feelings for her if that was the case, the lingering feelings were still there. And so, his gaze turned to the door.He had a feeling that Leila would come in even now.\u201cTen minutes left until the test begins.\u201dBut a feeling was just a feeling, it was different from reality.That woman, didn\u2019t come.As expected, did she give up on the test?Kalian\u2019s eyes darkened.\u201cEveryone, please sit down.\u201dFollowing the supervisor\u2019s instructions, the people sat down in unison.The supervisor waited a little longer, and when there\u2019s five minutes left, he turned to Kalian.Kalian was still looking at the door.\u201cMay we close the door, Your Majesty?\u201dThe supervisor asked politely, but Kalian didn\u2019t answer.It was the same no matter how many times he called.When the supervisor was at a loss, Ver sighed deeply and stood right in front of Kalian.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dOnly then did Kalian react.\u201cMay we close the door?\u201d\u201c\u2026how much time left?\u201d\u201cOne minute left.\u201dOnly one minute left?If it\u2019s until now, it is safe to say that she won\u2019t come now.I have to throw away the lingering feelings I have.As much as he had expected in his heart, the disappointment that came to him was great.Kalian turned around with a cloudy look.\u201cClose the door.\u201dThe moment when the huge stone door was about to close with a loud noise.\u201cPlease wait!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA desperate familiar voice could be heard through the half-closed door.\u201cPlease wait a minute!\u201dThis voice\u2026Kalian, who was about to go back, stopped on the spot. His head turned on its own.Ver, who confirmed Kalian\u2019s reaction, gestured.\u201cOpen the door again.\u201dThe huge half-closed stone door opened again.After a while, a woman in a slightly messy dress rushed into the stone door.Her hair, which was not properly groomed, was a mess, and her dress was also shabby.\u201cHaa haa.\u201dPerhaps the woman had run in a hurry, she stood still and caught her breath for a moment.\u201cThank, you.\u201dIn the meantime, it was funny seeing her not forget to say thank you to the servants.Everyone in the test hall, including Kalian, looked at the woman.Except for Kalian and Ver, most of them thought she was just a woman who came here for a business.They didn\u2019t think she was an examinee for the official test like they were.That\u2019s because there\u2019s no precedent for a woman to become an official of the empire.Besides, it\u2019s not a short-term job, but an aide to the emperor.A woman in such an important position?It was ridiculous. It couldn\u2019t have happened.In the midst of everyone\u2019s murmuring, Kalian glanced at Ver.Ver, who knew what Kalian wanted, sighed quietly and approached the woman.The woman, who was catching her breath with her upper body bent slightly, straightened her back as Ver approached.Her outfit was a bit shabby and messy, but the dignity that couldn\u2019t be hidden flowed out from the woman.It was just eye contact, but he thought that he shouldn\u2019t dare to treat her recklessly.As expected, a noble is a noble.Ver placed his hand on his chest and greeted her politely.\u201cMy name is Ver Delrond. You are Lady Leila Thebesa, right?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dWhen the woman, Leila, answered, the people murmured once again.Philen Williot\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.The woman who will soon become Duchess Williot.The daughter of Count Thebesa.\u2026and the illegitimate child of Count Thebesa.BANG-\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe people, who were murmuring as they looked at Leila, turned to look at Kalian in surprise when he slammed the table hard.\u201cNoisy.\u201dKalian, who was seated on the highest seat, looked at the people as sharp as a well-forged blade.The people hurriedly lowered their eyes for fear of making eye contact with Kalian.\u201cIt\u2019s already past the test time, so everyone shut up.\u201dEveryone shut their mouths at once as if cold water had been poured by Kalian\u2019s words.Even the supervisors stood still with their mouths shut, but there were only two people moving.\u201cUmm, is it too late for me to take the test?\u201dOne was Leila.\u201cNo way.\u201dThe other was Ver.\u201cNumber 172.\u201dHe smiled brightly and handed the test identification slip to Leila Thebesa.\u201cThe test has to begin now. So please take a seat, Lady Leila Thebesa.\u201d*****The fact that Leila took the official test spread through the people\u2019s mouths even before the test was over.Each person said different things, but the context was the same.They thought it was ridiculous for Leila to take the official test.And wouldn\u2019t that lady soon become a Duchess?Why would she take the official test?She wouldn\u2019t be able to pass it anyway.Without proper education, it was impossible for a lady to pass the official test.Moreover, they said that this test had the highest difficulty ever.Even Raymond Logan, who was known for being a genius, shook his head when he saw the test questions.That\u2019s why people were convinced that Leila wouldn\u2019t be able to pass the test.No one expected Leila to pass the test as the top.Even Kalian.*****\u201cThe top?\u201dKalian asked Ver, in a daze.\u201cLady Thebesa as the top?\u201dVer expressed his affirmation in silence. He, too, was very perplexed.From the moment he heard that Raymond Logan was taking the official test, Ver knew he would be on the top.It was the same with Kalian.The official test was held to officially recruit Leila, but Raymond Logan\u2019s application was unexpected.He never expected Logan to apply for the official test when he gave his resignation letter.So, he was worried about what to do, but Leila took the top spot, beating Raymond Logan.\u201cIsn\u2019t something wrong?\u201d\u201cThis is the Lady\u2019s answer sheet.\u201dIt\u2019s better to show it directly than to explain it verbally.Ver showed Kalian the answer sheet, which scholars praised so much that made their mouths dry.How on earth did she write her answer so well that scholars scored her higher than Raymond Logan?He was very curious. Kalian perused the answer sheet silently.After a while,\u201c\u2026well written.\u201dAfter reading it carefully, Kalian briefly expressed what he thought.If other people heard it, they would say it was an indifferent evaluation, but this was the highest compliment that Kalian could give.Even Ver, who had been working with him for a long time, had rarely heard compliments with \u2018well\u2019.Most of them ended with \u2018good job\u2019.\u201cVery well written.\u201dHowever, he gave that compliment not once, but twice, even to the point of \u2018very\u2019, but Ver wasn\u2019t surprised at all and nodded calmly.Leila\u2019s answer was perfect, even in his eyes.If you write a long sentence in a short period of time, the second half usually falls apart because of your urgency, but Leila\u2019s answer was all neat.All 7 answers.The answer sheet was so perfectly written, she would be good at filling out the documents.Ver\u2019s eyes twinkled like there\u2019s stars on them.Ver put his hand on Kalian\u2019s desk and leaned his upper body toward him.\u201cPlease give her to me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dKalian\u2019s eyebrow tilted obliquely at the words that came out of nowhere.\u201cLady Thebesa is not a thing.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way. I meant to ask you to recruit her as an aide as soon as possible. I want to see Lady Thebesa\u2019s work quickly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it. You want to hand over your work quickly.\u201dKalian smiled and pinched his true intention. Then Ver replied with a nonchalant smile.\u201cThat too as well. After all, Your Majesty is going to recruit Lady Thebesa.\u201d\u201cI am, but\u2026 will it be okay?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe recruited one is Lady Thebesa.\u201dThat\u2019s why, what\u2019s wrong with that?Ver blinked as he couldn\u2019t understand what Kalian meant and looked at him.Kalian said in more detail with a subtle face.\u201cLady Thebesa is a woman.\u201dVer replied indifferently.\u201cWell, she doesn\u2019t look like a man.\u201d\u201cUntil now, women have never been officials of the empire.\u201dAh, it was because of that.Only then did Ver realize what Kalian was trying to say and replied with a small smile.\u201cI know, right? It\u2019s not prohibited by law, so why hasn\u2019t there been one yet?\u201dHis answer was that he didn\u2019t care at all for Leila to become an aide.As expected, it\u2019s good to have him by my side.Kalian stood up, smiling happily.\u201cWhere is Lady Thebesa?\u201d\u201cShe is waiting outside the palace.\u201dOf course, Leila wasn\u2019t waiting of her own accord.Seeing her answer sheet, Ver knew this would happen and immediately held her back.\u201cHis Majesty said that he wanted to see the Lady separately. Please wait for a moment, Lady Thebesa.\u201dTo that end, he didn\u2019t hesitate to use Kalian\u2019s name.Well, how is it? It will be true soon anyway.\u201cI want to see her separately.\u201dSee? It is true.Ver smiled and bowed his head.\u201cYes.\u201d*****My body trembled slightly as the cold air touched my exposed shoulders and neck.At the hem of the skirt was densely studded with expensive jewels.Don\u2019t tell me, it\u2019s not going to fall, right?I looked at the jewels with anxious eyes.If it was my dress, I would only feel sorry if I lost the jewels, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel worried because the dress was borrowed from the emperor.According to the maids\u2019 opinion, my original dress was inappropriate for an audience with the emperor, so I had to change into this dress.And before that, my messy hair was washed thoroughly and groomed.I walked carefully with the skirt up in case something dirty got on the dress.\u201cWelcome, Lady Thebesa.\u201dThe person who came to meet me was the man I had met at the test hall.His name had to be Ver Delrond. His title was baron.Even a three-year-old child knew that he was the emperor\u2019s aide.The emperor\u2019s only aide, Ver Delrond, was famous in many ways.Whether in a good sense or in a bad sense.The most famous thing was \u2018his job\u2019.\u201cHis Majesty is waiting. Come this way.\u201dAt the emperor\u2019s palace, Ver himself, not Sylvia, guided me.After passing through the long corridor decorated with splendor and elegance, we entered the drawing-room.Kalian was sitting on a red velvet sofa.\u201cLeila Thebesa, I greet the sun of the Empire.\u201d\u201cCome here and sit down.\u201dAs I sat across from Kalian, the maid set refreshments on the table.When the maid left, Kalian opened his mouth.\u201cYour appearance has cleaned up.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dMy ears blushed and I bowed my head.\u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t intend to come to the test hall like that, but somehow\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter if you smell or not.\u201dKalian smiled mischievously.\u201cSeeing that appearance, I can see something must have happened.\u201dI expressed my affirmation in silence.Kalian leaned leisurely on the sofa and asked.\u201cMay I ask what happened?\u201dWhat should I do? Should I tell him?I thought about it because it wasn\u2019t a very pleasant story, but I slowly opened my mouth.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42\u201c\u2026the rainy season has begun in Williot territory.\u201dIt might sound a little out of the blue, but to explain what happened, I had to say this.It started with the fact that I was stranded in the estate due to the early rainy season.To make matters worse, the riverbank collapsed, causing a great flood.All the carriages except for Duke Williot\u2019s carriage were put in to save the territory\u2019s people.As a result, all the carriages were broken, and there were no carriages to ride on.\u2026I didn\u2019t tell him that Philen didn\u2019t lend me the only remaining Duke Williot\u2019s carriage.Not because I thought of Philen, but it was because of my face.I didn\u2019t want to let other people know that I was a fianc\u00e9e who was ignored by her fianc\u00e9.\u201c\u2026so I was in a difficult situation. Luckily a procession of merchants passed by, I was able to get a carriage and come to the capital.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not just a carriage, but a luggage carriage?\u201dKalian asked back as if it was ridiculous.Of course.A noble Lady rode a luggage carriage rather than a regular carriage. It was funny even to me.So when I stopped by the town in the middle, I thought about renting a proper carriage.However, getting a carriage that travels long distances is not only expensive but also time-consuming, so I just came here by relying on the merchant carriage.Thanks to that, my condition was a mess.\u201cRather than riding a luggage carriage, you could have just ridden a horse.\u201d\u201c\u2026I am ashamed, but I do not know how to ride a horse.\u201d\u201cWhy? Did you not learn basic skills when you were young?\u201dCountess Thebesa couldn\u2019t have taught me that.There\u2019s even no teacher to teach me about letters. I barely learned it from the books my half-brother had left behind by self-studying.\u201cSomehow, I missed the opportunity to learn.\u201dIf I told other people about it, it would be an act of shooting myself in the foot, so I changed my words around.It would have been difficult if he had persistently asked, but fortunately, Kalian didn\u2019t.\u201cYou did a great job on your test.\u201dKalian picked up the teacup and said in a nonchalant tone.\u201cYou\u2019re the top.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dI\u2019m\u2026 the top?\u201cThat can\u2019t be true. There must be some mistake\u2026\u201d\u201cMistake? My Lady, we have 7 scholars and Ver\u2026 And do you want to say that my eyes are wrong?\u201dMy mouth closed on its own.I still couldn\u2019t believe that I was on the top, but I couldn\u2019t ask if he was mistaken when he said that.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a mistake. It\u2019s certain that the Lady is the top.\u201dKalian firmly put an end to the question.\u201cSo the Lady was selected to be my aide.\u201dWhat are you saying right now\u2026I, I was selected to be your aide?I was stunned by the more unbelievable fact than being the top in the test.Is this a dream?I was worried that everything would disappear when I came to my senses again.\u201cCongratulations, Lady Thebesa.\u201dThe indifferent congratulatory brought reality to my face.Only then did I come to my senses and cover my mouth with my hands.I really became the emperor\u2019s aide.Being an official had been my desired dream since I was very young.However, I was giving up because of the custom, the custom that women couldn\u2019t become officials. I couldn\u2019t believe I achieved it like this.My heart was full and my eyes were teary. It felt like I was walking on clouds.\u201cTh, thank\u2026\u201dI had to say thank you quickly, but no words came out.Like a fool, I just repeated the word \u2018thank\u2019.I stuttered, barely holding back the tears that were about to pour out.It must have been frustrating for me to do that, but Kalian didn\u2019t say anything.He just quietly drank tea and waited until I could fully say thank you.*****One by one, things that I had forgotten for a while came to mind.The image of Philen, who was angry about what I would do with the duchess\u2019s work when I became an official, flashed in front of my eyes.\u201cWhen can you start to work?\u201dI couldn\u2019t say anything to Kalian\u2019s question and just fiddled with the teacup.Will Philen allow me to work as an aide?If he doesn\u2019t allow me, what should I do?Should I\u2026 refuse it?\u201cIt seems there\u2019s no answer.\u201dOh my, I couldn\u2019t believe I ignored the Emperor\u2019s question.\u201cI apologize. I have something to think about for a moment\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the look on your face.\u201dKalian held his chin and leaned his upper body slightly toward me.\u201cSo, what\u2019s your answer?\u201d\u201c\u2026I think I will have to go back to the Williot estate first.\u201d\u201cI guess you do. You have to pack your stuff.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s that, but\u2026 I have to ask Duke Williot if it\u2019s okay for me to work as an aide.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dKalian tilted his head slightly as if it was strange.\u201cIt\u2019s your business. Why are you asking Duke Williot rather than making your own decision?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the Duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201dSo? I thought that was a sufficient answer, but now that he asked back, I was disconcerted.\u201cDoes Duke Williot ever ask the Lady for permission to do something?\u201dI shook my head.Philen never asked for my permission and always acted in his own way, and it\u2019s entirely up to me to take care of the aftermath.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he ask? Isn\u2019t Duke Williot your fianc\u00e9?\u201dThat\u2019s right, why didn\u2019t he get permission from me?Because he\u2019s the Duke?Of course, there had to be a reason, but I couldn\u2019t say that it was necessarily the case.Because when the previous Duke Williot did something, he always asked the Duchess.When I looked at it interestingly, the previous duke stroked my hair with a broad smile, saying that if he was considerate of his wife, he had to do this.Consideration, that\u2019s right. This was a consideration, not an obligation.Philen wasn\u2019t as considerate of me as I was of him.\u2026why did I realize this now?No, I already realized it, but I had been turning a blind eye to it all this time.If I acknowledged that fact, I would be so miserable.It made me so pathetic that I couldn\u2019t let go of the duchess\u2019s position even after being treated like this.\u201cIt seems like you have a lot on your mind again.\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201dIt was disrespectful to keep thinking differently in front of the emperor.\u201cI will be careful from now on.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean that the Lady and I will see each other again?\u201dOf course, I tried to answer yes, but my mouth kept closed.Because I knew that what he meant was not as Duchess Williot and the Emperor, but as the Emperor\u2019s aide and the Emperor.When I looked at the teacup silently, Kalian smiled brightly and picked up his teacup.\u201cYou said you have to go back to the Williot estate, so I\u2019ll have to give you plenty of time. A month should be enough, right?\u201d\u201cThat is enough. Thank you for your consideration, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re someone who\u2019ll help me with my work in the future, so this is nothing.\u201dAfter taking a sip of tea, Kalian put down his teacup and looked at me.\u201cI\u2019ll accept whatever choice the Lady makes, but I want you to know one thing.\u201dHis blue eyes twinkled mischievously.\u201cThat I really need the Lady\u2019s help.\u201dIf the emperor needed help, I had to help as I was a noble.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m not forcing you.\u201dKalian raised both hands to his chest level, smiling.\u201cI just said that. The Lady can do whatever she wants.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cStill, I hope to see you again in a month with good news.\u201dMy eyes went down to the teacup, which had lost its warmth.\u201cI\u2019ll always be waiting for you.\u201dThe words that he\u2019ll be waiting echoed in my ears.*****I was grateful to Kalian for letting me spend the night in the Imperial Palace, and also for lending me a carriage.I should say thank you for his help later. And also gave him a thank you gift.What should I give him? Jewelry? Clothes? Or\u2026\u201c\u2026strawberry candy?\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe strawberry candy came to my mind as a gift.It seemed like the strawberry candy he gave me before left quite an impression on me.In fact, even without worrying about this, I already knew what Kalian wanted the most.Me accepting the position of an aide.Kalian said he didn\u2019t force me, but it was still burdensome.I was thinking a lot about it.If he had forced me to accept the position, I would have accepted it with ease.No. I shouldn\u2019t think like this when he thought of me and gave me the chance to make a choice.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s hard.\u201dI sighed deeply and looked out the window.The scenery became more and more familiar. It meant that Williot territory was getting closer.It also meant that the time had come to meet Philen.The thought of seeing Philen gave me a headache.He must have already heard that I passed the official test.How will Philen react when he sees me?I hoped he didn\u2019t get too upset, but\u2026 it would be impossible.If I thought of my relationship with Philen, I had to refuse the position. But if I thought of my dream, I wanted to accept it.\u2026it would be too much to catch two rabbits at the same time.What on earth should I do?The worries weren\u2019t resolved, rather it continued to grow like a snowball, and by the time I arrived at Williot\u2019s estate, it became uncontrollably huge.When I finally arrived at Duke Williot\u2019s mansion, my face had turned darkThe imperial knight and the coachman, who took me all the way here, asked me what was wrong.I tried hard to smile, saying there\u2019s nothing wrong and went into the duke\u2019s mansion.\u201cMy Lady!\u201d\u201cYou are back, My Lady!\u201dSarah and Misa came out to greet me with bright smiles. Other servants were also seen.I didn\u2019t see them for only about 10 days, but I was happy as if I hadn\u2019t seen them for a year.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. Is everything okay?\u201d\u201cOf course! As you may have seen, the territory restoration is going smoothly!\u201dDid it? I didn\u2019t pay attention as my head was full of other thoughts.\u201cBut My Lady.\u201dSarah looked at me with twinkling eyes.\u201cI heard you passed the test? And on the top too!\u201dAs expected, that story had spread all the way here.\u201cAs expected of My Lady! You are amazing!\u201d\u201cSomehow, I was lucky.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be lucky enough to be on top! My Lady got it because you\u2019re smart!\u201dSarah gave me a thumbs up saying I was cool. Other servants also made a fuss and complimented me.It\u2019s not like I had done a great job, but being complimented by so many people made me embarrassed.\u201cStop it. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I never thought you\u2019d pass the test as the top.\u201dIt was a smiling face, but the eyes looking at me were terribly cold.He\u2019s in a very bad mood.Well, he couldn\u2019t have felt good because he was doing something he didn\u2019t like and even lost the bet.Since I was greeted with congratulations, I thought I should answer, so I bowed my head lightly.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the Duke\u2019s support.\u201d\u201cSupport, huh?\u201dPhilen smiled a little and folded his arms. His head tilted to one side.\u201cSo, what are you going to do next? Are you planning to become an official?\u201dI hadn\u2019t decided yet, but I nodded, thinking about Philen\u2019s intentions.\u201cYes. I decided to do that.\u201dThe smile faded from Philen\u2019s face at my answer.In the place where the false smile disappeared, the chilly, cold air swept around.\u201cDid you make that decision without my permission?\u201d\u201cDo I have to get permission from the Duke to become an official?\u201d\u201cDid you forget that you\u2019re my fianc\u00e9e?\u201dIt was funny that Philen said the same thing I said to the Emperor.Did the emperor feel this way when he saw me saying it? It\u2019s a little embarrassing.\u201cI will ask you the other way around. When the Duke does something, do you ever ask or get permission from me?\u201dPhilen let out a small sigh and tilted his head.\u201cWhy do I have to get permission from the Lady?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the Duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201dJust as I realized after listening to Kalian, I wanted Philen to realize it too but seeing his hardened face, unfortunately, it seemed that he failed.\u201cThe Lady seems to have forgotten that I am the duke.\u201dThis time, you\u2019re making excuses with your status, huh?\u201cWhen the previous Duke Williot did something, you must have known that he had always asked the Duchess for her permission.\u201dAs I calmly retorted, Philen\u2019s face distorted.\u201cAre you protesting right now?\u201d\u201cProtest?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you protesting to me because you\u2019re upset that I didn\u2019t take care of you and only took care of Cecily?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why you think so, but no. Why would I protest for something like that?\u201d\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll believe that?\u201dI wasn\u2019t surprised, as I had already expected that Philen wouldn\u2019t believe me.It\u2019s just tiresome and annoying to have to keep arguing with him like this.I got the position with my own strength, so why did I have to hear this from him?\u201cDo you want to be an aide that much?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cEven if I\u2019m against it?\u201dI hesitated for a moment but eventually nodded.Then Philen twisted his lips and pointed his index finger to the front door.\u201cGet out.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI told you to get out of my mansion.\u201dAt those words, not only me but also everyone in the hall looked at Philen in surprise.\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve warned you. If you ignore my words one more time and do as you please, I won\u2019t let you off anymore.\u201dPhilen looked straight at me and continued.\u201cSo pack up and leave the mansion right away, Lady Leila Thebesa.\u201dHow could he look at me like that and tell me to leave the mansion?\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cThen, do you think I\u2019m joking when I say this?\u201dNo, it didn\u2019t look that way.I was disconcerted.Is he trying to kick me out for something like this?For him, my existence is only this much?How can he kick me out so easily?\u201cMy Lady.\u201dMisa called me anxiously and came to my side.\u201cTell the Duke that you did wrong right now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201dAll of a sudden, my emotions surged up. I looked back at Misa and asked.\u201cIs it wrong for me to become an aide without the Duke\u2019s permission?\u201dI deliberately said it out loud so that Philen could hear it.As soon as Philen\u2019s expression hardened a little more, Misa, who noticed his expression, grabbed my arm.\u201cMy Lady.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t apologize. I did nothing wrong, and there\u2019s no reason for me to apologize.\u201dAt some point, Cecily was seen behind Misa.In the meantime, while hugging her bigger belly, she looked at me with a pitiful look on her face.Are you pitying me?A laugh came out.I wasn\u2019t laughing at her behavior, I was laughing because I felt sorry for my situation of being pitied by Cecily.But that was now over.I\u2019m leaving this house.Although Philen didn\u2019t explicitly say that the engagement was broken, asking me to get out of the duke\u2019s mansion was nothing more than an implicit declaration of breaking up.It would be better to cut it off for sure.Because of his personality, he might say something else later.That might be why there was room left right now.So let\u2019s make sure to tie the knot now.\u201cDuke Philen Williot.\u201dIt was my refusal to be swayed by him anymore.\u201cLet\u2019s break up.\u201d*****From the time Philen brought Cecily in, it was expected that our engagement might end in a breakup rather than a marriage.\u2026I didn\u2019t know that I would say \u2018let\u2019s break up\u2019 first. But\u2026It\u2019s all thanks for the position of an aide.If it weren\u2019t for that position, I still wouldn\u2019t have given up on my attachment to the duchess\u2019s position.Even if Philen poured out such insults, I would have swallowed my anger like a fool and endured it by clenching my teeth.And I wouldn\u2019t have seen Philen\u2019s stupid face.As expected, it was a good thing that I became an aide.I was truly grateful to Kalian for giving me this opportunity.I have to do my best to assist him.\u201cMy Lady, what should we do about this?\u201dThe maid asked, holding out a box of a pretty dress.It was a birthday gift for me before Philen went to war.He gave it to me as a gift to wear when I debuted in the social world, but I couldn\u2019t wear it because the war broke out.\u201cThrow it away.\u201dI had no intention of taking even a single stone from Philen\u2019s gift.\u201cThis too?\u201dThis time, the maid held out a hairpin I received from the previous Duchess Williot.She put this on my head and told me that I was pretty.She smiled brightly, saying that it goes well with my dark hair.Just thinking about it made me want to cry.I couldn\u2019t answer as readily as before and hesitate.I wanted to take it with me, but\u2026 I should leave it.Because I didn\u2019t deserve this since I gave up the Duchess\u2019s position.\u201cLeila, you have to be Philen\u2019s brain.\u201dWhat the previous Duchess Williot said lingered in my ears.\u201cAs a wife and duchess, fill what my stupid son cannot do. Please take good care of Philen and the Duke of Williot, Leila.\u201dI\u2019m sorry, Duchess.I guess my endurance is up to here.I didn\u2019t feel a bit sorry for Philen, but I was very sorry for both of them.I closed my eyes tightly and put all the items given by the previous Duchess into the box and gave it to the maid.\u201cThrow everything away.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dAs I was looking for anything to throw away, what caught my eyes was the drug given by Countess Thebesa.Come to think of it, did Countess Thebesa return to her estate already?I had to tell her that there\u2019s no need to prepare for the wedding anymore\u2026 Philen would take care of that, right?\u201cThrow this away too.\u201dI wrapped it in a cloth in case anyone else saw it and gave it to the maid.\u201cAre you really leaving, My Lady?\u201dSarah asked me with tears in her eyes.\u201cCan you not go?\u201dI smiled softly, wiping the tears from Sarah\u2019s eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sarah.\u201d\u201cUh-huhug.\u201dMore tears pouring out than tears wiped away.What should I do with this tearful child?I held Sarah in my arms and patted her.After crying in my arms for a long time and wetting my shoulders, Sarah looked at me with a determined face.\u201cI, have made up my mind! I will come with My Lady!\u201d\u2026huh?\u201cBut you\u2019re the Duke of Williot\u2019s maid. How are you going to come with me? You can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAs I said before, I am not a slave. I can choose the job I want!\u201dSarah clenched her fists.\u201cSo I\u2019m going to leave this place and come with My Lady!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do that, Sarah. I can\u2019t pay you as much as the Duke of Williot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not here for money! I\u2019m here because I wanted to repay the favor to My Lady!\u201dTo repay the favor?\u201cFive years ago, when there\u2019s a famine, My Lady opened the storage and provided food to us. Thanks to that, my younger siblings and I did not starve to death.\u201dSarah put her hands on her chest and clenched them together, smiling brightly.\u201cI really want to repay the favor I received back then. So, please give me a chance to repay the favor.\u201dShe said it so earnestly, how could I firmly say no?\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 Okay, I get it.\u201dI needed at least one maid to help me when I went to the capital anyway.If Sarah could take that role, I would be grateful for it, so I hugged her tightly again.\u201cThank you, Sarah\u201d.*****Philen really had no intention of kicking Leila out.She didn\u2019t know her fault and came out so confidently, so he just wanted to scold her a little.Then she would realize what she had done wrong and beg for forgiveness, but his expectation was unexpectedly wrong.Leila actually left the mansion after shouting loudly that she wanted to break up.Philen laughed at the fact that it was so ridiculous.She seemed to get big-headed because of becoming an aide.We\u2019ll see how long you can do that, Leila.You\u2019re bound to come back to me anyway.When that day comes, I will not forgive you as mildly as I am now.Thinking so, Philen ignited his anger towards Leila.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

According to the saying of a certain country in the east, a quarrel between a married couple is like, is it cutting a knife with water?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not cutting a knife with water, it\u2019s cutting water with a knife, butler.\u201dA passing servant corrected the butler\u2019s words.The butler shed a glimpse of the servant who broke the mood and coughed.\u201cEhem hum, anyway, there is no woman that suits the Master other than the young lady\u2026\u201d\u201cWoman that suits?\u201dThe butler turned around, startled at the sudden coy voice.Then he saw Cecily wearing a thin shawl.With her long, wavy hair hanging down beautifully, she was so beautiful that people didn\u2019t even think she was pregnant.\u201cLittle Young Lady.\u201dThe butler hurriedly bowed his head and greeted her. The same goes for Misa and other servants.\u201cThe title is wrong.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou have to call me just Young Lady now. Isn\u2019t that woman not here?\u201dAt Cecily\u2019s declaration that she was no less than the mansion\u2019s hostess, the butler and the other servants\u2019 expressions subtly hardened.Misa completely ignored Cecily.Cecily also didn\u2019t care about her and called a servant who was passing by her.\u201cWhat are you carrying right now?\u201d\u201cThis is Young Lady Leila\u2019s stuff.\u201d\u201cWhere are you taking it?\u201d\u201cTo the storage. The Duke said to keep it in the storage.\u201dKeeping her stuff in the storage without throwing them away.Philen still had lingering feelings for Leila. That\u2019s what it meant.I\u2019ve been driving a wedge between those two, and he still hasn\u2019t thrown away his lingering feelings for her?I don\u2019t like it.Cecily frowned slightly and moved her hand.\u201cBring it here.\u201dThe servant didn\u2019t move immediately and looked into the butler\u2019s eyes.\u201cAre you ignoring me?!\u201dAs Cecily shouted hysterically, the butler sighed deeply and nodded.It meant to do what she wanted.The servant took the box and brought it to Cecily.Then Cecily rummaged through Leila\u2019s stuff as if it was hers.\u201cMy Lady, that is Young Lady Leila\u2019s stuff.\u201dWhen the unseen Misa said a word, Cecily\u2019s eyes went up sharply.\u201cWho do you dare to talk back to when you\u2019re just a maid?\u201d\u201c\u2026I apologize.\u201dMisa bowed down and apologized, but Cecily continued to be sarcastic.\u201cA maid like you thinks the Duke of the Empire is no big deal, huh? No, maybe it\u2019s because there hasn\u2019t been a proper hostess until now.\u201dMisa clenched her fists as Cecily openly shot Leila.\u2018Young Lady Leila is a hundred times or a thousand times better than you!\u2019 Those words lingered in her mouth, but couldn\u2019t come out.How could she say that? Her opponent was the woman with Philen\u2019s child.The moment you provoke her by mistake, you will be kicked out of the mansion and your life will be at risk.\u201cHmph.\u201dCecily snorted and rummaged through Leila\u2019s stuff again.Then she found something wrapped in a luxurious cloth and took it out.What was wrapped in the cloth were bottles of red and blue liquid.She thought it was a jewel, but it wasn\u2019t. She was disappointed.Still, if it were something Leila was holding, it wouldn\u2019t be an ordinary item.It could be an expensive magic drug, so Cecily took the vials.Chapter 3. The Emperor\u2019s Aide.About five days after leaving the Duke of Williot. I came back to the capital again with Sarah.I never thought I\u2019d be back this early.Getting off the rented carriage, I now looked around.Maybe because I had been here a few times, I was familiar with the street to some extent.In particular, the huge Imperial Palace that was not too far away caught my eye.That\u2019s where I will be working in the future.My heart was pounding. I looked at the Imperial Palace for a long time.Sarah, who had paid for the carriage, sprinted to my side.\u201cWhere are we going now?\u201d\u201cWell, shall we go to the inn first?\u201dI used to stay at Duke Williot\u2019s mansion in the capital, but now I couldn\u2019t do that anymore. I needed another place to stay.I\u2019ll have to find a house first.How much was the housing price in the capital? It could be expensive since it\u2019s in the capital, right?I hope the money I have can solve it.Leaving aside the worries about a house for a while, I went to a nearby inn to unwind.I paid the accommodation fee for two days and headed to our assigned room.\u201cThe room is much smaller than I thought.\u201dSarah, who checked the room, asked worriedly.\u201cIs it okay for you to stay in a place like this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dThis was good enough. There were no bugs, and I didn\u2019t have to sleep on the floor without a blanket.\u2026and there\u2019s no strange hands reaching out every night too.\u201cThen I\u2019ll organize our stuff simply. Because when we find a house, we have to move immediately.\u201dSarah smiled vigorously and unpacked the luggage.Oh my, I should find a house right away.As soon as I finished organizing my stuff, I opened my bag thinking that I had to find a house first.Inside the small bag was a wallet, a notarized document from betting with Philen, and a necklace from Kalian.Since we had broken up, there would be no fighting with Philen over trivial things like now, but I brought the notarized document in case something went wrong.I hope I don\u2019t use this.I looked at the document bitterly and picked up the box next to it.It was the box containing the necklace I received from Kalian.When I opened the box, I saw the necklace shining brightly in blue under the sunlight.Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t given him something in return yet.As I received a lot of help, I wanted to give him a proper gift.What should I give as a gift that would make him happy?Jewelry? Or clothes?An ordinary nobleman would have wanted that, but it was the emperor.Giving the emperor a material gift wouldn\u2019t impress him.His treasury should be filled with more valuable treasures than what I gave him.Then, as expected, it should be a gift from the heart, right?\u201cSarah, what would be a gift from the heart to give?\u201d\u201cA gift from the heart?\u201dSarah, who was diligently organizing her stuff, looked back at me.\u201cYeah. If possible, it\u2019s with sincerity.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s a gift from the heart with sincerity, shouldn\u2019t it be a handkerchief embroidered by yourself?\u201dEmbroidered handkerchief.Suddenly, I remembered the handkerchief I gave to Kalian before.A handkerchief with the Duke of Williot\u2019s crest on it.\u201cWhy do you ask about a gift from the heart all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s someone who I have to give something in return.\u201d\u201cMy lady? Ah, then an embroidered handkerchief will not work. Because My Lady can\u2019t embroider.\u201d\u201cNo, a handkerchief will do.\u201dIt still bothered me that Kalian took the handkerchief with the Duke of Williot\u2019s crest.I should take this opportunity to give him the handkerchief with the Imperial crest on it, and ask him to return the handkerchief he took before.\u201cSarah, let\u2019s go outside.\u201dI left my bag and only took my wallet.Sarah, who was quickly ready to go out, stood close to me and asked.\u201cAre we going to find a house, My Lady?\u201d\u201cNo, let\u2019s go to the embroidery store first.\u201d*****\u201cYour Majesty, Lady Leila Thebesa is here.\u201dKalian, who was looking at the document in the office, put the document down at Rahel\u2019s words, the head attendant, and looked at him.\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d\u201cLady Leila Thebesa is here.\u201d\u201cIs it the Leila Thebesa I\u2019m thinking of?\u201d\u201cIf you are thinking about Lady Leila Thebesa, who was recently selected as an aide after passing the open official test as the top, you are right.\u201dOf course.As far as he knew, there was only one Leila Thebesa.But why was she here? Wasn\u2019t she gone down to the Williot estate?Did she come back again? It hadn\u2019t even been two weeks yet.It was good that she came early because he didn\u2019t really like waiting too long, but it made him nervous.He had an ominous feeling that she would refuse to be his aide.\u201cBring her here.\u201dHe was concentrating on the document again when Rahel returned.Behind him, he saw Leila, dressed in a light sky-blue dress with her hair neatly tied up.\u201cLeila Thebesa, I greet the sun of the Empire.\u201dLeila grabbed the hem of her skirt and greeted him in a somewhat dignified yet elegant manner.It suited her better than a fancy dress full of jewels.After greeting her with a light nod, Kalian moved to the table.\u201cSit down.\u201dWhen Kalian, who was seated at the higher seat, gestured, Leila finally sat down.[T/N: higher seat = a seat of a person who is of high-ranking or who is older.]Kalian stared at Leila\u2019s face as the maids set the table.He was trying to read what she was thinking in advance, but it was difficult to read her thoughts with her expressionless face.She\u2019s the type who\u2019s good at hiding her thoughts. I like her even more.After taking a sip of tea, Kalian started with a small talk.\u201cI thought it would take three weeks, so I couldn\u2019t believe you came to see me in two weeks. You came back earlier than I thought. When did you come to the capital?\u201d\u201cI came yesterday.\u201dIs that why her complexion doesn\u2019t look very good?\u201cThen, you should unwind your fatigue from travel.\u201d\u201cI think I should give you an answer quickly.\u201d\u2026is she trying to reject it?It was as if he had eaten a bitter herbal medicine in his mouth. Kalian\u2019s lips were slightly lowered.\u201cLooks like you have decided.\u201d\u201cYes, I have.\u201dLeila clenched her hands on her lap tightly and looked at Kalian. She looked quite nervous.There\u2019s no way she would be that nervous if she said yes.\u201c\u2026are you rejecting it?\u201dLeila\u2019s eyes widened slightly at Kalian\u2019s words. It was like the expression of a person who was hit right on the mark.As expected, it was a rejection.His annoyance soared. Philen, he was very upset that he lost to that man.Kalian frowned and was about to say something, but before that, Leila opened her mouth.\u201cNo.\u201dKalian immediately swallowed what he was about to say and listened to Leila.\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that I accept the position of an aide.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A gentle smile spread across his lips.\u201cWell thought.\u201dKalian got up from his seat. He took something out of his desk drawer and put it down in front of Leila.It was a round piece big enough to fit into the palm of a hand. The marble sculpture was engraved with a blue dragon, the crest of the empire.\u201cIt\u2019s a pass. If you have this, you don\u2019t have to get my permission when you enter the palace in the future, \u201dIt\u2019s an important item.Leila kept the pass in her pocket.\u201cYou can fill out the aide document when you meet my aide, Baron Delrond. You know who he is, right?\u201d\u201cYes. I know.\u201dThey had already met once, and if not, there was no noble who didn\u2019t know Baron Ver Delrond, the emperor\u2019s only aide.\u201cThen, I will come to work tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThat early? You came to the capital yesterday. There should be things you need to organize, right? Ah, will you be okay staying at Duke Williot\u2019s mansion?\u201dLeila smiled faintly at the indifferent words and lowered her gaze.\u201cDid I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that\u2026 I don\u2019t stay at Duke Williot\u2019s mansion.\u201d\u201cHmm? Why?\u201dLeila\u2019s complexion darkened.Something must have happened.Why can\u2019t Philen Williot\u2019s fianc\u00e9e stay at Duke Williot\u2019s mansion?Does she have a fight with Philen Williot?He was curious, but even if he asked, she seemed unwilling to answer.I\u2019ll have to investigate this separately.\u201cSo, where are you staying right now? I don\u2019t think Count Thebesa is in the capital.\u201d\u201cFor now, I am staying at an inn.\u201d\u201cInn?\u201dWrinkles crept into Kalian\u2019s forehead.\u201cDid you not find a suitable house?\u201d\u201cI am trying, but\u2026\u201dLeila hesitated, unable to speak about it easily.Why did she act like that?\u201cPerhaps, you don\u2019t have money to buy a house?\u201dLeila blushed and nodded.He was just saying it without knowing that it was the answer.He couldn\u2019t believe she, who was the fianc\u00e9e of a duke not too long ago, couldn\u2019t find a house in the capital because of money.It was an absurd story enough for a passing dog to laugh, but there\u2019s no way she would lie about something like this.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll help you find it.\u201dLeila\u2019s eyes widened. Her two tightly clenched hands finally fell and waved in the air.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s my house, I\u2019ll take care of it myself.\u201d\u201cAre you able to do that?\u201dLeila shut her mouth at the words that hit right on the mark. Her hands slid down to her knees again.\u201cI know what the Lady is thinking, but it\u2019s better to accept this.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think hard. Think of it as a kind of welfare. If the Lady has any inconvenience when working, it makes me uncomfortable too.\u201dLeila\u2019s expression became a little more comfortable at the added explanation.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cThen I should look for a house.\u201dThere were several mansions owned by the Imperial family, so he could give her one of them.Kalian shook the bell, and Rahel came in.\u201cCall Ver. Tell him to bring the aide\u2019s employment contract when he comes.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201dAfter Rahel left, Kalian immediately called the handmaiden, Audrin.It was to fit Leila\u2019s uniform.\u201cI\u2019ve never had a female aide before, so there are only pants in the uniform. It\u2019ll be okay, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGood. Audrin, fit Lady Thebesa\u2019s uniform.\u201d\u201cI understand. My Lady, this way.\u201dLeila followed Audrin to measure her body.After taking the measurements, she was given explanations from Kalian about the body and mind she should have as an aide.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing very special. Just be loyal to me. And do what I tell you to do well.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cThe uniform doesn\u2019t have to be worn regularly, but it should be worn on special occasions or formal events.\u201dKalian said it as if it were nothing, but Leila listened carefully.After talking about many other things, Ver finally came.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I called you, you come really early.\u201d\u201cMy boss forced me to do too much of what I had to do, so I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201dAs Ver skillfully responded to it, Kalian smiled.\u201cOh my, I don\u2019t know who the boss is, but I have to scold him.\u201d\u201cI sincerely hope you do that.\u201d\u2026is this a conversation between an aide and a superior?The superior is not an ordinary nobleman. He\u2019s an Emperor.Leila looked at them in bewilderment because it was something that didn\u2019t make sense to her common sense.It was an obvious result. In this long battle, it was Kalian who won the battle of words.\u201cUgh, really.\u201dVer grumbled openly and put down the aide\u2019s employment document, a quill, and ink in front of Leila.\u201cRead it and sign the last page. If you have any questions, please let me know.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLeila took the document and read it thoroughly.In the meantime, Kalian gave Ver an order.\u201cVer, give one of the mansions owned by the Imperial family to Lady Thebesa.\u201dVer looked at Leila.\u201cIs there a house you want in particular? Whether it\u2019s the size of the house or the shape of the house you wish to have.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I will take what you give me.\u201dAt Leila\u2019s reply, Ver smiled and made a little sarcasm.\u201cWhat will you say if I give you a shabby and dirty house that makes you terrified, My Lady?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there will ever be such a house among the houses owned by the Imperial family.\u201dLeila replied calmly without panicking.Ver looked at Leila with interest and then nodded.\u201cAll right. I just remembered a mansion suitable for the Lady.\u201dVer looked back at Kalian.\u201cThen I\u2019ll bring the house gift document.\u201dGift? Doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re going to give me the house?\u201cWa, wait!\u201dLeila was bewildered and stopped Ver, who was about to get out.\u201cGift? It\u2019s not making any sense. I\u2019m okay with rent.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dVer asked with a face that he didn\u2019t understand at all.\u201cYou can live it without paying, but why on earth are you paying for it? If you like to waste money\u2026\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dKalian cut off Ver\u2019s words.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to act like a senior already, do it in moderation, Ver.\u201d\u201cAct like a senior? I\u2019m asking because I was genuinely curious.\u201dVer protested that he was wrongly accused, but Kalian neatly ignored him.\u201cLady Thebesa, do you really want me to rent the mansion? I don\u2019t mind giving it to you.\u201d\u201cRent is enough.\u201dLeila was determined, and Kalian respected her opinion.\u201cVer, I will rent the mansion as Lady Thebesa wants. And guide her to the mansion.\u201d\u201cI have to do it personally?\u201dVer\u2019s eyebrows twitched.\u201cI apologize, Your Majesty. I have a mountain of work to do\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be doing it, so go.\u201d\u201cI will go right away.\u201dVer, who changed his words as quickly as turning a palm, looked at Leila with a bright smile like a child who got a sweet cookie.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. Lady Thebesa.\u201d\u201cPlease wait.\u201dLeila, who had just finished reading the employment document, signed the last page and stood up.\u201cWait.\u201dAs they were about to leave, Kalian grabbed Ver\u2019s shoulder and spoke in a voice only audible to him.\u201cFind out what happened between Leila Thebesa and Philen Williot.\u201dAs Ver looked at Leila unknowingly, Kalian grabbed his shoulder a little harder.Only then did Ver, who recovered his eyes, respond with his eyes that he understood. Then he went outside with Leila.*****Williot estate, which had been a mess due to the rainy season and flooding, was quickly recovering.Houses that were flooded and broken were repaired, and the riverbanks were also repaired.The riverbank repairs were carried out according to the report written by Leila before.However, the crops that were swept away by the flood were, of course, not restored. Most of the crops were flooded and couldn\u2019t be used.\u201cEven so, I\u2019m glad. Thanks to Young Lady Leila\u2019s annual storage of some harvest, we don\u2019t have to worry about food this year. But\u2026\u201dTail, who was reporting with a smile, shut his mouth when he looked at Philen\u2019s serious face.The other aides also looked at Philen\u2019s serious face.Since Leila left the mansion, Philen\u2019s mood hit the floor and hadn\u2019t come up until now.He seemed fine when Cecily was around, but he wasn\u2019t actually feeling better, he was \u2018pretending\u2019 to be.What\u2019s wrong with him when he\u2019s the one who kicked her out first?Tail sighed consecutively inwardly and asked Philen carefully.\u201cMay\u2026 I continue the report, Duke?\u201d\u201c\u2026yeah.\u201dI really can continue it, right?Tail smiled awkwardly and spoke again.\u201cAs I\u2019ve already said, we don\u2019t have to worry about the food this year, but next year is the problem. Much of the farmland has been eroded and needs restoration.\u201d\u201cSo, what\u2019s the conclusion?\u201dIt was the moment when the report that he had spent a lot of time on was overshadowed.Tail answered with an awkward smile.\u201cWe need to hire a wizard.\u201dIt was the surest and fastest way to restore vast areas.There\u2019s a disadvantage that it cost a lot of money, but in the long run, it was beneficial to borrow the power of a wizard.Therefore, Leila hired a wizard every rainy season. This was to reduce the damage of the rainy season.However, Philen canceled the wizard\u2019s employment.As long as there was no flood, it didn\u2019t really matter, so the aides agreed with Philen\u2019s opinion.But there was a flood. It was also such a great flood, with 60% of the territory submerged.It was crazy not to hire a wizard in this situation.\u201cIf we don\u2019t hire them, we can\u2019t guarantee the farming for next year or the year after that. The food problem will eventually happen.\u201dAt the added explanation, Philen looked at the report with a serious face.As expected, did the budget bother him?He\u2019s been obsessed with money since last time.It was also because of money that the situation became like this.Such a catastrophe wouldn\u2019t have happened if it hadn\u2019t been for rejecting Leila\u2019s document, saying that the budget was too high.No, it would have been better if Leila had taken care of everything in the first place.Suppressing a wish that couldn\u2019t come true, Tail said to Philen carefully.\u201cIf hiring a wizard because the budget is too high\u2026\u201d\u201cThe budget is fine.\u201dPhilen cut off Tail\u2019s words and said.\u201cThe problem is Cecily.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why is her name popping up all of a sudden?Tail looked puzzled. The other aides also looked like they didn\u2019t know what happened.On the other hand, Philen continued with a serious face.\u201cShe hates wizards.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201d\u201cWhen she was still a princess, she was caught by a bad wizard and suffered harshly, you know?\u201dHaha, so what?He didn\u2019t cancel the wizard\u2019s employment because of the budget, he simply didn\u2019t hire them because she hated them?It was a truly ridiculous reason. Tail managed to swallow his smirk and continued.\u201cThe young lady\u2019s story is pitiable, but if you think about the territory, you need to hire a wizard.\u201dPhilen\u2019s eyebrows furrowed.\u201cAnd what if Cecily is so shocked to see the wizard and miscarries the child?\u201dAt the question he returned, Tail was speechless and kept his mouth shut.\u201cWe\u2019ll hire a wizard once Cecily gives birth. For now, let\u2019s put the territory\u2019s people in it as soon as possible.\u201dAn aide responded to Philen\u2019s decision, shouting.\u201cRight now, the territory\u2019s people are in a very difficult situation due to flood damage.\u201dMost of the people lost their homes, and some of them lost their families or were injured.\u201cAnd you want them to restore the farmland? You can\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the territory\u2019s people\u2019s job. There\u2019s nothing that can\u2019t be done.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but as I said before, the situation of the people is not very good right now.\u201d\u201cThe people\u2019s resistance may intensify.\u201dTail and the other aides came forward and suggested hiring the wizard, not the people, but Philen was determined.\u201cPut the people into restoring the farmland.\u201dPhilen put aside the document he was looking at and stood up.Tail and the other aides also stood up at once.\u201cIf there were rebels, who dared to disobey the lord\u2019s order, put them all in the dungeon. That\u2019s it, the meeting ends here.\u201d*****House prices in the capital were more expensive than expected.Although the price on the outside was cheaper, the security was not good there. It was dangerous for two women to live.That\u2019s why I was worried because I didn\u2019t have much money to go to a place with good security, but then he\u2019s helping me out like this.His Majesty is a very good person.When I heard the rumors, he was like an evil villain with a twisted personality who enjoyed slaughter, but it was wrong.He was a very kind and nice person. He knew how to be considerate of other people too, unlike Philen.But there were rumors like that going around. Someone must have been jealous of Kalian and spread false rumors.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201dThe carriage stopped, and I got off the carriage while being escorted by Baron Delrond.As soon as I got off the carriage, I saw a clean two-story house. There was also a small garden.This is where I\u2019ll live in the future, huh?I would have been grateful even if he had rented me a shabby cabin, but to rent me such a nice mansion like this\u2026\u201cHis Majesty is a very good person.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dAt the remark that I unconsciously uttered, Baron Delrond looked at me in surprise.\u201cHis Majesty is a good person? Do you genuinely think so?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think so, Baron?\u201d\u201cOf course not! First of all, he has a terrible personality! It\u2019s so terrible that he\u2019ll get angry if he doesn\u2019t like it even a little bit!\u201dBaron Delrond refuted me with veins on his neck.\u201cIs that all? He\u2019s so narrow-hearted that he\u2019ll keep in mind what happened, and then get back to you several times later!\u201d\u2026this person, has a lot of stuff piled up, huh?\u201cUhum hum, let\u2019s stop talking about it.\u201dPerhaps embarrassed after swearing for a while, Baron Delrond\u2019s ears blushed and coughed.Then he took the red key out of his pocket and held it out.\u201cThis is the key to this house. It is the only key, if you lose it, you will have to change the entire door, so be careful not to lose it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLike the pass, I took the key carefully.\u201cThen, would you like to open it yourself and take a look inside?\u201d\u201cMay I?\u201d\u201cOf course. This is the house where the Lady will live from now on.\u201dThe house I\u2019ll live in.It\u2019s not particularly a special word, but it made me feel strangely good.I opened the door, went inside, and looked around the house.The first floor had 3 rooms including the drawing-room.There was also a separate kitchen and storage room.I went straight to the second floor and looked around.\u201cAs you can see, the basic furnishings are all there.\u201dBaron Delrond followed me and said.\u201cIt takes about 10 minutes by horse to get to the Imperial Palace from here. Ah, come to think of it, you don\u2019t have a horse. As soon as I return to the Imperial Palace, I will send you a horse.\u201d\u201cUmm, I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know how to ride a horse.\u201dBaron Delrond, who had been following me diligently, seemed to have stopped.Looking back at him, I saw Baron Delrond looking at me with eyes full of questions.\u2026I should learn horse riding as soon as possible.Horse riding was a basic skill for any nobles to learn, men and women of all ages.However, it was rare for noble ladies to actually ride horses when they went out. Most of them rode carriages.So I thought there would be no problem if I didn\u2019t learn it, but it was my arrogance.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I will learn it quickly.\u201d\u201cAh, I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201dBaron Delrond placed his hand on his chest and bowed his head politely.\u201cPlease forgive me for my rudeness, My Lady.\u201d\u201cNo. I also thought that I should learn how to ride a horse.\u201d\u201cI also recommend you to learn it. When I am working as an aide, I often ride a horse.\u201dIf that\u2019s the case, I have to learn it even more.I nodded, deciding that I should find a horse riding teacher right away.\u201cThen let\u2019s discuss this again later.\u201dI said I would come to work tomorrow, but Kalian gave me a week off.It took not only that long for the uniform to be made, but it was also a consideration for me to slowly adapt to the capital.As expected, he\u2019s a good person, but why was everyone saying he\u2019s not?\u201cDid you bring a maid when you came from the Williot estate?\u201d\u201cYes. I brought one.\u201d\u201cIt will be difficult for one person to manage the house and the garden and even attend the Lady. If you can afford it, I recommend getting one more person.\u201dThat was something I also agree with.\u201cThen let\u2019s fill out the document.\u201dBaron Delrond took the document out of his bag and showed it to me.\u201cIt\u2019s a house rental document. Please read it and let me know if you have any problems or questions.\u201d\u201cYou mean, I should read it all right now?I think it\u2019ll take some time to finish reading it all.If it was only one page, I would quickly read it, but there were more than six pages.\u201cNo. You will need time to read it, so you can give me the document later. You can finish it until then.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, I will go now. I have a lot of work to do. I\u2019m worried about leaving everything to the emperor.\u201dI thought I just heard something I shouldn\u2019t have heard, but I must have heard it wrong.\u201cI\u2019ll see you next time, My Lady.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you off.\u201dAfter seeing Baron Delrond off, I looked around the mansion again.Perhaps it had been well maintained, the mansion was clean with no dust.The small garden was also well maintained with no weeds.The vine roses that rose along the fence were particularly beautiful.\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201dIt was good that my worries about the house disappeared, and it was nice to live in such a nice place.Sarah, too, would definitely like it when she saw it.I wanted to quickly see if Sarah liked it, so I set aside everything else and went to pick her up first.*****\u201cAre we really going to live here from now on?\u201d\u201cYeah. This is the mansion bestowed upon us by His Majesty.\u201dTo be precise, he rented it to me, but I didn\u2019t need to say that, right?At my words, Sarah clasped her hands like a girl and her eyes twinkled.\u201cWhen I heard the rumors, I thought he was a scary person, but he is actually a good person.\u201d\u201cI think so, too.\u201dWith such a person as my superior, it was a great honor to have him as my master.\u201cAre you using the second floor, My Lady?\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201dI already had a plan in my head on how to use the second floor.I was planning to use the largest room as a study, the middle room as a bedroom, and the smallest room as a storage room for clutter.\u201cOh, Sarah, I think it would be difficult for you to manage this entire mansion alone. How about getting another maid?\u201d\u201cAre you okay with that? That\u2026\u201dSarah didn\u2019t finish her words, but I could guess what she was trying to say.She was probably worried about money, right? After all, it wasn\u2019t comfortable enough to have two maids considering my circumstances.It would be different when I get paid, but for the time being, her pocket money wouldn\u2019t be enough.As expected, it\u2019s not a good idea to hire a new maid for a while.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. If you had stayed in the duke\u2019s mansion, you wouldn\u2019t have to suffer like this.\u201d\u201cN, no!\u201dSarah waved her hands in surprise.\u201cI am happy just being by My lady\u2019s side! Really!\u201dNo lies could be seen in her transparent, sparkling eyes.I was happy to know that Sarah truly believed in me and came with me, but my sorry for her grew bigger.I grabbed Sarah\u2019s hands tightly. Telling her this, no matter how many times, wouldn\u2019t be enough.\u201cThank you so much, Sarah.\u201d*****Contrary to Ver\u2019s expectations, Kalian was working diligently.It was just that strange, so Ver looked at Kalian blearily.\u201cDo you have any complaints with me?\u201dWith his gaze fixed on the document, Kalian threw a word at Ver.\u201cNo way.\u201dVer smiled brightly and clasped his hands tightly.\u201cI\u2019m just very happy that Your Majesty finally feels like he\u2019s working.\u201d\u201cOf course, I have to work.\u201dKalian stamped the seal at the bottom of the document.\u201cOr someone will keep being sarcastic.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who it is, but I feel like I want to bow down to that person.\u201dVer skillfully responded and shared the information he had learned.\u201cAh, Lady Leila Thebesa and Duke Williot are said to have broken up.\u201dKalian\u2019s hand, picking up the next document, froze.His cold blue eyes turned to Ver.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cI said Lady Leila Thebesa and Duke Williot have broken up.\u201dHa. That\u2019s why when he asked about the Duke of Williot, she made that kind of expression.\u201cWell, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s official.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cRumor has it that Lady Thebesa has declared their breakup, but Duke Williot is still preparing for the wedding.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne declared a breakup, and the other was clingy and still didn\u2019t accept it?\u201c\u2026interesting.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyes bent languidly.Philen Williot had very high self-esteem, as expected of the son of a duke.Even on the battlefield, there were a few times when he was in trouble because he couldn\u2019t hurt his pride.Yet, it now looked like he\u2019s just clingy to a Count Lady.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cShall we find out more about it?\u201dKalian thought for a moment and then shook his head.\u201cNo, that\u2019s enough.\u201dSeeing Leila didn\u2019t say anything to him, it seemed like she wanted this to be buried, and it didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to dig more into it intentionally.So Kalian pretended not to know anything and was going to bury it.Until Leila told him about it with her mouth first.*****We unpacked our luggage from the inn and headed to the market to buy groceries and other daily necessities.It was well maintained, but there were more things to buy than I thought, probably because people hadn\u2019t lived there for a long time.After wandering around for a while, my wallet became thin.Now, I really don\u2019t have much money left.Instead of hiring a new maid, it seemed like I had to save until I got my paycheck.I think I only bought what I needed, where did I spend so much money?As I pondered, I remembered a fine handkerchief and thread I bought at the embroidery store.Those two prices accounted for more than half of what I spent today.Is it too much?No. It\u2019s a gift for the emperor, I can\u2019t buy the cheap ones.And compared to what I\u2019ve received from him so far, this much is nothing.Even if I was thrifty about other things, it was right not to be thrifty about it.If I was in a pinch, I could sell the jewelry I brought.Even if I sold just one, the half-year living cost was not worth worrying about.That\u2019s why, just in case of an emergency, I had to save the jewelry as much as possible.\u201cWhat are you thinking about, My Lady?\u201d\u201cNothing. We have bought everything now, right?\u201dSarah nodded, pointing to the box containing the items.\u201cYes. I think we can buy other things whenever we need them.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then let\u2019s bring it together.\u201dWhen I asked the employee to deliver, he said I had to pay two shillings for delivery.With that money, I could buy bread for a few days, so I decided to save it.It wasn\u2019t something that two women couldn\u2019t carry, too.\u201cYes? Instead of asking for delivery, do you want to bring it yourself?\u201d\u201cWe have to save money.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dSarah turned red and bowed her head.\u201cI, I apologize, My Lady. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cI really apologize.\u201dIt\u2019s really okay, you know?\u201cStop it and let\u2019s go.\u201dIf I left her alone, it looked like she would be digging into the ground, so I grabbed some of the stuff first.Then Sarah grabbed the remaining stuff and followed me.When I got home, I started organizing the luggage with Sarah.Sarah jumped restlessly, saying she would do it alone, but in the end, she helped me.I was sorry to have made her manage this spacious house alone, so I couldn\u2019t leave her to organize the luggage by herself.After organizing the luggage, we had a late dinner and chatted about this and that, and then I embroidered the handkerchief until just before I went to bed.The imperial crest was a roaring blue dragon.Dragon scales were more sophisticated than roses, so if I didn\u2019t concentrate even a little bit, the embroidery would be messed up.I wanted to finish it quickly, but it was too much to stay up all night long working on it.Still, I fell asleep while working until quite late, and at dawn, my eyes opened wide.It was because of the habit of waking up early in the morning.Even when I tried to sleep again, my mind was awake. I thought it would be impossible to sleep again.Since I\u2019m up, should I embroider?While picking up the cloth and needle on the desk, I suddenly remembered what Baron Delrond had said when I saw the document next to it.He said he had a lot of work to do.I remembered there were quite a number of documents piled up in the emperor\u2019s office.The long war had just ended, and since he had just been crowned, of course, there\u2019s a lot of work to be done.But Baron Delrond is the only aide that can help\u2026.It bothered me. They\u2019re busy working, could I take it easy and embroider?While fiddling with the cloth, I put it down and went into the bathroom.Kalian said I didn\u2019t have to come for a week, but I thought it would be better to go.I\u2019ll go and help them with some simple documents.I washed briefly, took out a few clothes from the closet, and changed into it.I kept my makeup simple and neatly styled my messy hair.It was only after I packed the document and the pass that I realized that I had no transportation to get to the Imperial Palace.Baron Delrond said he would send a carriage from next week.Then, is there a place where I can rent a carriage near here? I don\u2019t think I saw it when I got home yesterday.I felt like I had to just walk.If it took 10 minutes by carriage, it would take about 40 minutes on foot.It wasn\u2019t that far away. I could walk enough.All right, let\u2019s walk.Having made that decision, I left my room after checking if I had forgotten anything.I left a note on the table, saying I would go to the Imperial Palace, and was about to leave the house, but Sarah came out of her room, rubbing her eyes.\u201cMy Lady? Where are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go to the Imperial Palace for a while.\u201d\u201cYes? This early?\u201dSarah, who suddenly woke up, shouted in surprise.\u201cIf something like this happened, please tell me in advance! Then I would have helped you prepare!\u201d\u201cNo. I can do this much by myself.\u201dSarah looked at me from head to toe and let out a short exclamation.\u201cYou are really prepared yourself. Cool. Noble ladies usually cannot do that.\u201d\u201cUsually, yes.\u201dUsually\u2026I turned around with a faint smile.\u201cI\u2019ll take the key with me, so don\u2019t go out and stay at home today.\u201d\u201cHow, how about your breakfast?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. There\u2019s no need to prepare breakfast in the future. Because I don\u2019t eat.\u201d\u201cAh, come to think of it, you didn\u2019t eat even when you were at the Duke\u2019s.\u201dDuke\u2019s. Just hearing it made me smile bitterly.\u201cI understand. Then should I prepare lunch?\u201d\u201cNo. Just prepare dinner.\u201dIf I left now, it would be impossible to come back by lunchtime.\u201cYes! I will make the stew and mocha bread that you like.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\u201cHave a safe trip, My Lady.\u201dI left the house with Sarah seeing me off. The cool air of dawn, which had not yet gone, enveloped my body.\u201cIt\u2019s a little cold.\u201dIt was hot during the day, so I dressed lightly, but it seemed to have been the wrong choice.Should I go back in and bring out my shawl?No. Let\u2019s just go. It got hot during the day anyway.In addition, the imperial palace was warm because it had warm magic on it.So I went straight to the Imperial Palace, thinking there would be no problem if I just went.*****I walked endlessly through the quiet streets.When the blueness of dawn that remained in the sky disappeared, I arrived at the Imperial Palace.When I showed the pass that Kalian gave me, I passed from the outer palace to the inner palace at once.However, I couldn\u2019t enter the palace where the emperor\u2019s office was located.It wasn\u2019t that the pass didn\u2019t work. It was because I came too early.According to the attendant who came to meet me, Kalian had just woken up and was washing up.Oh my. I thought too much based on my standards.Like me, Philen was the type to wake up early.It wasn\u2019t after he brought Cecily, but before that, he always woke up early in the morning and practiced swordsmanship until late at night.The previous Duke and Duchess Williot also always woke up early because they didn\u2019t sleep well.So I thought the Emperor would of course be awake at this time.\u201cShould I come back later?\u201d\u201cPlease wait. Let me check.\u201dAfter telling me to wait a little bit, the attendant went inside.After a while, he returned and spoke with a slightly awkward face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but would you mind waiting in the drawing-room for a moment?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen, I will guide you to the drawing-room. Come this way.\u201dThe attendant kindly guided me to the front of the drawing-room.Drinking the tea the maid brought, I looked around the splendid and antique drawing-room.Duke Williot\u2019s drawing-room was also quite large, but compared to the emperor\u2019s drawing-room, it was a drop in the bucket.[T/N: a drop in the bucket refers to a very insignificant thing or a very small amount.]Well, no matter that it was a Duke,it didn\u2019t make sense to compare it with the Imperial Palace.More than that, I should stop thinking of the Duke of Williot\u2026Despite leaving the Duke of Williot, I could hardly escape from the Duke\u2019s shadow.I didn\u2019t miss Philen. I missed the life there, Williot estate.It was only natural because I had been living there for over 10 years.To me, Williot estate was like a second home.\u2026now it\u2019s a hometown that I can\u2019t go back to again.The fact that there were two such hometowns broke my heart.In particular, unlike the first hometown, the second hometown was even more heartbreaking because I had many good memories in many ways.\u201cHuu.\u201dI felt like crying, so I covered my face with both hands.The warmth of my palms warmly embraced my slightly cold face.Let\u2019s just stay like this until the fluctuating emotions subside.Before the Emperor came, I had to calm down unconditionally.Because I couldn\u2019t show my unsightly tears in front of him.I was used to holding back tears and swallowing sadness.I was pressing my face with my palms when a cold hand touched my shoulder.When I looked up in surprise, I saw Kalian, who I didn\u2019t know when he came.\u201cYour Majesty, when\u2026\u201dWhen I tried to stand up hurriedly in surprise, Kalian pressed my shoulder hard and prevented me from standing up.\u201cI remembered something urgent.\u201dKalian said indifferently and put a handkerchief in my hand.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be back for a while, so please wait a little longer, My Lady.\u201dAnd without a moment to hold onto him, he quickly went out.Left alone, I looked at the handkerchief he gave me.Since when did he come?Did he happen to see me crying?Kalian didn\u2019t comfort me with kind words or hugs.He just gave me a handkerchief and left the room.However, it comforted me.Really, strange.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn\u2019t know what he meant by that, so I looked at him and Kalian added.\u201cI said it because there\u2019s a person in front of me and she kept staring at the teacup.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dIf Kalian said something like that, it seemed that I had only looked at the teacup.Oh my. I\u2019m not a child who is just learning etiquette, why do I keep making mistakes like this?I politely put my hands together and apologized.\u201cI apologize, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou have nothing to apologize for.\u201dKalian smiled mischievously and stroked his chin.\u201cBecause it\u2019s my fault.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m less attractive than the teacup, isn\u2019t that why you don\u2019t look at me?What a ridiculous thing to say.I hurriedly denied it, thinking that Kalian was having a strange misunderstanding.\u201cN, no! Your Majesty is attractive enough!\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was rather embarrassing that he took it as if it was obvious. I didn\u2019t know what to say.As I stared blankly at Kalian, he laughed cheerfully.\u201cHaha, the Lady seems to be weak at jokes like this.\u201dAh, that was a joke, huh?I didn\u2019t even notice it and reacted like a fool.\u201cI see, a jo\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, I was stating the truth.\u201dI was speechless again.\u201cSo, why did you come so early?\u201dKalian asked, filling the empty teacup himself.\u201cDo you not like the mansion you live in?\u201d\u201cNo. I really like it. Thank you for renting me such a nice mansion.\u201d\u201cRenting you, huh?\u201dKalian smiled slightly and picked up the teacup.\u201cYeah. I\u2019m glad you like it. Then, what is it?\u201d\u201cI heard from Baron Delrond yesterday that he was very busy. So, I wonder if there is anything I can do to help\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re here to work as an aide?\u201dWhen I nodded, Kalian looked at me with puzzled eyes.\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to take a week off to unwind?\u201d\u201cI have unwind enough.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re asking me to get you to work right now.\u201dWhen I nodded, Kalian shrugged.\u201cThe Lady is a workaholic, huh?\u201dSo you don\u2019t like it?Fortunately, Kalian nodded as if it wasn\u2019t.\u201cWell, okay. I was tired because Ver was whining. If you want to help, there\u2019s no reason to refuse.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cI should be the one who\u2019s thankful. Thanks to the Lady, I was able to reduce the work\u2019s burden.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyes bent in delight.\u201cI\u2019m telling you just in case, once you start, you can\u2019t quit.\u201dHe gracefully picked up the teacup.\u201cEven if you want to rest later, you won\u2019t be able to rest until your next vacation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dIt was better to work than to do nothing and rest. It was only then that I could feel that I was alive.I didn\u2019t want to be a useless human being.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get to work right away.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re full of enthusiasm. I hope that enthusiasm lasts for a long time.\u201dKalian put down the teacup and shook the bell on the table, then an elderly attendant came in.\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten breakfast yet, has the Lady eaten?\u201d\u201cNo. I usually\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s eat breakfast together.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dBreakfast with the emperor alone?Just thinking about it made my heart race and my mind went blank.\u201cRahel, prepare breakfast.\u201dBefore I could bring up the fact that I usually didn\u2019t eat breakfast, Kalian gave an order to Rahel, the attendant.I wanted to refuse it even now, but there\u2019s no good reason.If I had known this would happen, I would have said that I had eaten breakfast.Rahel left and Kalian stood up.The emperor stood up, and I couldn\u2019t keep sitting down, so I, too, quickly stood up from my seat.Kalian smiled and reached out to me.\u201cI want to escort the Lady to the dining room before you become an aide. It\u2019s okay, right?\u201dHe even said he wanted to escort me, I couldn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t going now.\u201c\u2026it is an honor.\u201dI struggled to raise the corners of my mouth and gently placed my hand on Kalian\u2019s outstretched hand.*****Table manners were the most important etiquette among the etiquettes learned by nobles.If I made a mistake here, there\u2019s no turning back. I would be branded as an uneducated person. I should never make a mistake.I sat down on the chair pulled out by the attendant, recalling the table manners I had learned when I was very young enough that I couldn\u2019t even remember.Then, I belatedly realized that this seat was right next to Kalian and I opened my eyes wide.It\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t any other seats, so why am I here?I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll definitely get indigestion if I eat here.\u201cI\u2019ll go to another seat\u2026\u201d-click.As I was trying to say that I would go to another seat, I heard the door open.I turned my head inadvertently and saw Baron Delrond creeping in like a zombie.Perhaps he had stayed up all night in the Imperial Palace, he wore the same clothes as yesterday and had sloppy appearances.The dark circles reached down to his nose, and his face looked exhausted. His eyes were full of drowsiness.\u201cOh.\u201dBaron Delrond stopped and stared at me, rubbing his eyes.\u201cI must be seeing things because I haven\u2019t slept.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you spitting out all of a sudden?\u201dKalian, who was seated on the higher seat, asked indifferently.[T/N: higher seat = a seat of a person who is of high-ranking or who is older.]Ver rubbed his eyes again and looked at me.\u201cI really can see things\u2026\u201d\u2026.were the things Baron Delrond talking about me?Kalian seemed to think so too. He frowned and rebuked the baron.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you called a person who definitely exists in front of you as things.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dIt was then that the baron widened his eyes, perhaps realizing that I wasn\u2019t an illusion but a real person.\u201cWhy is Lady Thebesa here\u2026?\u201d\u201cShe said she\u2019s here to work.\u201d\u201c\u2026really?\u201dKalian nodded, and the baron\u2019s mouth opened wide. His sleepy eyes gleamed like stars.The baron strode over to where I was, took my hand, and said,\u201cLet\u2019s work right now.\u201dLooking at his expression, I thought I should go right away. I leaned forward a bit and lifted my butt.\u201cSit down.\u201dThen, at Kalian\u2019s command, I put my half-lifted butt back on the chair.I tried to read Kalian\u2019s face, but the baron didn\u2019t.He said, looking at Kalian with dissatisfaction.\u201cShe is here to work, so I am going to take her to work. Why are you stopping me?\u201d\u201cBecause she has to eat breakfast.\u201d\u201cAh, right. Breakfast.\u201dHis face that had shone brightly became sullen again.\u201cEverything you do, you\u2019re doing it in order to eat and live, so of course, she has to eat. Well, I, too, have to eat to work.\u201d[T/N: Everything you do, you\u2019re doing it in order to eat and live = this phrase is usually used when they\u2019re talking about the importance of eating and good nutrition and living well as opposed to the importance of hard work and frugality.]The baron muttered to himself and sat to Kalian\u2019s left, that\u2019s, opposite me.Seeing Baron Delrond sitting there, it looked like he\u2019s sitting so close.Well, thinking about it, the room was big and there also weren\u2019t many people, seeing the way we\u2019re seated, I found it funny.When the baron sat down, the attendants served the food.Soup made with oatmeal, hot freshly baked bread and butter, and salad with fresh vegetables, tomatoes, and salmon.It was an easy meal to eat for breakfast.\u201cLet\u2019s eat.\u201dAs Kalian began to eat, Baron Delrond also picked up the cutlery.As if he was familiar with this kind of seating, the Baron ate casually.\u201cOh, Your Majesty. You got another letter from Lady Alton.\u201dThen they exchanged conversations that had nothing to do with work.\u201cHer heart for Your Majesty was desperate.\u201d\u201cYou read the content on your own again.\u201d\u201cShould I not read it from now on?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dKalian drank water and replied indifferently.\u201cI\u2019d rather have your eyes dirty than mine, so keep doing that for a long time.\u201d\u201cWow, you\u2019re so mean. My eyes are precious too, you know?\u201dDo they\u2026 usually eat in this kind of atmosphere?I, too, had meals with the aides several times when I was working at the Duke of Williot, but it wasn\u2019t in this kind of light atmosphere.We ate in a strictly formal and rigid atmosphere. The only conversation we had throughout the meal was about work.And if I ate in such an atmosphere, I always had indigestion.So, not wanting to show that from the first day, I didn\u2019t eat as much as I could and only rummaged through the salad.\u201cLady Thebesa, is the meal not to your taste?\u201dAs their eyes focused on me all of a sudden, I looked at the baron with my fork.\u201cIt\u2019s because you talked about useless things.\u201dBaron Delrond responded to Kalian\u2019s words with an unfair look.\u201cWhat did I say?\u201dKalian didn\u2019t answer. He placed a delicious piece of bread on my plate.\u201cEat it.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re unusually kind, you know?\u201dWhen Baron Delrond spoke as if he was dumbfounded, Kalian\u2019s eyes bent languidly.\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not, huh?\u201dKalian picked up two pieces of bread and placed them on Baron Delrond\u2019s bowl, then spoke affectionately.\u201cIf you\u2019re jealous, you should\u2019ve told me earlier. I would\u2019ve taken care of you.\u201dBaron Delrond muttered with a face that seemed to have seen a ghost.\u201cNow I am afraid Your Majesty\u2019s voice will appear in my dream.\u201d\u201cIt must be a lucky dream. Make sure to buy a lottery ticket.\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have talked.\u201dBaron Delrond grunted and ate the bread.I also picked up the bread that Kalian gave me.I didn\u2019t really want to, but if the emperor gave it to me, I had no choice but to eat it.I picked it up to eat, but the thought of eating it made me sigh.When I hesitated with the bread, Baron Delrond said,\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to eat, you don\u2019t have to eat it.\u201dStill\u2026 is that okay?I glanced at Kalian, reading his face.Kalian, who met my eyes for a moment, nodded.\u201cI\u2019m not forcing you, so if you don\u2019t want to eat, you don\u2019t have to eat it.\u201d\u201c\u2026no, thank you for the food.\u201dHe said he wasn\u2019t forcing me, but I felt like I had to eat it anyway, so I tore the bread into small pieces and put it in my mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sir Thebesa, it\u2019s kind of awkward.\u201dKalian replied indifferently.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing awkward about it. You called her right.\u201d\u201cOkay. Then from now on, please take good care of us, Sir Thebesa.\u201dWhen Baron Delrond bowed his head, I hurriedly put down the bread I was eating and bowed my head.\u201cPlease take good care of me too, Baron Delrond. Ah, should I call you Sir Delrond too?\u201d\u201cYou can call me Sir, and if you want, you can also call me Baron.\u201d\u201cThen I will call you Baron.\u201dSir was a title used to call those who were given administrative positions, including knights. However, if that person had a title, generally, it was his title that was called.\u201cLet\u2019s stop it and continue eating. The food will get cold if it\u2019s continued.\u201dAt Kalian\u2019s urging, I ate the bread again.The freshly baked bread was delicious enough to whet my appetite, but that\u2019s all.I didn\u2019t want to eat more. So I was going to stop eating after eating it.But when I finished eating it, Kalian put a new piece of bread on my plate. He also kindly gave me rose jam.\u201cOnce again, I\u2019m not forcing you. If you don\u2019t want to eat, you don\u2019t have to eat it.\u201d\u2026you\u2019re sure you\u2019re not forcing me, right?I read Kalian\u2019s face and picked up the bread.Then, I\u2019ll just eat it and really stop eating.That\u2019s what I thought.\u201c\u2026.delicious.\u201dThe bread with rose jam was very delicious.\u201cTry this too.\u201dWhen I was admiring it, this time, Baron Delrond pushed the strawberry jam with pulp in front of me.\u2026the strawberry jam is also delicious.Before I knew it, I finished one piece of bread and picked up a new one.When I was thirsty, I ate the soup while eating the bread. I also ate the salad little by little.After eating for a long time, when the meal was over, I had already eaten my portion.That alone was surprising, but what was even more surprising was that even though I ate so much, my stomach didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable at all.It was really\u2026 strange.*****Early in the morning just before dawn.After sneaking out of the mansion, Cecily secretly contacted a maid and waited under the secluded wall.\u201cMiss Cecily.\u201d\u201cShhh.\u201dCecily covered the maid\u2019s mouth and looked around.After confirming that there\u2019s no one around, Cecily took her hand off the maid\u2019s mouth and asked.\u201cDid you find out about what I asked you?\u201dCecily had ordered the maid to find out the identity of the drug she had obtained from Leila\u2019s stuff.The maid nodded. To Cecily\u2019s ear, she told her what she had known.Cecily\u2019s eyes widened as she heard all the stories.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s definitely an abortion drug. One is a drug that will help you get pregnant.\u201d\u201cHoo.\u201dShe thought it was an expensive magic potion. She couldn\u2019t believe it was a drug used for that purpose.Cecily clicked her tongue at the completely unexpected result.It was not difficult to guess why Leila had the drugs ready.The drug to get pregnant would have been to have Philen\u2019s child. And the abortion drug would have been for her.That woman, unlike her appearance, is sly.I have no idea that she has drugs like this ready.What a shame. Had I known this would be the case, I would have kicked that woman out a little later.If that had been what happened, Philen would have completely thrown away any lingering feelings for her.Biting her nails in regret, Cecily\u2019s eyes flashed for a moment.\u201c\u2026didn\u2019t I still have a chance? \u201dBetter late than never.A quote from someone suddenly came to Cecily\u2019s mind.And Cecily came up with a very useful way to use this drug.If I use that method, he won\u2019t be looking for that woman anymore.A sly smile crept across her lips.\u201cWhich one is it?\u201dCecily grabbed the maid\u2019s shoulders hard and asked her.Surprised by Cecily\u2019s sudden behavior, the maid blinked her eyes like a fool.Frustrated by this, Cecily shouted loudly.\u201cWhich one is the abortion drug?!\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe maid hesitated as if she didn\u2019t remember it well.No matter how uneducated a lowly maid is, how could she\u2019s so stupid?Cecily\u2019s irritation soared, but she tried hard to hold it in.Currently, in Duke Williot\u2019s mansion, the only people she could use as her hands and feet were the maid in front of her and a servant named Jack.Other servants didn\u2019t move according to Cecily\u2019s will. Because everyone was impudent and only followed Leila.Because of that, Cecily had no choice but to hold back her irritation.If she kicked out this maid, she would have no hands and feet to use.As a princess who had many attendants, Cecily knew how frustrating it was.Even so, there\u2019s a limit to patience, so she hoped the maid would give her an answer before her patience ran out.\u201cAh, I remember!\u201dFortunately, the maid remembered before Cecily\u2019s patience reached its limit.\u201cThe drug dealer definitely said that the red one is the abortion drug.\u201d[T/C: Lol ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)]\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes. Apparently, the blue one is the pregnancy drug, and the red one is the abortion drug.\u201d[T/C: ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)]\u201cReally?\u201dCecily grinned with satisfaction.\u201cGreat job.\u201dCecily put some gold coins in the maid\u2019s hand. The maid\u2019s mouth opened wide.The maid held the gold coins tightly and bowed her head toward Cecily.\u201cIf you have anything else to order next time, please feel free to let me know, Princess.\u201dPrincess. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m a princess.Even if my country is destroyed, that fact doesn\u2019t change.The title of a princess that Cecily had not heard in a long time made her shrug.\u201cThis is your tip.\u201dCecily smiled and put another gold coin in the maid\u2019s hand.*****After the meal was over.Kalian left immediately due to the nobles\u2019 request for an audience, and I followed Baron Delrond to the aide\u2019s office.The aide\u2019s office was right next to the emperor\u2019s office.If you open the door and look right next to it, you can see the emperor\u2019s office.\u201cDon\u2019t you have to accompany him when there\u2019s an audience?\u201dDidn\u2019t the aide usually have to go there too?When I asked in wonder, Baron Delrond kindly answered.\u201cNormally, one has to do that, but now it is an unusual case.\u201d\u201cUnusual case?\u201d\u201cI am the only official aide. If I accompany him there, the other things will come to a halt.\u201dThe baron let out a small sigh.\u201cSo, for the time being, I am only reading the records written by the secretary.\u201dI see.Somehow, it seemed that my role had become more important, so I answered resolutely.\u201cI will do my best to fulfill my role as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cI am sincerely looking forward to it.\u201dThe baron entered the aide\u2019s office and added several explanations.\u201cAs you know, the working hours are from 9 am to 6 pm. Of course, there are times when you come to work a little earlier or leave work late. All of them are paid for, so please work with a joyful heart to earn money.\u201dIs it my illusion that he emphasizes the word \u2018joyful\u2019?\u201cThere are also other offices, but I usually do my work here. Still, it\u2019s better to know, so if I have a chance later, I\u2019ll show you the other offices of the outer palace.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dBaron Delrond pointed to an empty desk.\u201cThis is the seat where Sir Thebesa will work from now on.\u201dThis is where I\u2019ll be working from now on, huh?I swept the desk with my hand. The texture of the wood that my fingertips felt was soft.The thought of working here already made my heart race.\u201cDid you bring the rental document?\u201d\u201cYes, here.\u201dI handed the rental document I had brought to the baron.Baron Delrond checked the last page of the document to confirm my signature, then nodded.\u201cI have confirmed your signature. Do you have any other questions about the document?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dThe baron put the rental document in his desk drawer and looked at me again.\u201cThen I will tell you what to do.\u201dThe baron put down the documents piled up as high as his upper body length on my desk.\u201cFirst of all, you just have to sort these documents in chronological order. Then, organize these documents by region and by case.\u201dThe baron put another pile of documents next to it.\u201cSometimes, there are cases where they foolishly omit the seal and submit for approval, and I have to go to the department and pick it up myself\u2026\u201dBaron Delrond suddenly blurred the end of his words, made a serious expression, then smiled casually again.\u201cI will take care of that part, so you just have to give it back to me.\u201d\u201cIf it is only getting the seal, I can do it.\u201dHe seemed too busy to do even such a trivial thing, and I thought it would be better to go there in person to find out the location of the department.\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201dBaron Delrond shook his head violently as if he didn\u2019t think so.\u201cPlease leave the work that has to go to the outer Palace with me unconditionally. Sir should not go there by herself.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. I understand.\u201dI couldn\u2019t say I\u2019d go despite all the opposition.The documents without seals should be given back to Baron Delrond.I thought about what the baron told me to do over and over in my head.\u201cWhen should I finish the work you gave me?\u201d\u201cI hope you can finish it today, but you don\u2019t have to push yourself too hard.\u201dThe baron said that while having dark circles on his eyes. Tiredness was smeared on his face.\u201cDo it in moderation and leave work at 6 o\u2019clock. I will do the rest.\u201d\u201cNo. It is my work, so I will do it until the end.\u201d\u201cThen you will leave work late.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dI was sorry for the promise I made with Sarah, but I couldn\u2019t help it.I hated the thought of throwing away the work given to me or passing it on to someone else.I have to finish it as soon as possible.And it\u2019d be better if I could finish everything in the meantime.\u201cThat\u2019s a good attitude. I like it.\u201dBaron Delrond smiled contentedly as if he liked my answer.\u201cThen let\u2019s start working. If there is anything you don\u2019t know, feel free to ask.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI immediately sat down and started sorting out the pile of documents.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They didn\u2019t think such corruption would be hidden in it.\u201cThen, shouldn\u2019t her position be changed to a mistress rather than an aide?\u201dOne of the nobles sitting around the round table smirked.\u201cApparently, Lady Thebesa is Duke Williot\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, so he couldn\u2019t openly accept her as an empress, that\u2019s why she entered as an aide.\u201d[T/N: The empress here refers to concubines.]\u201cI know right.\u201dA sneer spread like a plague among the nobles. Regardless of age or position, everyone laughed at Kalian and Leila.\u201cAt this rate, won\u2019t he soon turn that lady into an empress?\u201d[T/N: The empress here refers to concubines.]A nobleman asked a question.\u201cI heard Lady Thebesa declared a breakoff of her engagement with Duke Williot.\u201d\u201cAh, I heard that rumor too.\u201dAnother nobleman smiled and shrugged.\u201cI wondered what kind of confidence Lady Thebesa suddenly had and did such a bold thing, so it was because of this.\u201d\u201cIndeed, of all women, the woman His Majesty chose is such a woman. Birds of a feather flock together, that statement is accurate.\u201dThe laughter grew louder. Some people shrugged their shoulders and some laughed out loud.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we step out before His Majesty goes any further, Duke Giltian?\u201dThe eyes of the nobles turned to Duke Giltian, who was sitting on the higher seat.Duke Giltian, who had remained silent while the nobles talked, opened his heavy mouth.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it for a long time, but the duke seems to be too tolerant with His Majesty.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201dA gentle smile was drawn on his wrinkled face, which was buried with traces of time.\u201cEven though we\u2019re not blood-related, His Majesty is like a grandson to me.\u201d\u201cEhem.\u201d\u201cHmm, hmm.\u201dThe nobles, who cursed Kalian, coughed at Duke Giltian\u2019s response and turned their heads.Duke Giltian glanced over that nobles.His eyes were so vivid that it was hard to believe that he had passed the age of 60. Ambition flashed in his gray eyes.With his eyes gleaming sharply like a wild beast, Duke Giltian slowly opened his mouth.\u201cSo, let\u2019s watch him for the time being.\u201d\u2018For the time being.\u2019*****Leila spent each day buried in her works, unaware of how she was gossiped about in the mouth of the nobles.She already knew that there\u2019s a lot of work, but it was beyond her imagination when she did it herself.It was surprising that Kalian and Ver handled all of this alone until now.Leila tried hard not to be a nuisance to them.She didn\u2019t hesitate to work overtime and reduced her sleeping time.She wanted to work all night like Ver, but then Kalian dismissed her, saying that she was exhausted.\u201cBut Baron Delrond does it.\u201d\u201cVer is a man and Sir is a woman.\u201dThat\u2019s right.When Leila looked sullen, Kalian hurriedly added.\u201cI\u2019m not ignoring or discriminating you for being a woman. I just said the \u2018difference\u2019. Men and women basically have differences in physical strength. If you had worked like Ver, you would have gotten sick sooner.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dLeila wasn\u2019t sullen in that sense.If she were a man, she would have been more helpful, so she was just disappointed that she wasn\u2019t.\u201cReally.\u201dHowever, Kalian justified in rare bewilderment as to whether she had misinterpreted it in a completely different sense.\u201cSo don\u2019t get me wrong. Because you\u2019re helping me enough.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWhen Leila bowed her head politely, Kalian frowned.Despite her impeccable attitude, it seemed that there\u2019s an invisible wall between Leila and himself.Why was that? He didn\u2019t feel this way when she was unaware that he was the emperor.Is the title the problem?Kalian thought that might be the case.Because he called Ver familiarly by calling him his name, while he called Leila rigidly by calling her Sir Thebesa.\u201cSir Thebesa.\u201dIf you find a problem, it\u2019s better to fix it right away.\u201cI\u2019ll call you Sir in public, but I want to call you by your name in private. Can I do that?\u201d*****Ver headed to the emperor\u2019s office with the approval documents handed over from each department.There\u2019s a guest in the office who came before him.With dazzling silver hair, his face didn\u2019t look like a drop of blood would come out even if you stabbed it with a needle.He was the leader of the \u2018Crowd Knights\u2019 who mercilessly slaughtered even children who couldn\u2019t speak under the Emperor\u2019s order and was called the Knight of the Iron Wall.He had no last name because he was a commoner.It was difficult to give a title to a commoner who didn\u2019t have a single drop of noble blood, but it wasn\u2019t impossible at all.Even if it was difficult to give him a Viscount, they could give him a Baron, but then he wondered why Hiltine hadn\u2019t been given the title until now, still, he didn\u2019t ask about it.Because if he asked Kalian, he obviously would dismiss him as an individual and Hiltine wouldn\u2019t answer him.Hiltine hardly spoke with anyone other than Kalian and his knights.Ver was also included.So when Ver first saw Hiltine, he thought he was deaf-mute.\u2026nothing has changed now.\u201cHello, Sir Hiltine.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDespite Ver\u2019s warm greeting, Hiltine just lightly greeted him with his eyes and said nothing.Phew. He\u2019s the type that\u2019s hard to get close with.Ver sighed deeply inside and shook his head.Even though they had known each other for 7 years, there had been so few conversations with Hiltine that he could count with one hand.As they\u2019re serving the same master, he tried to get close with him, but even if he talked to him first, he didn\u2019t answer and didn\u2019t give him a normal greeting.Your Majesty, where did you pick up such a guy?\u2026well, he seems to have outstanding talent in swordsmanship.Ver glanced at Hiltine and stood in front of the desk where Kalian was sitting.Kalian, who was looking at the document, looked back at Hiltine without giving a single glance to Ver.\u201cI get it. Keep looking into it.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHiltine politely bowed and went out.After glancing at the closed door once, Ver said bluntly.\u201cI guess Sir Hiltine doesn\u2019t like me.\u201d\u201cNo way. He\u2019s just not interested in you.\u201d\u201c\u2026isn\u2019t that worse?\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201dKalian smiled a little and put the document he was looking at into the drawer.At that moment, Ver frowned after seeing a little bit of what was written on the document.\u201cAre you still investigating the matter?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been more than 10 years. There can\u2019t be any evidence left to this day.\u201d\u201cYou never know.\u201dHe finishes other things irreproachably, but why is he so clingy with it?It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t understand Kalian\u2019s feelings, but feeling his reluctance to give up, Ver secretly sighed.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dIt meant that he didn\u2019t want to talk about this topic anymore.Ver was also hoping for that, so he silently put down the document he had brought with him on the desk.Seeing more documents than he handled yesterday and today, Kalian frowned.\u201cWhy don\u2019t these things lessen no matter how many times I do them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s karma.\u201dWhen Ver answered as if he was asking what was so obvious, Kalian kept his mouth shut and checked the documents.Starting with the proposals from the areas, then various types of documents such as security and tax.\u201cBefore you look at the documents, I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201dKalian replied with his eyes on the document.\u201cFrom tomorrow on, Sir Thebesa will write the report and report to you, Your Majesty.\u201dOnly then did Kalian look at Ver.\u201cLeila?\u201dLeila?Ver stared at Kalian blankly, bewildered when he called out Leila\u2019s name.Kalian said indifferently.\u201cI know I\u2019m handsome, so stop looking and tell me why.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat kind of nonsense is this?No, well. Although he\u2019s handsome objectively, isn\u2019t it embarrassing to say things like that with his own mouth?Ver managed to straighten his contorted face and gave Kalian the answer he wanted.\u201cFrom tomorrow, I have to go out to the outer palace to prepare for the victory commemoration party and the achievements of the past war heroes. So I handed the work to Sir Thebesa.\u201d\u201cYou seem to have taught Leila everything.\u201dLeila again.At the unfamiliar name, Ver paused for a moment before replying.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen, with what confidence are you making her write the report already? And leaving her for the reporting too?\u201dWhen Kalian asked back as if it was ridiculous, Ver smiled gently.\u201cIt will be fine. No, it\u2019s fine. Your Majesty will surely like it when you see it.\u201dSomething was amiss, but seeing Ver answering so sure like that, there had to be a good reason.\u201cI get it.\u201dAs soon as Kalian nodded, Ver asked as if he had been waiting.\u201cBy the way\u2026 are you calling Sir Thebesa by her name?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHaa.When Ver clicked his tongue, Kalian frowned slightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? I call you by your name too.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, do you know what rumors of Sir Thebesa that are circulating among the nobles?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dKalian leaned against the backrest with his interlaced fingers on his lap.\u201cThey\u2019re saying that I brought Leila in as a mistress, not as an aide.\u201dEven knowing that, he called her name without hesitation.Ver sighed deeply and added,\u201cThere are also suspicions that she may have cheated.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re just some guys with nothing to do.\u201d\u201cDo you think it is just a day or two?\u201dVer scratched his head as if he was annoyed.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter on the inside, but on the outside, even in private, do not call Sir Thebesa by her name.\u201d\u201cWhy? Is it because you\u2019re afraid of them gossiping?\u201d\u201cYes. I am afraid that the damage will go to Sir Thebesa.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she looked strong on the outside, she was a soft-hearted person on the inside.Kalian had seen Leila cry twice.First, under the big tree.Second, in his drawing-room.Until now, he didn\u2019t agree with the saying that women\u2019s tears are a weapon but seeing Leila\u2019s tears changed his mind.She looked pathetic and pitiful.It felt like seeing a pitiful kitten wet in the pouring rain.That\u2019s why he wanted to comfort her asking if she was okay, but he couldn\u2019t do that because he was afraid Leila\u2019s pride would be hurt by his nosy sympathy.The thought of Leila crying again made Kalian feel bad. He frowned and clenched his jaw.\u201cShould I send them all to the workhouse? That way, they wouldn\u2019t have such useless thoughts.\u201d\u201cI hope you dream that while you sleep.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyebrow went up slightly at the criticism that came back to him.\u201cMy aide is very nice.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m nice.\u201dAfter responding indifferently, Ver bowed his head.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll leave now because I\u2019m busy. Please finish the documents I gave you by tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBy tomorrow? It\u2019s too tight.\u201d\u201cWell, if you find it hard, you can give it to me a little later. Starting from tomorrow, it will be done by Sir Thebesa, not me.\u201dHe wondered why Ver, who had always been whining hard saying it had to be done within the schedule, was leaving so meekly, it turned out there\u2019s a reason for everything.Of course. This guy couldn\u2019t have changed.Kalian let out an annoying sigh and waved his hand.*****The time has come to go to the office to report to His Majesty.\u201cHuu.\u201dI stood up with the documents and took a deep breath.Up until now, I was in the position of receiving reports, so when it was the other way around, I felt awkward and nervous.\u201cHello, My Lady.\u201d\u201cHello, Mr. Head attendant.\u201dAs I went around frequently as an aide, I also made some acquaintance with Rahel, the head attendant.The head attendant smiled slightly at the documents I was holding.\u201cStarting from today, will you report directly to His Majesty, My Lady?\u201d\u201cYes. It just happened. It\u2019s my first time, so I\u2019m nervous.\u201d\u201cYou will do well, My Lady.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying that.\u201dRahel responded with a smile.\u201cThen I will inform His Majesty that you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cPlease do that.\u201dThe head attendant knocked and informed Kalian that I was here.\u201cYour Majesty, Lady Thebesa is here.\u201dAfter a brief silence, permission to come in was dropped.I bowed my head once again to the head attendant and went inside.After I entered, when the head attendant was about to close the door\u2026\u201cRahel, you come in too. Leave the door open.\u201dKalian, who was standing in front of the bookshelf and reading a book, said abruptly.Rahel was puzzled but he came in right away. The door was left open as he ordered.I could feel the attendants standing around the room sneakily peeking inside.And Kalian said nothing after letting us in.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dWhen Rahel called him, only then did Kalian close the book he was reading and turn to Rahel.\u201cRepeat what you just said.\u201dRepeat what I just said? He\u2019s not asking me about when I called him Your Majesty, is he?I think I\u2019m pointing out that Lady Thebesa is here\u2026It hadn\u2019t been long since Viscount Kranten became the head attendant, but he was a veteran for a long time as an attendant belonging to the Imperial Palace.He quickly noticed the mistake he had made and apologized hurriedly.Not to Kalian, but to Thebesa.\u201cI apologize, Sir Thebesa. I\u2019ve never seen a lady given the title \u2018Sir\u2019 before, so the title \u2018Lady\u2019 came up like a habit.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dLeila smiled awkwardly and waved her hands.In fact, she didn\u2019t even feel strange or awkward when Rahel called her \u2018Lady\u2019.\u201cI will be more careful next time.\u201d\u201cYou should be.\u201dAnd then, Kalian spoke loudly as if to tell the attendants who were hearing their conversation through the open door, not to Rahel.\u201cIf something like this comes into my ears one more time, I won\u2019t let it slide then. Do you understand?\u201dThere\u2019s a feeling of exaggeration a little, but for the sake of Leila\u2019s position, he had to do this.Rahel replied that he did, then went out.The door closed. Kalian sat at his desk and looked at Leila, who was a little spaced out.\u201cWhat are you standing there blankly for?\u201d\u201cAh, I apo\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough apologizing.\u201dKalian held out his hand.\u201cDid you bring the report? Bring it here.\u201d*****\u201cBring it here.\u201dIs it starting now?What was happening with Rahel just now was completely erased from my mind.I was so nervous that I tried hard to move my immobile feet to the front of his desk and put down the report I had brought on the desk.Suggestions and reports from each department were put together to make it easier for Kalian to see.I thought it would be easy because it was simply organizing, but I was wrong.Some documents were hard to recognize because of their bad handwriting, and there were people who suggested strange things.As Baron Delrond said, the documents that were submitted without the seal often appeared.It was a lot more intense labor than I thought to rewrite them after checking and categorizing them if there were any other problems.Was that all? It was also the aide\u2019s job to investigate the background of the issue presented in the proposal and find data about it.Once again, I understood why Baron Delrond worked overtime every day.\u201cDo you have any urgent business to do right now?\u201dAny urgent business to do? I thought for a moment and answered.\u201cThere\u2019s not right now.\u201d\u201cThen wait there for a while. I\u2019ll let you know if there\u2019s anything to fix or complement.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be thankful for it.\u201dKalian grinned and picked up the report.I was a bit nervous. I clasped my hands tightly and waited for his evaluation.I thought he was just reading the report, but as he read, he asked various questions.Why is it categorized like this?Why is this data needed here?What is my opinion on a particular issue?I used to ask the same questions when the aides brought me the report.It made me laugh a little that his behavior wasn\u2019t that different from mine. The anxious feeling that I felt disappeared.As they were expected questions, I was able to answer calmly without trembling.The more I answered, the more pages of the report flipped, and the more Kalian\u2019s expression changed little by little.It didn\u2019t change in a good way. Because the smile on his face is getting harder and harder.When he saw the report that Baron Delrond brought, he didn\u2019t look like that. It seemed that there were still many parts that were lacking.\u201cIf you tell me what is lacking, I will correct it right away\u2026\u201d\u201cLacking?\u201dKalian\u2019s eyebrow tilted.\u201cIf this is lacking\u2026\u201dKalian put down the report he was looking at, grabbed another document, and shook it.\u201cEveryone who wrote this should get out and die.\u201d\u2026that\u2019s a compliment, right?\u201cIt\u2019s a compliment.\u201dWhen he replied as if he read my mind, I looked at him in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s your first time, but you did pretty well. Good job.\u201dKalian looked at me with a bright smile.\u201cFrom now on, the report should do only this much. If there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand, ask Ver right away.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, you can leave now.\u201dI tried to bow to him politely with courtesy, but I just bowed my head lightly, recalling his words to say goodbye in silence because it was burdensome.\u201cLeila.\u201dAnd as I was about to leave right away, Kalian called me as if he had suddenly remembered.Leila.Even though it was my name, it felt a little strange when he called me.Is it because he\u2019s been calling me Sir Thebesa all this time?Looking back at him, Kalian looked at me a little worried and asked.\u201cAre there any rumors\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNo, I was just trying to ask you to have lunch with me.\u201dHmm, I don\u2019t think so.\u201cHave you eaten already?\u201d\u201cN, no.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s have lunch together.\u201d\u201cOkay. I will contact Baron Delrond, too.\u201dKalian paused for a moment, then nodded with a trembling look.\u201c\u2026do it.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you again in a little while, Your Majesty.\u201dI bowed to him once again and left the office.*****After Leila left, Kalian stared at the office door quietly, then stood up with a deep sigh.He tried to ask Leila about the rumors, but he couldn\u2019t.Because he couldn\u2019t think of what to say if he asked her that.Can\u2019t I just say don\u2019t worry about it indifferently?But even if I say that, it\u2019s not like she won\u2019t worry about it.And even after not asking that, it gave him a headache. Because he had brought up a useless thing and stimulated her curiosity.That\u2019s why he quickly changed the topic by talking about a meal that wasn\u2019t planned at all.It was surprising to see himself like this, but it was also surprising that Leila said she would contact Ver as if it was natural.Those two, are they that close?Well, of course, they\u2019re close. They had been together almost all day, so there\u2019s no way they couldn\u2019t get close.He also didn\u2019t like that part.Because rumors of being with another man all day long gratuitously would block Leila\u2019s path to being single and that made him worried about unnecessary things.\u2026well, I\u2019m already blocking her marriage path.Because there\u2019s no great nobleman dared to marry a woman who was rumored to be the emperor\u2019s mistress.But he wasn\u2019t too worried.It was all rumors that would go away as soon as Leila showed her ability. And she also had enough ability.Kalian read the report that Leila organized again.It was a neat report that contained only the necessary information.He said to Leila that she did pretty well in her first time, but in fact, even if it was perfect enough, there\u2019s no lacking.He just praised Leila moderately in case she would be lazy.Ver, Hiltine, and then Leila.There were only three people he handpicked, and all three of them were excellent.\u201cSuch an accurate eye I have for people.\u201dKalian smiled happily, praising his own eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It\u2019s also thanks to Baron Delrond.When I arrived at the dining room, as usual, I sat to Kalian\u2019s right and Baron Delrond to his left.As everyone was seated, the attendants served the food. The large table was quickly filled.\u201cYour Majesty, I have something to tell you about the reward for the war hero\u2026\u201dWhen Baron Delrond talked about work matters even before eating, Kalian\u2019s forehead wrinkled.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about work while eating.\u201d\u201cI apologize, but I don\u2019t have time. After eating, I have to go back to the outer palace.\u201dKalian clicked his tongue in annoyance and picked up his glass of wine.\u201cBecause of the problem of distributing the spoils\u2026\u201dVer didn\u2019t care and began reporting again.Kalian listened to Ver\u2019s report steadily while showing off his annoyance.They\u2019re having a serious conversation, and I didn\u2019t think I should be the only one eating, so when I tried to put down the fork\u2026\u201cLeila.\u201dKalian called me. I was startled and picked up the fork again.\u201cI will keep eating.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u2026huh? Isn\u2019t that what you mean?\u201cThe things Ver just told me, did you hear it?\u201dEmbarrassed for no reason, I quietly put the fork down again and looked at Kalian.\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about compensation for the bereaved family, I heard it.\u201d\u201cI want to hear your thoughts about it.\u201dMy thoughts?I was taken aback. Baron Delrond was in full charge of this matter, so I had nothing in my mind about it.\u201cIf you give me some time, I will investigate\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to hear your opinion purely, rather than a standard answer based on data.\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t know anything about this issue\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, what\u2019s your opinion?\u201dHe cut me off and asked again. No matter what, he was determined to hear my answer now.What should I do? What kind of answer must I give to satisfy him?It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t have any thoughts at all, but I couldn\u2019t tell him because I didn\u2019t know if this was right or not.\u201cHmm, did I ask something too difficult?\u201dHis sigh woke me up as if cold water had been poured onto me.Hold yourself together, Leila.The Emperor\u2019s testing you.I was afraid that if I showed a foolish side here, I would never be recognized by Kalian.But, it would be better to say anything.I took a deep breath and slowly spoke my thoughts.\u201cAs Baron Delrond said, I also agree to give consolation money to the bereaved family. One\u2026 more than that. I think there is an issue that needs to be solved first.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt is about protecting war orphans.\u201dChildren without guardians were left in danger.\u201cNot only that, but it also makes their livelihood hopeless. Because what children can do is extremely limited.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re giving them consolation money. We want them to make a living.\u201dBaron Delrond interrupted the conversation.\u201cOf course, if you give them consolation money, they can make a living right away, but in the long run, it doesn\u2019t help much. Rather, there is a high possibility that crimes targeting children with large sums of money will occur.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201dKalian nodded in agreement with me. Baron Delrond also looked like he understood.The two of them listened to my opinion, which gave me confidence. I expressed my opinion more confidently than I did before.\u201cThat\u2019s why I think protecting the children first is a priority.\u201d\u201cProtect\u2026\u201dKalian thought for a moment and asked.\u201cIn what way?\u201d\u201cThere are many ways, but in my opinion, taking the children and taking care of them until they reach adulthood is the best and surest thing to do.\u201d\u201cThe temple must have been doing that already.\u201dBaron Delrond interrupted the conversation again. I looked back at him.\u201cOf course, the temple plays that role, but it has its limits. The number of people that can be accommodated in the temple is also limited.\u201dIn addition, there were several problems with accommodating children in the temple.\u201cSo I think it would be good to create a new child care institution.\u201dHowever, to point out one by one now would make the conversation leak to a different area, so I ended it appropriately.\u201cOf course, the initial budget will be high, but in the long run, it will be very helpful for the Empire\u2019s welfare. Because even if there is no war, there are still orphans.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dKalian thought for a moment and then nodded.\u201cOkay. Leila, I\u2019ll leave this to you. Go write the report.\u201dDo you want me to write the report right away without discussing it with the ministers of each department?I looked at him in surprise.\u201cI think it was a hasty decision to write the report right away, Your Majesty.\u201dBaron Delrond also expressed his opinion anxiously whether he had the same thought as me.\u201cThis is something that needs to be thought through and decided. We also have to discuss it with the ministers of each department.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ver, because I\u2019ve thought about it enough.\u201dKalian said with a smile.\u201cWhat\u2019s left is to make the ministers of each department understand. To do that, we need a proper report, that\u2019s why I asked Leila to write it.\u201dIn other words, the state of the report I wrote would determine whether or not this would proceed.I was worried about whether I could do such an important task, but I really wanted to do it.Building a child care institution had been something I had always wanted to do since I was at the Duke of Williot.I had no choice but to put it aside because of realistic walls such as a budget problem, but when the opportunity to achieve it came, my heart was pounding.I really wanted to succeed.With my own hands, not anyone else\u2019s.\u201cYou can do it, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIf I showed too much excitement, Kalian would think it\u2019s strange, so I calmed down my excitement as much as possible and replied politely.\u201cI will give it a try.\u201d*****I wanted to write the report on the child care institution right away, but there were too many other things to do.The priority was to prepare for the victory celebration party that was just two weeks away.Usually, the banquet preparations were led by the empress, the owner of the inner palace.When the Empress is absent, the Empress (concubine) takes over the role, but Kalian had neither Empress nor Empress (concubine).Because of that, the work came back to us, the aides.Although each department provided assistance, most of it had to be handled by me and Baron Delrond.When I saw the documents piled high enough to be incomparable with what I saw at the Duke of Williot, I sighed.\u201cIt would have been nice if there\u2019s an owner in the Palace.\u201dI complained without realizing it.I hurriedly saw Baron Delrond\u2019s face, and fortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to find it strange.\u201cI also fully understand your feelings.\u201dRather, he agreed with me.\u201cBut it would be better to give up on that part. His Majesty has no intention of bringing in an Empress or Empress (concubine).\u201dBaron Delrond scratched his head.\u201cNo, I guess \u2018can\u2019t\u2019 is the right expression.\u201dIt\u2019s not that he has no intention, but that he can\u2019t?\u201cWhy?\u201dIs it because of the 3-year phase?But I know that the Imperial family is an exception for the prosperity and stability of the Imperial family.Curious, I asked, and Baron Delrond exclaimed briefly with a stiffened face.\u201cI made a mistake. Please pretend you didn\u2019t hear that, Sir Thebesa.\u201dBaron Delrond took the documents and stood up.\u201cThen, Sir Thebesa. I will go to the outer palace, so please contact me if there is anything urgent.\u201dBaron Delrond left the office as if he were running away.I didn\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually the case, but that\u2019s how it seemed to me.There must be some great secret.I was curious, but I didn\u2019t want to ask again.If I asked, I didn\u2019t think he would tell me and I didn\u2019t have a hobby of digging other people\u2019s secrets.There must be a good reason.I thought lightly and looked at the documents that came from each department.*****\u201cDuke, a letter has arrived from the Imperial Palace.\u201dThe old butler politely handed the letter to Philen.A letter from the Imperial Palace was an important thing to check even during meetings.Philen put down the document he was looking at and took the letter.The Imperial seal was clearly engraved on the sealing wax. It\u2019s definitely a letter from the Imperial Palace.Philen cut the envelope neatly using a paper-knife and read the letter inside.The butler stood in front of Philen until he finished reading the letter.After reading the letter, Philen put down the letter and looked at the butler.\u201cIn two weeks, there will be a victory party at the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201cThen you have to go back to the capital.\u201dPhilen clicked his tongue in annoyance.\u201cWhy don\u2019t they hold it all at once? Why do they hold it separately?\u201d\u201cBecause there are a lot of things to deal with, such as merit and compensation.\u201dAs the butler expressed his opinion, Philen\u2019s eyes went up sharply.\u201cAre you trying to teach me now?\u201d\u201cI apologize, Duke.\u201dThe quick-witted butler quickly apologized.Philen glanced at the butler once, and then put the letter in the drawer.\u201cI should prepare the clothes first.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll contact the boutique right away.\u201d\u201cNo need. I have to wear a uniform this time, so there\u2019s no need for a banquet suit.\u201dThe clothes problem has been solved, what else do I need to prepare?Philen tried to think, but nothing came to mind.Up until now, all of this had been done by Leila.Philen always ate at the table she had perfectly prepared, even the cutlery.So, he didn\u2019t know what and how to prepare.Besides this, there were many other things he didn\u2019t know. And there were so many things to do.It was hard to believe that Leila had done all these things, where it was too much for Philen to handle all the work by himself.\u201c\u2026I wish Leila was here.\u201d\u2018Absence makes the heart grow fonder\u2019, that statement was right.[T/N: to be precise, here means when the person is around, they don\u2019t realize his/her importance/presence. But when he/she disappears, they greatly feel that person\u2019s importance/presence.]Without Leila, he could feel her preciousness.It would be the same for Leila.If she felt that, he would like her to come back without being too stubborn, but the woman who endured it would feel silly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53***Philen put aside his thoughts about Leila for now and thought about what to do with the rest of the preparations.\u201cBring Baroness Wizard here. I need her help.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe butler, who was worried inwardly that he might be asking for Cecily\u2019s help, calmly accepted it.\u201cHow are the wedding preparations going?\u201d\u201cCountess Thebesa continues to take care of that. But\u2026\u201dThe butler studied Philen\u2019s face and asked carefully.\u201cYoung Lady Leila isn\u2019t here, I don\u2019t know if we can continue preparing for the wedding\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not your concern.\u201dAnd there\u2019s no need to worry. Because Leila will be back.Philen beckoned him to leave.The butler, who politely bowed to him, came out and was startled to find Cecily standing leaning against the wall.\u201cYo, Young Lady?\u201d\u201cWhat are you so surprised about?\u201dCecily smiled and tilted her head.Her bright blonde hair swayed gently.\u201cIt\u2019s like seeing a ghost.\u201d\u201cSince when did you here\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to tell you that?\u201dWhen Cecily spoke informally without hesitation, the attendants standing around looked at her in annoyance.Leila, a count\u2019s daughter and officially Philen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, used to speak politely and respectfully to the butler.It was a treatment for the elder who had served the Duke of Williot since the predecessor.However, speaking informally when she\u2019s just a mistress? They didn\u2019t like it.The old butler didn\u2019t say anything. He bowed his head and asked.\u201cShould I report your arrival to the Duke?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dCecily raised her leaning body, supported by her exclusive maid.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201dCecily turned back and glanced at the room where Philen was.Her gaze was quite sharp. Her expression was venomous.It was as if she had heard something she didn\u2019t want to hear.*****\u201cAll banquets should be abolished.\u201dBaron Delrond, who had returned after half-day, sat down on the chair and murmured as if he were dying.\u201cI don\u2019t know why people keep throwing money for something meaningless.\u201dHearing his harsh words, he must be very tired.Well, he couldn\u2019t go home for two days and he had been working all night, so of course, he\u2019s tired.As evidence of that, the dark circles under Baron Delrond\u2019s eyes had grown even thicker.Feeling sorry for Baron Delrond, I picked up some of the documents he had brought.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this, so get some rest, Baron.\u201d\u201cBut there must be a lot of work for you to do.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m almost done.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t empty words, it was true.I wanted to work on the child care institution report as soon as possible, so I worked a little hard and was almost done with what I had to do today.\u201cSir, you\u2019re my savior\u2026\u201dBaron Delrond couldn\u2019t finish his words and fell asleep.I took a blanket and covered Baron Delrond with it, then I went back to my seat and read the document he had brought.It was a document about spoils and rewards to be distributed to the war heroes.The number and quality of spoils changed depending on the contributions.The person who made a lot of contributions could ask the emperor for any spoils he wanted.\u2026just like Philen.\u201c\u2026\u201dThere were several names on the document, but Philen\u2019s name was exceptionally noticeable.The spoil Philen requested was none other than Cecily.It didn\u2019t feel good to see the names of those two written side by side.I wanted to live without knowing each other\u2019s news forever, but it was impossible since we were in the same country.I\u2019ll run into Philen at the victory party, won\u2019t I?I was worried about what he would say when he saw me, and what the other nobles, who saw him and me, would gossip.Thinking about it, my eyes were already darkened and my head was throbbing, so I closed my eyes tightly and touched my head.*****Baron Delrond awoke when I was almost done with the documents.\u201cWhat time is it now\u2026 arghh!\u201dLooking out of the dark window, Baron Delrond stood up from his seat in surprise.\u201cWhy is it so dark?\u201d\u201cBecause it is 8 o\u2019clock in the evening?\u201d\u201cThen, why aren\u2019t you leaving work yet?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m not done\u2026\u201dBaron Delrond, who approached me with an angry look, took the document I was looking at.\u201cGo home before it\u2019s too late, Sir Thebesa.\u201d\u201cI will when I finish\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease go home.\u201dWhen Baron Delrond spoke with a terrifying look on his face, I couldn\u2019t refute any further and nodded.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cYes. Be careful on your way home.\u201dAs if being kicked out, I left the office and walked through the quiet hallway.Ah, wait. Before I left, I should have asked the attendant to prepare a carriage.Realizing that only after leaving the palace, I let out a small sigh.I need to learn horseback riding quickly.It\u2019s cumbersome to ask the attendants to prepare a carriage every late hour. And it\u2019s also a nuisance to them.After the banquet, I have some free time, so I should learn how to ride a horse right away.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dJust as an attendant passed by, I called him.\u201cI\u2019m about to go home. Could you please call me a carriage?\u201d\u201cOf course. But I think it will take some time, could you wait?\u201d\u201cHow long should I wait?\u201d\u201cI think it will take about 30 minutes.\u201dHmm, 30 minutes?It was an ambiguous time to do something, but it was a waste of time to just stand and wait.Now that this has happened, shall I look for data on the establishment of a child care institution?The library was too far away, and the document storage room seemed just right.There might be at least one emperor who thought the same as me among all the previous emperors.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be in the document storage room. Will you call me when it\u2019s ready?\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter asking the attendant a favor, I headed straight to the document storage room.The documents were well organized, but there were so many documents that it was difficult to find what I was looking for.I\u2019ll spend all 30 minutes just looking for it.I\u2019ll just need to know where it is and come back tomorrow to see it.\u201cConstruction, establishment, architecture\u2026\u201dIt was the time when I was frantically looking around to see related data about institutions other than child care institution.Click\u2013I heard the door open.Is the attendant here already?I turned around to ask him to wait a little bit, but an unexpected person was standing there.The person standing in front of the door was Kalian, not the attendant.I looked at him in surprise.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dKalian also looked surprised when he saw me.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you gone home yet?\u201d\u201cI was about to go home.\u201d\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here right now?\u201dKalian frowned slightly as if told me not to lie.\u201cI really am. I was just looking through the documents for a while while the carriage was being prepared.\u201d\u201cCarriage?\u201dKalian tilted his head for a moment and then soon exclaimed as if he had realized something.\u201cCome to think of it, you didn\u2019t know how to ride a horse.\u201d\u201cI apologize. I will learn it quickly.\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m not trying to blame you. I just forgot about it for a moment. By the way, what were you looking for?\u201d\u201cI was looking for data on the establishment of a child care institution.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s that data, you wouldn\u2019t be able to find it here. None of the previous emperors ever thought of that.\u201dThat means\u2026\u201cIt seems Your Majesty has already looked for it, too.\u201dKalian paused for a moment at my response, then smiled.\u201cI always feel this, that the Lady is very quick-witted.\u201dIs that\u2026 a compliment?\u201cYeah, I looked for it. It\u2019s been more than 10 years, though.\u201dIf it\u2019s 10 years ago, he would be only 18 years old.When I was 18, let alone thinking like this, I was in a rush to deal with what was in front of me.\u201cThe data I researched at that time must still be there, do you want it?\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dIf it was given, I would be very grateful. I nodded my head right away.Kalian took out a box that had been left unattended with a white layer of dust in the corner.I thought he\u2019d take some wads of paper out of the box and give them to me, but I was wrong.\u201cHere you go.\u201dHe handed me the whole box.Is it possible that all the documents in there are his research data?My mouth was wide open at the huge amount, which was more than I thought.\u201cDo you want to check the inside?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAs soon as Kalian put the box down, he opened it and checked the inside.Inside the box were a bunch of old papers.\u201cIt feels different to see it after a long time.\u201dHis blue eyes quickly scanned the inside of the box.\u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s not organized at all. In addition, there must be a lot of things that aren\u2019t helpful since they\u2019re from 10 years ago.\u201d\u201cNo. It will be very helpful.\u201d\u201cYou said that because you haven\u2019t seen it yet.\u201dAh, come to think of it, he\u2019s right.I smiled awkwardly and picked up anything I could grab.The neat handwriting was Kalian\u2019s that I had been accustomed to.It is data about the location.I skimmed through it, but all of the selected locations were outside the capital.Of course, it would.The land price inside the capital is expensive, and it was a waste to spend it on this kind of thing.\u201cIf you see anything you don\u2019t know, ask me.\u201d\u201cDo you remember the contents of the data?\u201dIsn\u2019t it something you researched 10 years ago?\u201cCome to think of it, it seems I do.\u201dKalian smiled lightly and shrugged.\u201cWhen will the carriage be ready?\u201d\u201cHe said it would take about 30 minutes, so I think it\u2019s about 5 minutes left.\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t have time to go to the office.\u201dKalian thought for a moment and then nodded.\u201cYou can take these home if you want.\u201d\u201cBut it belongs to the Imperial family, can I do that?\u201dImperial documents were basically prohibited from being taken out of the Imperial Palace. This was why Baron Delrond worked in the Imperial Palace instead of going home.\u201cWhat do you mean Imperial documents? It\u2019s just my personal data.\u201dKalian snorted lightly.\u201cSo you can take it home and read it. Of course, if you want to.\u201dOf course, I wanted to, so I answered right away.\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dAt just the right time, the attendant told me that the carriage was ready.Kalian was going to take the box himself, but the attendants who watched it couldn\u2019t stay still.\u201cYour Majesty shouldn\u2019t do this!\u201d\u201cPlease leave this to us!\u201dKalian, who had the box stolen by his attendants, clicked his tongue.\u201cBeing the emperor changes their treatment of me.\u201d\u201cWhen you were a prince, weren\u2019t your attendants like this?\u201dAlthough the treatment of an emperor and a prince was different, wouldn\u2019t these trivial things be the same?\u201cThey weren\u2019t.\u201dWhen I asked out of curiosity, Kalian replied with a playful smile.\u201cAt that time, I was completely ignored.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the way back to the mansion by carriage.I recalled what Kalian said.That he was completely ignored.The reason I didn\u2019t consider Kalian\u2019s playful remarks was because I knew about his birth.That he was an illegitimate child like me.\u201c\u2026aren\u2019t we the same then?\u201dMy biological mother was a maid, not a noble, but Kalian\u2019s biological mother was the daughter of a Viscount.He was only called an illegitimate child because the Lady was neither an empress nor an empress (concubine).Empress Solia, who had no children at the time, took Kalian and raised him like her own son.That\u2019s why I thought he would have been treated fairly well, but from what he said, it seemed he wasn\u2019t.The fact that he was completely ignored by the attendants\u2026\u201cLook over there. She must have been scolded by the Countess again.\u201d\u201cOh my, does she want to live like that? If it were me, I would just die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s stop thinking about it. It reminds me of the past I don\u2019t even want to remember.I closed my eyes and tried not to think, but the more I tried, the clearer it came to mind.\u201cHey hey, we made eye contact. Let\u2019s go before the Count\u2019s daughter becomes territorial.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. Let\u2019s go before we interact with her, hihi.\u201dIt was over 10 years ago, but I still remembered it clearly when I closed my eyes.The hellish moments I experienced when I lived in the Count of Thebesa.Count Thebesa, who was obsessed with women, touched all the maids who worked in the mansion. My mother was one of them.My mother became pregnant with me because of a one-night relationship.If Countess Thebesa had known this earlier, I would have disappeared before seeing the light of the world.At that time, the Countess was at her parents\u2019 home on the pretext of recuperation. Thanks to it, my mother was able to give birth to me safely.The Count of Thebesa considered daughter as something valuable from generation to generation.A daughter was good to use as a tool for combining with other families, and Count Thebesa took me for that purpose.Of course, Countess Thebesa didn\u2019t like it, but she had no choice but to accept what the Count wanted.That was the beginning of hell.Until the moment when I was chosen as the fianc\u00e9e of the Duke of Williot.Thinking that Kalian might have gone through the same thing as me, I felt pity and had a sense of kinship.I couldn\u2019t believe I had a sense of kinship with the Emperor. It was an absurd feeling.If Kalian knew what I was thinking, I was sure he would laugh at me.\u201cHuu.\u201dI let out a sigh and turned my head to see the box Kalian had given me.I opened the box and took out a document inside.It was a document about child care law.I had already researched this part before, so I already knew most of it.Still, I was reading it carefully to review my memories and to see if there\u2019s anything I didn\u2019t know, but my eyes were drawn to what was scribbled on the corner of the document.[Why can\u2019t children choose their parents?]It wasn\u2019t a summary of the data, but a monologue.Unlike the other writings, the font was a bit thick and shaken.I felt like I knew a little bit about how he felt when he wrote these things.[Why don\u2019t the parents I choose admit that they are my parents?]There\u2019s a dark red stain next to the letter.This\u2026 isn\u2019t it bloodstain?Kalian\u2019s monologue continued on the back page.I flipped the paper over as if I was possessed.[Can parents who abuse their children be called parents?][Should parents who don\u2019t recognize their children be called parents?][Is bloodline the only thing that can define parent and child?][Who should I call my parents?]Looking at the rambling written monologues, I realized one thing for sure.Contrary to his relaxed appearance, he had a deep wound in his heart.And that it was none other than his family who caused the wounds.*****\u201cI\u2019m going to leave the mansion for about two weeks from tomorrow.\u201dPhilen said, brushing Cecily\u2019s coveted hair with his hand.Cecily, who was lying on Philen\u2019s lap and feeling his touch, opened her eyes wide and raised her upper body.\u201cWhy all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cI have to attend a party.\u201dCecily\u2019s head tilted.\u201cIf it\u2019s a party, haven\u2019t you been to it before?\u201d\u201cThat was a party to commemorate the Emperor\u2019s throne. This time, it\u2019s a party to commemorate the victory. They said I don\u2019t have to attend if there\u2019s anything special, but I\u2019d like to attend if possible.\u201d\u201cOf course, you have to.\u201dCecily smiled and kissed Philen lightly on the cheek.\u201cBecause you are the hero who led the empire to victory.\u201dPhilen looked at Cecily with complicated eyes.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026are you okay?\u201dCecily\u2019s head tilted slightly.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the one who ruined your country. But\u2026 are you okay?\u201d\u201cAhh.\u201dOnly then did Cecily realize what Philen was trying to say. She exclaimed softly and fell into him.\u201cWell, it would be a lie if I said it\u2019s nothing at all, but I decided to forget it because I wasn\u2019t that close with my family and this child is more important than that.\u201dCecily smiled bitterly and stroked her belly.\u201cI guess people change their mindset when they become mothers.\u201dHow can you be so bright when you must be sad to lose your home country?Philen was proud of Cecily.\u201cThank you.\u201dPhilen gently stroked Cecily\u2019s hair.\u201cThank you for understanding me, and for giving birth to my child.\u201d\u201cIf I say everything I meant to say, what will I say?\u201dWhen Cecily folded her eyes like a crescent moon and smiled bashfully, Philen kissed her cheek.\u201cI\u2019ll come back before you give birth to the child.\u201d\u201cYou are going to buy me a present when you come back, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Just tell me what you want. I\u2019ll buy you anything.\u201d\u201cWhat if I ask you to pick a star in the sky?\u201d\u201cThen I should bring you a jewel as pretty as a star. I can do that much for you, who will give birth to my child.\u201dCecily chuckled at the witty answer and rested her head on his chest.\u201cI don\u2019t need everything. I just need you to come back safely to my side.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. Ah, if possible, I hope that Lady Thebesa will also come back with you.\u201dWhen Cecily talked about Leila first, Philen\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to talk about Leila first.\u201d\u201cHey, if you say that, I will feel disappointed.\u201dCecily smiled sweetly and stroked Philen\u2019s chest.\u201cAs I said before, I think of Lady Thebesa as my family.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cOf course. Lady Thebesa will be my child\u2019s foster mother. I want to get along well with the Lady.\u201dIt seemed that every word Cecily said was pretty.It would have been nice if Leila was like this, too.Thinking about Leila all of sudden, who was as stiff as an old tree, made his heart stuffy.\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to come back with Leila this time.\u201dPhilen sighed and hugged Cecily\u2019s waist.\u201cIf you show her your heart, her heart will change too. Even if her words and actions are like that, she is not a bad person by nature.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dCecily\u2019s eyes gleamed sharply as she buried her face a little deeper in Philen\u2019s arms.\u201cSo, please do that.\u201d*****Late morning.Kalian visited the aide\u2019s office with a document to ask Leila.Leila, who was working, stood up in surprise.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dLeila\u2019s complexion was darker than usual.\u201cAre you sick?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cBecause your complexion is dark.\u201dAt Kalian\u2019s words, Leila let out a short exclamation and wiped her face.She couldn\u2019t sleep well last night thinking about his monologue, and it looked like it\u2019s obvious.\u201cIf you\u2019re not feeling well, you can go home.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t sleep for a while, and I\u2019m not sick anywhere.\u201d\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you sleep?\u201dLeila hesitated, unable to tell the truth.Meanwhile, his blue eyes quickly scanned Leila\u2019s desk.His gaze finally stopped on the paper piled up on one side.It was so long ago that he couldn\u2019t remember the details, but it was definitely the content of the data he had researched 10 years ago.His frantic writing was neatly organized in her writing.The amount was considerable. It wasn\u2019t something that could be finished in an hour or two.Kalian frowned and picked up the paper.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you didn\u2019t sleep because you were organizing this?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cNo? I think it\u2019s right. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t have organized this much in one night.\u201dProbably because he hit the mark, Leila hesitated for a moment and then continued.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s true that I organized it because I couldn\u2019t sleep, but it\u2019s not because of that.\u201dThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.Kalian snorted and put the paper down again.\u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201dNow you\u2019re changing the subject, huh?\u201cThis.\u201dKalian could see Leila\u2019s mind clearly, but Kalian pretended not to know.\u201cIt\u2019s the report you organized yesterday, and I have a question.\u201dKalian asked Leila what he had checked beforehand.Leila satisfied Kalian\u2019s curiosity based on the data she had prepared beforehand.Thanks to her, Kalian was able to easily solve his curiosity.If it wasn\u2019t for Leila, he would have called the ministers from each department to break the stones.Though, he would have been asking the scholars or searching the library for the unsolved problems.\u201cThank you. Thanks to you, I could solve it easily.\u201dThe word \u2018Park Hak-da-sik\u2019 used in a country in the east seemed to be referring to Leila.As such, Leila had various knowledge in various fields.In this case, the depth is usually thin, but Leila was an exception. Hers was very deep.Of course, it might be shallow compared to scholars who specialize in one field, but it was good enough.Despite having a prudent and calm personality and this ability, he also liked that she was humble and not arrogant.\u201cIt is an honor to be of help.\u201dAt times, she was too humble to the point of being overly rude, but it didn\u2019t matter.Because self-esteem was something she could grow by keeping her by his side from now on.\u201cLeila.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI hope you work as my aide for a long time.\u201dThat way, I\u2019ll be able to step down without worrying in the future.Kalian tapped Leila on the shoulder and left the office before she could say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the banquet was just a week away, the entire Imperial Palace became bustling.As an aide to the emperor, all that was left was to make sure that each department was doing its job well.\u201cI can do it myself. So Sir Thebesa, please go write the report on the child care institution.\u201dVer said as he handed the documents he had brought to the servant.\u201cIf it is delayed, the establishment of the health institution will also be delayed.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration.\u201dWhen Leila bowed her head, Ver shook his hand.\u201cNo. Thanks to Sir Thebesa\u2019s early arrival, the work was done quickly. This is only natural.\u201dIf Leila hadn\u2019t come, Ver would still be struggling with the documents.Was that all? Each department would have constantly urged him to finish them by saying, \u2018there\u2019s not much time left until the banquet.\u2019It was terrible just thinking about it. Ver shuddered inwardly and thanked Leila.\u201cThank you for coming early, Sir Thebesa.\u201d\u201cNo. I was just doing what I had to do.\u201dA pure smile was drawn over her lips. It was a light smile without a single speckle.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going now.\u201dLeila bowed politely to Ver and turned around.Ver looked half absentminded at Leila, who was getting farther away.The servant, who was holding the documents on behalf of Ver, looked at him curiously.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Baron?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dVer, who turned around scratching his head, was indifferent when a group of attendants passed by.And he greeted the attendants lightly.Since the Imperial family was served closely, most of the attendants working in the inner palace were the children of nobles higher than Viscount.Although they didn\u2019t have titles, Ver had to greet them first because their status was higher than Ver.[T/N: Title here refers to a title or rank of honor conferred on royalty or nobles with outstanding achievements.]The attendants didn\u2019t receive Ver\u2019s greeting. They whispered as they passed by him.\u201cLook at how that person greeted us\u2026\u201d\u201cEven if he receives a title, it doesn\u2019t mean that his low bloodline is going anywhere. He must be mistaken for becoming a noble like us.\u201d\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what it is. Basically, things like that are kind of stupid.\u201dThey were gossiping about Ver.When Ver looked at them, the attendant\u2019s faces who met his eyes changed slightly.They coughed as if they had never done so and disappeared quickly.Things that can\u2019t be said in front are always done on the back.It was so childish that Ver turned his head with a small smile.The servant asked anxiously as if he was worried.\u201cAre you okay, Baron?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay. It\u2019s not something that happens once or twice.\u201dVer shrugged casually.About 10 years ago, when he came to the Imperial Palace to serve Kalian, he was used to it as he had suffered countless times.At first, he was hurt and shed tears at their words and actions, but not anymore.It had reached the point where he heard with one ear and let it out through the other. He didn\u2019t even blink most of the time.But these days, the reason he kept getting disturbed was because of Leila.At first, he was enchanted by the perfect answer sheet and forgot about it for a while.Soon after realizing that Leila was a count\u2019s daughter and a duke\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Ver was seriously worried about whether he would be able to work with her.However, Leila and he were in perfect harmony to the point where his worries were overshadowed.Was that all? Leila, unlike other nobles, didn\u2019t ignore Ver.Not only did she respect Ver\u2019s opinion, but she also used honorifics to him.Although he\u2019s bothered about it, it was the first time he had ever been treated like this by a noble.Of course, people like Rahel and Audrin treated Ver to some extent, but that was extremely clerical treatment.They didn\u2019t treat him as warmly as Leila.Because of that, Ver was dazed whenever Leila did that.He even hinted about the fact in case she might not know that he wasn\u2019t a nobleman.However, Leila\u2019s attitude didn\u2019t change at all.Rather, she said that it was great to receive the title even though he wasn\u2019t a nobleman.She\u2019s a strange woman.Of course, she was strange in a good way, not a bad way.So Ver didn\u2019t dislike Leila\u2019s strangeness. Rather, it was fresh and eye-catching.If Leila asked him, he felt like he would do anything for her.\u201c\u2026I think I can get you a star if you feel like it now.\u201d\u201cYes? What did you just say?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s go.\u201dEmbarrassed with his own words, Ver roughly equivocated and headed to the outer palace with the servant.*****As I frantically searched and organized the data in the library, it was almost time to go report to His Majesty.As Baron Delrond was busy with final preparations for the banquet, it was still my job to report.There\u2019s nothing else to do, and I was going to see His Majesty, so I couldn\u2019t be late.First of all, I have to stop by the office, put down the data, and take the report.I have to take \u2018it\u2019 too.I hurriedly headed to the palace where the office was while holding the data in my arms.\u201cAck!\u201dBut then, I fell down when something caught my foot.The data I was holding spilled out.\u201cUgh.\u201dWhen I fell, I could feel the pain in my knee as if it was broken. My elbow also felt stinging.\u201cOh my goodness. Are you okay, Ms. aide?\u201dAs I was about to check the wound, I heard a high-pitched voice above my head.I looked up and saw several women.One of them was a familiar woman I had seen at the party before.I couldn\u2019t remember which family she was, but I remembered her being with Sophia.Are they Sophia\u2019s followers?They were smiling down at me.It wasn\u2019t the kind of expression that could be made while looking at someone who had fallen.That means they knocked me down on purpose, right?\u201cHere. Come on, stand up.\u201dA woman reached out to me and stepped on a piece of paper that had fallen on the floor.Footprints were clearly engraved on the white paper.\u201cOh my, my mistake.\u201dThe woman opened her eyes wide, covering her mouth with the hand that she had held out to me.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dContrary to what she said, she didn\u2019t look sorry at all.As expected, it\u2019s intentional.I stood up with a smirk.And when I looked at the woman without saying a word, the woman raised her nose bridge and asked brazenly.\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to blame me for making a mistake, right?\u201dIf I answered yes, she would do this again.And if I answered no, it was obvious that I would be treated as a petty person and they would make strange rumors.Either way was a trap.\u2026I\u2019m sure it is for other people.\u201cOf course.\u201dIn response to my answer, the women smiled with expressions that said \u2018of course, it is.\u2019The women\u2019s eyes twinkled unusually.It was clear that they were delighted to see my submissive attitude, thinking about tricks that would be great for me in the future.\u201cBut I\u2019m a little worried.\u201dWhat to do? Those smiles won\u2019t last long.I smiled brightly in response to their smiles.\u201cWill His Majesty forgive you?\u201d\u201cWhat, what?\u201dWhen the emperor was mentioned, their expressions changed in an instant. Their faces hardened and their smiles disappeared.\u201cThe paper that the Lady has stepped on just now is the report for His Majesty.\u201dIt was a blatant lie.It was simply the data I organized, but I lied without blinking an eye.\u201cSince the Lady stepped on it, I have no choice but to tell His Majesty the truth that it was because of the Lady.\u201dThe woman, who stepped on the paper, turned white. It seemed that she feared the emperor.\u201cA\u2026 are you trying to get revenge on me for making a mistake?\u201d\u201cRevenge? No way.\u201d\u201cIf this isn\u2019t revenge, what is it?! You can report with the new one you write\u2026!\u201d\u201cI would love to, too, but that document is the one His Majesty asked me to bring right now. I don\u2019t have time to write a new one.\u201dI put my hand on my cheek and tilted my head slightly.\u201cWell. After telling His Majesty the truth and asking for forgiveness, I might have time to rewrite it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, shall we go ask His Majesty for forgiveness together?\u201dAt my words, the woman was startled and shouted.\u201cWh, why me? This is the Lady\u2019s fault!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t the Lady just say it with your mouth? \u2018My mistake\u2019.\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2026\u201dStill, the woman couldn\u2019t continue her words, whether she had no conscience enough to say that she didn\u2019t say what she had said.\u201cWell, if the Lady sincerely apologizes for her mistake, I won\u2019t tell His Majesty that the Lady made the mistake.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat will you do?\u201dThe women looked into each other\u2019s eyes without a word.The woman, who stepped on the paper, bit her lip with her face red.\u201cWhat will I do?\u201d\u201cLisa.\u201dThe woman, who was watching silently, hit the woman, who stepped on the paper, on the back with her arm.The woman, Lisa, bit her lips to the point of bleeding, then bowed her head.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 my fault.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon? I can\u2019t hear you well.\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s my fault!\u201dLisa closed her eyes and screamed.I didn\u2019t feel the sincerity at all, but should I stop here?If I touched it more for no reason, she could have harbored a grudge and made something worse.\u201cOkay, you can go.\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re really not going to tell His Majesty about this, are you?\u201d\u201cI keep what I said.\u201dLisa and the other women looked at me and left in a hurry.In the meantime, it was funny to see them being careful not to step on the paper again.\u201cThey should have picked it up before they left.\u201dI didn\u2019t have time, and I couldn\u2019t believe I had to waste my time in this place like this.I sighed deeply and picked up the papers, but then I felt someone\u2019s presence behind me.As I turned my head, I saw a silver-haired knight I had seen before.He picked up the papers that fell on the floor and handed them to me.Thanks to him, I was able to save time. I smiled brightly and took the papers the man had handed out.\u201cThank you.\u201dThe man\u2019s expression changed subtly. It\u2019s as if he didn\u2019t know I\u2019d say thank you.Why? Do I look like such a rude person?It\u2019s kind of awkward.If he was the emperor\u2019s escort knight, he was someone I might see often in the future.\u201cMy name is Leila Thebesa.\u201dIt\u2019d be better to simply make an acquaintance.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, may I ask your name?\u201dThe man hesitated for a while and opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026Hiltine.\u201d\u201cSir Hiltine\u2026\u201dI gathered some of the paper that had slipped down slightly and bowed my head.\u201cThank you so much for your help, Sir Hiltine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do they want to skin a flea for its hide?\u201d[T/N: skin a flea for its hide means to exploit very little profit by unfair means.]I agree with that, but\u2026\u201cStill, I think we need to raise the tax.\u201dThen Kalian looked at me. He looked surprised.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d say that. Why do you think so?\u201d\u201cBecause of the budget.\u201dI chose the budget part of the report and put it aside so he could see it well.\u201cAs you can see, the budget is being spent more than expected due to successive events, relief projects, and issues with the bereaved family.\u201dKalian\u2019s expression became serious.Of course, it was.The state of the national treasury was also serious in my opinion. The six-year-long war was a problem.However, the situation of the people of the Empire wasn\u2019t very good to pay a lot of tax.As Kalian said, it was nothing but skin a flea for its hide.However, as shown in the data, the situation in the national treasury wasn\u2019t good, so we had to collect more taxes.Of course, we\u2019ll have to take it from those who have it, not the fleas.\u201cIf I dare to say something\u2026\u201dAs I was about to express my opinion that I had prepared in advance, Kalian suddenly grabbed my hand.It didn\u2019t stop there, but he rolled up my sleeve.All of a sudden, what\u2026I panicked and tried to pull my hand from him.But Kalian didn\u2019t let go of my hand. Rather, he pulled my hand closer to him.As a result, my upper body leaned on the desk.I put my other hand on the desk and supported my body so that I didn\u2019t fall.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201d\u201cDid you get hurt?\u201dHuh? Did you get hurt? What\u2026 Ah.I finally realized why Kalian was doing this and exclaimed quietly.He saw the wound from the fall earlier.It would have been difficult to see because it was covered with long sleeves, but he had good eyes too.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It was just a little scratch when I fell earlier.\u201dI meant to let go, but it seemed to have had the opposite effect as he tightened his grab.\u201cDid you fall?\u201dWhen I nodded, the question \u2018why?\u2019 followed.It would be better not to say that the ladies who caused me to fall, right?I did promise that, too.\u201cI was in a hurry so that I could arrive on time, but my foot got tripped\u2026\u201dKalian\u2019s eyes slanted obliquely.\u201cThat means it\u2019s because of me.\u201d\u2026huh? Is that how he interprets it?\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dWhen Kalian said sorry, I shook my head in bewilderment.\u201cIt was because I was in a hurry without seeing the floor like a fool. There is absolutely no reason for Your Majesty to apologize.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my fault that you came here right away without getting treatment even though you were injured.\u201d\u201c\u2026n, no.\u201d\u201cYour reply was late.\u201dKalian smiled slightly and stood up from his seat.Still holding my hand, I had no choice but to follow him as he moved.Kalian sat me on the sofa and rang the bell.The attendant, who was waiting outside, came in. It wasn\u2019t Rahel.\u201cBring the Doctor.\u201dCalling the Doctor when it\u2019s just a scratch?\u201cThat\u2019s too much. Just bring the ointment. That\u2019s enough.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s better for the Doctor to treat it rather than ointment, don\u2019t you think so? \u201d\u201cJust ointment is enough.\u201dWhen I didn\u2019t bend, Kalian clicked his tongue as if he didn\u2019t like it.\u201cBring the ointment.\u201dStill, he took my opinion into account.After a while, the attendant came with the ointment. Kalian took it and sat down next to me.\u201cBe sure to roll up your sleeve completely, I\u2019m going to apply the medicine.\u201d\u201cLet me\u2026\u201d\u201cShould I call the Doctor?\u201dHe threatened to call the Doctor if I didn\u2019t do what I was told.There\u2019s nothing I could do. Reluctantly, I rolled up my sleeve and let him treat the wound.\u201cTell me if it hurts.\u201dKalian meticulously applied the ointment to the wound.He was so careful and meticulous that it didn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201cThere are bloodstains on your skirt as well. Did you hurt your leg too?\u201dAh, come to think of it, my knee was wounded, too.Seeing my expression, Kalian asked as if it was ridiculous.\u201cYou seem to have forgotten that you got hurt there?\u201d\u201cSomehow\u2026\u201d\u201cSilly.\u201dHe clicked his tongue and pointed the tip of his chin to my skirt.\u201cRoll up your skirt, too.\u201d\u2026what?Roll up my skirt?I stared blankly at him. Even if it\u2019s an imperial order, I couldn\u2019t readily follow an absurd order like that.And as if he realized what he had said, Kalian looked bewildered.There\u2019s an awkward silence for a moment.It was Kalian who broke the silence first.\u201c\u2026sorry.\u201dHis earlobe that\u2019s exposed as he bowed his head was slightly red.Kalian couldn\u2019t see my face directly and apologized while looking elsewhere.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to make fun of you.\u201d\u201cYes. I know.\u201dI already knew that Kalian said those words purely to heal my wounds without any other intentions.So, although I was a little embarrassed, I wasn\u2019t angry or anything.Even that had just been cleared up by Kalian\u2019s apology.As I nodded my head calmly, Kalian frowned.Why is he like that? What mistake have I made?I had been pondering over what I had said so far, but there\u2019s nothing that I could think of.Still, seeing Kalian looking at me like that, I must have said something wrong, right?\u201cIf I made a mistake, please tell me. I will fix it right away.\u201dAt my answer, Kalian frowned even more and grabbed my shoulder tightly.\u201cLeila. I think you\u2019re misunderstanding something, but I made the mistake, not you. It\u2019s me who should apologize, not you.\u201dThat\u2019s\u2026 right.\u201cAnd when something like this happens, you can\u2019t forgive easily even if the other person is sorry. You should be angry.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no malice\u2026\u201d\u201cHow do you know if there\u2019s any malice or not?!\u201dA roar echoed loudly in the office.It was so loud that it was deafening for a moment.It was the first time I saw Kalian yell like this.That meant I did something wrong\u2026 What on earth did I do wrong?Knock knock\u2013\u201cYour Majesty, is there something wrong?\u201dRahel, who was waiting outside, asked carefully as if he had heard Kalian\u2019s roar.\u201cNothing! Everyone get out of the door!\u201dKalian simply dismissed them and looked back at me.His blue eyes were stained with anger.\u201cYou, did you understand what I was saying?\u201dTo be honest, I didn\u2019t understand at all, but I nodded because I thought he would get angry again if I said that.\u201cYes. I will keep that in mind.\u201dOnly then did the wrinkles engraved on Kalian\u2019s forehead fade.Perhaps his anger had completely subsided, he let out a deep sigh. He took his hand off and took a step back.\u201cSorry for yelling.\u201dKalian sighed a few more times as he scratched his head. And then, he put the ointment in front of me.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of the report, so go out and have your leg treated.\u201dThe aftermath of his yelling still hadn\u2019t gone away, so I leaned forward to grab the ointment and bowed to him.\u201c\u2026thank you.\u201dKalian turned around and spoke bluntly.\u201cIt happened because of me, so you don\u2019t need to thank me.\u201dKalian, who sat down at his desk again, beckoned me to leave.As I was about to go out as he told me, I suddenly remembered something I had in my pocket and stopped.I had no idea what I was thinking. But I had to give him this.I turned around and stood in front of the desk where Kalian was sitting.Kalian put down the report he had just picked up and looked at me.\u201cDo you still have anything left to say to me?\u201d\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dI took out the box I had in my pocket and held it out to Kalian.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a gift.\u201d\u201cGift?\u201dThere was wonder in his blue eyes that looked at me.\u201cWhat special day is today?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no special day as far as I know.\u201d\u201cThen why are you giving me a gift?\u201d\u201cI want to express my gratitude for what I have received so far from you, Your Majesty.\u201dKalian leaned against the backrest and looked up at me.\u201cI don\u2019t remember being kind enough to you to receive a gift like this.\u201d\u201cI remember.\u201dAnd not just one, but many. There\u2019s enough reason for me to give him a gift.\u201cSo please accept it.\u201dI put it down in front of Kalian as I didn\u2019t think he would ever take the gift.\u201cThen, see you later.\u201dAfter bowing my head to Kalian, who wanted to say \u2018hold on\u2019, I left the office as if running away.Rahel, who saw my urgent behavior, opened his eyes wide and looked at me. He looked as if asking me if something had happened.I smiled lightly in place of replying that nothing happened. And hurriedly entered the aide\u2019s office.I leaned against the closed door and exhaled loudly. My heart was beating so fast that it felt like it was about to burst.It was my first time giving a gift to someone other than Philen personally.It was also a handkerchief that I embroidered myself.It was a gift that I never gave to the previous Duke and Duchess Williot.Because it wasn\u2019t a good skill to be shown anywhere else.Although I was worried about what would happen if Kalian laughed at it, I felt a subtle feeling.I felt like someone was gently tickling the inside of my palm with a feather.It\u2019s really weird.The unknown feeling was so unfamiliar that I held my hands tightly together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because he\u2019s curious about what\u2019s inside it.Kalian carefully untied the ribbon as if handling fragile glass.Then he opened the box and checked the contents.Inside the box was a high-quality handkerchief.When he unfolded the handkerchief, he saw a large embroidered blue dragon.Kalian immediately recognized that it was Leila who embroidered the handkerchief.Because she was the only one he knew who could do such an ugly embroidery.Still.\u201cIt\u2019s much better.\u201dIt was a rapid growth compared to the embroidery he saw before.Kalian smiled happily. He looked at the handkerchief and replaced it with the handkerchief he had in his inner chest pocket.Shortly after that, Rahel came in, saying that he had something to report.As if he had never smiled, Kalian erased his smile and greeted Rahel expressionless.Rahel laid down a pile of letters in front of Kalian.Kalian\u2019s eyebrows furrowed slightly.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d\u201cThese are letters from the ladies, saying they want to be His Majesty\u2019s partner at this banquet.\u201dThe pile of letters showed that Kalian\u2019s popularity was just that great, but the person concerned was indifferent.Kalian didn\u2019t even give a single glance to the letters.\u201cGet rid of it.\u201dRahel took the letters back as if he was familiar with it.\u201cEven at this banquet, are you not going to get accompanied by a partner?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThen the first dance, as always, will be with Duchess Cloud.\u201dIt was so natural that Kalian looked at the document without even responding.\u201cWhat would you do to that person?\u201dAt the added words, Kalian\u2019s eyes turned to Rahel again.\u201cIs that person excluded again this time?\u201dKalian thought for a moment before answering.\u201cI\u2019m going to do that, but just in case, let\u2019s ask Duke Giltian for his opinion.\u201dKalian took a piece of paper from the drawer and wrote the contents down quickly.The completed letter was sealed with sealing wax and he gave it to Rahel.\u201cI will send it right away.\u201dWith the letter in his arm, Rahel politely bowed and was about to leave when\u2026\u201cRahel.\u201dKalian called him as if he suddenly remembered something.Rahel looked back at him.\u201cFind out why Leila was hurt.\u201dLeila said she fell while coming here in a hurry, but Kalian didn\u2019t believe it.Because from what he had seen so far, Leila wasn\u2019t that clumsy.\u201c\u2026if the reason why that woman was hurt, I know.\u201dHe thought there might be other reasons and asked him to investigate, but the answer came from an unexpected person.It was Hiltine.Rahel took a step back in surprise when Hiltine appeared out of the window.Hiltine\u2019s sudden appearance was surprising, but what surprised Rahel was that this place was on the 5th floor.On the other hand, Kalian looked at Hiltine calmly as if nothing had happened. And then, he beckoned Rahel to leave.As soon as Rahel left, Kalian said to Hiltine.\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cIt happened on the road between the library and the inner palace.\u201dHiltine reported what he had seen in a monotonous voice with almost no pitch.Starting with a group of ladies trying to bully Leila by tripping her leg.Everything until Leila wisely escaped the crisis instead of rebuking the ladies.After hearing all of that from Hiltine, Kalian let out a small sigh.\u201cThere they go again.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe that they didn\u2019t do what they\u2019re supposed to do, and instead, they did things that bothered others.Even though the ladies who came in as maids had little to do because there\u2019s no hostess in the palace, they were annoying because it was like that every timeBut there\u2019s nothing Kalian could do.There were some things that Leila didn\u2019t need to deal with, but even if that wasn\u2019t the case, Kalian couldn\u2019t step in.If he did, it would only add credibility to the rumor that Leila was a mistress and not an aide.If that happened, they would be even more excited and would bite and tear Leila.However, he was worried that the same thing would happen again if he stayed still.He was afraid that it would hurt Leila.Wouldn\u2019t it be a big deal if she quit being his aide because of that?Thanks to her coming, he was finally comfortable working now.\u201cI need to take proper action.\u201dKalian, contemplating what to do, immediately went to Ver.*****Right before going home, the attendant came and told me that Kalian was looking for me.What happened? Is there something wrong with the report I gave him?I was worried. I tried to swallow my anxiety and entered the Emperor\u2019s office.As soon as he saw me, he held out a paper without saying anything.On the paper, words commonly used as surnames were listed.Why is he showing this to me?When I looked at him in wonder, Kalian said.\u201cChoose any word you like.\u201dChoosing any word out of the blue?When I stood still without saying anything because I didn\u2019t understand the situation, Kalian shook the paper.\u201cI\u2019m busy, so hurry up and choose.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 I will choose this.\u201dI quickly scanned the paper again and chose the word that stood out to me the most.Seeing the word I had chosen, Kalian looked surprised.\u201cAstera. Do you know what it means?\u201d\u201cYes. It means star in ancient language.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyebrow rose slightly.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you know ancient language. Amazing.\u201d\u201cI only know a few basic words.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, you know? There are a lot of idiots who don\u2019t even know that.\u201dKalian smiled and took the paper back.\u201cOkay. It\u2019s a word that goes well with the Lady, so let\u2019s go with this.\u201d\u201cWhat are you going to do\u2026\u201dKnock knock-I was about to ask what he was going to do when I heard a knock.It was Rahel. He greeted me with a blink and then reported to Kalian.\u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s time for the evening audience.\u201d\u201cThe audience is all day long, huh?\u201dKalian sighed deeply and stood up from his seat.\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI was curious why he asked me to choose a word, but\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal, right?I didn\u2019t take it seriously and was about to leave, but Kalian added,\u201cThank you for the handkerchief.\u201dHe saw the handkerchief already, huh?I was happy about it, but a little embarrassed, so I didn\u2019t look straight at him and bowed my head slightly.\u201cI\u2019ll repay you for the handkerchief later.\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s still not good enough, but thank you for accepting it.\u201d\u201cNot enough? You did a good job, you know?\u201dI knew I wasn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t say anything because saying that would make Kalian feel awkward.\u201cYou can leave now.\u201d\u201cHave a peaceful night.\u201dI was going home soon, so this was the last time I saw Kalian today.After giving him a proper bow, I left the office.*****Next day.It was when I was returning to the office with books I had borrowed from the library.\u201cCome see me for a second.\u201dSomeone popped out of the corner and blocked my way.If my memory wasn\u2019t wrong, it\u2019s definitely the lady named Lisa.Did I have a conversation with this woman? I couldn\u2019t remember.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dWhen I asked in wonder, Lisa raised her eyes coyly and looked at me.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?! Of course, it\u2019s about what happened that day!\u201dWhat happened that day?\u201cAh, are you talking about when you deliberately tripping my leg andknocking me over, and then stepping on the report that I should give to His Majesty?\u201d\u201cThat, that was a mistake!\u201d\u201cYes. I suppose it does.\u201dI don\u2019t believe it at all though.\u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\u201cYou really didn\u2019t say anything to His Majesty, did you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dDoes she have a suspicious disease? Why can\u2019t she believe what people say?\u201cIf I had told His Majesty about it, you should have been given an impetuous order immediately. Did anything like that happen?\u201dWhether it happened or not, Lisa didn\u2019t answer.Of course, it was. Because I really didn\u2019t say anything to Kalian.\u201cIf you\u2019re done with your business, can you please step aside? Unlike you, who can come in and out of the palace leisurely, I\u2019m very busy.\u201dI was busy preparing for the banquet, proposals submitted by various departments, and writing the report on the child care institution.I didn\u2019t have time to play around like her.As I was about to pass by Lisa, who didn\u2019t seem to have any intention of stepping aside, Lisa muttered to herself.\u201cShe\u2019s a fake aide but she\u2019s pretending to be busy.\u201dA fake aide?I frowned at the absurd remark and looked back at Lisa.Lisa avoided my gaze, turned her head, and ran away.\u201cHey! Stop!\u201dEven when I called her out loud, she didn\u2019t stop.The desire to chase after her was like a chimney, but unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t because I had a lot of stuff.I didn\u2019t have the confidence to chase a woman who ran away so quickly.\u201cWhat on earth is that?\u201dA fake aide?It\u2019s not like she spat that out without thinking. On what basis did she say that?As I was pondering over what Lisa had said, a hand suddenly reached out from behind and took half of the books I was holding.\u201cWhy are you carrying so much?\u201dIt was Baron Delrond.\u201cYou\u2019re going to the office, right? I\u2019m going in the same direction, so I\u2019ll help you carry this. \u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dIt was actually quite heavy, but thanks to the baron\u2019s help, it became lighter.\u201cIs it all about the child care institution?\u201d\u201cYes. I borrowed all the books I thought could be a reference.\u201d\u201cIf there are so many, isn\u2019t it more convenient to just read them in the library?\u201d\u201cYes, but it\u2019s time for the library to close soon.\u201d\u201cAh, the Imperial Palace Library closes at 5 o\u2019clock, right.\u201d\u201cBeing a librarian is really good.\u201d said the baron.\u201cThen, I suppose I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something I have to organize today.\u201d\u201cThat means you\u2019ll stay in the Imperial Palace until late today. Then\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be staying too late. I will go home before 10 o\u2019clock.\u201dAs soon as I said that, the baron laughed as if he couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cPromised?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dAh, if it were the baron, maybe he knew about what Lisa said.\u201cBaron, can I ask you a question?\u201d\u201cAs many as you like. What is your question?\u201d\u201cI heard a strange thing from a lady.\u201d\u201cWhat strange thing did you hear?\u201d\u201cShe said I\u2019m a fake aide.\u201dIn an instant, the baron\u2019s eyes widened.As expected, he knows what she said.I stopped walking and asked, looking back at the baron who stopped too.\u201cWhat is it about?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I, His Majesty, and the scholars who held the test together with me do not think so.\u201d\u201cBut other nobles think so.\u201dThe baron agreed with me and sighed deeply like a sinkhole was going to form.\u201cThat\u2019s why the nobles call Sir a fake aide. They just, they just think what they want to think and say whatever they want.\u201dIt was like that, huh?Finding out something I didn\u2019t know made me feel relieved and heavy at the same time.I expected the nobles wouldn\u2019t recognize me, but I didn\u2019t expect it would be this much.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Baron.\u201d\u201cWhy are you apologizing, Sir? They\u2019re the ones who did the wrong thing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cSir is doing well enough.\u201dThe baron looked at me and smiled.\u201cPlease just do as you do now. Then those foolish nobles will realize what they\u2019ve done wrong and acknowledge you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cOf course. I guarantee it.\u201dThe baron\u2019s warm words were a great strength to me.Yeah, right. No matter what other people say, I just have to do what I have to do quietly.My heart, which had been so heavy, became a little lighter.I smiled and thanked the baron.\u201cThank you, Baron.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. So shall we go again? The books are a bit heavy.\u201d\u201cAh, give it to me. I will hold it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not heavy enough to hand it over to you, Sir.\u201dThe baron gave a playful wink and walked ahead.I aligned the slightly disorganized book and followed him.\u201cCome to think of it, how is Hutton\u2019s business going?\u201dHutton was a huge port city on the east side of the Empire.It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that all the trade of the Empire took place there.However, in recent years, pirates had been rampant, and they had been causing many troubles.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. Since Hutton is fine now.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dThat\u2019s a relief.\u201cThe problem is Khan.\u201dAs soon as I swept my chest in relief, the baron added.\u201cKhan? Are you talking about the island located in the southeast of Hutton?\u201dAt my reply, the Baron looked at me as if he was surprised.\u201cKhan is an island that most people of the Empire are not familiar with, but you know it.\u201d\u201cTo my shame, I also didn\u2019t know about it until recently.\u201dAs such, Khan was a very small island and was often not marked on the map.Only about 20 Imperial people lived there, and there were no lords to manage it in particular.\u201cI was worried about Hutton, so I looked for it and found this by accident.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s actually amazing. There are still a lot of idiots who don\u2019t know in Ministry of National Defense.\u201dThe baron was cynical.\u201cDo you know that Khan is often used as the pirates\u2019 den?\u201d\u201cYes. That\u2019s why there have been a few times that it has become an international problem. That\u2019s what I heard.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Since the founding of the Empire, there have been exactly 10 problems so far, and this time the 11th problem has occurred.\u201dOh my gosh.I was surprised at the unexpected remark and asked the baron.\u201cWhich country did it have a problem with?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Natsha Kingdom.\u201dNatsha Kingdom was an island country consisting of seven islands on the east side of the continent.Although the kingdom itself was not very large, Natsha Kingdom had powerful warships.Compared to all countries on the continent, including the Empire, it was a country with the most powerful navy.Even the late emperor, who declared the conquest of the continent, avoided Natsha Kingdom.That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t believe there\u2019s friction with such a place. I was worried.\u201cWill it be okay?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not.\u201dVer frowned.\u201cBecause they\u2019re making a preposterous demand.\u201d\u201cPreposterous demand?\u201dWhat kind of demand are they asking?As we talked, we arrived at the office.Baron Delrond put the books down on my desk and smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll stop talking about this here. If it becomes more public, I\u2019ll let you know then.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI was curious, but it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t want to tell me. He said he would tell me later, so there\u2019s no reason to ask him anymore.After seeing the Baron off, I went back to my seat and focused on what I was doing.*****\u201cSir Thebesa has heard of the rumor among the nobles.\u201dKalian, who was working in the outer palace\u2019s office, stopped at what Ver was saying and looked at him.\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI think she heard it from a Lady.\u201dWhat kind of idiot spilled words recklessly?Kalian clicked his tongue in annoyance.\u201cWell, fortunately, she doesn\u2019t seem to know about the mistress rumor, but\u2026 at this rate, Sir Thebesa will know before the banquet.\u201d\u201cCrackdown the ladies, who were entering and leaving the palace. In particular, the palace, where the aide\u2019s office is located, is further cracked down.\u201dVer handed the approved document to Kalian and said.\u201cYou can\u2019t stop it just by blocking the rumor, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dKalian, who received the document, replied while reading it.\u201cYou just have to block it until the banquet. I\u2019ll take care of it then.\u201d\u201cWith the way you said before?\u201dWhen Kalian nodded, Ver frowned a bit and shook his head.\u201cI apologize, but Your Majesty, do you really think that method is going to work?\u201d\u201cYou seem to think it\u2019s not going to work, am I right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt the firm answer, Kalian looked at him.\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t even acknowledge the aide, so there\u2019s no way they\u2019ll acknowledge her.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t they acknowledge you?\u201dVer replied as if he was asking what was so obvious.\u201cI\u2019m basically a man, and I\u2019m an exception. But that\u2019s not the case with Sir.\u201d\u201cEven if there\u2019s no legal problem.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s just against the common sense of old-fashioned people.\u201dWhen Ver blatantly criticized the nobles, Kalian smiled a little.\u201cIf they don\u2019t acknowledge her, we can make it happen.\u201d\u201cYou must be confident.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dKalian stamped the seal at the bottom of the document that he looked through while talking with Ver.\u201cSo trust me and follow me, Ver. As always.\u201d*****The meeting continued until late at night due to problems with Natsha Kingdom.Kalian, who was on his way back to the palace just after finishing the meeting, stopped when he saw the light from the window of the aide\u2019s office.As far as he knew, Ver was still working at the outer palace.That meant that it was Leila who was now in the office.It was close to midnight. The moon hanging in the sky also tilted.What is she doing that she still hasn\u2019t gone home until this late?Kalian clicked his tongue and turned away.The attendants quietly followed Kalian.Upon arriving at the aide\u2019s office, Kalian ordered his attendants to wait and entered the office alone.He deliberately opened the door loudly and came in, but Leila was still buried in her book without noticing that Kalian was there.She seemed to have been organizing the data because she occasionally transcribed it on paper.What is she working so hard on?Kalian quietly approached Leila and took the book she was reading.\u201cHow to raise a child properly.\u201dOnly then did Leila notice Kalian, opening her eyes wide and jumping up from her seat.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dShe looks like a rabbit.Kalian smiled a little and put down the book he took back.\u201cI definitely told you to write a report on the child care institution, but why are you reading about child care guidelines?\u201dLeila, who was looking at Kalian with a bewildered face, soon regained her composure and answered calmly.\u201cChild care institutions are places where children are cared for until they reach adulthood. I thought it would be good to have proper child care guidelines\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to look for that after the establishment of the child care institution is passed.\u201dA mischievous smile was drawn on Kalian\u2019s lips.\u201cOr do you believe that the report you write will pass no matter what?\u201dLeila was startled for a moment and then answered with a steady voice.\u201c\u2026even if the report doesn\u2019t pass, the child care guidelines can be applied elsewhere.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the temple for example?\u201dLeila expressed her affirmation in silence.The temples had raised children according to the rules and methods they had set so far.And Kalian knew well the fact that big and small problems were occurring because of that.It would certainly be nice to have child care guidelines.Kalian agreed with Leila inwardly and glanced at the data she had carefully organized.At first glance, the amount was considerable. It meant that she was working hard.That was good, but the problem was that it was too late.I told you not to work late, but you still do it.If you do this, it seems like I\u2019m overworking you.Kalian, who didn\u2019t like that Leila worked so late, turned around, clicking his tongue.\u201cIt\u2019s too late. Hurry up and go home before the day changes.\u201d\u201cYes? The day changes\u2026!\u201dOnly then did Leila, who checked the time, was shocked.Apparently, she didn\u2019t know that time had passed so much like this.Silly.Kalian sighed inwardly and ordered the attendant outside to prepare a carriage for Leila.In the meantime, Leila, who had packed her things, bowed her head toward Kalian.\u201cI apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to stay this late\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause you were working, you probably didn\u2019t know that the time had passed like this, right?\u201d\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re working hard. You don\u2019t need to apologize.\u201dKalian responded bluntly and turned around.\u201cI just want you to keep in mind one thing. If you collapse while overworking, I\u2019m not responsible for it.\u201d\u201cYes, I will keep that in mind.\u201dIt was a faithful answer, but it wasn\u2019t a heartfelt answer.\u201cAt times like this, the answer should not be \u2018I will keep that in mind\u2019, but \u2018I won\u2019t do it again\u2019, you know?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201dLeila quickly changed her answer.Pleased with her answer, only then did Kalian\u2019s expression change gently.While they were talking, the attendant reported that the carriage was ready.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the carriage.\u201d\u201cYou must be tired, so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just like taking a stroll at the same time, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dKalian urged her to go quickly, so Leila had no choice but to leave the office with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It doesn\u2019t look like a passing shower. Did you bring an umbrella, Ms. aide?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dThe librarian felt sorry and added,\u201cI have an extra umbrella.

It\u2019s a little shameless, but should I leave work early and go to the drugstore?\u201cWhy are you asking for sleeping pills all of a sudden? Do you have insomnia?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s similar.\u201d\u201cOh my.\u201dBaron Delrond clicked his tongue as if he felt very sorry.\u201cI don\u2019t know what caused your insomnia, but it is not good to rely too much on drugs. You might develop a tolerance to the drug, and you might not be able to take it when you absolutely need it.\u201d\u201cThank you for the advice.\u201dI\u2019m really thankful, but\u2026 \u2018That time\u2019 is a necessary moment for me.A night when I can\u2019t sleep without the drug.A night when everything is eaten up in the dark darkness.The thought of spending that night without sleeping pills made my eyes wide open already.*****Philen visited the Duke of Giltian after being invited to dinner.\u201cWelcome, Duke Williot.\u201dDuke Giltian went to the hall and greeted Philen personally. The butler was handed Philen\u2019s rain-soaked coat.Although they\u2019re both Duke, Duke Giltian was like Philen\u2019s father.\u201cThank you for the invitation.\u201dPhilen took Duke Giltian\u2019s outstretched hand with moderate courtesy.Duke Giltian smiled broadly and introduced his family.\u201cThis is my wife, and this is my sons and my daughters-in-law, and next to them are my grandchildren.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see you like this, Duke Williot.\u201dAfter one introduction, they immediately moved to the dining room.As a duke, the dining room was large and grand.Sculptures seen everywhere showed Duke Giltian\u2019s interest.Duke Giltian sat at the higher seat, and Philen sat to his left.The Duke\u2019s sons sat next to Philen, and the Duchess, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren sat straight to Duke Giltian\u2019s right.The meal was held in a quiet and calm atmosphere.\u201cThat time, so\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dDuke Giltian\u2019s family hardly spoke, and only Duke Giltian and Philen were the ones who spoke.Perhaps it was boring, Duke Giltian\u2019s little grandson twisted his body.As a result, the spoon fell to the floor, making a loud clanging sound in the dining room.In an instant, the atmosphere subsided. All eyes were focused on the little grandson.The little grandson trembled with great fear. His face looked like he was about to cry.Lily, the child\u2019s mother and the second daughter-in-law of Duke Giltian, also turned white.\u201cI, I apologize.\u201dLily hurriedly bowed her head toward Duke Giltian and Philen and apologized.\u201cThere\u2019s a guest, and he\u2019s being rude\u2026 Tian.\u00a0 You, too, hurry up and apologize.\u201d\u201cS, sorry, hiccup .\u201dThe frightened child hiccuped and finally shed a drop of tears.Philen didn\u2019t do anything, but he didn\u2019t feel very good because he seemed like a villain who tormented the child.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dPhilen said, wiping his mouth with a napkin.\u201cHe\u2019s still a child, and he can make mistakes. You don\u2019t need to apologize like that.\u201dLily\u2019s white face never returned to normal even after Philen\u2019s words.The child also was not free from fear.They kept looking at Duke Giltian\u2019s mood.It was the same for other people.Philen was the only one who didn\u2019t look at Duke Giltian\u2019s mood.Duke Giltian must be strict.If they look at him like that, he must be pretty strict.How strict is he that everyone looks at him like that?Looking at the child out of curiosity, Philen found a bruise on the back of the child\u2019s neck.It was a mark of being hit hard by something.Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 did Duke Giltian hit him?It seemed to be because of the child\u2019s reaction, but he didn\u2019t intend to go ahead and talk about it.Because it was someone else\u2019s family affair. It had nothing to do with him.\u201cMy my, Duke Williot is generous.\u201dDuke Giltian laughed cheerfully and forcibly evoked the subdued atmosphere.Other people forced a smile and agreed with Duke Giltian.\u201cThank you for being generous with my grandson\u2019s mistake.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dWhile Duke Giltian and Philen were talking, Lily quietly disappeared with her child.\u201cCome to think of it, Duke Williot.\u201dAfter taking a sip of wine, Duke Giltian said as if he suddenly remembered it.\u201cRumor has it that the Duke and Lady Thebesa have broken up, is that true?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a false rumor.\u201dWhen Philen firmly dismissed it, Duke Giltian nodded as if he had finally understood.\u201cThen the rumor about Lady Leila Thebesa being the Emperor\u2019s mistress must be false.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dPhilen\u2019s eyes widened when he heard that for the first time in his life.*****Even that day, Kalian was returning from a meeting at the outer palace until late.It rained so hard that even using an umbrella was useless. To make matters worse, thunder and lightning struck.Because of that, Kalian, who was returning to the palace slower than usual, frowned when he saw the light was on again on the aide\u2019s office\u2019s window.Again, the culprit was Leila.It\u2019s only been a day since she said that she wouldn\u2019t do that again. He couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019s already breaking her words.She needs to be scolded for her to come to her senses.If she didn\u2019t listen to what I said with good words, I have no choice but to give her a scolding.Thinking that she should be severely scolded, Kalian headed to the aide\u2019s office.Kalian, as usual, left the attendants outside and went inside alone.But Leila was nowhere to be seen. Her desk was empty.Did she forget to turn off the lights and go home?I don\u2019t think so, given her desk isn\u2019t organized.Did she go to the bathroom?It was when he turned around because he thought he should look for her.Rumbling, BANG-!\u201cHig\u2026!\u201dHe heard someone moaning along with the roar of thunder.Buried in the thunder, it couldn\u2019t be heard well, but Kalian, who caught it sharply, turned his head again.\u201cLeila?\u201dSoon, he found Leila trembling as she crouched under the desk with her ears covered.Kalian knelt down on one knee and sat in front of Leila.Only then did Leila realize that Kalian was there and looked at him.Her eyes were drenched in tears, her focus blurred.Her pale blue lips trembled.\u201cYour\u2026 Majesty?\u201dFortunately, she didn\u2019t seem to have completely lost her mind.\u201cWhy are you\u2026\u201dRumbling, BANG-Kalian\u2019s voice was buried in the roar of thunder.\u201c\u2026!\u201dHer blurry focus had completely disappeared. Tears were dripping down from her eyes in fear.Leila covered her ears harder and buried her face between her knees. Her body trembled like an aspen.Is she afraid of the sound of thunder?It\u2019s just a little loud, but why is she so scared like a child?It\u2019s ridiculous, but I have to calm Leila down for now.\u201cLeila.\u201dKalian grabbed Leila\u2019s shoulder and shook it.\u201cLeila, look at me.\u201d\u201c\u2026ugh.\u201d\u201cLeila.\u201dAlthough he called her several times, Leila hardly came to her senses.She was covering her ears so hard that her nails ripped her skin and bled.Her condition is worse than I thought.Kalian\u2019s eyes contorted.It seems that there\u2019s no way to wake her up in a simple way.Kalian forcibly removed Leila\u2019s hands, which were tearing her ears, unaware that she hurt herself.BANG!The thunder struck again in bad timing.Her eyes that lost focus were greatly shaken.\u201cN, no! No!\u201dI have to cover my ears. I have to stop the thunder sound.\u201cLet me go, let me go! I said let me go\u2026!\u201dLeila screamed and struggled to get out of Kalian\u2019s hands.Broken nails scratched Kalian\u2019s cheeks and other places.However, Kalian didn\u2019t frown at all. He didn\u2019t even push Leila away or yell at her.Rather, he hugged her tightly. Leila\u2019s tear-soaked face rested on his shoulder.\u201cMy beloved daughter. I\u2019m so glad I met you, Leila.\u201dDuchess Williot\u2019s sweet voice was heard in Leila\u2019s ears.\u201cLeila, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dGod doesn\u2019t care about me, right?\u201cMy Lady!\u00a0 The master and the madam are\u2026!\u201dI\u2019m just happy now. Why are you pushing me back into misery?Does God hate me?If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019d better kill me.Why are you taking the people I love?I said\u2026 you\u2019d better kill me instead!\u201cMy parents are dead.\u201dNo, Philen. They are alive in my heart.\u201cHow long will you cling on to the dead and never forget them?\u201dIt\u2019s the same for you.\u201cWhy are you afraid of thunder like a fool?\u201dI know that too. I know I\u2019m such a fool\u2026 But what could I do if I\u2019m still scared of it?\u201cI\u2019m not a child, so don\u2019t bother me with that.\u201dPhilen, I\u2026\u201cPack up and leave the mansion right away, Lady Thebesa.\u201dThe darkness has come.I\u2019m alone again.I thought I had finally entered a family fence, but it\u2019s all an illusion.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 alone.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cNo way.\u201dA ray of light could be seen through the dark darkness.Leila raised her blurry eyes.Then she saw a man smiling affectionately at her.She knew it was a man, but she couldn\u2019t remember who it was.He feels familiar, it looks like he\u2019s someone I\u2019ve seen often\u2026 Who is it?Leila, who was staring blankly at the man, slowly blinked her eyes.\u201cYou must be sleepy.\u201dIs that so? Now that I heard him, it seems to be like that.The only reason she couldn\u2019t sleep was because she was afraid of hearing thunder again.She needed something else to mask the thunder.For example\u2026\u201c\u2026sing me a song.\u201dAt Leila\u2019s request, the man smiled slightly.\u201cYou\u2019re making a rude request, you know?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re talking without honorifics.\u201dThe man acted like he wouldn\u2019t do it, but he slowly opened his mouth.A low, sweet voice resounded softly. It was a charming voice.His singing made her gradually become deaf and actually could no longer hear the sound of rain and thunder.In Leila\u2019s ears, only the sound of Kalian\u2019s singing could be heard.Since she couldn\u2019t hear the thunder anymore, her body, which had been trembling for a long time, calmed down little by little.This is\u2026 a lullaby?It was her first time. For someone to sing a lullaby for her.Leila just always overheard the lullabies sung to other people.So she got scolded several times.They said she\u2019s surely an ignoble child, that\u2019s why she\u2019s acting like one.However\u2026\u00a0 A lullaby is such a sleepy song, huh?Sadness disappeared in her eyes where the tears had stopped, and drowsiness filled the spot.Distant drowsiness came rushing in.Even though she thought that she shouldn\u2019t fall asleep like this, Leila couldn\u2019t defeat the drowsiness.As her black eyes disappeared into her thin eyelids, her body drooped helplessly in Kalian\u2019s arms.There\u2019s a faint smile on her lips that didn\u2019t match her tear-soaked face.\u201cWhat are you smiling about?\u201dKalian chuckled as if it was ridiculous, and swept over Leila\u2019s hair that flowed over her face.With his thumb, he wiped away all the tears left on her face and looked at the scars on Leila\u2019s ears.Her ears were full of scars. There were many old scars besides the ones that had just occurred. There were also dents.It looks like she has been suffering from this for quite some time.\u201cI guess you\u2019re not simply afraid of thunder.\u201dWhat on earth happened to you, Leila?He was curious, but he had no intention of asking. Because it\u2019s a big deal if he asked for nothing and dug through the painful wounds.He just wanted the wounds she had now healed well without leaving any scars.Kalian wiped off the sticking blood, didn\u2019t mind getting his sleeve dirty.After all the blood was almost wiped off, Kalian laid Leila on the sofa and called Rahel.Rahel freaked out when he saw the scratches on Kalian\u2019s face.\u201cYour, Your Majesty! You, you\u2019re hurt\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just little scratches.\u201dBut, they\u2019re not little scratches.Rahel swallowed what he was about to say and looked quickly at Leila, who was lying on the sofa.Leila\u2019s condition didn\u2019t look very good either.These two, did they have a fight?No, it doesn\u2019t make sense to fight with the emperor, and even so, how dare she hurt the emperor\u2019s face\u2026\u201cNothing happened.\u201dKalian looked at Leila with a subtle face and said firmly.\u201cYou see nothing.\u201dIt meant to keep everything he saw here.All till the scratches on his face.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cAnd bring the ointment.\u201d\u201cShould I bring a blanket too?\u201dRahel asked tactfully.Kalian thought for a moment and nodded.\u201cAlso, bring all the documents I saw here.\u201dTonight, it seemed like he wouldn\u2019t be sleeping, so he thought to look at the documents.*****I woke up out of a clear blue sky.Usually, it would make my head hurt like it was breaking, but strangely, it didn\u2019t hurt at all.I felt rather refreshed. My eyes and ears stung a little, but other than that, there was no pain anywhere else.It was refreshing. I felt like I could do anything.Today, I\u2019m going to finish the things I couldn\u2019t do yesterday.\u2026by the way, how far did I work yesterday?I couldn\u2019t remember. I had never done this before.When I opened my eyes in bewilderment, I saw the familiar ceiling and blinked my wide-opened eyes.That ceiling\u2026 The aide\u2019s office?That means I\u2019m in the aide\u2019s office, but\u2026Why am I sleeping here\u2026\u201c\u2026!\u201dThings I wish I hadn\u2019t remembered came to mind sparsely.From hiding under the desk in surprise when the thunder and lightning struck while I was working.Being terrified and trembling until meeting Kalian and being held in his arms. All of it.I couldn\u2019t remember what happened after that, but I was sure I had caused him trouble.I can\u2019t believe I have caused trouble to the Emperor and not anyone else.\u201cCrazy, crazy!\u201dEven if I was crazy, I wasn\u2019t usually this crazy.I wanted to cry, so I covered my face with both hands.\u201cHow can I see His Majesty now?\u201d\u201cHow can you see? You can just see me.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dWhen I heard Kalian\u2019s voice out of nowhere, I turned my head in surprise.Only then did I see Kalian sitting at Baron Delrond\u2019s desk, looking at the documents.My mouth opened on its own.\u201cSin, Since when\u2026\u201d\u201cSince when you stared blankly at the ceiling?\u201dThat means you\u2019ve seen it all from the beginning!No, rather than lying in front of the emperor.I hurriedly got up from my seat, tidied my disheveled hair and clothes, and bowed my head toward Kalian.\u201cI, I apologize! How dare I sleep in front of Your Majesty\u2026!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dKalian put down the document he was looking at and looked at me.\u201cHow\u2019s your body?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dI nodded my head vigorously to indicate that I was really okay.\u201cHmm.\u201dKalian let out a small nasal sound and glanced at me, then he got up from his seat and walked towards me.Clo, close.At a distance closer than I thought, I took a deep breath and didn\u2019t dare to exhale.If he had something to say, I wished he could say it soon, but Kalian didn\u2019t say anything and just stared at me.His gaze was very burdensome and it made me tense, so I held my hands tightly together.Then Kalian frowned and took my hand.\u201cIf you put too much strength, the wound will get worse.\u201dWound? Ah.Only then did I realize that my nails were broken.Looks like I had another seizure.Sometimes, when my stress reached its peak, I would have seizures on a thunderstorm night.Like ripping my skin.Or scratching other people blindly.Wait. That means\u2026!I hurriedly checked Kalian\u2019s face.It was faint, but there were red scratches on his cheeks and on the nape of his neck.They were scratches that didn\u2019t exist when I went to report yesterday.\u201cDid, did I cause that?\u201dI asked, hoping it wasn\u2019t, but Kalian smiled awkwardly. It was positive that it was me.Oh my God.I can\u2019t believe I hurt the emperor\u2019s face. I must be really crazy.How am I supposed to apologize for this? No, am I going to be arrested right now?The refreshing feeling suddenly subsided.My mind went blank and I was nervous.My mouth was dry.I was restless and bowed my head repeatedly.\u201cI, I apologize. How, how dare I hurt Your Majesty\u2019s face\u2026\u201dMy lips trembled and I couldn\u2019t speak properly.Because this wasn\u2019t a problem that could be solved simply by apologizing.Even if I was punished severely, there was nothing to say.As I kept my mouth closed because I didn\u2019t know what to say, Kalian shrugged.\u201cI\u2019m kidding. It\u2019s not because of you, so don\u2019t worry.\u201dIt was obviously a lie. A pure white lie to ease my worries.Instead of feeling lighter, my heart became heavier.The fact that I caused trouble to such a good person weighed heavily on my heart.I also was ashamed to show such a bad appearance.\u201cI apologize\u2026\u201dIt was a pity that the only way to express this feeling right now was by saying these words.\u201cI\u2019m telling you it\u2019s not because of you.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201dKalian asked with a stern face.It was disloyal to dare to doubt the emperor\u2019s words.Although I didn\u2019t feel ashamed to say yes willingly, I still replied \u201cno.\u201d in a low voice.\u201cThen it\u2019s fine.\u201dAs if satisfied with that alone, Kalian smiled brightly and rang the bell on the desk.The attendant came in and bowed politely.\u201cPrepare breakfast.\u201d\u201cYes, I understand.\u201dBreakfast, huh?I glanced out the window where the bluish dawn was still there.Looking at the atmosphere outside the window, it seemed that the sun had not risen yet.Fortunately, it didn\u2019t seem like I slept very long.But I couldn\u2019t believe I was staying out. Sarah must be very worried.\u201cLeila, eat breakfast first, then go home to rest.\u201dGo home to rest?I shook my head in bewilderment.\u201cI cannot do that. I have something\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dKalian dismissed it.\u201cYou need a break.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI definitely told you to rest.\u201dKalian said firmly as if he wouldn\u2019t change his words and then went outside.*****After returning from the Duke of Giltian, Philen couldn\u2019t sleep all night.It was because of what Duke Giltian said.\u201cThen the rumor about Lady Leila Thebesa being the Emperor\u2019s mistress must be false.\u201dWhat an absurd story.There\u2019s no way that the knowledgeable Leila could have become the emperor\u2019s mistress.Obviously not\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dPhilen\u2019s face hardened as he suddenly remembered how Kalian and Leila were having a friendly conversation.Philen had never seen Leila smiling so brightly when talking with another man.Of course, since the opponent was the emperor, she couldn\u2019t talk while frowning.But there\u2019s no need for her to smile so brightly.And even hugged him there, right?\u201c\u2026as expected, did she become the emperor\u2019s mistress after all?\u201dThinking like that, Leila\u2019s confident actions made sense.Is that why you\u2019re holding on without coming back to me, Leila?Suspicion swallowed up his anger and it gradually grew bigger.Philen\u2019s face was terribly distorted.\u201cHUGO! GET READY TO GO OUT RIGHT NOW! I NEED TO MEET LEILA!\u201dI have to meet her to see if the rumor is true.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And it was even more burdensome considering what happened last night.I was glad he didn\u2019t ask about yesterday\u2026Still, wishing that Baron Delrond could be here, I took the bread and looked at the empty seat to Kalian\u2019s left.Perhaps he saw my gaze, Kalian asked while drinking wine.\u201cYou seem to miss Ver, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes? No.\u201d\u201cNo? You were looking at Ver\u2019s seat the whole time we were eating.\u201dDid I? I don\u2019t think I saw it that many times.Feeling awkward for no reason, I tore the bread.Kalian picked up his wine glass and opened his mouth again.\u201cIs a man like Ver your type?\u201d\u2026what else is he talking about?As I looked at him, confused by his sudden question, Kalian smiled mischievously.\u201cYou were looking at Ver\u2019s seat so desperately, so I asked you just in case.\u201dAh, he\u2019s teasing me, huh?Rumor said that Kalian was a ferocious person who didn\u2019t smile often, rough, and mercilessly cut things he didn\u2019t like.But the Kalian I met was not like that.He had a good smile and his personality was gentle enough.I made several mistakes, but he was generous and forgiving.In addition, he was so playful that I had been teased by him over and over again.I won\u2019t be teased this time.He must be teasing me frequently because I keep getting teased.I quickly fixed my expression and answered calmly.\u201cIf Baron Delrond was my type, would Your Majesty build me a bridge to cross over personally?\u201d[T/N: Build a bridge to cross over means to improve relationships between people; set up a date.]\u201c\u2026what?\u201dKalian asked as if it was ridiculous.\u201cAre you serious, Leila? Do you really like men like Ver?\u201dOf course not. It\u2019s not that Baron Delrond wasn\u2019t really my type of man, but to be precise, I didn\u2019t have a type of man that I liked.Because before those values were formed, I was engaged to Philen and joined the Duke of Williot.And of course, there were men who I didn\u2019t like.For example\u2026\u201cLeila.\u201dI came to my senses at the sound of snapping fingers.Oh my. I was thinking about something else again.I was about to apologize in a hurry, but Kalian spoke faster than me.\u201cSeeing you take it seriously, it seems that men like Ver are really your type.\u201d\u2026hmm? What is he talking about?\u201cI\u2019m telling you for your sake, but you should give up on Ver. Ver is not as good a man as you think.\u201dKalian\u2019s misunderstanding continued.\u201cContrary to his appearance, he has a bad personality and has a dark side.\u201dIs that so?\u201cIs that all? He doesn\u2019t bathe often as well.\u201d\u201cHe looks clean.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just his appearance. It\u2019s completely dirty inside.\u201dKalian firmly denied it.\u201cCertainly, Ver and you don\u2019t match.\u201d\u201cAm I not good enough for the Baron?\u201dKalian frowned.\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\u201cIs it not?\u201d\u201cNo. Ver is infinitely not enough for you.\u201dOn what standard does he say that?I was curious and wanted to ask, but someone knocked and came in.It was Sir Hiltine. Sir Hiltine met my eyes and greeted me, bowing his head.I, too, greeted Sir Hiltine by bowing my head.Then Kalian glanced at me, a little surprised.What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dHiltine approached Kalian and whispered into his ear.His voice was so small that even I nearby couldn\u2019t hear it.\u201cReally?\u201dKalian\u2019s eyes flashed eerily.A cold smile crept across his lips.When I saw his face, I was suddenly reminded of his nickname.The Slaughter Emperor.\u2026but shouldn\u2019t there be smoke, there\u2019s fire?Kalian put down the cutlery he was holding.It looked like he had finished eating, seeing that he put it neatly on the side instead of on the plate.When I also put the cutlery down, Kalian said, wiping his mouth with a napkin.\u201cYou can eat more.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI wasn\u2019t saying empty words, I was really full.I just pretended to eat because Kalian hadn\u2019t put his cutlery down.\u201cThen I will go back home now.\u201dBefore I go home, I\u2019ll stop by the office and take what I haven\u2019t done yet.With that thought in mind, I got up from my seat, but Kalian waved his hand.\u201cWait. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201dDon\u2019t tell me, I don\u2019t think he meant to go to the office together.\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking of taking me home, I can go by myself. If you could lend me a carriage\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that I\u2019m taking you, but I\u2019m not going out because of you, so you don\u2019t have to refuse.\u201dKalian smiled slightly.\u201cBecause your house is on the way, I\u2019m just thinking of going together.\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe that that was the reason.Making a wrong guess without ground, I bowed my head in embarrassment.\u201cThen, shall we go?\u201dKalian got up from his seat and strode away.I asked while following him.\u201cUmm, can I stop by the office before we go?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s to pack your stuff, I\u2019ll allow it, but no documents.\u201dI was about to say that I had to bring the documents, so I flinched and stopped.Kalian, who stopped at the same time, frowned and looked at me.\u201cI told you to rest, you seem to have heard me in vain, huh?\u201d\u201cN, no.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201dKalian snorted.\u201cIf not so, there is no way you would dare to take the documents with you when I told you to rest at home.\u201d\u201cI was thinking of going to work on it after taking a good rest\u2026\u201d\u201cReject.\u201dKalian said firmly.\u201cI\u2019ll tell the maids to bring your stuff. You will go right out with me.\u201dKalian turned around and walked away as if he didn\u2019t want to hear my answer.I hurriedly followed him.After standing outside and waiting for a while, the attendant brought out two plain brown horses.Not a carriage, but horses?I looked at Kalian in bewilderment.\u201cI apologize, but Your Majesty, I don\u2019t know how to ride a horse yet.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dHiltine rode one of the horses he had prepared.\u201cExcuse me for a moment.\u201d\u201cKkyag!\u201dKalian grabbed me by the waist, held me up, and put me on the horse.I couldn\u2019t believe he held a person up this lightly.\u201cI, I must have been heavy.\u201dAs I was in awe, Kalian climbed up behind me and chuckled.\u201cHeavy? You\u2019re too light. Are you eating properly?\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re this light. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201dKalian reached out from behind and grabbed the horse\u2019s reins.As a result, I was naturally being held in his arms. I stiffened my body with a little embarrassment.His body that touched my back kept bothering me.\u201cI should tell them to prepare your meals with high calories from now on.\u201d\u201cThen my body becomes heavy and it becomes difficult to move.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can be a little heavier.\u201dAfter answering indifferently, Kalian stamped his foot.Hiltine followed Kalian, who was running lightly.By the time we reached the gate, Kalian asked me as if he had suddenly remembered.\u201cWhere is your house?\u201d*****\u201cYoung Lady has already left for work.\u201dIt\u2019s not 8 o\u2019clock yet, but she\u2019s already left for work?I can\u2019t believe it.Philen frowned and asked the maid again, who had a familiar face but didn\u2019t know her name.\u201cDid Leila really leave for work already?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTo be honest, she hadn\u2019t come back from work yesterday, but Sarah calmly lied without blinking.And Leila usually left for work at 7 o\u2019clock, so it wasn\u2019t a blatant lie.Unaware of that fact, Philen sighed in annoyance and swept his hair up.He wanted to check the truth of the rumor as soon as possible, but he was frustrated because Leila was not there.Should I go to the Imperial Palace right now?No. Even so, I can\u2019t get into the inner palace where Leila works.Even a duke had to get permission from the Imperial family to enter the inner palace where the Imperial family lived.There\u2019s nothing I can do. All I can do is wait for Leila to get off work.\u201cWhen does Leila get off work?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dHe thought she would get off work by 7 o\u2019clock at the latest, but the answer he got back was ridiculous.\u201cDoes that mean she had no fixed hours to get off work?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about that either. I just know it\u2019s always different.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll come back at night.\u201dAfter notifying Sarah, Philen left the house and didn\u2019t get on the horse right away, but looked over at Leila\u2019s house.The mansion with vine roses on the outer wall was quite small and pretty, but it was too shabby for the fianc\u00e9e of Duke Williot to live in.She was determined to make me lose my face.If I meet her, I\u2019ll take care of the house right away.No, is that necessary?She\u2019ll go back to the estate with me anyway.Philen looked blankly at Leila\u2019s house and got on his horse.He wanted to meet Leila quickly, so he rode a horse instead of a carriage. He didn\u2019t even bring an escort knight.When he turned around the corner to go to the Duke\u2019s mansion.\u201cHere it is.\u201dA familiar voice was heard from across the alley.This voice\u2026 Leila?Without realizing it, Philen got off his horse and hid behind the wall, looking at where the voice came from.A pair of a man and a woman were riding on a plain brown horse.The man on the back got off the horse and reached out towards the woman.\u201cGet off.\u201dThe man was Kalian.\u201cThank you.\u201dAnd the woman was Leila.Leila took Kalian\u2019s hand and gently got off the horse.Kalian looked at Leila with a stern face and said.\u201cI\u2019ll say it once again, never think of working. You have to take a good rest today.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re always good at answering.\u201dIn his eyes, the atmosphere flowing between Kalian and Leila was unusual.They didn\u2019t look simply as the emperor and his aide to him. It seemed to be a deeper relationship than that.For example, lovers\u2026Did she really become the emperor\u2019s mistress?I\u2019ve never heard of an emperor taking his aide home with a horse.Philen clenched his hand tightly, not realizing that his nails were digging into his skin until bleeding.Blood from the torn skin dripped to the ground.At that moment, Kalian turned his head and looked at the alley where Philen was hiding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPhilen was surprised and hurriedly hid himself.Fortunately, perhaps because he didn\u2019t see Philen, Kalian got on his horse, looking like he\u2019s leaving.\u201cThen see you tomorrow, Leila.\u201dLeila, not Lady Thebesa.As expected, it\u2019s clear that the two are not in a normal relationship.Does she become the Emperor\u2019s mistress?Clenching his teeth, Philen\u2019s eyes flashed dangerously.Philen wanted to run out right away, but he waited for Kalian to leave for now.Soon after, the sound of the horse\u2019s hooves became farther and farther away, and eventually, it was not heard.Now.He was going to meet Leila right away, but he felt a terrifying murderous presence behind him.Philen took out the sword he always brought and took a defensive stance.Clang-The sound of swords clashing sharply echoed through the quiet alley.Even in the dark alley, Philen could see his dazzling silver hair and immediately recognized the identity of his opponent.The Emperor\u2019s loyal dog, Hiltine.Hiltine\u2019s here meant that Kalian knew he was here.He thought he didn\u2019t get caught, but he\u2019s wrong.Well, Kalian was one of the outstanding knights after all.If Kalian had not left the battlefield in the middle and returned to the Imperial Palace, he would have got the first place that made the most contributions.\u201cI will pass on the words of His Majesty to you, Duke Williot.\u201dHiltine said in a monotonous voice with almost no pitch.\u201cDon\u2019t hang around Leila unnecessarily and leave right now.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWho is unnecessary to whom now?And hang around?Philen\u2019s face was distorted at the remark that clearly ignored him.\u201cHis Majesty is asking for something preposterous.\u201dWhat he didn\u2019t like the most was that he had to leave right now.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a fianc\u00e9 visiting his fianc\u00e9e?\u201dHiltine didn\u2019t respond to any of Philen\u2019s complaints.He just looked at Philen with an expressionless face.What a jerk.But his skills were clear. He didn\u2019t want to admit it, but Hiltine\u2019s skills were comparable to his.In addition, his assassination skill was even better than him.\u2026like he\u2019s a former assassin.\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t leave?\u201dHiltine finally answered.\u201cIf the Duke didn\u2019t leave, His Majesty said that you would pay the price for breaking the Imperial order.\u201dThe sword, which was pointed downwards, aimed at Philen again.Instead of retaliating, Philen put his sword back.\u201cIf it\u2019s the Imperial order, there\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dHe could stand it even if it was the Imperial order, but the problem was Hiltine.Philen couldn\u2019t afford to lose to him, but he\u2019s not even confident of winning.Moreover, if he fought in a place like this and other people saw it, he would become a joke to other nobles.He couldn\u2019t do that. He couldn\u2019t do anything that would damage the reputation of the Duke of Williot.Only then did Hiltine lower his sword again and lower his head lightly toward Philen.\u201cI\u2019ll take you to the Duke of Williot\u2019s mansion.\u201dA guarantee was a must in case Philen changed his mind and came back.Even if there\u2019s no need for him to follow him, Philen didn\u2019t say anything and quickly got on his horse.*****As soon as I got home, I got the shocking news from Sarah.\u201cDuke Williot\u2026 come?\u201dSarah nodded her head and shouted.\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! I can\u2019t believe he came after he kicked you out! I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking!\u201dIt was the same for me too.No, there was only one reason that came to my mind.Asking me to return to Williot estate.That\u2019s ridiculous.Although I missed Williot estate, I had no intention of going back.I had to be crazy if I went back there. To that suffocating place\u2026I was fully satisfied with the life I had now. Working as an aide was more enjoyable and rewarding than expected.\u201cDid the Duke say anything else?\u201d\u201cIn particular\u2026 Ah, he said he\u2019d be back at night.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhat should I do? I didn\u2019t want to meet him. Should I run away?No, it wasn\u2019t something that could be avoided. It was something I had to bump into one day.So I would not run away and waited for Philen to come.As I waited, I felt uncomfortable and anxious.Kalian told me to take a good rest, but I didn\u2019t think I could.I skipped dinner and waited for him, but Philen didn\u2019t show up as the time passed.\u201cDid he really say he\u2019d be back at night?\u201d\u201cHe definitely said that\u2026\u201dLooking at Sarah\u2019s expression, it seemed that Philen had said that for sure.I waited a little longer to see if he was a little late, but Philen didn\u2019t come.The moon tilted and the clock hands pointed to 11 o\u2019clock.There\u2019s no way he\u2019d come at this time.Then there were two possibilities.Either Philen just said it out without thinking.Or because of some reason, he couldn\u2019t come.I didn\u2019t know which one it was, but it was certain that Philen wasn\u2019t coming today.I was glad not to see Philen, but I felt uncomfortable because there\u2019s still unresolved problems between him and me.I was worried that this problem would explode at the banquet.I became even more reluctant to attend the banquet.Should I\u2026 pretend to be sick?*****Eventually, I decided to attend the banquet.It was my first banquet as an aide, so I couldn\u2019t fake illness.Today, I had no other schedule other than to attend the banquet, but I still went to work early.To write the report on the child care institution.Kalian said it was okay to take my time, but if I was late, the children would suffer much more, so I wanted to take care of it quickly.I skipped lunch and was frantically writing the report when I heard a knock.\u201cSir Thebesa.\u201d\u201cMr. Head attendant.\u201dIt was Rahel.I hurriedly got up from my seat and tried to greet him according to etiquette, but I couldn\u2019t grab my skirt.Oh, right. I\u2019m wearing pants now.To be precise, I was wearing the aide\u2019s uniform. To attend the banquet as the emperor\u2019s aide.How should I greet people when I\u2019m wearing pants?I didn\u2019t know because I had never worn pants in front of other people.Thinking about it, I remembered Baron Delrond\u2019s greetings to other nobles and did the same.Place your right hand on your left chest and bend your back slightly.Rahel smiled and responded with the same greeting as me.\u201cIt must be the first time you greet someone like this, but you do it perfectly. That\u2019s amazing.\u201d\u201cYou praise me too much.\u201d\u201cBut I recommend you not to greet His Majesty or other people in that way.\u201dI saw a thorn on his smiling face that I had not seen before.He\u2019s displeased with me.Was the head attendant also one of the nobles who didn\u2019t recognize me as an aide?I had never felt that before\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s time to go to the banquet.\u201dIt\u2019s already time for that, huh?I couldn\u2019t check the time because I was concentrating on my work.\u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201dI hurriedly cleaned my desk and followed Rahel.After walking a little through the long hallway, I saw Kalian talking with Baron Delrond in the distance.Kalian, with his hair up neatly and wearing fancy formal clothes\u2026 was very gorgeous.He was a man who was more suited to the word gorgeous than handsome.Thanks to his blue hair shimmering under the splendid lights, it gave off a mysterious atmosphere like a fairy.Once again admiring his outstanding appearance, I approached him and stood behind him.Only then did Kalian and Baron Delrond look back at me, perhaps noticing that I was here.\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d\u201cI apologize. I\u2019m focusing on writing the report, so I stop\u2026\u201dAgain, inadvertently trying to grab my skirt, I made a vain attempt and clenched my fists tightly.I couldn\u2019t get used to my pants, so I kept making mistakes.It\u2019s a relief that there weren\u2019t a lot of people right now, but I shouldn\u2019t make this kind of mistake at the banquet.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dIt\u2019s also a relief that Kalian didn\u2019t notice my mistake.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dThere\u2019s no need to show any flaws, so I smiled and stood upright as if nothing had happened.\u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201dKalian turned around, swinging his blue cape.Numerous attendants and maids, including me and Baron Delrond, followed Kalian.Soon after arriving at the banquet hall, Kalian stopped and looked back at me.\u201cLeila.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cPrepare yourself.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dWhat do you mean by \u2018prepare yourself\u2019?I looked at him, puzzled by his words, but instead of answering, Kalian waved his hand with an inexplicable smile.Then the attendants blew their trumpets to announce the Emperor\u2019s arrival.\u201cHis Majesty the Emperor is entering!\u201dThe attendant\u2019s loud voice silenced the people and drew their attention.The lavishly dressed nobles bowed their heads one by one and greeted the emperor.Kalian leisurely passed through the people that split like the Red Sea.The attendants and maids stopped at the entrance, but not me and Baron Delrond.We continued walking after Kalian.When he sat at the higher seat, we stood on the stairs right below.Baron Delrond stood to Kalian\u2019s left, and I stood on the right.Thanks to standing under the higher seat, I could tell who was coming.And thanks to attending the emperor\u2019s coronation banquet, I could see quite a few familiar faces.Of course, there\u2019s also Philen. I wasn\u2019t too surprised because I already knew he was coming.But, I didn\u2019t expect that man would come.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe moment I saw his shameless smiling face, I clenched my fists without realizing it.Andante Thebesa.The second son of Count Thebesa.Unlike Count Thebesa, who was being indulged in having sexual relationships with women, and his eldest son, who was addicted to gambling, he was apparently fine.He was kind to the people around him, and he didn\u2019t even ignore the servants.He was also the only one who cared for me as I was being abused by Countess Thebesa.So I trusted and relied on him.\u201cLeila, you\u2019re a nice girl.\u201dI never thought he would change like that.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m just giving you a chance to pay me back.\u201dA terrifying voice pierced my ears.\u201cYou have fine skin.\u201dA terrible touch stroking the place where no one has ever invaded.\u201cWill the inside be finer?\u201dA damp, dirty touch that licked the skin.\u201cShe seduced me! If it wasn\u2019t for that, there\u2019s no way I could get sexually attracted to my sister!\u201dNo. I didn\u2019t do anything.I screamed desperately, but no one listened to me.Rather, I was scolded even more harshly for telling a lie.Saying all I could do was move my body which resembled my mother.They pointed their fingers at me, clicking their tongues, asking me if I wanted to live like that.Like that, I was completely abandoned in Thebesa\u2019s mansion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63***\u201cToday\u2019s banquet is for those who led the war to victory.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dAs if struck by lightning, my mind, which was digging into the cruel past, came back at the solemn voice.I finally came to my senses and took a deep breath.I could feel someone\u2019s gaze. When I looked to the side, Baron Delrond was looking at me worriedly.He asked if I was okay with the shape of his mouth.I tried my best to smile and replied that I was okay, then I clenched my cold sweaty hands.Pull yourself together, Leila.You can\u2019t ruin what you have to do just because of the past you don\u2019t want to remember.I took a deep breath and braced myself.\u201cDuke Williot, Count Asdar, Sandra\u2026\u201dIn the meantime, after finishing his speech, Kalian called out the names of the main characters who led the war to victory.Those who were called came out to the front of the stairs with their glasses.Because of that, I was able to see Philen more closely and gritted my teeth in a different meaning than when I saw Andante.On the other hand, Philen didn\u2019t give me a single glance as if he was not interested in me.I was deeply relieved by the fact, but also anxious at the same time.It felt like seeing a dormant volcano just before it burst.After calling all the names of the main characters, Kalian raised the glass handed by Rahel.\u201cTo comfort the others who were unfortunately killed at the war, cheers.\u201d\u201cCheers!\u201dAll the nobles, including the main characters, emptied the glass they were holding.The banquet began by emptying the glass.As before, Kalian came down from the higher seat and danced with Duchess Cloud first.The aide had nothing to do until halfway through the banquet. So all we could do was to enjoy the party.\u2026will I be able to enjoy it?I peeked at Andante\u2019s side.Andante was not there.I looked around the banquet hall to see if he had gone somewhere else, but I still couldn\u2019t find him.Did he leave? No way.The banquet began now, and there\u2019s no way he could have left.More than that, why\u2019s Andante Thebesa here?Shouldn\u2019t he be in the academy by now?Let alone the Count of Thebesa being a fallen noble and having done nothing during the war, they couldn\u2019t possibly attend this banquet.I knew they didn\u2019t even get an invitation.So how did Andante get here?If it were Countess Thebesa or the Count, it would have been, but not Andante.I was anxious. I had to find him before he could do anything.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI was looking for Andante anxiously when someone suddenly grabbed my shoulder.I looked back in surprise.Behind me was Baron Delrond, who looked more surprised than I was.\u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dBaron Delrond raised both his hands to his chest level.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to surprise you, Sir.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI was surprised purely because I was stupid. Baron Delrond was not at fault.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThe banquet hall is a little stuffy, so I\u2019m going out to the terrace.\u201dBaron Delrond pointed his thumb at the empty terrace.\u201cIf it\u2019s okay with you, would you like to go out there with me?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dGetting out of the people\u2019s eyes was something I wanted too.I gladly followed Baron Delrond to the terrace.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I wore the uniform so it\u2019s stuffy.\u201dAs soon as Baron Delrond came out to the terrace, he frowned and unbuttoned the button that was tightening his neck.Seeing the baron like that, my tension was relieved and laughter came out.\u201cIs it funny that I feel uncomfortable?\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201d\u201cIf you laugh and say something like that, it\u2019s not credible, you know?\u201dBaron Delrond looked at me while grunting.The first song ended as I was talking with Baron Delrond.Numerous ladies gathered around Kalian as if waiting, but Kalian didn\u2019t seem interested.That\u2019s interesting. His reaction was quite different from the men I had seen so far.\u201cSir, aren\u2019t you going to dance?\u201dAt the baron\u2019s question, I looked back at him.\u201cI\u2019m not good at dancing, so I\u2019m just going to rest.\u201d\u201cI saw you dance before, and you were good at it.\u201dAh, did you see that?\u201cI\u2019m only good at the first waltz. And I\u2019m totally poor at the other songs. Besides, I can\u2019t dance in this outfit.\u201dWhen I pointed to the uniform, he nodded, saying he understood.\u201cWell, Sir is a woman, so it\u2019s kind of weird to dance in a men\u2019s uniform. But it\u2019s ironic that the uniform suits you well.\u201d\u201cThe uniform suits me well?\u201d\u201cVery.\u201dThat\u2019s a relief. I was worried if it didn\u2019t suit me.\u201cStill, it\u2019s a little awkward. I don\u2019t know how to greet people.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just greet the way noblemen do?\u201d\u201cIs that okay?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s why I asked.\u201dA moment of silence passed.The baron and I looked at each other and burst out laughing out loud.It\u2019s been a while since I laughed like this. It seemed like a really long time.I didn\u2019t know why I was laughing though.\u201cOh, my.\u201dAfter a long laugh, Baron Delrond realized that his champagne glass was empty and clicked his tongue briefly.\u201cI should go and get some champagne. Will you still be here, Sir?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dInside the banquet hall was stuffy, and if I went inside, I might meet Andante or Philen.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be back with only champagne. Please wait for a moment.\u201d\u201cGo ahead.\u201dI let the baron go and looked at the wide garden.It seemed that my stuffy heart had relieved a little.I liked the quiet silence, too.As I was looking at the wide garden, hoping that the banquet would end without anything happening, like the quiet silence, I could feel someone coming in.\u201cAre you already back\u2026\u201dOf course, I thought it was Baron Delrond, but unexpectedly, it was Philen.As soon as I saw Philen, I took a step back because I wanted to run away, but I couldn\u2019t run away much because the railing was right behind me.When I tried to run away to the banquet hall, Philen was blocking the entrance like an iron fortress, and when I was going to ask other people for help, there\u2019s no one around except for Philen.And there\u2019s no sign from Baron Delrond, who said he would be back.Then I had no choice but to face it head-on.\u201cGet out of my way.\u201dI snapped sharply, but Philen didn\u2019t blink an eye. Rather, he came closer to me.I leaned my back to the railing as much as I could, wary of Philen.\u201cI told you to get out of my way, didn\u2019t I? \u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d\u201cI have nothing to talk about with you.\u201d\u201cI have.\u201dPhilen grabbed my arm. I groaned at how hard he grabbed me.But instead of groaning out loud, I glared at him fiercely.\u201cLet me go.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t run away.\u201d\u201cAs I said before, I have nothing to talk about with you.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s about Williot estate?\u201d\u2026about Williot estate?My resolve not to talk to Philen was shaken.Should I hear what\u2019s going on?Because if there\u2019s a problem with the territory people, I have to help\u2026It wasn\u2019t for Philen. It was for the people of the territory, and furthermore, for the empire.\u201c\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201dWhen I expressed my willingness to listen, Philen finally let go of my arm.My arm, which he was holding, was throbbing. I wrapped the area with my other hand and glared at him.\u201cIf you have something to say, hurry up and say it.\u201d\u201cSince when did you become His Majesty\u2019s mistress?\u201dWhat kind of nonsense is this again?Philen had said countless nonsense so far, but this time it\u2019s by far the best.Philen\u2019s eyes gleamed dangerously as I stood still saying nothing.\u201cSeeing that you didn\u2019t deny it, it looks like you really became the Emperor\u2019s mistress.\u201d\u201cDo you not think I didn\u2019t deny it because it\u2019s so ridiculous?\u201d\u201cAre you saying that it\u2019s a false rumor?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a false rumor. Why would I become the Emperor\u2019s mistress?\u201dI firmly answered no, but Philen didn\u2019t erase his suspicions.Just think whatever you want.Having no intention of making excuses, I waved my hand.\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on in Williot estate?\u201d\u201cCecily is going to have a baby soon.\u201d\u201cI told you to tell me about Williot estate, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cThis is about Williot estate, too.\u201d\u201cHow can this be related to Williot estate?\u201d\u201cOf course, it can. The lord\u2019s child is about to be born.\u201dIt\u2019s just pure coercion.\u201cSo, you want me to congratulate you?\u201d\u201cIf I want it, can you do it?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dIt wouldn\u2019t have been possible if I was in the position of his fianc\u00e9e, but now that we\u2019re completely unrelated to each other, it was possible. There\u2019s no reason not to do it.\u201cCongratulations.\u201dI congratulated him with pleasure, but Philen sighed, rubbing his face.\u201cYou think Cecily\u2019s having a baby is completely someone else\u2019s business, huh?\u201d\u201cBecause it is someone else\u2019s business.\u201dAs I spoke honestly about what I thought, the wrinkles on his forehead deepened.\u201cHow can this be someone else\u2019s business?\u201d\u201cI would rather ask this. Why do you think it has something to do with me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re my fianc\u00e9e.\u201dFianc\u00e9e?It was so ridiculous that I couldn\u2019t even laugh.\u201cDid you forget what I said before I left the mansion? I said that I wanted to break off the engagement, right?\u201d\u201cI know it\u2019s out of anger. You\u2019re angry because I told you to leave.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something, but what I said that day was sincere. I want to break off the engagement. No, our engagement has already broken up.\u201dWhen I emphasized the word \u2018broken up\u2019, a deep wrinkle was formed on Philen.\u201cWhy? Is it because you became the Emperor\u2019s mistress?\u201dWhy did his mind only roll in that direction?\u201cI said no.\u201d\u201cThen, come back. If you want to work as an aide that much, I\u2019ll let you do it.\u201dThe way he spoke as if he was being kind was ridiculous.\u201cI\u2019ve said it many times, but I\u2019m not going back. I have no intention of going back.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d\u201cI told you I\u2019m not lying.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lie, too.\u201dAh, really.Fury rose from the depths of my heart. Even talking to the wall seemed less frustrating than this.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll make sure you believe it. Just the way you did it.\u201dI grabbed Philen\u2019s arm and headed towards the center of the banquet hall.People\u2019s attention was drawn to my sudden move.Philen also looked at me in bewilderment.\u201cWhat are you doing now\u2026\u201d\u201cDuke Williot, I will say it once again.\u201dI ignored Philen\u2019s words neatly and said.\u201cI, Leila Thebesa, want to break off the engagement with you, Duke Philen Williot.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their engagement was broken.\u201d\u201cOh my God, and Duke Williot kept saying it\u2019s not\u2026\u201dEyes filled with smirk poured on them.Philen\u2019s face turned red as if it were going to explode at any moment.Of course, it would be embarrassing.He can\u2019t help but be embarrassed about being publicly humiliated.Why did he have to go to Leila anyway?Ver, who looked at them with his tongue out, found Kalian not too far away.Kalian was looking at them with great interest.The corner of his lips that raised smoothly felt like it was going to reach his ears.What\u2019s so funny?This situation is funny enough, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to make someone laugh.Ver, who was looking at Kalian with a puzzled look, ran to him immediately when he saw Kalian\u2019s eyes bent.\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201dHe grabbed Kalian\u2019s arm tightly and said firmly.Kalian looked back at Ver.\u201cPlease don\u2019t make more work here.\u201dKalian\u2019s head tilted slightly.\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t play innocent with me. You were trying to get in between them just now.\u201d\u201cHoo.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyes widened as if he were surprised.\u201cWhen did you start practicing mind-reading, Ver?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been serving Your Majesty for years, and I know this much without mind-reading.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not fun.\u201dKalian clicked his tongue and lightly removed Ver\u2019s hand.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t do anything.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah. My beloved aide is asking me to do that, so I have to stay still.\u201dVer nodded vigorously.\u201cYes, yes. Please stay still.\u201d\u201cStill, I have to carry out what I have planned.\u201dPlan? What\u2026\u201c\u2026!\u201dVer, who was late realizing what Kalian was talking about, tried to catch him, but Kalian was already walking towards Philen and Leila.AH, NO!Ver\u2019s hand waved in the air.Ver also agreed with Kalian\u2019s plan, but now\u2019s not the time.Please do it when the situation calms down, PLEASE!Ver let out a silent roar. But sadly, it didn\u2019t reach Kalian.Even if he wanted to run and stop Kalian right away, it would draw people\u2019s attention to him, so he couldn\u2019t do it and just stamped his feet repeatedly.Philen was looking at Leila and didn\u2019t seem to know that Kalian was coming behind him.Leila also didn\u2019t notice that Kalian was coming because of Philen.And Kalian didn\u2019t talk to them right away, just watching them for a while.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re so stubborn when you can\u2019t do anything without me and the Duke of Williot.\u201dHis golden eyes containing Leila flashed dangerously.\u201cI knew you\u2019re stupid, but I didn\u2019t know you\u2019re this stupid.\u201dLeila looked at Philen with a smirk as if it were ridiculous.\u201cIf you had believed me, I wouldn\u2019t have done this either.\u201d\u201cHow long do you think you can be as confident as you are now?\u201dPhilen was sarcastic.\u201cHow long do you think His Majesty will be interested in you? You don\u2019t think it\u2019ll last forever, do you?\u201d\u201cWhat if it lasts forever?\u201d\u201c!?\u201dWhen Kalian stepped in all of a sudden, Philen turned to look at him in surprise.Leila also just realized that Kalian was here and looked at him.They both looked equally surprised, but the feeling was completely different.One was cute like a rabbit and the other was disgusting.\u201cDuke Williot, may I take my aide with me if you\u2019re done talking?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not done yet.\u201d\u201cIs that so, Leila?\u201dWhen Kalian called out Leila\u2019s name, the crowd roared.\u201cOh my goodness, did His Majesty just call Lady Thebesa\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cAs expected, the mistress\u2026\u201dEach whisper was small, but as they gathered, it became louder as if they were shouting.It felt even more so because they were all talking about the same thing.Despite the pouring gaze, the two men didn\u2019t care and looked only at Leila.\u201cLeila.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to stay with me, right? Leila.\u201dTwo men were fighting over a woman.It was a good topic for people to talk about. It\u2019s also a regular topic that often appeared in cheap gossip.Everyone wondered what choice Leila would make.Of course, if it was usual, the emperor\u2019s words would have taken precedence over the duke\u2019s, but this was a banquet hall.It was the woman who took the lead in the banquet hall.Someone could refuse a man\u2019s request for dance first, but they couldn\u2019t refuse a woman who requested first.If a woman had several suitors, the woman could choose.Regardless of status or position, it was solely up to the woman\u2019s choice.So everyone waited for Leila\u2019s choice. A bet was also made secretly.Most of them thought she would choose Kalian, and Leila also thought the same.One thing she was worried about was the rumor that she\u2019s a mistress.If she took Kalian\u2019s hand here, the rumor of her being his mistress would grow bigger.But she hated holding Philen\u2019s hand more than being misunderstood as a mistress.\u201cIt\u2019s noisy here, so shall we go somewhere else and talk?\u201dAfter a short consideration, Leila took Kalian\u2019s hand.At this, Philen was in despair, and Kalian smiled triumphantly.Kalian took Leila to the higher seat.But Leila stopped at the stairs below without going up to the higher seat.When Kalian looked at her curiously, Leila bowed slightly and said.\u201cThe aide\u2019s seat is here.\u201dThe mistress could sit next to Kalian, but the aide couldn\u2019t.As an aide, she indirectly said that she couldn\u2019t go to the higher seat.That also indicated that she\u2019s not the emperor\u2019s mistress.\u201cMy aide is very clever.\u201dKalian smiled and held out his hand.Then, Ver, who didn\u2019t know when he came, handed something to Kalian while weeping.\u201cEveryone be quiet.\u201dThe people, who were whispering, shut their mouths all at once at the voice that overwhelmed them and looked at Kalian.There\u2019s still time until the spoils presentation ceremony in the middle of the banquet.So they were curious about why he\u2019s drawing their attention.It was the same with Leila.As Kalian\u2019s aide, she was informed of the banquet order in advance, but there\u2019s no such thing about this.Leila asked Ver, who was standing opposite her, about what was going on with her mouth.But since it was something he couldn\u2019t answer, Ver just smiled without saying a word.\u201c\u2026Historically, all aides have been awarded titles.\u201dKalian\u2019s long speech ended.The bewildered people all looked at Leila in unison at the last words, saying \u2018no way\u2019.Leila, on the other hand, was looking at Kalian.\u201cLeila Thebesa.\u201dEven though Kalian called her name, Leila continued to stand still. Ver came over to her side and tapped her arm.Only then did Leila come to her senses and stand right in front of Kalian.Then, Ver told Leila to kneel on one knee and bowed her head with his mouth.Leila was puzzled, but she still did what Ver told her to do.Rahel handed Kalian a decorative sword.\u201cLeila Thebesa.\u201dKalian tapped her shoulder lightly once.\u201cI grant you the surname of Astera and also the title of baron.\u201d*****Andante left the banquet hall shortly after Kalian granted Leila the baron title. He returned to the Duke of Williot right away to pack his belongings.Ron, his exclusive servant, who had followed him all the way from the Count of Thebesa, looked at Andante strangely.\u201cWhy are you packing all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cBecause we\u2019re leaving the mansion.\u201d\u201cAt this time of night?\u201d\u201cYeah. So don\u2019t procrastinate and pack up quickly.\u201dRon was puzzled by Andante\u2019s orders, but he meekly packed his stuff.After packing everything up, Andante asked the Duke of Williot\u2019s servant to bring him and Ron the horse they rode.\u201cWhere are we going this late at night?\u201d\u201cWe should go to a nearby inn first for sure. But I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a room left.\u201d\u201cWait, why are we leaving this nice mansion and going to the inn?\u201d\u201cEverything has a reason. So, be quiet and follow me.\u201dAndante left the Duke of Williot\u2019s mansion and took a room at an inn far from the Duke\u2019s.He got the best room in the inn, but it was far less than the room Andante stayed in the Duke of Williot.It was even worse than Andante\u2019s room in the Count of Thebesa\u2019s mansion.\u201cAre you really going to stay in a place like this?\u201dAndante smiled at Ron\u2019s complaint and sat down on the bed.\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Because I can\u2019t stay in the Duke of Williot anymore.\u201d\u201cYes? Why? Didn\u2019t the madam say that you can stay at the Duke of Williot while you\u2019re in the capital?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because the two of them have broken up.\u201d\u201cYes?!\u201dRon screamed in surprise.\u201cWhy did they break up\u2026!\u201dThat\u2019s because Leila became the emperor\u2019s mistress.Andante smiled as he recalled the appearance of Leila and Kalian at the banquet hall today.When he first heard this rumor, he was skeptical, but that confirmed it.Leila had become Kalian\u2019s mistress.Otherwise, there\u2019s no way for Kalian to give only that chick the position of an aide and baron.She\u2019s my little sister, but she\u2019s amazing.I can\u2019t believe she seduced the infamous Slaughter Emperor.She looks like she\u2019s someone who doesn\u2019t know much about the world, but unlike her appearance, she seems to be good at that.Well, she must have been engaged to Philen by seducing the former Duke of Williot.As expected, I should\u2019ve forced it back then.Andante clicked his tongue as it was such a pity that his attempt was stopped because Countess Thebesa suddenly came.\u201cOh, right. What should I say to madam? I think she\u2019ll be very disappointed.\u201d\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry about that. Because I brought news that could happen and my mother could brush it off quickly.\u201dAndante\u2019s eyes were pleasantly bent.Andante ignored Ron\u2019s request to tell him what the news was and lay on the bed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s giving a title to a woman. Is His Majesty sane?\u201d\u201cIt is said that if you\u2019re blind to love, you can\u2019t make right judgments. His Majesty must be trying to hide the fact that she is a mistress with that.\u201d\u201cThat means he cherishes the lady that much, right?\u201d\u201cI feel sorry for Duke Williot only.\u201dRegardless of age or gender, they talked about the relationship between Kalian and Leila. While the talk about Philen came up once in a while.And so, the rumor about Leila being Kalian\u2019s mistress became solid as if it was true.Because of the fact that Kalian granted Leila the baron title, the nobles gathered at the Duke of Giltian from early hours.\u201cThis is nonsense!\u201dThe young nobleman slammed the table, enraged.\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s giving a title to a lady! His Majesty can\u2019t do that unless he\u2019s out of his mind!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201dThe other nobles ranted and raved as they agreed with him.\u201cLet\u2019s rush to His Majesty right now and tell him that it absolutely can\u2019t be allowed!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use though.\u201d\u201cHow can you know that?!\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019ve already done it.\u201dA nobleman who had already met Kalian during the morning audience groaned and touched his head with his hand.\u201cI told you it wouldn\u2019t work. When I said that, he threw the Imperial Codes of Law before me.\u201d\u201cCodes of Law?\u201d\u201cYeah. Looking for a reason why Leila Thebesa shouldn\u2019t be granted the baron title.\u201dWhen he said that, they had no choice but to step down quietly without saying anything.Because they already knew that they couldn\u2019t find such a law even if they searched in the Codes of Law.\u201cSo there\u2019s no point in going and saying it can\u2019t be allowed.\u201d\u201cWe can say that it is a custom, not a law!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t overturn the Imperial order with customs alone. Rather, you\u2019ll be ridiculed for bringing up old customs, you know?\u201d\u201cThen, what should we do?! Are you just going to watch that lass take the title?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant\u2026\u201dTANG-!When Duke Giltian put down the cup hard, the noisy room became quiet at once.Everyone kept their mouths shut like clams and read Duke Giltian\u2019s mood.On the other hand, Duke Giltian calmly tilted the pitcher to fill his empty cup.The heavy silence was broken when Duke Giltian, who was drinking water silently, emptied his newly filled cup.\u201cIt\u2019s obviously obsolete to stick to the custom. But if you want to break the custom, you must have a good reason.\u201dDuke Giltian\u2019s gray eyes flashed eerily.\u201cLet\u2019s listen to His Majesty\u2019s excuses on this matter and decide what to do with it.\u201d*****PAK-The scarecrow for practice was smashed. It was the same with the wooden sword Philen was holding.Philen threw away the broken wooden sword and grabbed a new one.Next to him were piles of broken wooden swords and scarecrows.\u201cBring a new scarecrow.\u201dAt Philen\u2019s order, the servants quickly removed the broken scarecrow and brought a new one.Philen mercilessly struck the scarecrow again.What was in front of him was an ordinary practice scarecrow that could be seen everywhere, but in Philen\u2019s eyes, he looked like Kalian.A rogue who seduced Leila with his good-looking face and authority as an emperor!I should have known from the moment it was written down on the official test announcement that women are allowed too.No, I should have done everything I could to stop Leila from taking the official test.Had it been, such a thing wouldn\u2019t have happened.There would have been no such thing as losing Leila to such a guy!He was resentful to Leila, who fell for him, but he hated Kalian more.He couldn\u2019t believe he used the aide position as bait to shake Leila\u2019s heart and induced her to break her engagement. As if it\u2019s not enough, he even gave him such humiliation.Had Kalian not been the emperor, he would have thrown a white glove to his face and challenged him to a duel.It was very annoying that he had to leave the banquet hall without doing anything.WHAT IF HE\u2019S AN EMPEROR!\u201cDARN IT!\u201dThe more he thought about it, the hotter he got. Philen spat out abusive words and swung his wooden sword hard.With that blow, the newly brought practice scarecrow was smashed.Not only that, the handle of the wooden sword that couldn\u2019t overcome his power was also broken.The debris was stuck in his palm, and blood was flowing profusely.Philen looked at his bloody palm indifferently as if it didn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201cAre, are you okay? Duke!\u201d\u201cH, hurry! The doctor!\u201dThe servants next to him were making a great fuss even more.Philen glanced at those servants as if they were annoying, then picked up his coat.\u201cDuke! Since the doctor is here, the treatment\u2026!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need it.\u201dThe servant turned and hurried after Philen.\u201cWhere are you going?! Duke!\u201d\u201cTo Leila.\u201dHe kept thinking about it while beating the practice scarecrow, but he thought it would be better to talk about this with Leila again.Not enraged like yesterday, but calmly.Only then would he be able to hear what Leila truly thought.Philen didn\u2019t think what Leila said yesterday was sincere.Just as he spoke out of anger, Leila would be like that too.So he had to properly explain to Leila what the problem was and convince her to come back.But why do I have to explain it?If she begs to come back, I still have to act, thinking about whether to accept it or not\u2026!\u201cHuu.\u201dPhilen, who stood tall in his place, exhaled a small breath and swept his hair up.The servant looked at him and spoke carefully.\u201cHow, how about getting treatment first? If Young Lady Leila sees that hand, she might be scared and run away.\u201dAt the servant\u2019s words, Philen looked at his injured hand.It was definitely bizarre.Even though it looks like this to me, will Leila be terrified at this?\u201c\u2026the doctor?\u201d\u201cThis way.\u201dAs if waiting, the servant led Philen to the drawing-room where the doctor was waiting.The doctor removed the piece of wood from Philen\u2019s hand and said while suturing the torn wound and applying the bandage.\u201cThe wound is deeper than I thought, so it would be better to be careful for about a week.\u201d\u201cAre you telling me not to hold a sword?\u201d\u201cIf possible, it is better to do so.\u201dDon\u2019t hold a sword for a week to a knight?It wasn\u2019t a very pleasing request, but he nodded for now.\u201cI will prescribe medication to be applied and oral medication to keep the wound from getting worse.\u201d\u201cYou did a good job.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just doing what I had to do. Then I\u2019ll get going.\u201dAs soon as the doctor left, Philen visited the butler.\u201cI\u2019m going to Leila. Prepare the horse. No, I\u2019ll go to the stable.\u201dIt would have been a big deal if I delayed more for no reason and Leila went to work.The day after the party, she usually goes to work in the afternoon, so I still have time, but it was just in case.Feeling impatient, Philen went directly to the stable, got out his horse, and immediately left the mansion.*****It was a fact that I knew too that if I became the emperor\u2019s aide, I could receive a title.But I never thought for some reason that it would be me.I didn\u2019t even dare to wish for it.But granting me the baron title?I couldn\u2019t believe I became a baron.My lips were dry at things I couldn\u2019t even imagine in my dreams.It seemed to be why I was asked to choose a word out of the blue a few days ago.That meant that from then on, he was planning to grant me the baron title\u2026\u201cHe should\u2019ve told me in advance.\u201dIf he had, I would have prepared my heart.But in fact, even if I prepared my heart, nothing would change.Rather, if I had known in advance, there\u2019s a high possibility that I would have made a series of mistakes because I was nervous.Still, this is too sudden.And then there\u2019s Philen and Andante too\u2026\u201cHuu.\u201dI heard bad things happen at the same time. I guessed that words were right.I licked my lips that dried out of tension and grabbed the hem of my humble skirt tightly.I thought hard about what to do next, but there\u2019s no answer.The more I thought about it, the more complicated my mind became.\u2026shall I solve the baron problem first?I thought it would be good, so I got ready to go to the Imperial Palace and went down to the first floor.\u201cMy Lady?\u201dSarah, who was working diligently in the kitchen, noticed me and ran to me.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cThe Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201cYes? You said you were going to go this afternoon.\u201d\u201cI was going to, but I think I have to go early.\u201dIn this situation, I couldn\u2019t wait patiently at home until afternoon.\u201cThen please wait a little bit! I will call a carriage.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dTo organize my complicated mind, I was thinking of walking to the Imperial Palace.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201cMy, My Lady. I\u2019m going to the market today, do you need anything?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need anything.\u201d\u201cThen I will buy just my own. Have a safe trip, My Lady.\u201dI left the house with Sarah seeing me off.As I was walking straight towards the Imperial Palace, I heard the sound of rough horse hooves behind me.Naturally, I stepped out of the way.But the sound of horse hooves stopped behind me.What is it?Bewildered, I turned around and found an unexpected person, then I froze.\u201cAre you on your way to the Imperial Palace?\u201d\u201cPhilen\u2026\u201dWhy is he here?No, since it happened yesterday, it\u2019s only natural for him to come to see me, right?I expected it, but it still baffled me.When Philen got off his horse and stood in front of me, I stepped back, wary of him.\u201c\u2026what brings you here, Duke?\u201dPhilen chuckled at my words.\u201cDuke? It feels distant.\u201dOf course, it is. Because I meant what I said.\u201cIf you\u2019re not busy, give me some of your time. I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201c\u2026what if I refuse?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201dHis mouth was smiling, but his golden eyes flashed dangerously.He seriously intended to take me by force if I refused.Of course, if I rebelled or screamed, no matter how hard Philen tried, I was able to attract the attention of the people around me, but I couldn\u2019t do that.If I did that, tomorrow\u2019s morning newspaper would have our matters published.Our story would always be on everyone\u2019s lips.I wasn\u2019t afraid of that, but I was worried Kalian\u2019s situation would be complicated just because of me.I didn\u2019t want to cause any problems as much as I could.\u201c\u2026I understand\u201dAfter contemplating, I eventually accepted Philen\u2019s request.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66\u201cBut I can only give you 30 minutes. I can\u2019t give you more than that because I also have a schedule. As you can see, I was on my way to the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201cOkay. That\u2019s enough.\u201dPhilen smiled and held out his hand.\u201cThen shall we go in?\u201dGo in? Where?\u201cAre you thinking of going into my house?\u201d\u201cThen? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to talk in there?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dWho wants to let him into my house? I never even thought of that.\u201cLet\u2019s talk here.\u201dPhilen\u2019s brows furrowed.\u201cDo you want to talk on the street?\u201d\u201cI am comfortable with that.\u201dIf we talked on the street, I could ask for help from those around me in case of an emergency.And Philen wouldn\u2019t be able to step forward recklessly because there were people around here.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, I\u2019ll get going.\u201dWhen I turned around with the real intention of going, Philen hurriedly grabbed my arm.\u201cYou\u2019ve become very impatient since I saw you last.\u201dThat\u2019s because I don\u2019t want to talk face to face with you.Philen said after hesitating for a moment.\u201c\u2026come to think of it, I think I\u2019ve been too indifferent to you all this time. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dShould I be glad that you realized it now?\u201cI\u2019m truly reflecting on it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying this\u2026 can\u2019t you come back to the estate?\u201dSeeing him come to me like this and say that even though he reproofed me like that yesterday, it seemed that he really wanted me to come back to the estate.But what should I do, Philen?\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duke.\u201dI\u2019ve already stopped caring about it completely.\u201cAs I said at the party yesterday, I have no intention of going back to Williot estate.\u201dThe dream of becoming the Duchess of Williot was put down when I left the Williot estate.It would be a lie if I said that there\u2019s no regret left, but the desire to not go back was bigger than that.I didn\u2019t want to be ignored by him anymore, and I didn\u2019t want to live while having to read his thoughts.At my answer, Philen\u2019s face instantly turned red.\u201cI bend like this, and you build your pride until the very end, huh?\u201dI never build my pride though.\u201cWhat on earth should I do to make you come back? Tell me what you want. I\u2019ll listen.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201dI replied calmly.\u201cNo matter what you do, I have no intention of going back. So, please, fold your heart, Duke.\u201dArguing with him like this was physically and mentally exhausting. I wanted to stop.\u201cPlease.\u201dOnce again, I sincerely hoped that I wouldn\u2019t be involved with him in this matter again.Then Philen\u2019s expression collapsed. It was my first time seeing him like this.\u201cConsidering how long we\u2019ve been together, you easily abandon me, huh?\u201dWho abandoned who?I was speechless for a moment because it was ridiculous and I was dumbfounded.I wanted to point out how nonsense it was, but considering Philen\u2019s status, I responded to him as calmly as I could.\u201cThe Duke was the one who abandoned me first.\u201dThen Philen bit his lip hard.Seeing him doesn\u2019t deny it, it seems that he hasn\u2019t sold his conscience completely.\u201cThat\u2019s why I said I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHis words and expressions didn\u2019t match at all.\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry for being indifferent to you or yelling at you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cThank you for saying sorry even now.\u201d\u201cIs that your only answer?\u201dNodding in that sense, Philen sighed heavily and covered his face with his bandaged hand.There\u2019s some blood on the white bandage.It was fine yesterday, but maybe he got hurt in the meantime?I was a little worried because it wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t have a heart as much as I hated him.But there were no words coming out of my mouth. Because I didn\u2019t want to give him hope for nothing.Although it might seem a bit harsh, it was good for him and for me to cut it off firmly when we could do so.\u201cIf you have nothing more to say, I\u2019ll get going.\u201dI bowed my head to Philen and turned around.\u201cWait\u2026\u201dPhilen grabbed my arm.\u201cAh!\u201dHis grip was stronger than I expected. I looked at the arm he was holding with a slight frown.\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was then that Philen threw my arm away and pulled out the sword he brought on his waist.That shook me for a moment, but fortunately, I quickly regained my balance and didn\u2019t fall unsightly.Philen looked somewhere while holding his sword, and then clicked his tongue.\u201c\u2026that\u2019s why you\u2019re not coming back.\u201dHis golden eyes, full of murderous intent, stared at me.When I met those eyes, I felt a chill as if I was standing in the middle of the road without wearing a coat on a cold winter day.I wrapped my arms around and stepped back. My legs were shaking and I felt like I would collapse at any moment, but I tried my best to hold out.\u201cLady Thebesa.\u201dThere\u2019s also a chill in his voice. His attitude was completely different from before.\u201cI ask you one last time. Are you really not coming back?\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201dI forced out a voice that didn\u2019t come out well and answered.Then Philen clicked his tongue and got on the horse.And he went away without looking back.What? Is it over?Afraid that Philen might come back, I stared intently at the direction he disappeared, but he didn\u2019t come back.\u201cHuu.\u201dNow that I was relieved, I breathed heavily and wiped my chest.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 really over, right?\u201dBecause he said one last time.I was a little worried because Philen was the type of person who could change his words like flipping a palm, but I didn\u2019t think he would cling to me again after I did him this much.Because he was a man with higher pride than anyone else.So, it was safe to say that this was the end of my relationship with Philen.It was a pleasure, but on the other hand, I was depressed because this also completely ended my relationship with the Duke of Williot.The former Duke and Duchess Williot, who loved me so much.My thanks to the servants of the duke family and the territory people who followed me well, who was his fianc\u00e9e.And also the duke\u2019s aides who helped me a lot while grunting\u2026Except for Philen, I couldn\u2019t cut off the longing for everyone in the Williot estate at once.Even so, I had no intention of turning back or stopping.Because it was the path I chose.I was going to keep moving forward.*****A murderous intent that he felt the moment he grabbed Leila\u2019s arm.In the past, Philen had faced the same murderous intent.The Emperor\u2019s Shadow, Hiltine.The fact that that guy was attached to Leila meant that the emperor had attached him to protect her.As expected, she had become his mistress.It was a fact he already knew, but it felt quite bad to have it confirmed again.But that was all. As Philen said, he decided not to give Leila another chance anymore.This was the last time he held out his hand from this side, let alone if she clung to his leg, crying out loudly first.If that happened, he would cruelly shake off her hand.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs he recalled that, he somehow felt his heart throbbing.His mood also subsided.All of this was because of Leila.He felt bad because a count\u2019s daughter dared to spit her words and went against his will.Now that he had never seen her again, he would never feel this way again, right?When Philen returned to the mansion, the butler rushed to Philen, almost falling.\u201cDu, Duke!\u201dThe fact that the butler, who regarded face as important, rushed like that meant that a very urgent problem had arisen.Did Leila come back?Or did the emperor do something weird again?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dPhilen got off his horse and asked the butler, a little nervous.The butler, standing in front of Philen, shouted.\u201cI, I just got an urgent message from the estate\u2026!\u201dAh, it\u2019s not about Leila.Philen was finally relieved.\u201cYo, Young Lady Cecily is said to have started to go into labor.\u201dAs soon as he was relieved, the butler brought up surprising news.There\u2019s still time until the due date, but she\u2019s in labor already?The first thing he was worried about was that something wrong happened to the child.Philen frowned and got back on the horse.\u201cI\u2019m going back to the estate right now.\u201d*****As soon as I entered the Imperial Palace, I could feel the eyes of many people.People stopped what they were doing and looked at me. I also saw them whispering openly.I expected them to look at me in a bad way, but it\u2019s worse than I thought.I sighed inside, but pretended to be fine on the outside and entered the archives room.When a position was succeeded or someone received a new title, all records were recorded and kept in the archives.I visited the archives to see if there had been any precedents in the past when women were granted titles.I didn\u2019t remember if that ever happened, but it was just in case.I wish there was. That way, it wouldn\u2019t be strange for me to be granted the baron title.I took a big tour of the archives.As the history of the empire spanned over a thousand years, the amount of recorded data was enormous.The vast amount of data made my mouth wide open just by looking at it.I could look at the records from about 100 years ago, right?At least I knew for sure that there had never been such precedents before that.I took the data from the bookshelf and brought it to a table on one side of the library.Then, sitting on the sofa, I looked at it little by little, going back in time from 100 years ago.However, there\u2019s no record anywhere that a woman was granted a title.In the past, there\u2019s a female doctor who made a big contribution to the war with her outstanding medicine, but she only received a reward and didn\u2019t receive a title.The same was true when there\u2019s no male successor in a family. The title was not passed on to the daughter, but to the man who married the daughter.Just because they\u2019re women.The law didn\u2019t forbid women to have titles, but it was implicitly forbidden.If I was granted the baron title, then I\u2019d be the first to break the custom.The word \u2018first\u2019 felt too heavy.I put the data I was looking at on my lap and sighed deeply.\u201c\u2026is it really okay?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67When I suddenly heard Kalian\u2019s voice from behind, I looked back in surprise.Kalian, who I didn\u2019t know when he came, was standing right behind me.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dI was so surprised that I forgot that I had put the data on my lap and jumped up from my seat.As a result, the data fell and scattered on the floor. Some even went all the way to Kalian\u2019s feet.I tried to pick up the data in a hurry, but Kalian was faster.\u201cYou\u2019re more clumsy than you look.\u201dKalian clicked his tongue, picked up the fallen data, and held it to me.I bowed politely, receiving the data.\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cApologize for what? I was the one who surprised you.\u201dKalian answered indifferently and picked up the data on the table.Those were records of nobles who were granted titles in the past.He chuckled as if he realized at once what I was looking for.\u201cHave you been looking for precedents for women being granted titles?\u201dI didn\u2019t do anything embarrassing, but I was embarrassed for no reason, so I blushed slightly and nodded my head.\u201cYou made a vain effort. Never in the history of the Empire has a woman been granted a title before.\u201dAs expected, is it?It was a fact I already knew, but when it was confirmed, I sighed.\u201cSo you\u2019ll be the first to set a precedent.\u201dThen I looked at him, startled by his next words.Kalian\u2019s eyes bent beautifully.\u201cWhy are you so surprised?\u201dWhy am I surprised? Is he asking that because he really doesn\u2019t know?\u201cIs it surprising that I granted you a title?\u201d\u201c\u2026are you really going to grant me the baron title?\u201d\u201cThen? Does it look like I said something I didn\u2019t mean?\u201dHis eyes were still smiling, but there\u2019s a little dissatisfaction in them.It would be disrespectful for me to doubt his words.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dI answered right away, fearing that Kalian might misunderstand.\u201cI just haven\u2019t signed the document yet.\u201dUpon conferring the title, I had to put my name on the list of noble families and sign the document.The place where the documents were kept was the archives room here.\u201cAnd I think the nobles will be very opposed to it\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy does it matter if the nobles are opposed to it? It\u2019s the emperor\u2019s authority to grant titles.\u201dThat\u2019s true, but I couldn\u2019t answer because there\u2019s a part that bothered me to move on.\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about.\u201dKalian put down the data he was holding and said.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. Because I have plans.\u201dWhat kind of plan?I wanted to ask, but I couldn\u2019t ask anything because I was afraid to hear him saying something that implied I doubted him again.*****\u201cLeila.\u201dKalian talked to Leila about various things, and later told her his purpose for coming to the archives.\u201cI came here to find data on the diplomatic dispute that occurred because of Khan, do you know where it is?\u201d\u201cHere it is.\u201dHe asked just in case, but she brought the data right away.Kalian looked at Leila, slightly surprised.The archives contained more than thousands of data, classified by category.But knowing right away where the data was\u2026\u201cYou\u2019ve already looked it up, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes. I looked it up because I heard there was a conflict with the Natsha Kingdom.\u201dNatsha Kingdom\u2019s affairs aren\u2019t hers, but she looked it up.\u201cDid you organize the data?\u201dHe asked just in case, and Leila nodded.Hoo, she even did that too.There should have been a lot of work to do but Leila even organized the data. He was proud of her, but at the same time, he felt she was silly.Does this woman know the word \u2018laziness\u2019?\u201cCan I see the data?\u201d\u201cThe data is in the office.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go to the office then.\u201dThey moved to the office.Leila handed the data she had organized separately to Kalian.He thought it would be short, but it was thicker than he thought.Why is it so much? Did she not organize it and just copy the contents?Kalian, who was scanning the document, immediately corrected his thoughts.This wasn\u2019t just a copy.Rather, it was easier to identify than the existing data. It was easy to see where and what was going on.I needed the report that Leila organized as it is, but it turned out well.With this, even those who live on the flavor of their own pride wouldn\u2019t be able to say anything.[T/N: living on the flavor of their own pride means that people tend to think they are the best no matter what others think.]\u201cCan I borrow this data?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind, but\u2026 if you are simply looking for data on diplomatic disputes, it would be better to take the existing data.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? This one looks better.\u201dBesides, it could flatten their noses.[T/N:\u00a0 to flatten their noses means to embarrass someone or dampen their spirits.]Thinking of the faces of those people who would be surprised, he already felt good.Kalian tapped Leila on the shoulder and walked past her.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go now, and you get ready to sign.\u201d*****The biggest reason for today\u2019s meeting was the diplomatic meeting with Natsha Kingdom in Hutton about two weeks later.Natsha Kingdom demanded sovereignty over Khan as compensation for pirate damage.Natsha Kingdom insisted that they would manage Khan because the Empire didn\u2019t seem to have the ability to manage Khan.If it was the first time this had happened, he would have ignored it as nonsense, but the problem was that this wasn\u2019t the first time.That\u2019s why the nobles sat around the round table and discussed what to do about this matter.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more convenient to just hand it over? This isn\u2019t the first time Khan has caused problems, and I think it would be better to get rid of those who troubled us.\u201d\u201cYeah, but if you hand over Khan to Natsha Kingdom, the territorial waters will become narrower. In addition, the issue of sovereignty is a sensitive matter, handing it too easily is a little\u2026\u201dThe nobles\u2019 opinions were divided. While arguing that their opinions were correct, Kalian, who sat at the higher seat, listened silently.Then, after dozens of minutes later, various measures and delegations for the diplomatic meeting were decided.\u201cThen let\u2019s do this for the diplomatic mission.\u201dAt the end of the list of the diplomatic mission, Kalian stamped the emperor\u2019s seal and handed it to the official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The meeting was over, but no one stood up.It was the same with Kalian.Kalian crossed his legs and buried himself deep in the backrest.A faint smile was drawn on his lips.\u201cSeeing everyone not standing up, it looks like you have something to say. Is that right?\u201dInstead of answering Kalian, the nobles only looked at each other. Waiting for someone to take the lead.In the end, a young nobleman, who looked brave, took the lead.\u201cYour Majesty, are you really going to grant Lady Leila Thebesa the baron title?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not Lady Thebesa, but Sir Thebesa. Get the title right.\u201dKalian gave a warning.At his point, the young nobleman\u2019s eyebrows twitched for a moment, but he wasn\u2019t wrong, so he changed her title to Sir Thebesa.Only then did Kalian listen to him with satisfaction.\u201cSo, what\u2019s wrong with sealing Sir Thebesa as a baron?\u201d\u201cI apologize, but since the founding of the Empire, there has never been a woman who has been granted a title.\u201d\u201cIs there a law that says it shouldn\u2019t be done because there\u2019s no precedent?\u201dKalian tilted his head and rested his chin on his hand.\u201cOr is there a law that says that women shouldn\u2019t be granted titles?\u201d\u201cIf we think about the custom\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to bring up old customs, you should stop right away. You can\u2019t move forward if you\u2019re tied to the past.\u201dAlthough his answer was expected, the nobleman couldn\u2019t find a proper answer and kept his mouth shut.The nobles glanced at Duke Giltian.They wanted him to come forward.\u201cIf it is not customary, the law of the Empire states that in order to be conferred a title, one must show sufficient ability.\u201dAs if to grant their wishes, Duke Giltian opened his mouth.Kalian looked at Duke Giltian. Gray eyes and blue eyes collided in the air.\u201cI doubt that Sir Thebesa has shown any such ability.\u201d\u201cWhy do you doubt? She passed the official test with outstanding grades and became an aide.\u201d\u201cIf you give a title simply because she did well on the test, you should also give titles to all those who did well on the academy graduation test.\u201dIn a word, it meant that it wasn\u2019t enough.Even though what he said was provoking, he wasn\u2019t wrong.Because there were many nobles who were officials but didn\u2019t have titles.Although it was customary for most of the emperor\u2019s aides to be granted titles, this was also not set by law.\u201cSo, does that mean that the Duke is against Sir Thebesa becoming a baron?\u201d\u201cNot necessarily. As long as Sir Thebesa shows her ability, I am willing to consider it.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dKalian smiled strangely and looked at the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marquis Valdir, right next to Duke Giltian.\u201cMarquis Valdir, what do you think of the data you just saw?\u201d\u201cDo you mean\u2026 this data?\u201dIt was a random question. Marquis Valdir answered honestly while puzzled.\u201cIt was perfect data. I knew Baron Delrond had worked hard on it, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be this much.\u201d\u201cAs expected, this should be done by someone who has been properly trained.\u201d\u201cWhat would happen if it was left to the lady, who didn\u2019t know anything?\u201d\u201cI, too, don\u2019t expect much from her. At least, she has to know how to do this much.\u201dOther nobles agreed with Marquis Valdir, emphasizing that Leila didn\u2019t have the right ability to be an aide.\u201cI\u2019m well aware of your opinions. But there\u2019s one thing you\u2019re mistaken about.\u201d\u201cMistaken?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKalian\u2019s blue eyes glistened coolly, and his lips were raised smoothly.\u201cIt was Sir Thebesa, not Baron Delrond, who made the data.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68***The conference room became quiet as if cold water had been poured.Up until now, everything about Natsha Kingdom was done by Ver and so they thought Ver was the one who made it, but Leila?The nobles, who praised the data until their mouths were dry, shut their mouths like shells.The other nobles gave them stinging glances and silently criticized them.Even Duke Giltian, who was talking gallantly, shut his mouth, and only Kalian who was smiling in this situation.Kalian bit his tongue to hold back the desire to grab his stomach and burst out laughing at any moment.\u201cI think this is enough to show Sir Thebesa\u2019s ability\u2026 what do you think, Marquis Valdir?\u201dAs he pointed it out again, Marquis Valdir\u2019s face turned white.Marquis Valdir glanced at Duke Giltian.His slightly twisted lips showed that he was in a bad mood.It was bad enough for Duke Giltian, who could control his emotions better than anyone else, to reveal it on the outside.Marquis Valdir felt a cold sweat run down his spine.I have to answer well.If I say something weird, I\u2019ll be bitten by two wild beasts.Marquis Valdir clenched his fists and opened his mouth slowly.\u201cN, now that I look at it, I see a lot of loopholes in the data.\u201d\u201cLoopholes?\u201dKalian tilted his head and looked through the data.\u201cMaybe because I\u2019m a fool, I can\u2019t see any loopholes. So, would the Marquis kindly explain it to me?\u201d\u201cTh, that\u2026\u201dMarquis Valdir hurriedly looked through the data but found no significant loopholes.If I force myself to find it, I can find it, but if I get caught in another thing, it\u2019ll be a pain in the ass.Marquis Valdir, who had become a honey-eating mute again, lowered his head deeply.At that moment, Duke Giltian opened his mouth.\u201cIt seems like Your Majesty thinks Sir Thebesa deserves the title.\u201d\u201cOf course. She deserves the title well enough. Haven\u2019t the Duke seen the data?\u201d\u201cThe data is definitely great.\u201dDuke Giltian looked through the data half-heartedly.\u201cBut we cannot evaluate Sir Thebesa\u2019s ability just by looking at this alone. A more objective and accurate evaluation is needed.\u201dIn a word, it was meant to produce visible results.It\u2019s all as expected.They reacted as Kalian had expected without an inch of error.Even Duke Giltian, who was like an old fox, couldn\u2019t stop smiling.Kalian covered his mouth with his hand to hide the laughter that came out.Now all that was left was visible results.This, too, was already in his mind.The child care institution for war orphans.If Leila handled that perfectly, they wouldn\u2019t be able to talk like they do now, saying to show them her right ability.Although it was purely the emperor\u2019s authority to confer titles, it was for Leila that all these cumbersome plans were made.If he ignored the nobles\u2019 opposition and sealed Leila to a baron, she wouldn\u2019t be recognized in the noble society in the future.Was that all? It was clear that Leila would have a lot of trouble working as an aide.Like it or not, she had to keep running into them.This was what Leila was worried about.That\u2019s why Kalian was trying to prevent them from saying anything else later.As he was about to wrap up, Duke Giltian suddenly opened his mouth.\u201cSince Your Majesty appreciates Sir Thebesa\u2019s ability so highly, I want to make a proposal on behalf of the nobles.\u201dI can\u2019t believe Duke Giltian makes a proposal first. It\u2019s unexpected.\u201cWhat\u2019s your proposal?\u201d\u201cAs Your Majesty knows, this diplomatic meeting is a very important meeting that may change the territorial waters. So\u2026\u201dWhen Duke Giltian beckoned, the official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs put the diplomatic delegation\u2019s list in front of him.\u201cI would like to include the competent Sir Thebesa, whom Your Majesty highly regards, in this diplomatic delegation.\u201d*****After leaving the conference room, Kalian went straight to the office to meet Leila, but then he stopped walking.It\u2019s because he felt Hiltine\u2019s presence behind his back.Looking back, Hiltine was there as expected.\u201cWhy are you here? Didn\u2019t I tell you to guard Leila?\u201dHe knew he was still preparing for the wedding even though Leila had declared their breakup.But Philen\u2019s obsession with Leila was gradually crossing the line.Last night, Kalian, who witnessed it with his own eyes at the banquet hall, put Hiltine on Leila.But why is he here?When he looked at him strangely, Hiltine put his hand on his chest and reported politely.\u201cDuke Williot left the capital while Your Majesty was in the meeting.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe he left the capital when he thought he would hold on a little longer.Kalian\u2019s eyebrow went up slightly at the unexpected report.\u201cIs he going back to his estate?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t checked it yet. Shall I find out?\u201dKalian thought for a moment, then shook his head.\u201cNo, no need.\u201dAs long as Philen left the capital, it didn\u2019t matter where he went. His actions didn\u2019t matter.What was important was Leila\u2019s safety.If Philen had left the capital, there\u2019s no need to put Hiltine on Leila any longer.But just in case, should I keep putting him on her today?After all, you never know where a crazy person will go.\u201cGuard her a little more today and if there\u2019s nothing wrong, focus on finding it again.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dHiltine left and Kalian headed to the office where Leila was waiting while seriously thinking about how to bring the story out to Leila.*****\u2018Get ready to sign\u2019 obviously means to sign the document stating that I\u2019m sealed as a baron.I\u2019m really becoming a baron, huh?Just thinking about it makes me nervous and my heart races.Leila, who was waiting for Kalian to return and taking a deep breath to control her trembling stomach, opened her eyes wide when she heard the unexpected news.\u201cDiplomatic delegation?\u201d\u201cYeah. They want you to attend this diplomatic meeting with the Natsha Kingdom.\u201dOh, my God. Diplomatic delegation?Leila looked at Kalian, as surprised as she was when she heard that she was sealed as a baron.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dKalian sighed deeply.\u201cI told you to get ready to sign, but instead of signing the document, I brought a burden.\u201d\u201cN, no. It\u2019s okay.\u201dLeila hurriedly waved her hand.She knew he had done his best to make her a baron without noise.So she didn\u2019t resent or blame Kalian, but she was still bewildered.Diplomatic delegation was made up of competent people as they were representatives of the Empire.Can I join them in such a place?She was worried that she might just humiliate him.Leila wiggled her hands without saying a word.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, you can refuse.\u201dHer eyes that had been looking at her hands went up and met his blue eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to force yourself.\u201d\u201c\u2026what happens if I refuse?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no big problem. It\u2019ll just be a little harder for you to become a baron.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a little, but Kalian hid it on purpose. There\u2019s nothing good about telling the truth.\u201cI was in a hurry too, if I think about it. Originally, I didn\u2019t intend to make you a baron this quickly.\u201dKalian stroked his chin.\u201cI was planning to do it when you made a contribution while working as an aide, but I rushed because the nobles spread a useless rumor.\u201d\u201cRumor\u2026\u201d\u201cThe rumor that you\u2019re my mistress, not an aide.\u201dWhen Leila\u2019s face turned a little white, Kalian frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you didn\u2019t know it yet?\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t know.\u201dOf course, I thought she would know, but it turns out she doesn\u2019t.Surprised, Kalian frowned.\u201cYou\u2019re deafer to rumors than I thought.\u201dLeila placed her hand on her chest and bowed her head modestly.\u201cI apologize.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to blame you.\u201dI just realized that I need to be more careful in the future.\u201cAnyway, once again, you don\u2019t have to accept their proposal. Even if you don\u2019t join the diplomatic delegation, I still can make you a baron.\u201dIt just takes a lot of effort and time to be recognized by the nobles.But Kalian was sure it would never be long.If the child care institution was done properly, they would have no choice but to acknowledge Leila\u2019s ability.However, one thing was that there wouldn\u2019t be much noise if she made a good solution to the diplomatic delegation.That\u2019s why he wanted Leila to accept it as much as possible, but he didn\u2019t intend to force her.Because it was a risky job.If this was done wrong, even if she was given the title, Leila could have the dishonorable label of incompetence for the rest of her life.So, he wanted to give her the opportunity to choose.Leila, who was silent for a moment, asked.\u201cYour Majesty, do you want me to refuse?\u201d\u201cNo, I want you to accept it.\u201dKalian knew Leila might feel burdened with this answer, but he didn\u2019t want to lie, so he answered honestly.\u201cThat way, they won\u2019t be able to say anything else later.\u201d\u201cAnd if I do it wrong, it will backfire.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same for other things. Whatever it is, there are risks.\u201dThat\u2019s it. Then, Leila nodded.\u201cAnd I think you can do it well enough. That\u2019s how much I trust you.\u201dThere\u2019s a firm belief in Kalian\u2019s eyes looking at Leila.His gaze came heavy, and Leila gently pressed her chest with her hand.Even though she didn\u2019t want to betray Kalian\u2019s trust, she wanted to proudly show her ability to the nobles who ignored her.\u2026especially to Philen.She wanted to show him that she could stand alone without him and the Duke of Williot.To do that, she should accept the proposal to join the diplomatic delegation, right?The thought of being part of the diplomatic delegation made her heart race and her breath quicken.\u201cHuu.\u201dWhen Leila let out a deep breath, Kalian, who thought it was a sigh, added.\u201cAgain, I\u2019m not forcing you to do it. Apart from trusting you, there are risks involved, so if you don\u2019t want to do it\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dLeila replied before Kalian could finish his words.Her black eyes firmly looked at Kalian.\u201cI will do my best to repay Your Majesty\u2019s trust.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69***After Leila made her decision, Kalian compiled a new list of the diplomatic delegation and sent it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Of course, Leila\u2019s name was added to the list. But the position written next to Leila\u2019s name wasn\u2019t as the emperor\u2019s aide, but as the emperor\u2019s agent.When a nobleman, who found this strange, asked Kalian why he did it, Kalian answered with a bright smile.\u201cI gave Sir Thebesa a chance to freely show her ability. Only then will she be able to show all of her abilities without restrictions.\u201dJust for that reason, he gave the important position as the emperor\u2019s agent to a person who had just become an aide?All the nobles clicked their tongues, saying that Kalian was out of his mind.Some people even pointed their fingers at him for being blinded by love.Later that day, Duke Giltian, who came to meet Kalian, spoke outright.\u201cI will consider it an exception for once this time.\u201dKalian, who was reading the report brought by Duke Giltian, looked at him.\u201cSo, if you are doing this because you want to keep her by your side, just make her an Empress(concubine).\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re misunderstanding something.\u201dKalian put his interlaced hands on his lap.\u201cI have no intention of making her an Empress(concubine). I just want to have someone competent as my aide.\u201d\u201cIt seems to me that it is not the only reason.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the only reason.\u201dKalian firmly dismissed it.Duke Giltian stared at him intently and then bowed his head.\u201cIf it is Your Majesty\u2019s will, then do as you please. I will get going now.\u201d\u201cAre you going to the detached palace?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dDuke Giltian raised his head again and smiled kindly.\u201cHe is waiting for me, so I have to go.\u201d*****While everyone was busy preparing for the diplomatic delegation to depart two days later, Leila asked for a day off and Kalian gladly approved it.Leila handed Ver all her work for the day before leaving work.There\u2019s also the report on the child care institution.Ver delivered it to Kalian as it was.\u201cDid she finish it already?\u201dHe had been watching her for a month, and he couldn\u2019t believe it was completed so quickly. Amazing.Curious about what she might have written, Kalian put down the document he was looking at and read the report.Some of the contents of the report were familiar to him because they referred to the data he had previously investigated.That fact made him somewhat proud, so Kalian smiled softly.\u201cWhy did Sir Thebesa suddenly apply for a leave?\u201dVer suddenly asked as if he was curious.Kalian answered indifferently while keeping his eyes fixed on the report.\u201cThere must be something she has to do, right? Or maybe she has been working so hard that she wants to take a day off.\u201d\u201cWell, she did work hard.\u201dNot only did she work on the weekend, but she also worked overtime constantly.So, he fully understood the desire to take a day off, but why today?The timing wasn\u2019t only bad, but very bad.\u201cOthers are pointing their fingers at Sir Thebesa, scoffing at her as an irresponsible woman.\u201dShe suddenly joined the diplomatic delegation without any notice, and it wasn\u2019t unreasonable for people to think that way because she took a day off instead of preparing for it.Even Ver was shocked when he heard that Leila applied for a leave.\u201cIs it really okay to send Sir Thebesa to this diplomatic meeting?\u201dVer said with a worried face.\u201cI\u2019d rather go\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already been decided. There\u2019s no turning back.\u201dKalian firmly dismissed it.He didn\u2019t seem to be worried at all about Leila going to the diplomatic meeting.Ver couldn\u2019t understand what on earth Kalian believed in and was so carefree.Although Leila was good at her job, that\u2019s only limited to the work of an aide.It hadn\u2019t been proven if she had excellent diplomatic or communication skills.No. He might have already verified it.With that in mind, Kalian\u2019s confidence was understandable.He was going to ask him about it, but someone came in without knocking.It was Hiltine who opened the door and came in.Hiltine greeted Ver with only a blink, as usual, and then approached the desk where Kalian was sitting.\u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201dThere was neither a subject nor an object, but Kalian stood up as if he understood what he was saying.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cAt the place where it\u2019s always open.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe conversation was simple, but Ver, who noticed that he was about to leave the Imperial Palace, stood in front of him.\u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201dKalian furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you stand in the way of the Emperor. That\u2019s rude.\u201d\u201cYou have to work overtime again today, so I\u2019ll just be rude. I would be more grateful if you could fire me at this point.\u201dKalian smirked.\u201cThen I\u2019m going to be the one who has a hard time, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dHow can you say something like that so proudly?Ver looked at Kalian with a small frown.\u201cIs Your Majesty harassing me for your convenience? Don\u2019t you feel sorry for me?\u201d\u201cYou know that\u2019s how much I treat you.\u201dKalian put his index and thumb together, drawing a circle.Although the basic salary was not small, the bonus from working overtime was also a considerable amount, that\u2019s why Ver couldn\u2019t refute it.\u201cThen, see you later.\u201dWhile Ver was at a loss for words and was hesitating, Kalian passed by him leisurely.\u201cArghh, Your Majesty!\u201dVer, who came to his senses late, hurriedly looked back at Kalian, but Kalian had already disappeared from his sight.He chased him in the direction he disappeared just in case but found none of his gorgeous blue hair.\u201cArghh! You have so many things to do. What will happen if you disappear like this!\u201dVer sat down on the cold marble floor, crying as he pulled his hair out.The attendants, who were passing by silently, went their own way without giving Ver a glance as if it was a familiar scene.*****A few days ago, after a heavy rain, hot days came.To avoid the scorching sun, Leila carried a parasol, and Sarah, who followed her, wore a hood.She wore a hood even when it was this hot.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be okay? We can use the parasol together.\u201dLeila asked Sarah because she was worried.\u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201dSarah replied, smiling vigorously.\u201cThis is nothing compared to the heat I felt at Williot estate.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but it\u2019s still hot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really okay. And since parasols are exclusive to noble ladies, how dare I use it when I\u2019m just a maid?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no law prohibiting maids from using parasols, so what?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but\u2026 Ah! Isn\u2019t that the shop that My Lady was talking about?\u201dSarah, who was looking for something to change the subject, pointed to the building in front of her and shouted.On the high-quality wooden signboard, \u2018Naveya shop\u2019 was written in large letters.Leila smiled and nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Sarah, I\u2019ll be back after doing some business, so please wait for a while while drinking something cool at the cafe, okay?\u201dLeila gave Sarah one gold.Sarah nodded, clutching the gold coin as if it were a treasure.\u201cOkay. I will wait patiently without going anywhere.\u201d\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201dLeila patted Sarah\u2019s head and went into the Naveya shop.It was when Sarah, who was staring at Leila\u2019s back, turned around.\u201cHi.\u201dSomeone blocked Sarah\u2019s path.He was a man with black hair like Leila.At first, she thought he was a robber, but seeing the clothes he was wearing was of high quality, it didn\u2019t seem to be the case.Then, who is he?He looks like a noble\u2026Sarah scanned her eyes on him.As if Sarah was cute, the man smiled so wide that his dimples were in full shape. Then he took out a plaque with a family crest from his chest and showed it to her.\u201cAndante Thebesa, will you know who I am?\u201dA lily, the crest of the Count of Thebesa, was drawn on the plaque.She had never met any other family members other than Countess Thebesa, but she knew their names.Andante was Leila\u2019s second brother.When Sarah realized that the person in front of her was the family of the owner she was serving, she hurriedly bowed her head.\u201cHo, how dare I not recognize the Lord\u2026 Ple, please forgive me!\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s your first time seeing me, so you might not recognize me.\u201dIf it had been another nobleman, she would have been yelled at for not recognizing him, but not Andante.Rather, he smiled sweetly saying it was okay.Leila had a friendly personality, and Andante was like that too. It seemed that Leila\u2019s thoughtful and kind personality was running in the family.Of course, Countess Thebesa seemed to be an exception.\u201cIf you are looking for My Lady, she just entered the Naveya shop.\u201d\u201cI know. But seeing her here at this hour, it looks like she didn\u2019t go to work today, right?\u201d\u201cYes. She said she\u2019s on leave today.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dAndante snorted and tilted his head slightly.\u201cA leave for a diligent kid like Leila? It\u2019s a little surprising.\u201dIt was the same for Sarah, so she replied, agreeing with him.\u201cShe must have something to do.\u201d\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know what she does, do you?\u201dSarah nodded.\u201cThanks.\u201dAndante held out 10 golds with a brief thank you.Oh my gosh. Not 1 gold, but 10 golds?It is several times my monthly salary.Sarah waved her hand in surprise.\u201cI, I can\u2019t accept such a large amount of money.\u201d\u201cJust take it. I\u2019m giving it to you because you take such good care of our Leila.\u201dWhen Leila\u2019s name was mentioned, her heart was shaken not to accept it.Andante smiled brightly and drove a wedge in.\u201cIt\u2019s Leila\u2019s birthday in a month, don\u2019t you want to give her a proper gift?\u201dSarah, who was still worried about what to do on Leila\u2019s birthday, took the money carefully.With this money, she wouldn\u2019t only be able to give a decent gift on her birthday, but she would also be able to get quality meat, cheese, and wine.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBy the way, don\u2019t tell Leila that you met me.\u201d\u201cYes? Why?\u201dLeila would like it if she knew her family was here though.\u201cWell, Leila would hate it if she found out that I gave you money. And I also want to give Leila a surprise birthday gift.\u201dSarah, who fully understood what Andante was saying, nodded.\u201cI understand. I will keep it a secret that I met the Lord today.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cMe too, thank you very much.\u201dThanks to you, I was able to lessen my worries about Leila\u2019s birthday.Sarah expressed her heartfelt thanks and went into the cafe.Andante, who was left alone, stroked his chin and looked at the Naveya shop.\u201cThis is definitely\u2026 the shop that exported goods to Natsha Kingdom.\u201dIt\u2019s not a mere coincidence that Leila, who was leaving for the diplomatic meeting with Natsha Kingdom tomorrow, visited here.\u201cI wish you all the best, Leila.\u201dThat way, something will fall on me too, right?A mean grin appeared on his handsome face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70***I folded the parasol and went inside the Naveya shop.The shop was crowded with people. There were so many people that it was impossible to tell who was the employee and who was the customer.\u201cDon\u2019t touch anything over there!\u201dAh, that person must be the employee.I approached the man who shouted loudly and asked.\u201cI\u2019m looking for a man named Khun.\u201dI deliberately spoke formally to hide that I was a noble. For that reason, I wore the most modest clothes.Thanks to it, the man pointed inward without any doubt.\u201cIf it\u2019s Khun, he\u2019s over there.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI went inside as the man instructed.There\u2019s a man looking at the items in the box.As I approached, the man looked back at me.The man looked at me up and down, straightened his bent back,\u00a0 and bowed his head to greet me.\u201cWhat brings you here, noble lady?\u201d\u201cHow did you know I was a noble?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no commoner who would carry such a luxury parasol.\u201dAh, now that I thought about it, I was holding the parasol.Still, the man outside didn\u2019t notice that I was a noble.Because I was caught that I was a noble, there\u2019s no reason to continue to speak formally.\u201cYou\u2019re sharp.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dTo my praise, Khun slightly bowed his head and asked.\u201cSo, what have you come to see me for?\u201d\u201cBefore that, I want to ask your name.\u201d\u201cMy name is Khun.\u201dI came to the right place.I nodded and glanced at the objects Khun was looking at.Most of the items in the sack were grains such as barley and wheat.\u201cAre these all exported to Natsha Kingdom?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. As the Young Lady may already know, Natsha Kingdom is where our top business mainly deals.\u201dOf course, it was a known fact. That\u2019s why I came here.\u201cIsn\u2019t a lot of grain going out to Natsha Kingdom these days?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even mention it. I was worried because of the bountiful harvest throughout the continent that the grains were overflowing, but thanks to the bulk purchases from Natsha Kingdom, there\u2019s little loss.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dAs expected, is that so?I looked at the barley in the sack and then looked at Khun.\u201cAs I said before, I have a few questions for you.\u201dKhun replied with a slightly nervous expression.\u201cIf I can give you the answer, I will.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not trying to ask you anything weird, so don\u2019t be nervous. Because the questions are easy. You just have to answer what you know.\u201dI smiled as kindly as possible and asked him the questions I had prepared in advance.Climate change in Natsha Kingdom in the last 10 years, Natsha people\u2019s staples, grain exports, etc.Every time I asked a question, Khun\u2019s expression became subtle.He looked confused about why I was asking this.\u201cIf it\u2019s that problem\u2026\u201dStill, he steadily answered all my questions.\u201cThank you for telling me.\u201dAfter paying the price for giving me the information to Khun, I turned around and left.It took more time than I thought. I thought it would take about 30 minutes, but it took over an hour.Sarah is still waiting for me, so I have to go quickly.As I hurriedly left the shop and headed to the cafe, I heard a familiar voice from somewhere.\u201cI\u2019m the emperor? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dThis voice\u2026 His Majesty?It was a voice that could never be mistaken, even if I tried to mistake it.Why is His Majesty\u2019s voice here\u2026I hurriedly looked toward the source of the voice.\u201cI told you I\u2019m just rich, okay?\u201dThen I saw Kalian arguing with big men.I didn\u2019t expect him to really be His Majesty.I looked at Kalian in bewilderment.As if unaware that I was watching, Kalian continued to argue with the big men.\u201cAre you really not?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not. If I were the emperor, I wouldn\u2019t go around alone like this, you know?\u201dKalian was lying without blinking an eye.The big men tilted their heads.\u201cIs he really not?\u201d\u201cBut blue hair is a characteristic of the Imperial family.\u201d\u201cRight. They said that only the Imperial family could have such clear blue hair.\u201d\u201cThe only remaining members of the Imperial family are the Emperor, Duchess Cloud, and an unknown prince.\u201d\u201cSince the prince was said to be a child, the only one left is the emperor\u2026\u201dThe big men looked at Kalian up and down as if they were very suspicious.The onlookers, who had gathered before I knew it, murmured as they looked at Kalian.Kalian, the person involved, didn\u2019t mind, but not me.I was anxious and nervous because I feared that Kalian would be found to be the emperor.Of course, there were escort knights around to protect him, but what if some possible situations would occur? I couldn\u2019t let go of my worries.In addition, I was even more anxious because I couldn\u2019t see anyone who looked like Sir Hiltine or an escort knight.I wanted to help, but if I acted hastily, I would only worsen the situation.But I couldn\u2019t just watch it.What should I do? How\u2026\u201cIf you don\u2019t reveal your identity, I\u2019ll cut you off.\u201dSchwing-One of the men pulled out the bastard sword he was carrying on his back.DA, DANGEROUS!Unable to watch anymore, I hurriedly ran and grabbed Kalian\u2019s arm.Kalian was surprised, turning his face at me.The big men and the crowds were also surprised.There was a moment of silence.Having received everyone\u2019s attention, I swallowed my dry saliva.I came out in a hurry without thinking, what should I do now?Cold sweat flowed down my back.Not knowing what to do, I looked through my surroundings and a couple came into my view.Looking at the couple, an idea came to my mind as to how to get out of this situation.I would never do it any other time, but now, I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201cHo, honey!\u201dI closed my eyes tightly and shouted. It was because I couldn\u2019t look directly at Kalian\u2019s face.Even if I closed my eyes, I could still see Kalian\u2019s bewildered face clearly.I became nervous in a different way than before.My mouth was dry and my head was spinning. I wanted to run away right now.But it would look even weirder, so I tried hard to squeeze my voice out.\u201cWhat are you doing here?! Why did you dye your hair blue again?\u201d\u201cHuh? Ahh.\u201dOnly then, as if he noticed what I was trying to do, Kalian smiled a little and held my waist.\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like it?\u201dAnd he acted, playing along.If he played along, I should have felt more comfortable, but I became more uncomfortable. My mouth was dry in tension.I answered, clenching my hands full of cold sweat.\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s because hair dye is expensive\u2026\u201d\u201cBut Honey likes this color.\u201dHoney.The word that made me embarrassed when I said it with my own mouth was even more embarrassing when I heard it through someone else\u2019s mouth.In addition, I felt that way more because that person was the emperor and my supervisor, Kalian.I still couldn\u2019t meet Kalian\u2019s eyes directly, so I put my gaze on the edge of his chin.\u201cRight?\u201dI didn\u2019t really like it\u2026However, if I answered no, it would be strange, so I nodded for now.\u201cI\u2026 like it.\u201dKalian smiled brightly and lightly kissed my forehead.In an instant, my hand that was holding his clothes tightened.The place where his lips touched was as hot as fire.I, I don\u2019t think he needs to kiss\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s why I did it.\u201dWhile I was in a daze, Kalian\u2019s acting continued.\u201cIt\u2019s expensive, but I don\u2019t want to be jealous of the emperor.\u201dMy heart was pounding at his sweet tone and actions.\u201cI also want to show you that I love you more.\u201dHe\u2019s good\u2026 at acting.Even though I knew he was acting, his acting skill was so good that I was fooled for a moment.\u201cHer husband is so sweet! I wish I could be his wife!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s making all men disgraced!\u201dI heard shouts of envy and boos from those around me, perhaps other people besides me had been fooled.\u201cAs expected, he isn\u2019t?\u201d\u201cWell. There\u2019s no way an emperor would go around without an escort knight.\u201dEven the big men who were suspicious of Kalian seemed to be completely convinced that I and Kalian were a couple.This much would\u2019ve been enough, right?I looked away and tried to get out of the position.\u201cAck!\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t do that because Kalian pulled my waist tight.Was that all? Because of that, our bodies were completely attached to each other that a single sheet of paper couldn\u2019t fit through.And close enough to even hear his breathing.Being held in his arms all of a sudden, my body stiffened in great bewilderment.\u201cLeila.\u201dKalian spoke so quietly in my ear that only I could hear him.\u201cNow that it\u2019s already like this, can you help me until the end?\u201dWhat does he want me to do? Are there any problems he hasn\u2019t resolved yet?I wondered, but I nodded for now.\u201cGood.\u201dKalian smiled again and gently swept my cheek.This is acting. We\u2019re just acting like a married couple.Even if I tried to control my mind, his acting was so realistic that it wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do.My heart kept pounding without him realizing it.Instead of opening my mouth, I barely raised the corners of my lips, fearing that Kalian would hear my heart beating.I\u2019ll try not to be as awkward as possible.\u201cI had a hard time getting an invitation to buy your gift, but they don\u2019t let me in because they think I\u2019m suspicious.\u201dInstead of answering, I glanced at the big men.I didn\u2019t give them a resentful look, but the big men, who were pricked, coughed.\u201cEhem hum, as you know, this is a place where you have to be careful\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s been confirmed that you\u2019re not the emperor, so follow me! But, you have to bring your wife with you!\u201dHuh? I have to go too?At the unexpected words, I looked at Kalian in bewilderment.As if he didn\u2019t feel my gaze, Kalian nodded willingly.\u201cOkay.\u201dNo. Sarah is waiting for me\u2026But since I told Kalian that I would help him until the end, I couldn\u2019t say no now.Still, I have to go and explain the situation to Sarah at least.Otherwise, Sarah will wait for me endlessly without knowing the reason.\u201cUmm-.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dAs if he knew what I was worried about, Kalian spoke in a low voice into my ear.At the hot breath that afflicted my ear, my shoulders hunched involuntarily.\u201cIf it\u2019s your maid, Hiltine will take her home safely.\u201dAs expected, there\u2019s an escort knight with him.But, how did he know I brought Sarah?I wanted to ask, but there\u2019s no time for that.\u201cShall we go, honey?\u201dKalian led me in the guise of a sweet husband again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He nodded as if telling me to do what he said.I handed the parasol to the big man.Knock, knock.When the big man knocked, the small side door opened and a skinny hand popped out. It was so skinny that I could see the bones.I was startled and clung to Kalian.Then Kalian comforted my arm as if telling me not to worry about anything.He pulled out a black invitation card from his inner chest pocket and handed it to the skinny hand.The skinny hand grabbed the invitation and disappeared inside.Shortly after, the side door closed and the big door opened.\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dI wanted to ask where we were going, but I couldn\u2019t ask because the big man was staring hard at me, so I went inside without asking.The inside of the building was dark and narrow. Candles were hanging on the wall.Kalian put the hood he wore on my head.\u201cNo matter what, don\u2019t take it off.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dI carefully grabbed his hood over my head.Perhaps because he\u2019s wearing it all the time, the hood smelled like him.Strangely, his smell calmed my mind.\u201cThis way.\u201dIn front of us, there\u2019s a narrow corridor that only one person could pass through.After walking there for a while, Kalian and I went down the stairs.At the end of the stairs, there\u2019s a wooden door that looked rather old.Kalian knocked on the wooden door with a certain rule.Then there\u2019s a sound of a lock being opened from the inside, and the door opened with a squeaking and loud noise.Behind the wooden door was a completely different world.\u201cTake a look at it at once!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll never see something like this again!\u201dWith the merchants selling all kinds of rare items on the stalls.\u201cHow much is this?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too expensive. Please give me a discount.\u201dThe underground square was crowded with people who came to buy things or onlookers.It looked like a market on the surface, but it didn\u2019t seem to be an ordinary market.If it\u2019s an ordinary market, it wouldn\u2019t have been held in the underground square, and there would be no need for an invitation.And also, the big men wouldn\u2019t have to be wary of Kalian by raising such blades like that.\u201cWhere are we?\u201dWhen I asked a question out of curiosity, Kalian answered while looking through the underground square.\u201cBlack market.\u201d\u201cYes? Black market?\u201dOh, my God. A black market?When I was surprised by the unexpected answer, Kalian turned to me.\u201cWhy are you so surprised? Is it your first time coming to a black market\u2026 Ah, it\u2019s your first time going to one.\u201dKalian nodded as if he had realized it too late.\u201cBecause a good person like you will never come to a black market.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean Your Majesty is not a good person?\u201dI was just asking jokingly.\u201cOf course.\u201dAnd hearing him say yes made me a little perplexed.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You came all the way here because of me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI was a little surprised by the word black market, but that\u2019s all.It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t like coming here or had the thought of coming here.I was rather curious. Because it\u2019s my first time coming to a black market in my life.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m relieved.\u201dKalian looked around again and grabbed my hand as if he had found what he was looking for.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIt was not the first time I held hands with him, but strangely, I was excited.Is it because I heard the word \u2018honey\u2019 from him?It seemed that the aftermath of the acting earlier was still there.I followed him, staring at the hand he held.Like a black market, they sold many rare items that couldn\u2019t be found in general stores, such as fairy wings and mermaid scales.But Kalian continued to go inside without giving a single glance to those things.Following him, I saw a group of young children who didn\u2019t fit in with the black market.Why are the children here?Curious, I continued to look at the children, then stopped when I saw their hands and feet were handcuffed.Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 those children are slaves?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Leila?\u201dKalian, who stopped with me, looked at me.I just looked at the children without answering.Kalian soon saw the children and nodded as if he understood my reaction.\u201cI guess those kids are bothering you.\u201d\u201cAre you okay with that, Mr. Carl?\u201dI remembered he asked me to call him Carl in the past, so I called him that.Kalian replied, \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dYou\u2019re not sure even after seeing that?In a different way, I looked back at him, bewildered.\u201cThey are all children. Children, who are not even 10 years old, are going through such a thing\u2026\u201d\u201cSlavery is legal in the Empire.\u201dI was speechless at the somewhat cold words that came back.I knew that too. As he said, slavery was legal in the Empire.Even if someone frowned seeing that, what they did was not illegal.I knew that, but still\u2026\u201cI want to help them.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201dKalian asked indifferently.I couldn\u2019t find a proper answer again this time, so I kept my mouth shut.The joyous feeling I felt from seeing the strange and interesting items subsided in an instant and I became depressed.Kalian sighed deeply and added.\u201cI know you feel pity for those kids, but there\u2019s nothing you can do. It\u2019ll be good for you not to care.\u201dEvery single word he said was right.My head understood what he was saying, but not my heart.\u201cLet\u2019s go now.\u201dMy heart didn\u2019t understand Kalian, who turned around coldly even after seeing the poor children.Now that I thought about it, he was the ruthless, merciless emperor, who cut even a crying child with a single stroke.He had been so good to me that I forgot about it for a while.I glanced at Kalian\u2019s back as he strode forward while holding my hand.Until just now, I was excited to hold hands with him, but now\u2026 it was somehow uncomfortable.*****After passing through several stalls, he stopped at the one in the far corner.A glass bottle containing someone\u2019s eyeballs. Lizard skin. Unidentified powder and vials.There were only bizarre items on the stall.The seller also had a bizarre atmosphere.I glanced at the old woman sitting in front of the stall.Wrinkled face and skinny body. Unfocused eyes.Her left eye\u2026 artificial?The old woman wore a black hood. She looked scary like the witch in a fairy tale that often eats children.It wasn\u2019t right to judge people based on their appearance, but I was still a little scared, so I turned my head.The old woman smiled strangely when she saw Kalian.\u201cOh, my. A precious person is here.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyebrow rose slightly at the old woman\u2019s meaningful words.\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\u201cWell. If I know, I know, if I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\u201dThe old woman smirked darkly as she recounted riddles.\u201cOkay. What do you need with this poor old woman?\u201d\u201cThey said if I came here, I might be able to find the poison I want.\u201dPoison\u2026Come to think of it, he said there\u2019s a plant he really wanted to find.Was that plant a plant that was used as an ingredient for poison?Since we came to the black market, I thought the item Kalian was looking for would be unusual, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be poison.Although I had said that I believed he wouldn\u2019t do anything bad, seeing him actually looking for a poison made me anxious.Who\u2026 he\u2019s not trying to really kill someone, right?\u201cIf it\u2019s poison, it\u2019s my specialty.\u201dThe old woman pointed to the unidentified powder with her skinny hand.\u201cThat pure white powder is a powder made from a flower called Baektae. It has no effect on ordinary people, but if someone with diabetes eats it, it can kill them at once.\u201dAt the terrifying word of kill, I held the hood I was wearing tightly. Meanwhile, the old woman\u2019s explanation of poison continued.\u201cAnd this is\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is a colorless, odorless poison.\u201dKalian said, cutting the old woman\u2019s words.\u201cTsk tsk. This old woman is still talking,\u00a0 but you cut her off. Kids these days don\u2019t know how to respect the elderly. Don\u2019t glare at me fiercely like that.\u201dThe old woman clicked her tongue and stroked her chin.\u201cColorless, odorless poison. There are more than a hundred that come to mind right now. I need more detailed information to know what you want.\u201dKalian immediately added more explanation.\u201cAfter eating it, your mouth will smell sweet and your fingertips will turn black. And the poison doesn\u2019t react to silver.\u201d\u201cHmm, the poison that will smell sweet and turn your fingertips black.\u201dThe old woman thought for a moment, then took out two vials from her bottari.[T/N: Bottari is a traditional wrapping cloth of Korea.]\u201cOf what comes to mind, these are the poison I have right now.\u201d\u201cWhat about the other poisons? I want to know the names.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you if you give me money.\u201d\u201cHow much? I\u2019ll buy these poisons too.\u201dAfter getting the information and poison he wanted, Kalian put the poison in his inner pocket.\u201cCome back next time.\u201dThe old woman said as she put the money she had received from Kalian in her bottari.\u201cI\u2019ll bring the poisons that I couldn\u2019t bring today. If there\u2019s anything that comes to mind, I\u2019ll bring them too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be grateful if you do that.\u201dWhen Kalian, who finished talking to the old woman, turned around.\u201cThe emperor\u2019s spy is here?\u201d\u201cNo way. This is a black market with strict security\u2026\u201dThe people began to buzz.Kalian clicked his tongue as if annoyed.\u201cI think I\u2019ve been caught.\u201d\u201cYes? Th, then what should we do?\u201d\u201cWhat should we do? Of course, we have to run away.\u201dRun away?How do we run away through this many people?Not to mention, all over the place, I saw the big men with swords that I saw on the street earlier.They were looking around fiercely.As Kalian said, if he had been caught, they\u2019d probably be looking for us.I grabbed Kalian\u2019s arm and whispered softly.\u201cI think it\u2019s impossible to run away from those people.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201dPossible? How?\u201cThis way.\u201dKalian took my hand and went further inside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There\u2019s no lock, so it\u2019s easy to open.\u201cThe current is rough.\u201dKalian said after checking inside the iron cage fence.Just by listening to the sound of the water, I could guess that the current was rough.But more than that, what were we doing here?We shouldn\u2019t be doing this, we should find a way to escape quickly.\u201cMr. Carl, the mercenaries will arrive soon.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dKalian looked back at me with a smile.\u201cThen, shall we go now?\u201dGo now?To where?Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u00a0 over there?\u201cA, are we running away through the waterway?\u201dKalian looked back at me, wondering what the problem was, and answered.\u201cYeah?\u201dAt that moment, I felt dizzy.I thought he knew a secret passage to the outside, but it\u2019s a waterway, not that.It was truly unexpected. I had been out of common senses for some time now.\u201cAre you not going?\u201dAt Kalian\u2019s urging, I answered, turning pale in surprise.\u201cI, I can\u2019t swim.\u201d\u201cI know how.\u201d\u201cBu, but going to the waterway is dangerous\u2026\u201d\u201cLeila.\u201dKalian smiled gorgeously and held out his hand to me.\u201cAre you perhaps don\u2019t trust me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI trusted him, but this was different.But, since I was his aide, I couldn\u2019t bear to say anything disrespectful.But I was scared to jump into the waterway, so I couldn\u2019t take his hand.\u201cThey ran that way!\u201d\u201cHurry up!\u201dPeople\u2019s voices were heard through the passageway. The voices weren\u2019t too far away. It looked like they were nearby.\u201cLeila, come on.\u201dKalian shook his hand and urged me.Blue Dragon.Please have pity on Your people.I took Kalian\u2019s outstretched hand, desperately seeking the Blue Dragon, the guardian deity of the Empire.Kalian grabbed my hand and hugged me by my waist.And then.Splash!He jumped into the water while holding me.The water that touched my skin was very cold.I covered my mouth and nose with both hands and leaned against Kalian\u2019s wide chest.Kalian was still holding me tight.No matter how good he was at swimming, it had to be difficult while holding a person in his arms.I was afraid that I might die like this.When I was getting out of breath and my body was screaming to breathe.\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201dKalian\u2019s friendly voice was heard.He seemed to not talk in the water, that meant\u2026I opened my eyes wide.Then I saw a wall made of pure white marble.It was a familiar wall.Here can\u2019t be\u2026\u201cI, Imperial Palace?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dImpossible. We arrived at the Imperial Palace from there? Just for tens of seconds holding breath?I just stood there and blinked my eyes at something impossible for common sense to do.Kalian let go of me and took a few steps back.I turned to look at him involuntarily, and only then did I notice that Kalian\u2019s clothes were not wet at all.Was it just clothes? His hair and skin were also dry.It\u2019s quite different from me, who was like a drowning mouse.We fell into the water together, so how could he still dry?Staring at his face in wonder, Kalian smiled mischievously and touched his face.\u201cAm I that handsome?\u201dWhat do you mean handsome?Well, of course, he wasn\u2019t wrong, but it felt weird to hear him saying it with his own mouth.It\u2019s a good thing to know yourself well, but\u2026 isn\u2019t it embarrassing to say things like that with your own mouth?As I stared, Kalian coughed lightly.\u201cMore than that, you\u2019re very wet.\u201dHe raised his index finger at me.Then my dress and my hair dried dry without any wetness.Oh, my God. What is this?Startled, I touched my dry cheeks and the hem of my dress.\u201cDid you know how to do magic?\u201d\u201cOnly magic involves water.\u201dKalian answered while lying down with his arms as a pillow.\u201cYou probably know this since you\u2019re also the Empire\u2019s people. The fact that the Imperial family inherited the blood of the Blue Dragon.\u201dOf course, I knew that, but\u2026\u201cI thought it was just a legend.\u201d\u201cLegend? There\u2019s evidence though.\u201dKalian smiled and pointed to his blue hair.That\u2019s right. I acknowledged what he said. It\u2019s an unusual hair color, but as I saw it often, I guessed I got used to it.\u201cThen, is it Your Majesty\u2019s ability to go to the Imperial Palace through the waterway?\u201d\u201cYeah. I can go anywhere connected to the water.\u201dAh, so that\u2019s why he said he\u2019s going to use the waterway to escape.\u201cAmazing!\u201dIt was sincere, not empty words. Because it\u2019s something that normal people could never do.When I said that, Kalian looked at me with a slightly dazed face.Why is he looking at me like that? Am I being too honest?\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dWhen I called him out in wonder, Kalian briefly exclaimed and raised his upper body.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. More than that, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a long time since you asked for a leave, but I disturbed it.\u201d\u201cNo. Thanks to you, I saw a lot of interesting things.\u201dI also saw some heartbreaking scenes, but I didn\u2019t mention them.Because I thought it would be good for him and also for me.I didn\u2019t even ask about him buying poison.It wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t curious. I didn\u2019t ask because it seemed presumptuous to just ask that.And even if I asked, he looked like he wouldn\u2019t answer it.\u201cThen, can I leave now?\u201dKalian thought for a moment before answering.\u201cStay a little longer.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t what the person, who just said sorry for disturbing a leave, would say.So I looked at him with a little perplexity, and for some reason, Kalian looked more perplexed.Kalian touched his forehead and rubbed his face.Finally, he sighed deeply and stood up.His face looked very worried.Well, there were a lot of things to be concerned about, so of course, he was worried\u2026Ah, was it because of the proposal I submitted through Baron Delrond?It\u2019s likely to be the case. Since I was on leave, he couldn\u2019t ask me, so it seemed like he had a hard time by himself, groaning inside.Then, as it was my duty, I should take initiative first.\u201cYes, I will.\u201dKalian\u2019s expression brightened in an instant at my answer.\u201cIf there are any shortcomings in the proposal I gave you through Baron Delrond, please tell me.\u201dFor a moment, at the added words, Kalian frowned again and looked away.Is it\u2026 not?\u201cNever mind. You\u2019re on leave, so why are you saying that? Just go home now.\u201dThen, as I was wondering what it was, I suddenly thought that maybe I had made him into a bad boss.Of course, he caught it first.But I had no intention of doing that.But it could seem that way in other people\u2019s eyes.Then it would be better to just go back.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll get going now.\u201dI bowed to him and left.*****After Leila left, Kalian, who was left alone, rubbed his face and sighed heavily.The reason he held onto Leila for a moment was because it felt like a pity to let her go like that.So he grabbed her without realizing it and stopped in surprise.He felt good when she answered \u2018I will\u2019, which made him smile.\u2026but then he felt bad again when he found out that it was because of the document.Why did I feel bad?I have no reason to feel bad.Rather, shouldn\u2019t I be happy that she works hard?He was confused by the incomprehensible emotion.Kalian, who was thinking for a long time while staring at the ground with his head down, raised his head when he felt someone\u2019s presence.Then, he saw Leila coming back for some reason.Leila\u2019s hair swayed slightly as she ran.The dazzling summer sunlight shone brilliantly between them.Kalian looked at Leila, half-stiffened.\u201cUmm, Your Majesty.\u201dThe cool breeze blew past the dry grass leaves.\u201cCome to think of it, I left my parasol to the mercenary who was guarding the black market.\u201dA small dimple was seen next to her awkwardly raised lips.\u2026her dimple is pretty.The thought of wanting to touch it and the thought that he shouldn\u2019t do that crossed.But what won in the end was the thought of wanting to touch it.\u201cYour Majesty?\u201dKalian, who belatedly realized that he had touched her cheek, was very surprised on the inside, but on the outside, he took his hand off casually.\u201cThere\u2019s something on it\u201d\u201cAh, thank you.\u201dLeila, who had no idea what Kalian was thinking, smiled innocently and thanked him.Kalian, pricked by his conscience for no reason, turned his head and said.\u201cIf it\u2019s the parasol, I\u2019ll buy you a new one.\u201dLeila shook her hand in panic.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m just worried that it might become a problem later\u2026\u201d\u201cThey can\u2019t figure out who we are by a parasol only.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dOnly then did Leila wipe her chest as if she were relieved.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll really get going now.\u201dLeila bowed politely again and left.Kalian barely stopped himself from trying to call her involuntarily.His gaze was still fixed on Leila.Her hair, which swayed every time she walked, seemed as soft as silk.\u2026it\u2019s actually soft though.Kalian looked down at his hand, groping for the touch.Then, Leila calling him honey lingered in his ears like an auditory hallucination.And Leila\u2019s expression at that time floated in his mind.Her black eyes looked at him that said she didn\u2019t know what to do, and her cheeks turned pale pink when he called her honey.Even the cute small lips that shyly said she liked it.He felt strange. It felt like he had stepped into a forbidden land that he should never enter.His heart stung as if the poison he had kept in his chest pocket had broken and penetrated into his skin.\u201cAre those poison really the problem?\u201dKalian checked the vials he had in his pocket.Fortunately, the vials were safe.Then, what on earth is this? This feeling.The wrinkles on Kalian\u2019s forehead deepened.He continued to ponder, but in the end, he returned to the palace with no answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did something happen?!\u201dAs soon as I got home, Sarah grabbed me and asked.\u201cI just\u2026 met someone I knew for a while.\u201dI said roughly because I couldn\u2019t tell her that I met His Majesty and went to the black market with him.The quick-witted Sarah noticed that I didn\u2019t want to talk about it and didn\u2019t ask anymore.\u201cI\u2019m glad you came back safely.\u201dSarah was truly relieved and wiped her chest.\u201cI was very worried if something might have happened to you, My Lady.\u201dI hurriedly changed the subject before Sarah asked about what had happened.\u201cHow did you get home? Did Sir Hiltine take you home?\u201dKalian said Sir Hiltine would take her home, but I asked just in case.\u201cI guess the name of the man with silver hair is Hiltine.\u201dSarah\u2019s cheeks turned slightly red.I held back the laughter that was about to burst and poked Sarah\u2019s arm.\u201cYou\u2019re in love with him, huh?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in love with him?!\u201dSarah shook her hand.\u201cHo, how dare a maid like me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201c\u2026no. Let\u2019s go in.\u201dI really wanted to tell her what I thought, but I couldn\u2019t.I was afraid that Sarah would needlessly mind it.I was afraid that she would have vain dreams like my mother.\u2026and I was afraid she\u2019d die miserably.I consciously raised the corners of my mouth and patted Sarah\u2019s head.*****About 5 days from the capital to Hutton.And it took at least a week to negotiate with Natsha Kingdom and settle incidental matters there.In other words, once I left the capital, I couldn\u2019t return for almost a month.\u201cSo it\u2019s okay for you to go back to your hometown for a while.\u201dLeaving Sarah alone at home for a month bothered me, so when I said that, Sarah\u2019s face brightened.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah. Go and buy some delicious food for your siblings and your mother.\u201dI gave her 10 gold generously.It was quite a lot of money in my current circumstances, but for Sarah, who gave up her stable job because of me and left her hometown and family, I could bear this much.It was also payday soon.Come to think of it, my payday was after I left for Hutton. I wondered if I could come back on my next payday.And I didn\u2019t think I would get my paycheck at the Imperial Palace, but still, I was curious about how the paycheck would be paid.I\u2019ll have to ask Baron Delrond later.With that in mind, I packed my things.Sarah helped me while packing her luggage as well.I usually wore a neat and practical dress, but as it was a schedule on behalf of His Majesty, I dressed neatly in uniform. And my long hair was also neatly tied high by Sarah.\u201cAre you not wearing any accessories?\u201d\u201cWell, I think it would be neat not to wear anything in a uniform.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but it\u2019s too neat. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to wear at least one?\u201dSarah rummaged through the jewelry box and took out the spirit necklace that Kalian gave me before.\u201cI think this would be fine.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dI also thought it wasn\u2019t too bad, so I obediently put on the necklace.I even wore my coat and looked in the mirror to see if there was anything strange, but Sarah\u2019s eyes twinkled.\u201cMy Lady, dressing like this makes you look like a cool knight.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes! If My Lady was a man, I would have fallen for you.\u201dI smiled at the nice compliment. Then I picked up my luggage and left the house.Sarah followed after me.We stood at the gate and waited for the carriage to the Imperial Palace and the carriage to Williot territory.The first to arrive was the carriage to the Imperial Palace.Sarah looked at me with a face that seemed to burst into tears at any moment.\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, My Lady.\u201dI opened my arms to hug her. And Sarah hugged me right away.\u201cIn the meantime, take care of yourself, okay?\u201dI gently patted Sarah on the back.Sarah muttered, putting her face on my shoulder.\u201cMy Lady too.\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\u201cMy Lady too.\u201d\u201cWhy did you suddenly become a parrot?\u201d\u201cBecause My Lady says everything I want to say.\u201dIs that so?I laughed quietly.I wanted to talk to Sarah a little more, but I couldn\u2019t make the carriage wait any longer.\u201cThen, see you later, Sarah.\u201dI said goodbye to Sarah and got into the carriage.*****The outer palace was busy preparing to set up the delegation.I passed by them and entered the relatively quiet office of the inner palace.Looking at his desk, it seemed that Baron Delrond had already come for work. But the person was nowhere to be seen.He must have gone to the outer palace to prepare for the diplomatic mission, right? But when did he come to work?I was pretty early, too, but it was amazing that he came first.I took a document out of my bag while glancing at Baron Delrond\u2019s desk, which was piled up with documents.The document was a combination of the information Khun gave me yesterday and the information I had gathered so far.I left the original one on my desk and took only the copy.I had to give this to Marquis Valdir, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.If my prediction was correct, it would definitely be helpful during the diplomatic mission.I took the copy and headed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the outer palace.It\u2019s been almost a month since I started working as an aide, but it was my first time coming to the outer palace.I only saw it as I passed by.The outer palace was very busy with preparations for the diplomatic mission.Regardless of the department, everyone was busy running around.Even in this situation, when I passed by, everyone stopped what they were doing and looked at me. Their gazes were stinging more than before.\u201cLook over there. She came in her uniform.\u201d\u201cI think she\u2019s really planning to go to the diplomatic meeting.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know if she\u2019s fearless or has good nerves. But if it were me, I would have given up.\u201dThey talked openly as if wanting me to hear them, but I entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs without giving them a single glance.\u201cHey, bring that here!\u201d\u201cHey, you have to take this over there\u2026\u201dThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs also seemed very busy. I didn\u2019t want to disturb them as much as possible, but I had to inform his aide first to see Marquis Valdir.Marquis Valdir\u2019s chief aide\u2026 Ah, there he is.I approached the man who was looking at the documents on the innermost side.This man was Dillon Valdir, Marquis Valdir\u2019s chief aide and his second son.\u201cNice to meet you, Sir Dillon Valdir.\u201dToday was the first time I saw him, but I could immediately recognize him thanks to his wine-colored hair, the characteristic of the Marquis of Valdir.Wine-colored hair was not as common as Kalian\u2019s blue hair.\u201cWho are\u2026\u201dDillon Valdir\u2019s face, which he raised with a smile, hardened in an instant.The people, who had just been busy walking around until now, stood there like broken toys and looked at me.There\u2019s an awkward silence in the office. It was so quiet that I could hear people breathing.I didn\u2019t like the way they looked at me and the atmosphere, but I didn\u2019t care and introduced myself.\u201cMy name is Leila Thebesa. I work as an aide to His Majesty.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know.\u201dDillon sighed and stood up.Whether he had no intention of hiding it, his expression was full of irritation.\u201cWhat do you need? As you can see, I\u2019m busy, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you could tell me quickly.\u201dIt meant to just say what my business was and disappeared quickly.I didn\u2019t expect him to welcome me, but I didn\u2019t feel very good when he actually treated me coldly before my eyes.Still, I answered with a smile without showing any displeasure.\u201cI have come to see Marquis Valdir, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\u201d\u201cFor what purpose do you want to see the Marquis?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s about the diplomatic meeting with the Natsha Kingdom.\u201dDillon asked again with a slightly nervous look.\u201cDid His Majesty send you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dDillon said as if he was dumbfounded.\u201cHis Majesty didn\u2019t send you, but you want to see the Marquis? Do you think it makes sense?\u201d\u201cUnless His Majesty sent me, I couldn\u2019t see the Marquis? I didn\u2019t know there\u2019s such a law.\u201dWhen I calmly responded, Dillon closed his mouth in dissatisfaction, then opened it again.\u201cThe Marquis is away right now. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but you can come back again next time.\u201dAh, I couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019s away right now.It was a pity, but I had nothing to say. Because it was my fault for suddenly coming without an appointment.\u201cThen, can you give this to the Marquis?\u201dI put the data I had brought on Dillon\u2019s desk.I wanted to give this to him directly if possible, but I didn\u2019t have time for that. I also had some work to do before I left.And I have something to ask Baron Delrond.Dillon glanced sideways at the document I had put and nodded.\u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cThank you. Then, I\u2019ll get going now.\u201dI left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with those who were still looking at me.\u201cSir Thebesa?\u201dThen, on my way back to the inner palace, I met Baron Delrond.\u201cGood morning, Baron.\u201d\u201cYes. Good morning. By the way, did you just go to the outer palace?\u201d\u201cYes. I have some business to do with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a moment.\u201dBaron Delrond looked surprised at my answer.Why is he like that?When I looked at him in wonder, Baron Delrond asked anxiously.\u201cNothing happened, right?\u201d\u201cYes? What do you mean by that?\u201dAs I asked back at the situation I couldn\u2019t understand, the baron shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re going back to the office, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s go together.\u201dI walked side by side with Baron Delrond, heading to the office.\u201cBy the way, why did you go to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the diplomatic meeting. I have found some information, and I came to tell him in case it might be of any help.\u201dBaron Delrond smiled happily.\u201cYou\u2019re working hard, huh?\u201d\u201cOf course, I have to work hard.\u201dThat way, I can be recognized by other people.\u2026especially to Philen.\u201cYour expression suddenly got bad.\u201dIs that so? Well, it\u2019s only natural because I thought of Philen.\u201cDid I perhaps say something wrong\u2026\u201d\u201cNo way.\u201dI said, shaking my hands as Baron Delrond might be misunderstood.\u201cIt was just because something bad happened to cross my mind. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s definitely not because of the Baron.\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s a relief.\u201dThe Baron, who was smiling with his eyes folded like a crescent moon, suddenly hardened and pulled my arm.\u201cAh!\u201dThe moment I said \u2018ah!\u2019, the distance between him and me sharply narrowed.I bumped my head against his chest and looked up at him with my eyes wide open.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I swallowed my saliva unconsciously.I stayed still, holding my breath because I could die if I was stung by the wasp.It was the same with Baron Delrond.There\u2019s a suffocating tension.I waited for the Baron to send me a signal because I couldn\u2019t see the wasp in my position.How long do we have to stay like this?\u201cYou two, what are you doing?\u201dSomeone\u2019s voice suddenly appeared. It was Kalian.\u201cOh, my.\u201dKalian raised his mouth obliquely, looking at me and Baron Delrond.\u201cSince when did you two have such a relationship?\u201dSuch a relationship?\u201cI have no intention of meddling whether the two of you are dating or not, but please refrain from having a date in a public place.\u201dA, a date?!My mouth was wide open at the absurd misunderstanding.Baron Delrond also looked at Kalian as if it was absurd.\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201dKalian snorted.\u201cNo? When you\u2019re so close to each other like that?\u201dAh, he\u2019s misunderstood because of this.I was going to say that it was a misunderstanding, but Baron Delrond spoke before I could.\u201cIt was because of the wasp.\u201dOnly then did Kalian frown perhaps because he saw the wasp.\u201cWhy is there a wasp in the Imperial Palace?\u201d\u201cYou should ask the gardener, not me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dKalian wagged his finger. Then I heard something fall.\u201cThank you.\u201dShortly thereafter, Baron Delrond gave him a brief thank you and let me go.It seemed that Kalian used some special method with the wasp.\u201cVer, you go to the gardener and tell him to deal with the wasps, and Leila, I have something to say to you, so follow me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI had something to ask Baron Delrond, but it seemed like I\u2019d have to ask him that next time.I parted ways with Baron Delrond and followed Kalian.Kalian didn\u2019t say anything all the way to the office.\u201cYou really are not in a relationship, are you?\u201dThen, as soon as we entered the office, he suddenly asked that.I understood what he was saying a little late and shook my head in surprise.\u201cYes? Absolutely not.\u201dKalian looked at me with suspicious eyes.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. What happened that time was just because of the wasp.\u201d\u201cYeah, wasp. There\u2019s a wasp.\u201dKalian mumbled to himself and held out a small piece of paper on the desk to me.\u201cIt\u2019s your paycheck statement. It\u2019s written until next month, so you can take it to the cashier at any time and they will pay you.\u201dI was wondering how the paycheck would be paid, so this is how it works, huh?\u201cThank you.\u201dI politely received the statement.I\u2019ll trade it later.It\u2019s a big deal if I trade it in advance and lose it.\u201cAnd this proposal.\u201dWhat Kalian picked up was the proposal about the child care institution.\u201cI reviewed it yesterday and I have a few questions. Is it okay if I take some of your time?\u201dOf course, it\u2019s okay. That\u2019s why I came early.\u201cIf you have questions, please ask me.\u201dI forgot all that had happened earlier and had a heated conversation with Kalian about the report.*****Even after Leila left, people continued to talk about Leila.In particular, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where she visited, was the noisiest.\u201cThat Lady, what on earth is she thinking?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Do you think she\u2019s really the emperor\u2019s aide?\u201dTheir mouths moved constantly, gossipping about Leila.\u201cBut it\u2019s about the diplomatic meeting. What was she trying to report to the Marquis?\u201dAt the sudden words of an official, everyone\u2019s eyes turned to the document Leila left behind.Dillon was already reading the document. He looked like he wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201cChief aide. What is written on the document?\u201d\u201cUseless things.\u201dDillon didn\u2019t even read the entire document and threw it at the official.\u201cThrow it away.\u201d\u201cYes? But the Lady asked you to give it to the Marquis\u2026\u201d\u201cI just told you. Useless things. If I give this to the Marquis, he will only be angry.\u201dWell. The official agreed with Dillon and put the document in a box where waste papers were collected.*****Still talking with Kalian about the proposal, it\u2019s already time to leave.Kalian clicked his tongue as he checked the time.\u201cI\u2019ve been holding on to you too long.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cYou have to go to the cashier, so I\u2019ll stop here.\u201dI was thinking of going to the cashier when I came back later, but I said yes because I still had to stop by the office to pack my things.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving the capital soon. How do you feel?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still\u2026 bewildered.\u201dI even brought my luggage, but I still didn\u2019t believe that I joined the diplomatic mission.\u201cThat\u2019s an honest answer.\u201dKalian smiled and stood up from his seat.\u201cEven if you forget everything else, you only need to keep one thing in mind.\u201dOne thing to keep in mind?\u201cThe fact that you joined the diplomatic mission as the emperor\u2019s agent.\u201dAh, right. I was the Emperor\u2019s agent.It wasn\u2019t the time to be bewildered and lost. Suddenly, I felt a heavy weight on my shoulders.I nodded, clearing my mind.\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s no need to be so nervous.\u201dKalian smiled and tapped my shoulder.\u201cBecause I believe you\u2019ll do well.\u201dHe must have been trying to relieve my tension, but unfortunately, I was more nervous.If I showed him that, I was sure Kalian would tell me not to feel pressured again, so I tried to smile and nodded.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen, go.\u201d\u201cBefore that, I want to ask you one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWill this work even without me?\u201dKalian looked at me puzzledly at my words.\u201cDo you want this child care institution project to proceed while you\u2019re away? Then, it might not be recognized as your work.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dUsually, when a project started, the first person in charge took the credit for it.So, if the project went out while I\u2019m away, there\u2019s a high possibility that my contribution wouldn\u2019t be recognized no matter how hard I prepared it.It would be a lie if I said I wasn\u2019t sad at all, but I didn\u2019t mean to be greedy.Because I didn\u2019t want the children to suffer more because of my greed.I just wanted this child care institution project to be completed as soon as possible so that the poor children could be saved as soon as possible.\u201cSo, I would appreciate it if you could proceed.\u201d*****The large-scale diplomatic mission led by Leila left the Imperial Palace.Kalian, who returned to the inner palace after seeing them off personally, suddenly stopped.\u201cHiltine.\u201dAt his call, Hiltine quietly appeared from the darkness.\u201cFollow Leila.\u201dKalian ordered with his back to him.\u201cDon\u2019t reveal yourself. Just protect her quietly.\u201dVer, who came to see Kalian, waited for a while as Kalian and Hiltine were talking.\u201cIn this mission, she is me. So, whoever tries to harm her, whether they are a noble or a royal family, dispose of them on the spot.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAfter Hiltine said that, he disappeared into the darkness again.Immediately after that, Ver approached Kalian from behind and said.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re sending Sir Hiltine. You must be very worried about Sir Thebesa.\u201dOnly then did Kalian notice Ver was there. He glanced sideways at him and started walking again.Ver followed after him and said.\u201cIf you\u2019re that worried, there would have been a way to not send her.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her decision.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty must have encouraged her to go.\u201dIf only Kalian had told her not to go.No, she wouldn\u2019t have joined the diplomatic mission if he had rejected Duke Giltian\u2019s proposal at the meeting.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t, because you want Sir Thebesa to become a baron as soon as possible, right?\u201d\u201cWhy do you ask when you already know it?\u201dKalian responded bluntly and entered the office.Ver, who had followed him, put the documents he was holding on the desk.\u201cThis is the end of today\u2019s report. If you don\u2019t have anything else to ask me to do, I\u2019ll get going.\u201dThe work on the war heroes was finished, and the diplomatic delegation also left.Although the issue of the bereaved family was still there, it had been transferred to the relevant department and there\u2019s nothing he could do right now.So, I\u2019m going to go home and sleep well today. I\u2019ll also take a bath in hot water.\u201cVer. Proceed this right now.\u201dHowever, Ver\u2019s simple dream was shattered when Kalian handed out a document.Ver protested while staring at Kalian with a face with dark circles down to his chin.\u201cYour Majesty, I haven\u2019t gone home and have worked all night for these two days.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t do it?\u201dI thought he\u2019d give me a little bit of mercy if I said this. There\u2019s no change in him.Even the devil would be nicer than this man.Ver sighed deeply inside and scanned the document.It was a proposal about the child care institution.\u201cHuh? I know this is a project that Sir Thebesa decided to carry out.\u201d\u201cStarting today, you carry it out.\u201dVer made a weird face at the unexpected words.\u201cThen, Sir Thebesa\u2019s efforts may not be recognized.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cAnd you still want me to carry it out?\u201d\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what Leila wanted.\u201dVer was surprised by Kalian\u2019s answer and checked the report. He could tell from the first page how hard Leila had worked.Is it okay if I carry it out?\u201cDid Sir Thebesa really want it? Why?\u201dVer couldn\u2019t believe him, so he asked again.\u201cShe said she didn\u2019t want the children to suffer because of the work being delayed because of her.\u201dKalian told him exactly what he heard from Leila.\u201cThat\u2019s why push ahead with it right away.\u201dTo be honest, after checking the document, he was thinking of going to be a little stubborn asking whether it could be done next time, but after hearing that, he couldn\u2019t.Ah, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll sleep a lot after I die anyway.Ver sighed inwardly and replied.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cYou can leave now.\u201dVer, who was about to leave directly after getting kicked out, suddenly remembered something and looked back at Kalian.\u201cCome to think of it, Your Majesty, it\u2019s been a long time since you have been to the detached palace, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKalian\u2019s hand, which had just picked up a document, stopped.\u201cThey said he\u2019s been depressed because it\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s seen you, Your Majesty.\u201dKalian replied with a short sigh.\u201c\u2026as far as I know, Duke Giltian goes there often.\u201d\u201cDuke Giltian is a Duke and Your Majesty is Your Majesty.\u201dHe\u2019s right.Kalian nodded.\u201cThanks for letting me know. I\u2019ll visit him soon.\u201d\u201cAnd he\u2019s also curious about Sir Thebesa.\u201dKalian replied while picking up the document.\u201cIt\u2019s not the time yet. After a little more time, I\u2019ll introduce her to him.\u201d\u201cAfter Sir Thebesa becomes a baron?\u201dKalian didn\u2019t answer, but it was no less than an affirmation.Well, that\u2019s indeed the perfect time.If it\u2019s too fast, it\u2019d be suspicious in other people\u2019s eyes.If it\u2019s too late, it\u2019d get another kind of suspicion.Ver agreed with Kalian\u2019s decision and took his leave.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going now.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dKalian gave the document he was looking at to Ver.\u201cLook into this, too.\u201d\u2026even the devil would be nicer than this man.Ver cursed Kalian inwardly and took the document he gave.As he checked the document, Ver\u2019s eyes widened.At the top of the document, the words [Abolition of Slavery] were written in large letters.*****After hearing the news of her labor, Philen drove to the mansion without a break.It was because he wanted to see his baby as soon as possible.\u201cWhat about the baby?\u201dAfter arriving at the estate in two days, Philen looked for his baby as soon as he entered the mansion.The butler\u2019s face darkened. It was the same with the other servants.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dAn ominous feeling hit his spine.Philen grabbed the butler\u2019s shoulders roughly and shouted.\u201cAnswer me right now. Where\u2019s the baby?!\u201d\u201c\u2026the undertaker is here to prepare for the funeral.\u201dThe fact that the undertaker came\u2026\u201cIs the baby\u2026 dead?\u201dThe butler couldn\u2019t speak, so he nodded.\u201cHah.\u201dPhilen stepped back.His golden eyes trembled.\u201cThe baby, my baby is dead\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dWhen Philen\u2019s body staggered in great shock, the butler and the servants hurried to support him.\u201cAre you okay, Master?\u201d\u201c\u2026do you think I\u2019ll be okay?\u201dSuddenly, his hardened eyes gleamed with murderous intent.Philen grabbed the butler\u2019s collar and shouted.\u201cHow on earth did the baby die? What did the doctor do?!\u201d\u201cMa, Master, your hand\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll hear it directly from the doctor. Bring Cecily\u2019s doctor here!\u201dPhilen met Cecily\u2019s doctor in the drawing-room.Cecily\u2019s doctor, Mavel, was a doctor hired by Cecily, not the mansion\u2019s doctor.Of course, before entering the mansion, his identity had been verified thoroughly.Mavel liked to gamble, so he owed some debt, but other than that, there\u2019s nothing wrong. He was definitely a talented doctor.Mavel, who faced Philen, bowed down with a tense look on his face.\u201cI, I see the Duke, the sword of the Empire\u2026\u201d\u201cTell me the situation.\u201dPhilen cut Mavel\u2019s words and asked him as if pressing him.Mavel didn\u2019t dare to look directly at Philen and told him in a quivering voice.From when Cecily\u2019s labor started earlier than scheduled, to the baby\u2019s stillbirth after a long period of labor, all of it.\u201cStillbirth?\u201dDoesn\u2019t that mean he\u2019s already dead when he\u2019s still in the womb?I thought it went wrong after he was born, but stillbirth?\u201cWhen I left the mansion, didn\u2019t you\u00a0 say that the baby was healthy?\u201d\u201cYe, yes.\u201d\u201cThen why did the baby die? What happened to Cecily?!\u201dMavel replied with trembling lips at his murderous intent that pierced his skin.\u201cIt, it looks like I need to check the details a bit more, but the situation is caused by\u2026 poison.\u201d\u201cPoison?\u201dPhilen\u2019s face turned awfully.\u201cWho poisoned her?\u201d\u201cI, I don\u2019t know that far, but it is certain that Young Lady Cecily took a deadly poison and it had an adverse effect on the baby.\u201dAs soon as Mavel finished speaking, Philen jumped up from his seat and called the butler.\u201cHarchen!\u201dHe called him by his name instead of \u2018Butler\u2019 as usual.It was proof that he was very angry.The butler, who had expected this ending from the moment Philen said he wanted to meet Mavel, rushed into the drawing-room.\u201cDid you call me?\u201d\u201cBring the chef and maids who were in charge of Cecily\u2019s meals and snacks to the hall right now!\u201dSince Cecily couldn\u2019t have poisoned herself to harm the baby, someone must have poisoned her.To harm her or the baby.In this case, it was most likely that her food was poisoned, so Philen summoned all the servants who were in charge of Cecily\u2019s food.\u201cEveryone had gathered in the hall.\u201dHearing Harchen\u2019s report, Philen nodded.\u201cAlright. Mavel, follow me.\u201dPhilen headed with Mavel and Harchen.The servants, who were suddenly summoned while working, showed signs of tension on their faces.It was because they could guess what Philen called them for.\u201cHe does think we did anything to make his baby stillbirth, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cI think so. Other than that, there\u2019s no reason to call us like this.\u201dThe people, who were buzzing, shut their mouths in an instant. It was because Philen appeared in front of the railing of the long hallway connected to the central staircase.He was quite far away, so it was hard for them to see what kind of expression he was making, but they could clearly tell that he was furious.Of course, he was. Because it was the baby he had been waiting for.The servants who knew that fact better than anyone else put their necks in like a turtle and read Philen\u2019s mood.\u201cIf you turned yourself in, I wouldn\u2019t have done this. So, I\u2019ll ask another question.\u201dPhilen came down the stairs, unbuttoning his shirt that was tightening his neck.\u201cHave you ever seen any of these people do anything suspicious?\u201dAnd then, he said while looking at the servants, who looked at each other.\u201cAnything is fine. I\u2019ll reward those who give me information.\u201dDespite Philen\u2019s words, the servants remained silent and looked into each other\u2019s eyes.Their behaviors made Philen feel even more irritated.BANG-!Philen hit the railing hard. As a result, the wound on his right hand ripped open and the bandage was dyed bright red.Mavel looked at Philen\u2019s hand in bewilderment.\u201cDuke, your hand\u2026\u201d\u201cThe important thing wasn\u2019t my hand right now! But my stillbirth baby!\u201dRed veins were clearly visible in Philen\u2019s eyes.\u201cMy first child was a stillbirth. And he was poisoned by someone!\u201dPoison?All the servants were surprised and took deep breaths.They knew that something went wrong with Cecily\u2019s child, but they didn\u2019t know that she had been poisoned.Before Philen spoke, the only people who knew about it were her doctor, Mavel; the butler, Harchen; and her exclusive maid, Ellie.\u201cCo, come to think of it\u2026\u201dAt the sound of someone muttering quietly, all the eyes of the servants turned to her.Philen also looked at the person who said that.Common brown hair with freckles.It was Ellie, Cecily\u2019s exclusive maid.Ellie, who received everyone\u2019s attention at once, was bewildered and covered her mouth with her hands.\u201cI, I apologize. I said something weird\u2026 \u201d\u201cI guess you have seen something?\u201dPhilen, who had completely come down the stairs, approached Ellie and asked.Ellie couldn\u2019t look directly at Philen, so she hurriedly bowed her head.Her face turned white like a blank sheet of paper.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I could say I saw it, or not\u2026\u201d\u201cAnything doesn\u2019t matter. Tell me everything you know.\u201dAs Philen urged her, Ellie hesitated before opening her mouth.\u201cThat day, I saw the chief maid sneaking into the kitchen with a strange vial.\u201d\u201cMisa?\u201dWhen an unexpected person was mentioned, Philen frowned.Ellie shook her hands and hurriedly added.\u201cO, of course, I didn\u2019t mean that the vial was a poison. I just saw her carrying it in, and I had no idea what was inside.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, wasn\u2019t the chief maid the one who brought Young Lady Cecily\u2019s snack that day?The words that the servant suddenly spat out began to stir up the other servants.Of course, no one said that Misa would be the culprit.Everyone said there must be some misunderstanding, and that Misa couldn\u2019t be the one who did that.\u201cThe chief maid, there\u2019s no way that Misa did that.\u201dIt was the same with Harchen.He spoke to Philen seriously.\u201cDoesn\u2019t Master also know that Misa is not someone who would do that?\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s not something I can guarantee.\u201dAfter thinking about it for a moment, he said something that didn\u2019t make sense and looked back at the maids.\u201cWhere\u2019s Misa now?\u201dAt Philen\u2019s question, the maids looked at each other.\u201cCome to think of it, the chief maid, I haven\u2019t seen her since yesterday.\u201d\u201cI thought she was out of town.\u201d\u201cHarchen, where\u2019s Misa?\u201dIf Misa had gone out of town, Harchen, the butler, would have known.So he asked him, but Harchen didn\u2019t know either.She went into the kitchen with a suspicious vial.And that day, even though she was not in charge, she brought Cecily\u2019s snack.And after the incident broke out, she didn\u2019t show up.Many things were suspicious.Misa was the maid who had been managing the mansion even before Philen was born.For Philen, she was like family.So, if possible, he didn\u2019t want to doubt her, but under the circumstances, he couldn\u2019t help but doubt her.\u201cFind Misa immediately.\u201dPhilen ordered the servants. The servants moved busily, looking for Misa.\u201cHarchen, lead me to Misa\u2019s room. I\u2019ll search her room myself.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dHarchen led Philen to Misa\u2019s room with a solemn look.It was right under the room Leila used to use.Her room was firmly locked.\u201cOpen it.\u201dHarchen opened the door with the master key he had.As soon as he opened the door, the smell of fishy blood hit them.\u201c\u2026!\u201dMisa was lying on the floor with a knife stuck in her heart.****Please support to save ROS. Your help is desperately needed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Misa died?Harchen was shocked.Philen was also shocked and in a daze. When he came to his senses, he ordered Rohen to be called in to investigate her death.He also asked him to investigate the possibility that Misa had harmed Cecily\u2019s baby.A few hours later.Rohen concluded that Misa had committed suicide and presented a suspicious empty vial as evidence.Philen handed the vial to Mavel and asked him to investigate what drug was in it.About an hour later, Mavel said that the drug in the vial was a very strong abortion drug.An empty vial of abortion drug and Misa\u2019s suicide.There\u2019s only one conclusion that could be inferred here.The culprit who poisoned Cecily was Misa.\u201cThe chief maid could never have done such a thing!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! There must be some misunderstanding!\u201dThe servants, who believed and followed Misa, didn\u2019t want to believe that Misa was the culprit, but all the circumstances were saying that Misa was the culprit.They tried not to believe it, but they couldn\u2019t.With the mansion engulfed in shock and chaos, Cecily, who had lost consciousness due to the shock of giving birth prematurely to her stillbirth child, woke up.\u201cHmm.\u201dAs her eyelids were pushed up, her blue eyes that were out of focus were revealed.Cecily asked, blinking slowly as if trying to focus.\u201cThe baby\u2026 where is him?\u201dNo one could answer that.Even Philen, who ran immediately after hearing Cecily had woken up, was silent.\u201cThe baby, my baby\u2026\u201dWhen everyone was still silent, Cecily got up anxiously.\u201cUgh!\u201dCecily grabbed her stomach and groaned, then Philen hurried to support her.\u201cYou\u2019re not feeling well yet. Don\u2019t overdo yourself, just lie down.\u201dCecily grabbed Philen\u2019s arm tightly and looked up at him.\u201cPhil, our baby\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dPhilen said with a miserable face.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t protect you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 what do you mean?\u201dCecily\u2019s eyes began to tremble wildly.\u201cCouldn\u2019t protect me\u2026 That can\u2019t be\u2026 The, the baby\u2026?\u201dPhilen affirmed in silence.\u201cNo\u2026\u201dCecily muttered with half the light out on her face.\u201cNo, NO! There\u2019s no way something went wrong with my baby! NO WAY!\u201dSoon after, Cecily cried endlessly in tears.She was so pitiful that the servants who didn\u2019t like her looked sorry at her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dPhilen also felt sorry and hugged Cecily tightly.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cecily.\u201d*****When Cecily\u2019s condition stabilized a little, Philen asked what happened.\u201cWas it before dinner\u2026 The chief maid brought me a bowl of red drug, calling it a supplement.\u201dCecily said with a tear-soaked face.\u201cAfter I drank it, I felt a little stomachache, and afterward I felt an indescribable pain.\u00a0 And, and\u2026 ughhh.\u201dCecily couldn\u2019t forget everything. She covered her face with both hands and burst into tears.Philen sighed deeply and comforted Cecily again.Even though he thought it was foolish for Cecily to drink the drug without checking what drug Misa gave her, he still couldn\u2019t stand Misa, who deceived such an innocent girl, and felt disgusted.How dare she run away to death after doing this.\u201cButler.\u201dPhilen laid Cecily, who was asleep tired of crying, on the bed, and ordered Harchen.\u201cThrow the chief maid\u2019s body into the field to be eaten by wild dogs.\u201d[T/C: Noo! That\u2019s too cruel TT. Misa TT]\u201cYes?\u201dTo be eaten by wild dogs?It was a cruel order, but if Misa was really the culprit who killed Philen\u2019s child, it was the punishment she deserved.\u201c\u2026yes, Master.\u201dThus, Harchen swallowed his tears and replied that he would.After Harchen left, Philen looked at Mavel and Ellie.\u201cTake good care of her. If something like this happens again, your neck will not be safe then.\u201dEllie lay her face down facing the floor, and Mavel bowed.\u201cI will keep that in mind.\u201dPhilen looked at them with suspicious eyes and then left the room.Only then did Ellie lift her head and wipe off the cold sweat on her forehead.\u201cOh my, the master must be furious.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not surprising though.\u201dMavel also wiped his cold sweat with his handkerchief.\u201cBecause his long-awaited child was a stillbirth.\u201dMavel put his handkerchief in his pocket and walked over to Cecily\u2019s bed.Cecily was lying still and sleeping like a doll. Her face was white and wet with tears, and she looked very miserable.\u2026if it was real.\u201cYou can wake up now, Young Lady. The Duke has left.\u201dCecily\u2019s eyes widened at Mavel\u2019s words.\u201cAre you sure he already left?\u201dEllie looked outside and nodded.Only then did Cecily remove the blanket and get up.\u201cOh my, I thought I was going to die from lying in bed.\u201dCecily grabbed her stiff shoulders and warmed up lightly.She didn\u2019t look like she was in any pain.\u201cI didn\u2019t eat because I pretended to be sick, so I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cHere is bread and soup.\u201dEllie quickly brought Cecily the food she had prepared in advance.What\u2019s gotten into this stupid tactless child?Cecily took a sip of the soup Ellie brought.The soup was all cold, but it was quite tasty, perhaps because she was hungry.Cecily ate all the bread and then gave a jewel to Ellie and Mavel.\u201cEveryone did well.\u201d\u201cThank you, Young Lady.\u201dThe two, who accepted the expensive jewel, smiled broadly.\u201cIf you do the rest of the work as well as you do now, I\u2019ll give you more jewels than you do now.\u201d\u201cMo, more jewels than this?\u201dThe jewel she was holding now was so expensive that even a single maid wouldn\u2019t dare to dream of it.But she\u2019ll give me more jewels than this?When Ellie asked in surprise, Cecily answered with a smile.\u201cOf course. When I become the Duchess of Williot, you\u2019ll become the Duchess\u2019s maid and doctor. So, shouldn\u2019t you be rewarded better than that?\u201d\u201cYoung Lady\u2026\u201dEllie was moved to tears, but Mavel had a strange expression on his face.It looked like there\u2019s something that bothered him.\u201cWhy do you look like that, Mavel?\u201d\u201c\u2026Young Lady. The road to becoming a Duchess is never easy.\u201dCecily\u2019s face distorted at Mavel\u2019s words.\u201cAre you now thinking that I can\u2019t be one?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that, but there\u2019s just something that bothers me\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s because of my origin, don\u2019t worry. Because Philen is so into me that he doesn\u2019t even care about that.\u201dCecily folded her arms and raised her chin proudly.\u201cAnd even though my kingdom was destroyed, I\u2019m still a princess. And my origin was much better than that woman.\u2019\u201cOf course. That\u2019s obvious!\u201dEllie quickly responded to Cecily\u2019s words.Feeling better, Cecily gave Ellie a few more gold coins.Mavel, who saw it, immediately changed his words.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have doubted you. Of course, you have to be the Duchess of Williot.\u201dThat\u2019s what he said, but his doubt didn\u2019t go away.That\u2019s because, after returning to the mansion, Philen never looked for Cecily until he heard that she had woken up.Not even once.*****I had never seen the sea in person in my life. It was only through books and pictures.So, just the fact that I could see the sea in person made my heart pound.I looked out the window, which was constantly changing, then looked inside the empty carriage.The others rode with two or three people together, but I was the only one who rode alone.It was because I was the only woman on this diplomatic mission. All were men.Unless it was a couple, family, or a very special case, it was implicitly forbidden for men and women to ride in the same carriage, so they couldn\u2019t ride together.Even if it weren\u2019t for that, no noble would want to ride with me.As the day grew darker, the diligently running carriage stopped.I arrived at the inn after a day.\u201cWelcome.\u201dThe innkeeper and staff came out the door to welcome us.Watching it through the window, I got off the carriage when the coachman opened the door.The innkeeper, who was talking to a nobleman, was surprised to see me.Then he said something to the nobleman with a serious face.The nobleman glanced at me while listening to the innkeeper. He looked like he was very annoyed.What is it? Is there any problem?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dWhen I asked out of curiosity, the nobleman sighed and answered.\u201cHe didn\u2019t know that the Lady would come, so he prepared only rooms for two people.\u201dNot Sir Thebesa, but Lady?I felt a little bitter, but I didn\u2019t show it.I didn\u2019t want to run into such a trivial problem.\u201cDoes that mean I have to share the room with a man?\u201d\u201cIf it was set as I was told, you\u2019re right.\u201dI wanted to follow what was set as much as possible, but I was reluctant to go with it.There\u2019s no way I wanted to share a room with a man who was neither my lover nor my family.\u201cIs there no room left?\u201d\u201cAll double rooms are full. There is one single room, but it is very small and shabby.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll use it.\u201dThe innkeeper was bewildered by my answer and explained.\u201cIt\u2019s a really shabby room, My Lady. There is only one bed of furniture, so it would be very inconvenient for a noble lady to use.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dIt\u2019s only one night.And it was better than sharing a room with a man.\u201cI\u2019ll go with that room, so please prepare it.\u201d\u201cOf course, that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201dLooking back at the sudden interruption, I saw Marquis Valdir, who had a slightly displeased look on his face.\u201cLetting the Lady use a shabby room? As a gentleman, that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201dJust listening to it, it seemed like he was thinking of me, but he\u2019s not.Because it was an act of treating me as a noble lady, not as a member of the delegation.Knowing this, I couldn\u2019t accept the Marquis\u2019s goodwill as it was.\u201cI don\u2019t really care about it, Marquis.\u201d\u201cI care. Or would you like to use my room?\u201dWhat did he say?I replied, bewildered.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u201cThen, do what I tell you to do.\u201dMarquis Valdir glanced at the people and said to the youngest-looking man.\u201cZeffel, I\u2019ll let you use the room.\u201dAt the Marquis\u2019s words, Zeffel glanced at me.It was the eyes that asked \u2018why I had to go to such a length for you\u2019.Other people also looked at me with unkind eyes.I also didn\u2019t want someone to be kicked out of their room because of me.I\u2019d rather if I was the one who went out.\u201cI\u2019m really fine. I\u2019ll go with that single room.\u201dDespite my earnest request, Marquis Valdir neatly ignored me and entered the inn.The dissatisfied, stinging gazes of others fell on my back.I didn\u2019t expect this journey to be smooth, but I couldn\u2019t believe a problem had already risen.A sigh came out automatically. I was seriously worried about the remaining journey ahead.****Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Because she\u2019s a lady.These were the words I heard the most from people while going from the capital to Hutton.It felt like I had heard it more than I had in my entire life without adding a single lie.When I ate or rested.Even when I was sleeping, the words \u2018because she\u2019s a woman\u2019 followed.\u201cPlease don\u2019t treat me like a woman.\u201dWhen I said that because I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, they responded with bizarre expressions.\u201cThe Lady is not a man, right?\u201dI was taken aback, but there\u2019s nothing I could say because it was true.Still, they grumbled when I couldn\u2019t erase the dissatisfied expression on my face.\u201cWe\u2019re so considerate of you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re dissatisfied with.\u201d\u201cThe Lady is so fussy.\u201dDid the meaning of considerate change without my knowledge?The behavior they showed me was outright contempt and they treated me like an outcast, not considerate.Should I say this was what you call bullying?They seemed to want me to get hurt, but unfortunately, I was fine.Because I was used to this kind of situation.When I was at the Count of Thebesa, I was treated even more than this.So, I was fine.\u2026am I really okay?\u201cHuu.\u201dAt the sudden question, I sighed deeply and closed the book I was reading.It\u2019s a book I had always liked, but I couldn\u2019t concentrate on it because of the situation.And I also felt like I was getting a little motion sickness.I looked out the window to change my mood.\u201cWow.\u201dThe blue drawing paper could be seen over the thick forest. It was the sea I had only heard of.The sea I saw for the first time in my life was very beautiful.As I looked at the vast open sea, my deep sorrow seemed to disappear.It looked so pretty from a distance. How much prettier would it be from up close?I was really looking forward to it. I couldn\u2019t wait to get closer and see it.Falling in love with the charm of the sea, I stared at the sea endlessly.About 4 hours later.We finally arrived at our destination, Hutton.As a port city, Hutton\u2019s symbol was the anchor.The carriage continued to run diligently until it reached the mansion in the north of Hutton.This was where Armand Hutton, Lord of Hutton, lived.The Marquis of Hutton was a family that produced outstanding naval officers from generation to generation.Even Armand Hutton, the current Lord of the Marquis of Hutton, was the number one person in the Empire who had no one to follow in terms of chart navigation skill.As a result, no one could say anything about a marquis ruling over such a large city, over a duke.The reason Hutton had grown this much was also because of the efforts of Marquis Hutton.\u201cWelcome, everyone. Welcome to the Marquis of Hutton.\u201dIt was a young man, not Marquis Hutton, who came to greet us.It was my first time seeing him, but Marquis Valdir smiled brightly and called out the man\u2019s name as if he knew him.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Aldor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you too, Marquis.\u201dAldor Hutton. Armand Hutton\u2019s second son.Aldor Hutton, who had greeted Marquis Valdir, looked at me and exclaimed briefly.\u201cOh, who is this beautiful lady?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a face that didn\u2019t know me.He must have already received the list of diplomatic mission, so he couldn\u2019t possibly not know.\u201cMy name is Leila Thebesa.\u201dEven so, I reached out my hand to shake his hand because it was essential to introduce myself at the first meeting.\u201cI\u2019m Aldor Hutton. It is an honor to meet a beautiful lady.\u201dBut instead of shaking my hand, he held the back of my hand and kissed it.His behavior was disciplined and polite like a gentleman, but not in the way he looked at me.Eyes that gleamed darkly looked like they would eat me up at any moment.\u201cYou have fine skin.\u201d\u2026it was the same eyes as when Andante looked at me in the past.I was startled and bit my tongue.\u201cYou are truly a beautiful lady.\u201dHis words and gaze made me feel like I was standing on a single feather. I got goosebumps all over my body.\u201cIf I had known such a beautiful lady would come, I would have paid more attention.\u201dI smiled, trying to straighten my distorted face. Fortunately, I was used to forcing myself to smile.\u201cIt\u2019s still great.\u201dI said something I didn\u2019t mean and naturally pulled out my hand.Aldor looked at his hand that had held me as if it was a pity, then raised the corner of his mouth, smiling.\u201cI\u2019ve heard so many rumors that I\u2019ve always wondered what kind of person you are, that\u2019s why I\u2019m delighted to meet you like this.\u201dI bet he was of the same class as Andante.Now his target was\u2026 me?It was terrifying just thinking about it. Cold sweat flowed down my spine.I wanted to run away right away, but I couldn\u2019t.On the surface, Aldor Hutton was perfectly normal.If I did that, I would be the only one who became a fool.\u201cAldor.\u201dI was thinking about what to do, but unexpectedly, Marquis Valdir saved me.\u201cWhere is Marquis Hutton?\u201dOf course, it wasn\u2019t to save me, but it\u2019s purely had something to do with Aldor.\u201cFather went out to the port for a while. He wanted to greet you personally, but an important trading ship came in today. I ask for your understanding.\u201dStill, thanks to this, I was able to escape Aldor\u2019s spiderweb-like gaze.I slipped back in fear of being caught by Aldor again.Aldor, who had been talking to Marquis Valdir for a long time, looked around the people as if he had suddenly remembered.His gaze finally reached me.I blatantly avoided his gaze.Aldor then smiled and looked back at Marquis Valdir.\u201cEveryone must be tired from the long journey, but I\u2019ve made you all wait too long. The servants will guide you to your room. And I\u2019ll guide you personally, Marquis.\u201dMarquis Valdir smiled happily.\u201cOh my. I\u2019m grateful, but I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been bothering you for nothing.\u201d\u201cNo. Of course, it\u2019s something I should do. Come this way.\u201dMarquis Valdir entered the mansion with Aldor.Immediately after that, a maid approached me and politely greeted me.The maid, full of freckles on her face, appeared to be like Sarah\u2019s age.\u201cMy name is Eria. I will be serving you from today. It is a great honor to serve you, My Lady.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThen, I\u2019ll guide you to your room.\u201dAs I was about to follow Eria, a nobleman approached me.I looked back after giving Eria a blink, asking her to wait for a moment.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cI would like to inform you about the upcoming schedule.\u201dI already knew the schedule, but there might be some changes, so I listened to the nobleman.\u201cYou are free to do whatever you want until this evening, but please join us for dinner.\u201dThey always outcasted me, telling me to eat alone. What\u2019s wrong with them?\u201cDo we have any special plans for the evening?\u201d\u201cWe have an appointment for dinner with Marquis Armand Hutton.\u201dAh, that\u2019s why you want me to join you, huh?Because it\u2019ll be difficult for them to turn away from me in that kind of position.\u201cI understand. Is there any other schedule that changes other than that?\u201dThe nobleman was silent for a moment before answering.\u201cThere isn\u2019t.\u201dThe silence bothered me, but I didn\u2019t ask what it was.If I asked him, I was sure he wouldn\u2019t tell me.I also didn\u2019t want to argue for no reason.\u201cThen, I\u2019ll see you at dinner, My Lady. Until then, rest well.\u201d\u201cMay the Lord rest well too.\u201dWe exchanged bows casually, and then I followed Eria to the annex.Except for Marquis Valdir, all guests were staying in the annex, and I was no exception.Like a marquis\u2019s annex, the annex was large, splendid, and beautiful.It\u2019s very obvious that they cared about welcoming guests from everywhere.An envoy from Natsha Kingdom would be coming soon, so of course, he paid a lot of attention.I was following Eria while looking around the mansion, but when I suddenly felt someone\u2019s gaze, I stopped walking and looked back.But there\u2019s nothing there.What? Am I mistaken again?If it was the first time, I wouldn\u2019t have minded it, but I had felt the same feeling before.That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t simply pass it, so I kept looking around.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, My Lady?\u201d\u201c\u2026it\u2019s nothing.\u201dIn the end, I couldn\u2019t find anything, so I followed Eria again.I kept glancing back, but I still couldn\u2019t find anything.\u201cHere it is, My Lady.\u201dThe room Eria guided me to was on the third floor of the annex, at the eastern end of the building.I didn\u2019t like rooms with large windows, but I liked this one.Because I could see the blue sea clearly through the large window.I approached the window and opened it. The wind smelled like salty seaweed. I guessed it was the smell of the sea.The sea sparkling under the sunlight was so pretty. I stood by the window for a while and looked at the sea.In the meantime, Eria, who had finished organizing my luggage, approached me and said.\u201cYou seem to like the sea.\u201d\u201cI like it. It\u2019s my first time seeing it.\u201d\u201cOh, really? Well, you must have not had a chance to see the sea because you\u2019ve been inland all the time.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cThen, would you like to take a closer look?\u201dTake a closer look?\u201cIs there a beach in the mansion?\u201d\u201cNo way. Of course, you have to go outside.\u201dDo you mean I should leave the mansion?\u201cYou\u2019ve come all the way to Hutton, so it must be frustrating to just stay in your room, right?!\u201dThat\u2019s right, but\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t have any other plans until dinner anyway.\u201dEria\u2019s words shook my heart.I also wanted to go outside, so it made me more tempted to do it.Although I was the emperor\u2019s agent, as a member of the delegation, I had to get Marquis Valdir\u2019s permission as he\u2019s the representative of the delegation.It was only in the mansion that I was able to move freely. Outside was excluded.After contemplating, I eventually went to Marquis Valdir and asked if I could go outside for a while.\u201cYou can go.\u201dNot only did Marquis Valdir gladly give his permission, but he also gave me a carriage and an escort knight.\u2026why is he so kind to me?If Marquis Valdir was originally a friendly person to me, I would have happily accepted it, but it was suspicious because he\u2019s not.\u201cCan I really go out?\u201dWhen I asked for confirmation, Marquis Valdir replied with a chuckle.\u201cWhy are you asking me that? If the Lady wants to go out, she can go out, and if she doesn\u2019t want to, she doesn\u2019t need to.\u201dHis answer was that he didn\u2019t care whether I went out or not.Ironically, I was relieved by his words and went out immediately.***Please support to save ROS. Your help is desperately needed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI left the mansion with a carriage, but that\u2019s all.I used my two strong legs to walk around the streets, and there was no escort knight with me.Eria was anxious about that, but I was somewhat lighthearted.Because I didn\u2019t really like taking people around.\u201cWhere do you want to go first, My Lady?\u201d\u201cUm, well.\u201dI pondered for a moment and answered.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the port first. I want to see the sea more closely.\u201d\u201cThen, come this way.\u201dAs someone who confidently said that she would take me around Hutton, Eria knew Hutton\u2019s geography well.As soon as I entered the port with Eria, I could see the vast open sea with its salty smell.The waves, pushed by the wind, hit the rocks and disappeared into the air, creating white foam.There were a lot of people in the port.Sailors, merchants, and travelers were also seen.What\u2019s the name of those white birds flying in the sky again?\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of that bird?\u201dI asked Eria.\u201cThat\u2019s called seagull. Do you know that you can feed seagulls?\u201d\u201cIs that possible?\u201d\u201cOf course! Please wait a minute, I\u2019ll go buy the bread.\u201dI picked up a piece of bread that Eria bought and lifted it high in the sky.Then a seagull took it in an instant.Wow, amazing. I can\u2019t believe I fed seagulls.\u201cNow, try this too!\u201dI smiled like a child and gave pieces of bread to the seagulls.Then, following Eria\u2019s recommendation, we headed to sea street.According to Eria, the sea street was a famous street that travelers, who come to Hutton, must visit at least once.As she said, the street was full of people whether it was really a famous street. It seemed to be more than the port.\u201cIt\u2019s cheap, it\u2019s cheap!\u201d\u201cTake a look!\u201dThere were a lot of food ingredients that weren\u2019t commonly found in inland areas, such as seafood and fish, at the stalls.There were also a lot of handicrafts that were made using the characteristics of the sea, such as corals, pearls, and shells.I didn\u2019t know when I could go out again, so should I buy Sarah\u2019s gift in advance?I might as well buy a gift for Baron Delrond and Kalian.I thought gifts with the characteristics of this place would be good, so I bought a hairpin with shell decoration for Sarah, and a coral reef quill pen for Baron Delrond.And as for Kalian\u2026 what should I buy?This was hard. I was thinking about buying a quill pen like the baron\u2019s, but for a famous emperor, a quill pen as a gift seemed too shabby.Then, what would be good to buy?I looked around the stall carefully.This looks too cheap, and that doesn\u2019t go well with Kalian\u2026\u201cAh.\u201dAfter looking around for a long time, what caught my eye was blue jewel-studded cufflinks.The jewel that was studded on the button reminded me of Kalian\u2019s eyes.I picked it up as if I was possessed.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you picked that up. You have good eyes!\u201dThe merchant smiled brightly and explained the jewel on the button.\u201cIt\u2019s a Blue Marine, and it\u2019s a special jewel that can only be found here in Hutton. It\u2019s also called the tears of the sea.\u201dWasn\u2019t that a nickname for pearls?Anyway, it\u2019s definitely a jewel I had never seen before.I had never seen it in a store that handled all the jewels on the continent.That meant it might not be a jewel.\u201cI\u2019ll buy this.\u201dI was wondering whether I could give it to Kalian, but I ended up buying the cufflinks.That\u2019s how much the jewel on this button went well with Kalian.I hope he likes it.\u201cThis is yours.\u201dI also bought a simple gift for Eria, who took the trouble to guide me.\u201cThank you!\u201dEria bowed as if she was very moved.After exploring the streets a little more with Eria, I returned to the mansion around 5 o\u2019clock.Returning to my room, I put down the things I had bought and headed to the main building to meet Marquis Valdir.I wanted to hear his review of the document I gave to Dillon Valdir before.Because he should have read it all by now.\u2026but he might not have read it.I went to his room, but Marquis Valdir was away.Where did he go?I asked a passing servant for Marquis Valdir\u2019s whereabouts.\u201cDo you happen to know where Marquis Valdir is?\u201d\u201cMarquis Valdir is having a meeting with the other diplomatic missions in the conference room on the first floor.\u201d\u2026who\u2019s having a meeting with whom?Marquis Valdir and the other diplomatic missions?Then what about me? Am I not one of the diplomatic missions?\u201cHa.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but laugh. I rubbed my face with my hand.I already knew well that they ignored me and hated me.There\u2019s no way I couldn\u2019t not know because they showed it so openly.However, the reason I didn\u2019t say anything all this time was because I didn\u2019t like them either, and I didn\u2019t want to cause problems by bumping into them.But this was a different case.How could they have a meeting without me? It was a problem I couldn\u2019t get past.I headed straight to the conference room on the first floor. Just as the meeting was over, people were leaving the conference room.Starting with Marquis Valdir, then all the diplomatic missions except me.I heard the thing from the servant, but when I saw it in person, it was even more absurd.I stood a few steps away from the conference room and looked at them.\u201cSo I\u2026 hey, hey.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wro\u2026\u201dThe people who noticed me belatedly shut their mouths all at once and looked into my eyes.A heavy silence fell in the hallway.The last to break the silence was Marquis Valdir.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe nobleman closest to the Marquis pointed at me with a blink.Only then did the Marquis realize that I was here and looked at me.Unlike the other nobles, who looked at me and panicked, the Marquis was calm.\u201cOh, it\u2019s Lady Thebesa. Did you enjoy walking around the streets?\u201dTo say things like that casually.\u201cIt was fun walking around the streets.\u201dWith a forced smile on my lips, I walked up to the Marquis and said,\u201cI heard you had a meeting.\u201d\u201cWe did.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me?\u201dMarquis Valdir looked at me with a face that seemed like he didn\u2019t understand what I meant.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re asking me that. The Lady was the first to say that she wanted to go out to see the streets.\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u201cI did it because I didn\u2019t hear that we had a meeting today.\u201dIn response to my answer, Marquis Valdir looked at the nobleman who stood a little further away. He was the nobleman who gave me the schedule.\u201cSir Salmon. Did you not tell Lady Thebesa that we had a meeting this afternoon?\u201dSalmon glanced at me and answered.\u201cNo, I said it.\u201dWhat are you saying right now\u2026\u201cHe\u2019s lying!\u201dI clenched my teeth and shouted.\u201cI never heard from Sir Salmon that we had a meeting!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what she said, Sir Salmon.\u201dMarquis Valdir asked Salmon again.Salmon replied with a shrug.\u201cIt\u2019s not me who is lying, it\u2019s Lady Thebesa.\u201dHow can you lie so calmly without blinking an eye?It was absurd and ridiculous. I asked, glaring at Salmon.\u201cSir clearly said to me that we have no special schedules until dinner tonight, so I\u2019m free to do whatever I want. You didn\u2019t say a word about the meeting.\u201d\u201cHe said it.\u201dIt was another nobleman beside Salmon who answered.\u201cI saw it. When we just arrived at the mansion, Sir Salmon surely told Lady Thebesa about the changed schedule.\u201d\u201cI saw it too.\u201dIn an instant, two fake witnesses made my position difficult.If I stayed like this, I would be called a liar.Before that happened, I had to make an excuse quickly, but I didn\u2019t know what to say.I couldn\u2019t think of anything because my mind turned white like a blank sheet of paper.I stared blankly at Salmon, who looked at me triumphantly, and the nobles whispering.\u201cHmm.\u201dMarquis Valdir looked back at me.\u201cThen, what do you think, Lady Thebesa?\u201dWhat do I think?Of course, I\u2026\u201cI\u2026 did not lie.\u201dI managed to part my lips that didn\u2019t come off easily.I tried to answer calmly, but I couldn\u2019t stop my voice from trembling.\u201cI really didn\u2019t hear it.\u201dEven if I said this, they wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway.\u201cIt\u2019s not that you didn\u2019t hear it, you must have forgotten it.\u201dAs expected, Marquis Valdir didn\u2019t believe me.\u2026no, maybe he didn\u2019t intend to believe me from the beginning.If I thought about it, it was strange that Marquis Valdir passively allowed me to go out.It was even more strange for him to give an escort knight and a carriage.It was all planned, huh?From the beginning, they were going to have a meeting without me.They made this plan because if they did it openly, I could tell them to the emperor.They were such shameful and cowardly people.I was angry, frustrated, and feeling absurd, but there was nothing I could do now.No matter what I said, they would dismiss it as a lie.In this case, it\u2019s better to be silent.I knew that well, but I was so angry.I wanted to grab Salmon right away and shout, \u2018why are you making me look like a liar?!\u2019Calm down, Leila.Don\u2019t fall for their tricks.There\u2019s nothing good about being angry.\u201cIt seems that you have finally realized what you were doing.\u201dAs I struggled to swallow my anger, Marquis Valdir tapped me on the shoulder and said.\u201cDon\u2019t meddle too much. Stay quiet and go back to the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThen who knows, I might tell Duke Giltian some good words for the Lady. Haha.\u201dHe passed by me laughing so loudly, revealing his neat teeth.Salmon and the other nobles also passed by me smiling.Some of them deliberately bumped my shoulder and passed by.\u201c\u2026\u201dLeft alone, I clenched my fists so tightly that my blood veins stood out.I had to bite my lip so hard that it bled to hold back the tears that burst out because of the soaring emotions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It meant that a lot of time had passed since then.\u2026hold on. What about dinner with Marquis Hutton?When I belatedly remembered that while staring out the window, I got up in a hurry and pulled the bell rope.As if waiting for my call, Eria came in right away.\u201cDid you call me, My Lady?\u201d\u201cWhat about dinner with Marquis Hutton?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s that schedule, it was canceled. Master said he would be home late due to port work.\u201dThe master Eria was talking about was referring to Marquis Hutton.\u201cIt\u2019s for real this time, right?\u201dWhen I asked in case I was the only one who didn\u2019t join again like before, Eria nodded her head.\u201cIt really is. Master hasn\u2019t returned yet.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dIf so, it was fortunate. Only then did I sit back on the bed in relief.\u201cWhat would you like for dinner, My Lady?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201dIt\u2019s late, and it\u2019s obvious that if I ate dinner in this mood, I would have indigestion.I didn\u2019t want to suffer from eating for nothing.\u201cThen, should I help you with the bathing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just taking a bath, you don\u2019t have to help me.\u201dEria tilted her head.\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s really okay?\u201d\u201cYeah. You can go and rest while I\u2019m taking a bath.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAfter a while, when Eria said the bath was ready, I headed to the bathroom.Soaking in the hot water seemed to wash away the fatigue of travel I felt.But the concerns were still there.\u201cHuu.\u201dI sighed deeply and poured hot water on my face.Although I was included in the delegation, the number of people who could participate in the meeting was limited.Judging by Marquis Valdir\u2019s attitude, it was highly likely that he wouldn\u2019t include me in the meeting with Natsha Kingdom.Then, what should I do?If I couldn\u2019t participate in the meeting, I couldn\u2019t meet Duke Giltian\u2019s conditions\u2026More than that, the fact that I might disappoint Kalian, who trusted me and entrusted me, came to me as a bigger concern.\u201cIf I had known this would happen, I should\u2019ve just said I wouldn\u2019t do it\u2026\u201dBecause of it, I suffered hardships and suffered humiliation for no reason.As I was thinking about how to solve this situation, the water got cold.Should I get out now? It\u2019s not good to stay in the water for too long.I roughly wiped off the water, put on my robe, and came out.When I sat down at the dressing table, Eria took a towel and dried my hair.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say it\u2019s okay for you to rest?\u201d\u201cI want to do my job until the end.\u201dThat said, I couldn\u2019t say anything. I left her to do as she pleased.When Eria was almost done drying my hair, Tok Tok , knocks were heard.Considering that I was still only wearing a robe, Eria went outside.\u201cMy Lady, there was a call from the Imperial Palace.\u201dImperial Palace? At this time?\u201cAre you sure it was a call from the Emperor?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure about that. I just heard there\u2019s a call on the magic messenger bird.\u201dUnlike the magic communication tool, magic messenger bird was a magic tool that only conveyed the other person\u2019s voice.It had the advantage of being able to be used for a longer time than the magic communication tool, but it had a big disadvantage that it could only be contacted once it was connected.\u201cBring it.\u201dIf it\u2019s the magic messenger bird, there\u2019s no need for me to change clothes.In Eria\u2019s hand, who came back in after going out, there\u2019s a small toy bird with a spring.When Eria put the bird on the table and turned the spring, the beak moved as the spring slowly turned.[Did you arrive safely at Hutton?]As expected, it was Kalian who contacted me.After I sent Eria out, I answered.\u201cWe arrived safely. How have you been, Your Majesty?\u201d[I\u2019m always the same.]Hearing Kalian\u2019s voice, which was the same as usual, made me choked up for no reason. I felt like I was going to cry.[It\u2019s raining in the capital right now, what about Hutton?]\u201cIt\u2019s very clear here.\u201dI couldn\u2019t show Kalian that I was crying, so I answered calmly and gently pressed my eyes with the back of my hand.Tears that I couldn\u2019t hold back flowed down my cheeks.[I\u2019m glad it\u2019s clear. Because it\u2019s near the beach, the damage will be worse if it rains.]\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dIt was fortunate that it wasn\u2019t a magic communication tool, but a magic messenger bird.If it had been a magic communication tool, I would have shown this unsightly appearance to Kalian.I thought it was really fortunate and wiped away my tears, but Kalian suddenly asked.[Are you crying?]How can he\u2026I looked at the messenger bird in confusion.I wondered if he could see me, but it couldn\u2019t have been.Because the messenger bird didn\u2019t have such a function.Then, how did he know?Did I speak in a crying voice?There\u2019s no way. I spoke the same as usual though.Then, was he just poking it?[As expected, you must be crying.]\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a lie. I was so surprised that tears overflowed.I continued, wiping away the tear marks left around my eyes.\u201cI have no reason to cry.\u201d[Well. What did Marquis Valdir say to you?]Could it be that he has the ability to foresight other than the ability to handle water?Kalian pinpointed the reason too precisely that it made me have such a ridiculous thought.[Looks like I hit the mark.]\u2026I guess he doesn\u2019t have the foresight ability.I suddenly thought of telling Kalian what happened with Marquis Valdir, but I decided not to.\u201cNo. Nothing happened with Marquis Valdir.\u201dIf I told him, the problem in front of me would be solved right away, but that\u2019s all.It would only deepen the misunderstanding between Marquis Valdir and me.In addition, if I worked as an aide, something like this would happen again, and it\u2019s not right to expect Kalian to solve it each time.I have to solve it myself.\u2026although there\u2019s no way.[Did nothing really happen?]\u201cYes.\u201d[Leila.]Kalian\u2019s voice became a little heavy. I got tense up and waited for him to speak.[I hate people who lie.]\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I lowered my head, my gaze naturally went down a little more than the messenger bird.Kalian\u2019s words continued.[I\u2019ll ask again. Did nothing really happen with Marquis Valdir?]I couldn\u2019t answer.To lie again, I was bothered by what he said, and I couldn\u2019t even tell him the truth, so I kept my mouth shut.Then Kalian let out a deep sigh.I wiggled my fingers and apologized.\u201cI apologize, Your Majesty.\u201d[I don\u2019t like hearing you apologizing, but I have to hear it this time.]\u201cI\u2026\u201d[But I don\u2019t want to hear it twice.]Kalian cut me off firmly.[Leila, do you remember what I told you to keep in mind before you go?]What he told me to keep in mind?I looked back on my memory for a moment before answering.\u201cDo you mean to not forget the fact that I joined the diplomatic mission as the emperor\u2019s agent?\u201d[Right. And you said you\u2019d keep that in mind.]Right.[But now that I look at it, it seems you completely forgot.]\u201cYes? There\u2019s no way. I remember it very well.\u201d[So, are you acting appropriately as the emperor\u2019s agent now?]\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dI hesitated because I couldn\u2019t answer yes confidently.Then I heard a short click of tongue.[Don\u2019t forget, Leila. You are the emperor\u2019s agent. You\u2019re always\u2026]While listening to Kalian, the magic messenger bird suddenly stopped.I panicked and tried to rewind the spring, but it didn\u2019t work. It seemed that the magic had run out.I returned the messenger bird to Eria and sat down on the sofa.Kalian gave me a tremendous right to be the emperor\u2019s agent so that I could freely express my mind.\u201cSo that I could freely express my mind\u2026\u201dExpress? I can\u2019t even participate in the meeting with the way things are going.A laugh came out of nowhere because my situation was funny.\u2026but I still have to do something.I came here as the emperor\u2019s agent, so I couldn\u2019t return without doing anything.Because that was an insult to Kalian.It was unconditional to lead this diplomatic meeting successfully.To do that, I had to participate in the meeting\u2026\u201c\u2026can I do it?\u201dI shook my head at the sudden worry.It\u2019s not \u2018can I do it?\u2019, but \u2018I have to do it\u2019.I will definitely do it.*****According to Mavel, the drug Misa used was quite expensive enough that ordinary people could barely afford it even though they saved half their lives.As Misa was a maid, her income was better than that of ordinary people, but she wasn\u2019t rich enough to buy such expensive drugs.It would be possible if she was prepared to commit suicide and spent all of her wealth, but there were some things that weren\u2019t clear.Thinking that there might be something he was unaware of, Philen tenaciously dug into Misa.In the meantime, he found out something unexpected.\u201cNow\u2026 what did you say?\u201dPhilen asked, doubting his ears.The maid replied, down on the floor and trembling.\u201cThat, that vial is the one that Young Lady Leila had.\u201dIt\u2019s the drug that Leila had\u2026?\u201cThere\u2019s no lie in those words, right?\u201d\u201cO, of course.\u201dThe maid shook her head big and continued.\u201cOn the day Young Lady Leila left the mansion, I clearly saw her holding the vial when I helped her organize her luggage. A, and this\u2026\u201dThe maid held out a small bottle with trembling hands.It was the same bottle that came out of Misa\u2019s room, and it contained a blue drug inside.\u201cI, I found it in Young Lady Leila\u2019s luggage that was kept in the storage.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What\u2026Ah, is it because I\u2019m not wearing a dress?If I was an ordinary noble lady, it would be appropriate to wear a dress, but I was clearly an aide to the emperor and a member of the delegation.But it would be ridiculous to say something like that.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t forget that I am His Majesty\u2019s aide.\u201d\u201cWho said that?\u201dMarquis Valdir chuckled.\u201cI just said that if you\u2019re a lady, it\u2019s better to dress like a lady.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make a suggestion to His Majesty the next time they fit the uniform.\u201dPerhaps not liking my answer, Marquis Valdir looked dissatisfied.He looked like he still had a lot to say, but he had to turn around without saying a word because of the report that the diplomatic mission of the Natsha Kingdom would soon arrive at the mansion.After a while, a large and dignified group of people entered the main building.\u201cWelcome to the Empire.\u201dThe representative of the diplomatic mission was Marquis Valdir, but the lord was Marquis Hutton, so he welcomed the delegation on our behalf.\u201cThank you for welcoming us, Marquis Hutton.\u201dIt was Marquis Azef, the representative of the diplomatic mission, who greeted on behalf of the Natsha Kingdom.\u201cI\u2019m Marquis Valdir, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\u201dAs Marquis Valdir joined the conversation, their conversation got a little bit longer.I glanced through the Natsha Kingdom delegation while they were talking.As stated in the document, the delegation consisted of a total of 5 people, 4 of whom were male and one female.I saw them for the first time today, but I already knew who was who because I had read the document beforehand.I was looking through the people with their names on my head, and I happened to make eye contact with the woman that was looking at me.The woman approached me with her eyes folded neatly. Every time she moved, her short bob hair flickered.\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Diane Andrian.\u201dDiane introduced herself and asked for a handshake.It was a greeting that wasn\u2019t commonly used among noble ladies.So even though I felt a little strange, I felt better because she seemed to treat me as a full-fledged official rather than a noble lady.\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too. My name is Leila Thebesa.\u201dI smiled and took her outstretched hand.\u201cHutton is truly a beautiful city. I felt good all the way through because it felt like I was seeing the Natsha Kingdom.\u201dShe implicitly boasted that the Natsha Kingdom was beautiful.\u201cHutton is certainly a beautiful city, but there are many more beautiful cities in the Empire than Hutton.\u201dAt other times, I would have passed it, but not now.I replied with a smile.\u201cEspecially Baruch, the capital, is the most beautiful. If there is an opportunity, I would like to invite you to the capital.\u201dDiane\u2019s eyes lit up as she looked at me. Her lips went up in a pleasant line.\u201cI\u2019m really looking forward to it. At that time, Sir Thebesa will guide me, right?\u201dSir Thebesa. As expected, she recognized me as an official.I was happy with that fact, but my situation of having to be happy only over such things made me feel bitter.\u201cOf course.\u201dConversation with Diane was pleasant and fun.Above all, it was good that she didn\u2019t ignore me like other nobles.\u201cOh my, what are these two beautiful ladies talking about?\u201dWhile talking to Diane, Aldor suddenly interrupted.\u201cShort hair is not common in the Empire, so I don\u2019t have a chance to see it, but it\u2019s very refreshing to see it this way.\u201dAldor glanced at Diane up and down as if it was very interesting.How rude you are to the person in front of you.As a noble of the same empire, I was ashamed.\u201cLord Hutton.\u201dI called him because I thought it would be better to stop him before he became ruder.Then Aldor winked at me.\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, Lady Thebesa. In my eyes, the Lady is the prettiest.\u201dWhat kind of nonsense is this\u2026I bit the soft flesh in my mouth to deal with the crumbling expression on my face. The corners of my lips, which I tried hard to raise, trembled slightly.\u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201dUnlike me, who hid my emotions, Diane expressed her displeasure.\u201cIs this how the Empire welcomes delegations from other countries? Sexually harassing a member of the delegation?\u201dAs Diane\u2019s voice resounded loudly through the hall, everyone\u2019s attention was drawn.Aldor\u2019s face, which had unexpectedly become the center of attention and was cornered as a molester, turned red.\u201cWhe, when did I sexually harass you\u2026!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you just say that? And why are you speaking informally? I never gave you permission to speak casually.\u201dUnlike me who hesitated, Diane said what she wanted to say without hesitation.Even though we\u2019re both women, we\u2019re so different.I was embarrassed and ashamed of myself. The desire to act confidently like Diane suddenly soared.As Diane shot him, Aldor kept his mouth shut with a red face.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dMarquis Hutton came to Aldor\u2019s behind and asked.\u201cFather! I\u2019m innocent!\u201dAldor confessed his innocence to Marquis Hutton.After hearing all the stories, Marquis Hutton sighed and pushed Aldor\u2019s back.\u201cYou go back to your room.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cNow!\u201dAt Marquis Hutton\u2019s roar, Aldor stomped and disappeared.\u201cMy stupid son made a mistake.\u201dMarquis Hutton apologized to Diane.\u201cI apologize on his behalf, Lady Andrian.\u201d\u201cI accept your apologies for the Lord\u2019s rudeness, but I hope the Marquis will correct the title as well.\u201dDiane smiled brightly at the bewildered Marquis Hutton.\u201cIt is correct to call me Sir Andrian or Viscount Andrian, not Lady Andrian. Because I am here as a diplomat.\u201d*****\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early for you to corner someone?\u201dDiane, who came into her room guided by Marquis Azef, took off her coat and looked at him.\u201cWhat do you mean? You told me to pick a hole, uncle.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but after talking to them, I think we don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cLooks like they\u2019re not that competent, huh?\u201d\u201cI think Marquis Hutton is still good enough, but Marquis Valdir is good for nothing?\u201dMarquis Azef smiled and sat down on the sofa.\u201cI can\u2019t believe such a man is the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The glory of the empire seems to be a thing of the past. This meeting will be easy to resolve.\u201d\u201cWell. Will it be?\u201dAt Diane\u2019s answer, Marquis Azef looked at her.\u201cSeems like there\u2019s someone on your mind, huh?\u201d\u201cYes, there is.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201dDiane thought for a moment and shrugged.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be an obstacle yet, but I\u2019ll let you know when it grows to that level.\u201d*****It was a pity that I couldn\u2019t talk to Diane more because of Aldor.I wanted to visit her, but I held back because it didn\u2019t seem like I could meet a foreign delegation privately.From the other person\u2019s point of view, they might think that I was here to be a spy.And Marquis Valdir would find some faults in me needlessly.I\u2019ll see her again at dinner anyway, so we can talk then.Soothing my regret, I went through the data I had organized about the Natsha Kingdom.But had Marquis Valdir read the data I gave him?I was sure he wouldn\u2019t even look at it.As expected, I have to attend the meeting.Marquis Valdir wouldn\u2019t allow me to attend the meeting, but it didn\u2019t matter.Because I was the Emperor\u2019s agent.That alone was enough to qualify me to attend the meeting without the Marquis\u2019s permission.\u201cMy Lady.\u201dEria came in with a large box.\u201cThe Marquis has sent you a gift.\u201dSeeing her calling him \u2018Marquis\u2019 instead of \u2018Master\u2019, she probably referred to Marquis Valdir.I couldn\u2019t believe he sent me a gift. It probably wasn\u2019t sent in a good way.I looked at the box with uncomfortable eyes.On the other hand, Eria smiled and put the box on the table.\u201cMay I open it, My Lady?\u201dIt\u2019s a gift sent through a maid, so it wouldn\u2019t contain anything strange, right?I answered while trying to soothe my uncomfortable heart.\u201c\u2026yeah.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81***Inside the box was a beautiful blue dress.Seeing the dress, Eria put her hands together and her eyes twinkled like a girl.\u201cOh my, what a beautiful dress.\u201d\u201cRight?\u201dObviously, the dress was beautiful, but the intention of sending this was not beautiful at all.Because it was an implicit warning not to think about acting as an aide.I didn\u2019t expect Marquis Valdir would come out like this.I looked at the dress in annoyance.\u201cDon\u2019t just look at it, try it on, My Lady.\u201dEria, who didn\u2019t know anything, said with an excited face.Not wanting to spoil her mood, I nodded, indicating that I would do as she wanted.Eria quickly picked up the dress.The hem of the dress, which was sprinkled with finely ground pearl powder, dispersed elegantly.\u201cOh? There\u2019s a note in the box.\u201dEria took out the note that was hidden in the dress and held it to me.The small note had a short sentence written on it.[Wear it to dinner tonight.]He\u2019s trying to force me to accept what he wanted even if I didn\u2019t want to.It was uselessly thorough. I clenched the note.I scoffed and wanted to ignore these words, but he was a marquis and the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.My temporary position as the emperor\u2019s agent was valid only when dealing with other countries.For now, as a count\u2019s daughter and an aide, it wasn\u2019t something I could easily ignore.Then what should I do? Should I obey him as he told me to?I hated that.As I pondered over what to do, I looked at Eria with a sudden thought that crossed my mind.\u201cEria, I want to drink tea. Can you bring me tea?\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dEria put the dress down on the table and asked me.\u201cWhat kind of tea would you like me to bring?\u201d\u201cThe one with deep color.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dEria asked me back in confusion.\u201cThat, not a deep-tasting tea (tea with a strong taste), but a deep-colored tea\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah. I hope it was a very deep tea.\u201dAt the repeated words, Eria blinked her eyes with a confused face.Yeah, it must be ridiculous. I\u2019m sure no one has ever made such a request.Usually, when we asked for tea, we would ask for the scent and taste, and never ask for the color.Even though I knew that, I pretended not to know and asked.\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cAh, no. I\u2019ll bring it.\u201dEria hurriedly left.You don\u2019t have to go hurriedly like that.I followed Eria\u2019s footsteps and looked at the dress on the table.The dress glistening in the sunlight was definitely beautiful, but it didn\u2019t really impress me.I\u2019m just going to look at the rest of the data.I threw the marquis\u2019s note in the trash can and went through the data again.After a while, Eria returned with a teacup and a teapot.She poured tea into the teacup.Bright red tea was filled in the blue teacup.\u201cCan the color be this deep?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dIt will stain very well.I smiled contentedly and picked up the teacup.The scent was as strong as the color, which was deep.I just lifted it lightly, but the strong scent already struck me.\u201cYou can go now.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll put away the dress.\u201dWhen Eria tried to grab the dress, I waved my hand.\u201cJust leave it here.\u201d\u201cBut if you leave it like this, it will get dusty.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to change soon. I want to appreciate it a little more, so just leave it here.\u201d\u201cI understand, My Lady.\u201dAfter Eria left, I took a sip of the tea. The bitter taste lingered on the tip of my tongue for a long time.\u201cIt\u2019s not my cup of tea.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to drink this, so I had to throw it away.Instead of putting the teacup down, I lifted it to my shoulder level.And slowly tilted the teacup.*****Marquis Valdir sent not only the dress but also matching shoes and accessories as gifts.I could see his hard work in sending such an expensive gift to warn a lady he didn\u2019t like, but it was useless.\u201cOh, oh my goodness!\u201dThe dress Marquis Valdir gave me was stained by tea, so I couldn\u2019t wear it at all.Because the red marks that spread over the wet dress couldn\u2019t go away no matter how much I washed them.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Eria.\u201dI smiled inwardly but pretended to be sad on the outside and said to Eria, who was stunned.\u201cI couldn\u2019t wear the dress because I made a mistake.\u201d\u201cN, no. You can make mistakes. If it\u2019s\u2026 a mistake.\u201dSaying that, Eria looked at me suspiciously.I guessed Eria knew that I had intentionally spilled the tea on the dress.Well, it didn\u2019t change just because she knew.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a mistake.\u201dBecause she would stop if I insisted that it\u2019s a mistake.Eria sighed deeply and asked me.\u201cSince you can\u2019t wear the dress you got as a gift, what would you wear to the dinner? Do you have any dresses you brought with you?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI couldn\u2019t have been. I didn\u2019t even think about wearing a dress when I came here, so I only brought my indoor clothes and outdoor clothes to wear.\u201cThen what would you wear for dinner?\u201d\u201cWhat would I wear? I can wear the uniform as planned.\u201dAt my words, Eria\u2019s expression clouded.It was a face with something. There\u2019s no way she would make that kind of expression simply because I couldn\u2019t wear the dress.\u201cWhat did Marquis Valdir say to you?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dI was just testing poking it, but looking at her reaction, it seemed that I hit the mark.Come to think of it, Eria suggested going outside yesterday and persuaded me hard.Maybe that\u2019s also because of\u00a0 Marquis Valdir\u2019s influence.\u201cDid Marquis Valdir also tell you to take me outside without fail yesterday?\u201dI wasn\u2019t sure about this, but it was bingo again this time.\u201cHa.\u201d\u201cI, I apologize, My Lady!\u201dWhen I let out a big sigh, Eria lay her face down on the floor and apologized.\u201cThere, there\u2019s no malice! Marquis Valdir simply told me that he wanted me to introduce you to Hutton\u2019s beauty, so\u2026\u201dI knew that Eria had no malice.There\u2019s no way I couldn\u2019t have known that the Marquis was the one who said that. Since not a single maid dared to disobey, she simply followed.Even though I knew it well, as the human mind was so crafty, even she looked detestable.Even if I tried to think positively, it was difficult to do so.\u201c\u2026get ready to go to dinner.\u201dI said in a voice that\u2019s gone from laughter.Eria couldn\u2019t erase her gloomy expression throughout the preparation.Since I was wearing a uniform, not a dress, I didn\u2019t have much to prepare.It\u2019s just like when I went out to greet the delegation during the day.As I thought, I finished preparing early and spent the rest of the time reading the data.Tok tok-Suddenly knocks were heard.Eria, who opened the door with my permission to open it, looked at the other person in surprise.\u201cYoung\u2026 Master.\u201dYoung Master? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u201cIs Lady Thebesa ready?\u201dAs expected, it was Aldor who came.Why did he come here? I looked at Aldor with a serious look.Aldor looked at me in surprise.\u201cDinner is starting soon, why haven\u2019t you ready yet, Lady?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m already ready.\u201dAldor looked at me with a face that said, \u2018Really?\u2019.Then he looked at Eria with fierce eyes.\u201cDid you not deliver the dress that Marquis Valdir gave to the Lady?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026\u201d\u201cI already got the dress.\u201dEria, who was innocent, shouldn\u2019t be criticized because of me, so I immediately intercepted.\u201cBut I accidentally spilled my tea, so I had no choice but to wear my uniform. So don\u2019t blame the maid.\u201dAldor clicked his tongue and looked at me.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you spilled your tea. You made a mistake that even a child wouldn\u2019t make.\u201dIs he being sarcastic? I\u2019m not impressed though.I put down the data I was looking at and got up from my seat.\u201cSo, for what purpose do you come here, My Lord?\u201d\u201cI came to escort the Lady to the dining room.\u201d\u201cEscort?\u201dI tilted my head.\u201cDoes the Lord also participate in the dinner?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAldor smiled proudly and reached out to me.\u201cBut the Lady is special, so I came to escort you personally.\u201dThe reason why the obvious speech made me feel so bad was probably because I had heard it all the time when I came here.\u201cI don\u2019t need that kind of consideration.\u201dI said as I passed by Aldor.\u201cI want you to treat me not as a lady, but as the emperor\u2019s aide and the emperor\u2019s agent.\u201dAs I was about to leave, Aldor grabbed my arm.\u201cThen, how exactly should I treat you?\u201dWhen I turned around, I saw Aldor laughing out loud.He said to me sarcastically.\u201cShould I bow down while greeting you as I do to the emperor? Or do you want me to speak using honorifics?\u201dGreetings and honorifics.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say that too to the Marquis and my father? I\u2019m the emperor\u2019s aide and agent, so please treat me accordingly.\u201dPlease treat me\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t forget, Leila. You\u2019re the emperor\u2019s agent.\u201dYeah, right. I was the emperor\u2019s agent.An agent to the emperor who took over the emperor\u2019s role in the absence of the emperor.Why did I forget about this until now?Until now, the disrespect I had endured and let pass was also a disrespect to the Emperor.\u201cHaha.\u201dI felt so stupid that I burst into small laughter.Aldor looked at me strangely.\u201cLady Thebesa?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not Lady Thebesa, but Sir Thebesa, My Lord.\u201dI shook off his hand, pointing out his mistake.\u201cFrom now on, as the emperor\u2019s agent, I intend to receive all the fair treatment, so please do everything the Lord had said.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI left the dumbfounded Aldor and headed to the dining room in the main building.Apparently, there\u2019s no one in the dining room except for an empty table.Looks like everyone hasn\u2019t arrived yet.In case I was late, I hurried my steps, so it was a relief.Having spare time, I leisurely looked around the dining room.The dining room was as big and grand as the mansion.The sunlight coming through the stained glass that occupied one entire wall shattered into various colors.There were expensive sculptures everywhere, and even the paintings on the walls all looked expensive.There were a lot of paintings in the annex too, so it seemed that Marquis Hutton liked paintings.As I was looking around the paintings closely, the door swung open.\u201cOh, there\u2019s already a guest here.\u201dIt was Marquis Hutton. Beside him, there was Marquis Valdir, and other nobles were seen behind them.Everyone came together, so am I the only one who came alone?Aldor said he would escort me, so maybe they counted me out on purpose.\u201cLady Thebesa.\u201dMarquis Valdir called me in a displeased tone. He looked angry.Knowing why Marquis Valdir looked like that, I answered immediately.\u201cI loved the dress you gave me as a gift. However, I accidentally spilled my tea and couldn\u2019t come here wearing the dress. I\u2019m sorry, Marquis.\u201dMarquis Valdir\u2019s eyebrow slanted.\u201cA\u2026 mistake?\u201dI nodded calmly.\u201cYes. A mistake.\u201d\u201cLady!\u201d\u201cWhy are you angry, Marquis Valdir?\u201dMarquis Hutton stopped Marquis Valdir with a friendly smile.\u201cThe envoy from the Natsha Kingdom will be coming soon, so we must not harden the atmosphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on, don\u2019t frown and hurry up to sit down.\u201dMarquis Hutton took Marquis Valdir and headed to the higher seat.Next to him, other nobles sat side by side.After everyone was seated except for me, the only remaining seat was the farthest one.At other times, I would have sat there without saying a word, but not now.I passed by the people who were sitting and stood in front of the nobleman sitting right next to Marquis Valdir.So his name is\u2026\u201cViscount Malven. I think this is my seat, could you please move out?\u201d\u201cHa?\u201dViscount Malven looked up at me as if it was ridiculous.\u201cWhy does the Lady think this is her seat? You\u2019re not going to say it\u2019s because you\u2019re a count\u2019s daughter, are you?\u201dI heard someone laughing next to me.It was obvious ridicule, but it didn\u2019t shake my heart or my mind.I said, looking straight at Viscount Malven.\u201cNo way. The Viscount is higher than me simply by our rank.\u201dStrictly speaking, count\u2019s daughter was not a title.I originally had a lower rank than a baron, but he only respected me because my father was a count.\u201cI\u2019m glad you know that. But why are you asking me to move out?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the Emperor\u2019s agent.\u201dI swept the back of the chair he was sitting on with my index finger.\u201cThe Viscount is not going to say that he has a higher position than I, who is His Majesty\u2019s agent, is he?\u201dIn private places, rank was given priority, but in public places, position took priority.It rarely became a problem because usually, their rank and position match, but\u2026 everything had exceptions.That\u2019s the case right now.Of course, from that point of view, it was right for me to sit where Marquis Hutton was sitting, which was the higher seat, but since everything had its order, I compromised that in moderation.\u201cMy legs hurt, could you please move out?\u201dInstead of saying anything, Viscount Malven looked at Marquis Valdir for help.But Marquis Valdir said nothing.Of course, he is. Because everything I said is true.\u201cOr, should I report this to the Emperor now?\u201dEventually, Viscount Malven got up from his seat, and the atmosphere in the dining room subsided coldly.Everyone looked at me, but I drank water calmly. It was just plain water, but the water was very sweet as if it had been mixed with honey.I should\u2019ve done this earlier.I didn\u2019t really like to control someone with power, but I couldn\u2019t help it.Because if I didn\u2019t do this, they would control me.\u201cLady Thebesa.\u201dWhile everyone was quietly staring at me, Marquis Hutton smiled and spoke to me.\u201cWhen I first saw you, I thought you were weak, but you\u2019re more daring than I thought.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI smiled and put down the glass of water I was holding.\u201cI have something I want to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you call me Lady Thebesa in private, but I would like you to call me Sir Thebesa in public.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dIf it had been Marquis Valdir, he would have been furious, but Marquis Hutton didn\u2019t do that but smiled instead.\u201cI\u2019ll have to use honorifics too along with it then.\u201dIs he being sarcastic? Or, is he being serious?I looked closely at Marquis Hutton\u2019s face to find out which side it was, but it was difficult to guess what he thought from the smile on his face.Then, it would be better to answer in moderation.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t wish that far.\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s a relief. Don\u2019t you think so, everyone?\u201d\u201cYe\u2026 yes, haha.\u201d\u201cHa, haha\u2026\u201dUnder Marquis Hutton\u2019s lead, everyone except Marquis Valdir and me was forced to laugh.By the time the meaningless laughter died down, the envoy from the Natsha Kingdom entered the dining room.\u201cWelcome.\u201dEveryone, including Marquis Hutton and Valdir, got up from our seats to greet them.\u201cThank you for inviting us to the dinner, Marquis Hutton.\u201dMarquis Azef greeted Marquis Hutton lightly and sat opposite Marquis Valdir.The others sat next to him.And Diane sat opposite me, right next to Marquis Azef.When Diane saw me, she raised her eyebrows, slightly surprised.Why is she like that?Is it weird that I\u2019m sitting here?When I looked at her in confusion, Diane calmly turned her head as if nothing had happened.Soon after, food began to come out by course.Starting with appetizers, cold appetizers, soups, hot appetizers, and more.Throughout the meal, I watched the food eaten by the Natsha Kingdom envoy.Surely, my speed of eating was remarkably slow. And the fact that I wasn\u2019t really hungry also played the part.\u201cSir Thebesa, is the food not to your liking?\u201dBut Marquis Hutton, who was talking to Marquis Azef, asked me as if he was concerned.For a moment, everyone\u2019s attention was focused on me.It\u2019s burdensome\u2026I wiped my mouth with a napkin and answered.\u201cNo. It\u2019s delicious.\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t eat much.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it as it\u2019s to eat the main dish.\u201d\u201cHaha, I was going to say, \u2018what lose weight.\u2019 if you said you want to lose weight. I have nothing to say if you said so.\u201dUnlike Marquis Valdir, Marquis Hutton was good at joking and gave off a warm image in many ways.Rumor had it that his sharp personality made sailors and navy nervous, but I didn\u2019t feel that way at all.Again, the conversation was led by the three marquis.I and the others also participated in the conversation but to an intermittent level.I wanted to talk to Diane, but there were too many people so it was impossible.The marquis was talking right next to me, so it was difficult to suddenly bring up another story.There\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019ll just look for another opportunity.I swallowed my regret and focused on eating the main dish.\u201cSir Thebesa.\u201dJust before the dessert came out, Diane suddenly called me.\u201cAre you going to attend the meeting in two days, Sir Thebesa?\u201dThere\u2019s silence for a moment in the dining room.The nobles of the Empire looked at me in unison.The gaze was also that gaze, but Diane\u2019s question was so sudden that I stared blankly at her for a moment.\u201cHmm, that\u2026\u201dTaking advantage of that, Marquis Valdir opened his mouth.No. If I lose the chance to answer her to Marquis Valdir here, it will be difficult to turn back.\u201cYes.\u201dI clenched my fists that I had placed on my lap and answered her right away.\u201cI will attend too. As the Emperor\u2019s agent.\u201d*****After the meal, Marquis Hutton left first with the Natsha Kingdom envoy.I was about to go too, but Marquis Valdir caught me.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dI knew what he was asking, but I pretended not to know and asked naturally.\u201cHa, are you pretending not to know?\u201dThen Marquis Valdir snorted like an angry wild boar and asked in more detail.\u201cWho are you to attend the meeting as you please? Do you not know that I have all the authority to decide whether someone can attend the meeting or not?!\u201d\u201cOf course I do. But I am His Majesty\u2019s agent.\u201dI continued to speak while looking straight at the furious Marquis Valdir.\u201cI don\u2019t think the Marquis has more authority than me, who is His Majesty\u2019s agent, am I wrong?\u201dAt my words, Marquis Valdir couldn\u2019t say anything and kept his mouth shut.The wrinkles on his forehead showed that he wasn\u2019t in a good mood.After being silent for a moment, Marquis Valdir sighed deeply and said.\u201cWhat can the Lady do at the diplomatic meeting? Are you going to tarnish the name of the empire?\u201d\u201cWhy do you think I can\u2019t do anything?\u201d\u201cThen, do you mean you can do something? Ah, there must be one. It\u2019s that you\u2019re just taking up space uselessly!\u201dI frowned at the blatant criticism.Even if he was a marquis, which was a higher rank than me, there\u2019s no reason for me to keep listening to such abusive speech for no reason.\u201cIf there is nothing more to say, I will get going.\u201d\u201cGive up right away.\u201dAs I turned around, Marquis Valdir grabbed my shoulder and said.\u201cGive up on attending the meeting!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cLady Thebesa!\u201d\u201cHave you forgotten why I was included in this delegation? It was to prove my ability at the meeting.\u201dFor that, Kalian even gave me the privilege of being the emperor\u2019s agent.\u201cBut now, the Marquis\u2019s action seems to be against the Emperor\u2019s will.\u201dMarquis Valdir\u2019s mouth was closed like a clam.Even if he ignored me, it\u2019s impossible to ignore His Majesty.\u201cSo, no matter what happens, I will attend the meeting.\u201dI stared straight at Marquis Valdir and made sure of my words to him.\u201cIf you want to stop me, you\u2019ll have to get the approval from His Majesty.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It would be more beneficial for us if she didn\u2019t attend.\u201d\u201cThen, it wouldn\u2019t be fun.\u201dDiane, who arrived in front of her room, turned around with a mischievous smile.\u201cI\u2019ve been preparing for a long time, so if it\u2019s one-sided, it wouldn\u2019t be fun. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have at least one obstacle?\u201d\u201cObstacle\u2026 Is she at that level?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201dDiane opened the door and continued.\u201cWe\u2019ll see tomorrow whether she\u2019ll stop only as an obstacle or become a huge rock that blocks our way.\u201d*****According to the schedule, the meeting was scheduled for the following Wednesday at 2 p.m.I checked the schedule from time to time in case Marquis Valdir did another strange trick.At the same time, I also prepared for the meeting diligently.I made a plan while organizing the data I had.I didn\u2019t know about the others, but Diane was definitely a formidable person.I have to make a thorough plan.Because if she sees even a little gap, she will bite me right away.I reviewed and revised the plan considering the number of cases.Finally, with the completed plan, I visited Marquis Hutton\u2019s butler.\u201cCan I use the magic messenger bird?\u201d\u201cWhat do you need it for, My Lady?\u201d\u201cI want to contact His Majesty.\u201d\u201cI have to ask Master first, so will you wait in your room?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dHow long do I have to wait for him to come to my room?After a while, the butler brought the magic messenger bird.\u201cMore people used it than I thought, so it didn\u2019t charge much. The wizard said you could use it for about ten minutes.\u201dTen minutes is a bit tight, but it can\u2019t be helped.I nodded and took the messenger bird.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re done, you can return it to me through the maid.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d\u201cThen I will get going.\u201dThe butler politely bowed and left.I put the messenger bird on the table and turned the spring.The bird\u2019s yellow beak moved up and down and spit out words.[This is the Imperial Palace Communication Department. Please indicate your identity and affiliation.]\u201cI\u2019m Leila Thebesa, the aide of His Majesty the Emperor. I would like to contact His Majesty.\u201d[After confirming your identity, we will contact you again.]The voice disappeared and the spring stopped.While waiting, I was checking the plan, until the messenger bird flapped its wings.It meant that the Imperial Palace contacted me.When I turned the spring again, the beak moved.[Leila.]\u201c\u2026Your Majesty?\u201dOf course, I thought I was contacted by the Imperial Palace Communication Department again, but it\u2019s actually Kalian.Flustered and calling him, Kalian smiled a little.[Why are you flustered when you\u2019re the one who contacted me first?]\u201cI never thought Your Majesty would be the one who contacted me back right away\u2026\u201d[It happened somehow. So, what\u2019s going on? Hearing your voice, it doesn\u2019t seem like anything bad has happened.]\u201cIs it obvious?\u201d[Very.]Is that so? I spoke the same as usual though.\u201cThere is something I would like to ask Your Majesty, that\u2019s why I contacted you.\u201d[What is it?]\u201cIt\u2019s about the meeting.\u201dIf I had more time, I would have explained them one by one and asked, but I didn\u2019t have the time.Out of urgency, I asked whatever came to mind.\u201cHow far can I go?\u201dThere was silence for a moment.Realizing that I had asked something strange belatedly, I hurriedly spoke up.\u201cI apologize, Your Majesty. I didn\u2019t mean to ask this, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d[Anything.]Kalian replied, cutting off my words.It wasn\u2019t an angry tone. Rather, I guessed he was smiling?[As long as you\u2019re not selling the country, you can do anything. Because you\u2019re my agent now.]*****The day of the long-awaited meeting.I was so nervous that I couldn\u2019t sleep at night, and I also skipped lunch.After confirming once again that the meeting would be held at 2 p.m. as scheduled, I entered the conference hall 10 minutes before.I arrived quite early, but there were already people seated in the conference hall.There were three empty seats.It\u2019s the seat of Marquis Valdir, Marquis Azef, and mine as the emperor\u2019s agent.Perhaps because the words I said at the dinner two days ago worked out, my seat was right next to Marquis Valdir.As I sat down, the nobles of the empire looked at me with piercing eyes. All of them looked disapproving.The nobles of the other country were calm, but the nobles of the empire, who were on the same side, only made me laugh.It felt like the enemies I had to face had increased into two teams.They wouldn\u2019t start an argument that what I\u2019m doing now is something unconditionally bad for the Empire, right?\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dDiane, who was sitting across from me, smiled and greeted me.\u201cOf course. Because it\u2019s a place I have to come.\u201dThe smile on Diane\u2019s lips deepened. Her eyes looking at me flashed sharply, unlike before.\u201cThen, please do your best for me today.\u201dIt means that she will attack mercilessly without going easy on me.\u201cPlease do your best for me too.\u201dIt was what I was hoping for too. That way, I could comfortably receive their attacks and counterattack them.After a while, the meeting began with Marquis Valdir and Marquis Azef\u2019s arrival.Firstly, Marquis Valdir came forward and apologized for the damage the Empire caused to the Natsha Kingdom.And then, when he furtively presented the compensation set by the Empire, Marquis Azef immediately refuted it.\u201cThe only compensation we want in our kingdom is Khan\u2019s sovereignty.\u201dMarquis Valdir\u2019s expression was subtly distorted at Marquis Azef\u2019s bold request.The expressions of the other nobles were not good either.Diane smiled and said.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t take it too badly about us asking for Khan\u2019s sovereignty. We are just trying to reclaim our land.\u201d\u201cAre you saying Khan is Natsha Kingdom\u2019s land?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAt Diane\u2019s answer, the nobles of the empire made a commotion.Viscount Malven asked Diane.\u201cOn what basis do you say that?\u201d\u201cAs everyone knows, the founder of our Natsha Kingdom is Randell Alliance.\u201dNatsha Kingdom was a country of seven islands and was called the Randell Alliance about 700 years ago.Then, the lords of each island united and established a kingdom, which was the present-day Natsha Kingdom.\u201cAt that time, Khan belonged to the Randell Alliance. This is the evidence.\u201dWhat Diane brought out was an old document.The document contained a statement that Khan belonged to the Randell Alliance 700 years ago, along with a seal presumed to be the one who was the lord of Khan at the time.\u201cDo you have any proof that this document is real?\u201dWhen Viscount Malven cautiously asked, Diane answered immediately.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you the other way around. Do you have any proof that this document is fake?\u201dOf course, there was none, so Viscount Malven kept his mouth shut.Diane immediately attacked without a break.\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Cardin Empire would know that. Why did Khan, who belonged to the Randell Alliance, move to the Empire?\u201dOf course, I knew. It was a fact that anyone could know if they did a little research on Khan.While the lord of Khan at that time was ill with a serious illness, his uncle arbitrarily sold Khan to the Empire and took his share.However, at the time, Khan was too far for the Empire to directly manage.It took five days by boat to get there from Hutton, the closest city to Khan.On the other hand, it took only three days from the Natsha Kingdom.Moreover, even if the Empire had Khan, there was nothing to gain from Khan other than expanding the territorial sea.As a result, the Empire didn\u2019t manage Khan properly, and Khan became the pirate\u2019s den.The conflict between countries made the Empire try to resolve the situation by sending navy to Khan, but it was already too late.It\u2019s clear that a lot of casualties would occur even wiping out the pirates.However, it was a pity to hand it over to another country. In a word, Khan was a \u2018Gyereuk\u2019.[T/N: Gyereuk is something that one hesitates to give up even though it is of little interest.]Diane dug into that and appealed that it was better for the Natsha Kingdom to manage Khan.Diane\u2019s beautiful speech began to shake the nobles of the empire.\u201cMay I ask why the Natsha Kingdom wants Khan\u2019s sovereignty so much?\u201dMarquis Valdir, who was still holding onto the reason, asked.\u201cThe people living in Khan now are the descendants of the Randell Alliance, and have the same ancestors as our Natsha Kingdom.\u201dDiane\u2019s sharp eyes slightly bent sadly.\u201cBut the people of Khan are not being properly protected and are suffering from pirates that cause our King to feel very sorry for them.\u201dWas she arousing pity in? It wasn\u2019t a bad strategy.Marquis Azef joined in and made sure of her words to us.\u201cSo we decided that it would be better to take this opportunity to get Khan back, even if our kingdom bears the loss.\u201dTo bear the loss on the other side meant that this side was gaining benefit.The nobles were once again greatly shaken by the fact that it was beneficial to the empire.Even Marquis Valdir, who was holding onto the reason, also seemed to have fallen for the splendid speech of the Natsha Kingdom.I wasn\u2019t surprised. Because their story was perfect.\u2026at least on the surface.\u201cAnyway, I know that the current Cardin Empire cannot afford to manage Khan.\u201dAs if not wanting to give us time to think, Diane spoke quickly.\u201cThat\u2019s why I think us taking over and managing it is good for both the Empire and Natsha Kingdom. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dMarquis Valdir thought for a moment, then nodded.\u201cReceiving the kingdom\u2019s opinion\u2026\u201d\u201cThe sovereignty of Khan cannot be handed over.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI cut Marquis Valdir\u2019s words and spoke.Everyone\u2019s eyes were on me.The diplomats of the Natsha Kingdom, even the nobles who were on the same side, looked at me as if they were dumbfounded.As expected, they didn\u2019t read the data I gave them, huh?I wrote down the value of Khan there though.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you hand over Khan\u2019s sovereignty?\u201dThe man next to Diane asked in a fierce tone.\u201cPlease look at this.\u201dIt was much better to show the data than to explain it a hundred times in words.As she checked the data I had brought out, Diane\u2019s eyes shook wildly.Marquis Azef reached out his hand hastily.\u201cGive it to me.\u201dThe document was passed into Marquis Azef\u2019s hands.His eyes moved up and down, quickly scanning the document.The nobles of the empire stared intently at Marquis Azef. They looked curious about what it was about.\u201cWhat is it about?\u201dMarquis Valdir, who was sitting next to me, even went so far as to ask me.Not feeling worth answering, I neatly ignored him.\u201cSir Thebesa.\u201dMarquis Valdir called me in a fierce tone, but I still ignored him.After reading the document, Marquis Azef put down the document with a slight frown.I looked at Marquis Azef and said.\u201cAs stated in the document I showed you, the Randell Alliance was an alliance that was established about 900 years ago by the nobles of our Cardin Empire who settled on the island.\u201dTo be precise, the ship was wrecked due to a storm and was washed away to the island, and then they settled there.In other words, the founder of the Randell Alliance was from the Cardin Empire.\u201cSo it makes no sense to say that the Natsha Kingdom wants to reclaim their land.\u201dI quietly went in after their words.\u201cIn a way, our Empire should be the one that needs to reclaim the land of Natsha Kingdom.\u201dIt was an unreasonable demand to ask for the return of the land when the ancestor was from the empire, but they said nothing.Of course, they were. Because they were the ones who made such a ridiculous demand first.But, foolishly, the imperial nobles didn\u2019t notice it and were caught up in their words.Of course, some things were said so logically over there, and since the Natsha Kingdom suffered damage several times due to the Empire\u2019s faults, it was natural to compromise from here.But I have to say what I have to say.No matter how wrong it was, it was absurd that we were the only ones being subjected to strange demands from the other side.\u201cWhere is the proof that the content of this document is true?\u201dThe man next to Diane said with a dissatisfied face.I smiled and returned what they had said.\u201cThere\u2019s no proof that it was fake.\u201dThe man was speechless and shut his mouth.I looked at Diane\u2019s expression. She looked calm on the outside, but her eyes shook.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll show you the history books that the Empire has. If that\u2019s not enough, let\u2019s borrow the history books held by the other country.\u201d\u201c\u2026there is no need for that.\u201dDiane returned the document handed to Marquis Azef to me.\u201cBecause I already know. The fact that the founder of our Natsha Kingdom was from the Cardin Empire.\u201dAs expected, you knew, huh?Of course, they investigated it.It was 900 years ago, so it was a bit difficult to investigate, but it was not the information that couldn\u2019t be found if you dug deeper.\u201cBut the case is completely different.\u201dDiane put her hands on the desk and leaned her torso toward me.\u201c900 years ago, merchants of the Cardin Empire settled in a land that no one owned and formed the Randell Alliance, but the Empire robbed Khan that was the Randell Alliance.\u201d\u201cRob?!\u201dSalmon jumped up from his seat and shouted.\u201cOur Empire got Khan through legal procedures!\u201dDiane snorted and attacked back.\u201cAre you talking about the legal procedure that the lord of Khan had no idea about?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dLost in words, Salmon furtively lowered his tail and sat down quietly.I glanced at Salmon.I know how he feels about the Empire, but he acted too hastily.\u201cDo you know how much damage our Natsha Kingdom has to suffer because of the pirates who use Khan as their base?\u201dDiane slammed the desk.\u201cAs time goes by, because their plunder is getting worse, trade with other countries, including the Empire, is getting harder and harder.\u201dThe nobles of the empire, overwhelmed by her momentum, couldn\u2019t even make a sound.\u201cDespite that, with a good heart, we tried to take on the task that the Empire couldn\u2019t handle, but if it comes out like this\u2026 fine.\u201dDiane tilted her lips obliquely.\u201cInstead of Khan\u2019s sovereignty, I would like you to compensate us for all the damage we have suffered so far.\u201dAs if waiting, the man, who was sitting at the very end, held out a document.The document contained information about compensation for damage.Did she prepare this in advance? As expected, she\u2019s an opponent that couldn\u2019t be underestimated.The nobles of the empire, who read the compensation document from the Natsha Kingdom, opened their mouths, screaming in silence, without exception.Needless to say, the amount offered by the Natsha Kingdom was an enormous amount equivalent to half of the empire\u2019s annual tax revenue.It would be much better to give up Khan.\u201cYou choose. Will you give us Khan or will you compensate us for the damage?\u201dDiane asked with a triumphant smile.I stared at her, then nodded.\u201cAll right. We will hand over Khan as the Natsha Kingdom wants.\u201dAs soon as I accepted it easier than they thought, Diane and the other diplomats from the Natsha Kingdom looked at me with strange eyes.\u201cInstead, our empire will not trade with the Natsha Kingdom until all pirates are clear from the Natsha Kingdom.\u201dAt the added words, the diplomats of the Natsha Kingdom, as well as the nobles of the empire, began to buzz loudly.Marquis Valdir looked at me with flustered eyes. He looked like he didn\u2019t understand the situation either.Of course, he didn\u2019t. Because I asked this question separately to Kalian yesterday.He seemed to want to ask me what I was talking about right away, but he couldn\u2019t because there were eyes around, so he swallowed his words.Diane raised her eyebrows and looked at me.\u201cAre you threatening us now?\u201d\u201cThreat? There\u2019s no need for that. It\u2019s just a situation where we have no choice but to do so, so I hope you understand.\u201d\u201cWhat on earth is the reason you have no choice but to do that?\u201dDiane asked as if wanted me to lay it on her at once.I was waiting for that word, so I immediately explained the reason I had prepared.\u201cUntil now, the Empire has continued to trade with the Natsha Kingdom despite the great damage caused by pirate plunder to take responsibility for it.\u201dHowever, if Khan was passed over to the Natsha Kingdom, the Empire had no reason to take any further losses as we weren\u2019t responsible for the problem anymore.Diane frowned at my words.\u201cThe reason the pirates are like this is because the Empire didn\u2019t manage Khan properly. Are you saying you\u2019re going to pass all the responsibility onto us?\u201d\u201cIt was the Natsha Kingdom that said they would take on the task that we couldn\u2019t handle.\u201dAgain this time, I returned what they had said and shut their mouths.\u201cOr should we lend you navy and warship to escort the trading ships in the Natsha Kingdom whenever they come and go?\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re not saying you would lend it to us only once, right?\u201dWhy are you asking such an obvious question?\u201cOf course not. We will support you until the pirate issue is resolved.\u201dI replied with a smile.\u201cIf the pirates rob your supplies, we will take the responsibility that occurred in the Natsha Kingdom. Because it is a matter of convoy.\u201dTaking on not only the pirate issue but also supply damage made the expressions of the members of the Natsha Kingdom\u2019s diplomatic missions darkened.The country that the Natsha Kingdom mainly traded with was the Cardin Empire.However, if the Empire declared that we would not trade anymore, the Natsha Kingdom would be hit hard.The Empire also suffered a blow, but compared to the Natsha Kingdom, it was at a level that could be still endured.Of course, it would be a problem if they cleared the pirates in the Natsha Kingdom, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as it sounded. At least, it would take several years.Diane\u2019s expression, which couldn\u2019t have been unaware of that fact, was distorted without any doubt.Marquis Azef also showed an uncomfortable look.Diane discussed with the others for a while and then said as if she was being generous.\u201cInstead of Khan, we will choose the compensation for the damage.\u201dI can\u2019t believe she said that. She still hasn\u2019t come to her senses, huh?I refused like a knife.\u201cI refuse. Khan\u2019s value isn\u2019t worth the amount that\u2019s written here.\u201dDiane bit her lip hard.\u201c\u2026are you really not going to trade with us?\u201d\u201cIf you take Khan into the Natsha Kingdom.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you refuse even if we offered to receive compensation instead of Khan?\u201d\u201cHow could I accept what the Natsha Kingdom wants when the compensation is ridiculously high?Perhaps because they took it that we would accept it if the amount was reduced from my answer, they scrambled again and offered a new amount.It was less than the amount initially offered, but it was still insufficient.\u201cMay I suggest another alternative?\u201d\u201cTell us.\u201d\u201cBefore that, I would like to talk about Khan\u2019s issues first.\u201dDiane nodded, saying yes, with a slightly suspicious look on her face.\u201cAs everyone here knows, the fact that the pirates have established their base in Khan is not only suffering the people of Khan but also making trade difficult in many ways.\u201dI got up from my seat and looked at everyone.\u201cSo our Emperor would like the Kingdom of Natsha to lend him its power.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you want us to clear the pirates together?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIf there were warships, the pride of the Natsha Kingdom, and knights and wizards, the pride of the Cardin Empire, it was not a dream to clear the pirates.\u201cSo what is the benefit for us?\u201dDiane asked in a sharp tone.Now was the real start.I took a short deep breath and answered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85****\u201cIf the Natsha Kingdom helps us clear the pirates, we will set up a trading base in Khan and set up a \u2018jogyeji\u2019 so that the Natsha Kingdom can use it.\u201d[T/N: Jogyeji is mainly an area set up in the open port so that foreigners can enjoy extraterritorial rights in the country while living freely. More or less is like this :D]At my words, the diplomats of the Natsha Kingdom opened their eyes wide in surprise.\u201cAnd to compensate for the damages suffered by the Natsha Kingdom due to the Empire\u2019s mistake, we will reduce the export tax on grain for 10 years, as well as increase the limit.\u201dAnd at my added words, their wide open mouths looked like they were hardly closed.On the other hand, the nobles of the Empire looked at me with a puzzled look.They seemed to not understand at all why I suddenly said this or why the Natsha Kingdom had such a reaction.Of course, they didn\u2019t understand.They didn\u2019t even read the data I gave them, and this story was a story that I had with Kalian through the messenger bird privately yesterday.\u201c\u2026you knew that.\u201dDiane said in a trembling voice, covering her mouth with her hands.\u201cYou knew from the beginning what kind of situation in our kingdom is\u2026 and what our real reason for wanting Khan is.\u201d\u201cI knew.\u201dThe Natsha Kingdom was importing half of its food and producing half in its own country.However, domestic production continued to decline every year. Land unsuitable for farming and volatile weather were the factors.If this continued, there\u2019s a very high possibility that their domestic production would become zero in the near future.So the Natsha Kingdom studied various countermeasures, but there\u2019s no other good way than to increase grain imports.However, the amount of grain that could be imported from the Cardin Empire, the main importer, was limited, and the more imported, the higher the tax.In the long run, the food problem couldn\u2019t be solved.That\u2019s why the Natsha Kingdom, which was worried about this, tried to import grain from other countries as well as the Empire by using Khan as a trading base.\u201cWhat are you going to do, Marquis Azef?\u201dI smiled and looked at Marquis Azef.\u201cAs the Emperor\u2019s agent, I will ask. Would you accept His Majesty\u2019s offer?\u201d*****Although it took some time to discuss with the others, Marquis Azef eventually accepted the Empire\u2019s offer.It was much more beneficial than taking Khan\u2019s permanent residency or receiving compensation for the damages, so there was no reason to refuse.The benefit was the same for the Empire.In addition to maintaining the territorial waters, it became possible to clear the pirates, which were troublesome.Was that all? We could also continue to secure trade routes with the Natsha Kingdom, the main exporting country.Since the tax was lowered, it might seem like a loss right now, but in the long run, it was a huge benefit.It was also helpful in managing the external image.After talking more briefly, the meeting was over.There were a lot of things that had to be adjusted in detail, such as grain export limits and tax rates, etc, so we decided to hold a meeting two days later after organizing it a bit more.But I won\u2019t be attending that meeting.From then on, it would be the diplomats\u2019 territory.When they reported to Kalian later, I would check the report, but for now, my role ended here.\u201cHere is the summary of the situation in the Natsha Kingdom.\u201dSo, as soon as the diplomats of the Natsha Kingdom left, I presented the data I had to Marquis Valdir.There was data I had given him before, and there were new ones that I added while talking to Kalian yesterday.Marquis Valdir glared at me, took the data, and began to scan it quickly.As the paper flipped over, Marquis Valdir\u2019s face grew redder.Why is he like that? Is there anything he doesn\u2019t understand?\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand or lack, please tell me. I will explain it to you as soon as I know.\u201dMarquis Valdir snorted and looked at me.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t share this data beforehand, did you ignore me?\u201d\u201cI never did.\u201dBANG-!\u201cYou didn\u2019t?! You did it until now!\u201dHe shouted, hitting the round table hard with a furious face.\u201cDid you want to put on airs at the meeting earlier? Or did you want to show off how great the Lady\u2019s ability is?\u201dHis voice echoed through the conference room.I didn\u2019t know if he was really angry or trying to scare me, but I wasn\u2019t scared at all.Rather, should I say that he\u2019s making me laugh because he was so funny, acting desperately like this?I tried to hold back my laughter and looked at Marquis Valdir calmly.\u201cI\u2019m grateful that you consider my ability great, but I never tried to show off or tried to put on airs.\u201d\u201cHa? You never?\u201dMarquis Valdir twisted his lips and shook the data I gave him.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you bring this data to me beforehand? Why wasn\u2019t it shared with me, the representative of the delegation!\u201d\u201cI brought it to you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie! I didn\u2019t get anything!\u201dI thought it was a lie, but looking at his angry face, it seemed that he really never received it.\u201cDon\u2019t ask me, but ask your aides about that, Marquis. Because I certainly have given it to your aide.\u201dAt my words, Marquis Valdir looked quickly at his aide who followed him to the extent of making a whizzing sound when he turned.\u201cIs what Lady Thebesa said true?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201dThe aide couldn\u2019t answer right away and hesitated.He couldn\u2019t answer because if he told a lie, he could see his eyes, and if he told the truth, he thought he would get Marquis Valdir\u2019s wrath.But there was one thing he overlooked.\u201cVesta!\u201dFrom the moment he hesitated, it was no different than already answered yes.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring me this important data?!\u201dIn a raging rage, Sir Vesta put his neck in like a turtle.\u201cThe, the chief aide said it was useless data, so you wouldn\u2019t need it\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMarquis Valdir couldn\u2019t say anything because his chief aide was his son.No matter how angry he was, he didn\u2019t seem to want to curse his son.It was a love for his son that truly made me cry.\u201cThen, it seems like all the misunderstandings have been resolved, so I will get going.\u201dI heard Marquis Valdir yell something, but I ignored it and left the conference room.As I left the main building and headed to the annex, someone was standing in my way.\u201cSir Thebesa.\u201dIt was Diane.She smiled brightly and came to me.\u201cYou\u2019re not from our kingdom, but I can\u2019t believe you know the situation in our kingdom so well. I was really surprised. You\u2019re incredible, Sir Thebesa.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to say too. I almost fell for Sir Andrian\u2019s brilliant speech.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re really, I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t fall for it. If Sir had fallen for it, we would have missed this great opportunity.\u201d\u201cThank you for thinking of this as a great opportunity.\u201dAfter the Cardin Empire and the Natsha Kingdom struggled for days to find a way to coexist, it finally paid off.\u201cAre you going to attend the next meeting, Sir?\u201d\u201cNo. My role ends here.\u201dI could do it if I wanted to, but it didn\u2019t look good to go too far. I also had to know how to back off moderately.\u201cWell, it\u2019s because Sir is not a diplomat.\u201dDiane sighed deeply as if she was disappointed.\u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d\u201cAh, nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201dDiane smiled awkwardly and scratched her cheek.\u201cI was just asking because it was a pity that I couldn\u2019t talk more with you.\u201d\u201cDo we have to talk only in the conference room?\u201dI was like that too. I wanted to talk to her a little more too, so I said with a smile.\u201cI think it\u2019s just in time for tea time\u2026 what do you think, Sir Andrian? Would you like to join me?\u201dDiane smiled brightly at my suggestion and nodded.\u201cOf course, Sir Thebesa.\u201d*****The story of Leila\u2019s successful meeting with the Natsha Kingdom reached Kalian\u2019s ears less than an hour after the meeting was over.It wasn\u2019t reported by Marquis Valdir or diplomatic mission members.Kalian directly contacted Hiltine, who followed Leila, and asked.\u201cReally? You said she succeeded, right?\u201dAfter hearing all the stories from Hiltine, Kalian smiled satisfactorily.And Ver, who accidentally heard it together, was also slightly admiring her.\u201cI already guessed that the Natsha Kingdom was asking for Khan to open a trade route, but I had no idea that there was such a problem.\u201dKalian said, putting the messenger bird, which the communication had cut off, on the desk.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that either until Leila told me.\u201d\u201cHow did Sir Thebesa find out about that?\u201d\u201cWell. She didn\u2019t have much time, so I couldn\u2019t ask that much.\u201d\u201cIf she comes back, I\u2019ll ask her.\u201dVer clenched his fist. His eyes burning with passion for learning.Kalian said with a chuckle.\u201cDon\u2019t bother people too much, give her a break.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, Your Majesty. Because the only person I bother is you.\u201dVer said shamelessly and put the documents down on Kalian\u2019s desk.As if annoyed, Kalian tapped the documents with his index finger.\u201cI think I\u2019m working hard, but the documents don\u2019t seem to have shrunk.\u201d\u201cI agree with you.\u201dSo when he\u2019s about to tell him to work, \u2018 chirp chirp \u2018, he heard a bird chirping.It wasn\u2019t a real bird, but it was the magic messenger bird that was chirping.He thought Hiltine contacted him again, but the bird he had put down on the desk was silent.That means\u2026Kalian took another magic messenger bird out of the desk drawer.As he turned the spring, the beak moved and spat out words.[This is Dwyn.]Dwyn was Hiltine\u2019s subordinate and a member of the Crowd Knights.[Duke Williot went to Sir Thebesa\u2019s house.]Kalian\u2019s eyebrow tilted slightly.\u201cDuke Williot at Leila\u2019s house? What\u2019s his business?\u201d[I don\u2019t know what his business is, but he looks furious.]Dwyn was silent for a moment, then said.[Right now, he is banging on the door and saying all sorts of things, such as he will barge into her house if she doesn\u2019t come out right away.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFrom the moment he heard that Philen returned to the capital, he already thought it had something to do with Leila, but behaving like that in front of someone else\u2019s house?It was absurd and ridiculous. It wasn\u2019t something a famous duke would do.If Leila\u2019s house had been a noble mansion with proper formality and structure, it wouldn\u2019t have been possible for something like that to happen.Kalian was very upset because it seemed to be his fault for not giving her a proper house from the beginning.[What should I do?]In his mind, he wanted to get him out right away, but he swallowed it because if he did that, he would find out that he was monitoring her.Kalian thought for a moment, then told him to call the guards.He didn\u2019t forget to tell him to keep his eyes on Philen.The report ended there.Kalian looked at the messenger bird, whose spring had been completely stopped, and spoke out abruptly.\u201cVer, look for a mansion.\u201d\u201cA mansion?\u201dA mansion all of a sudden?At the sudden remark, Ver tilted his head.\u201cAh, do you want to give it to Sir Thebesa?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKalian continued, putting the messenger bird in the drawer.\u201cIt\u2019s fortunate that Leila is not at home right now, if she had been, it would have been a disaster, so it would be better to prepare in advance.\u201dThat\u2019s right. Ver agreed with Kalian.Even to him, Philen\u2019s obsession with Leila was abnormal.\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll find a proper noble mansion.\u201d\u201cAlso, look for butlers and servants who will take care of the mansion.\u201d\u201cMe? They are the people who will serve Sir Thebesa, wouldn\u2019t it be better to look for them yourself?\u201dIt makes sense.Kalian, who instructed him to do so, asked something else.\u201cHow is the establishment of the child care institution going?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going smoothly. It\u2019s easy to work because Sir Thebesa organized the data so meticulously.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dKalian smiled proudly as if he was the one who had been praised.Ver looked at him strangely and took out the report about the child care institution from among the reports he had brought and put it down in front of Kalian.\u201cThis is the current progress of the establishment.\u201dKalian looked through the report.As Ver said, it was proceeding without any problems. If this continued, the agenda for the child care institution would be passed within a month.If there\u2019s anything I\u2019m worried about\u2026\u201cThe temple won\u2019t stay still.\u201dUntil now, the temple had been in charge of caring for orphans.In return, the imperial family gave a huge donation to the temple.However, once the child care institution was established, all the orphans would go there. There was no need to give donations to the temple anymore.If they realized that they would lose the donation, there\u2019s no way the temple would stay still.\u201cThat is something I\u2019m concerned about too, but I think it would be better to keep an eye on the situation first. It\u2019s not too late to check how it turns out from the temple side and move.\u201dKalian nodded.\u201cWe should do that. It looks like Leila will be back soon, so let\u2019s discuss it as soon as she comes back.\u201d\u201cI wanted to finish it before Sir Thebesa came back, but it\u2019s not easy.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s a new agenda that was passed to you. Of course.\u201dTok tok-Knocks were heard and Rahel informed him that it was from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u201cI guess he\u2019s going to report about the diplomatic meeting with the Natsha Kingdom.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dHiltine had already reported it, but it didn\u2019t hurt hearing it again.There might be something Hiltine missed.\u201cThen I will get going now.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget to look for a mansion.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got it in my head.\u201dIn a playful response, Ver left the office.When Ver saw the official standing outside, he bowed his head lightly to greet him.But the official neatly ignored him and went into the office.\u201cHow rude.\u201dVer lightly clicked his tongue and returned to his office.He was welcomed by an empty office with no one in it.Ver\u2019s gaze naturally turned to Leila\u2019s desk.He had been using this large office alone for several years, and he had only been using it with Leila for only a month. But he felt her absence greatly. A corner of his heart felt empty.Is it because there\u2019s less work to be done and then more to do?\u201c\u2026it seems like that.\u201dOther than that, there\u2019s no reason to feel this way.Because it was convenient in many ways when Leila was there.He didn\u2019t have to work overtime, and they could think about work together and share their opinions.\u2026and unlike other nobles, she didn\u2019t ignore him.Now, it had been over two weeks since Leila had been away.\u201cI hope you come back soon.\u201dHe missed Leila as if it had been two months.*****I didn\u2019t attend the meeting after that, but I kept hearing about how it was going.It\u2019s from Diane though, not from the nobles of the same Empire.I couldn\u2019t believe I heard the news from a diplomat from another country. It was embarrassing.I was curious about how things were going, so I continued to hear the news from her despite my embarrassment.When I attended the diplomatic meeting, everyone was acting like a fool, so I was a little worried, but fortunately, the diplomatic meeting was going smoothly.Still, a diplomat was a diplomat, huh?It was fortunate, but I was annoyed for other reasons.\u201cSir Thebesa, think carefully.\u201dIt was because the nobles were annoying.\u201cThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the face of the empire. But what would happen to the image of the empire if rumor spread that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn\u2019t do its job properly in the meeting with other countries? It\u2019s going to fall right away!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s why, about what Sir did at the meeting, we wanted you to keep it a secret\u2026\u201dEven if there\u2019s a good reason, I was annoyed when they said such nonsense in a situation where they would feel annoyed by it too.I held back what I wanted to shout right now and told them.\u201cI have no intention of doing that, so please go back now.\u201d\u201cAre you worried about your evaluation, Sir?\u201dWhy are you talking about that here?When I looked at him absurdly, the nobleman said, \u201cas expected,\u201d and exclaimed.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, Marquis Valdir had said that he would tell Duke Giltian well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! The Marquis said that he was going to tell the Duke that, thanks to Sir\u2019s help, we were able to lead the meeting successfully!\u201dAha, I was wondering why you were doing your best to persuade me, it turned out Marquis Valdir\u2019s influence was there.It was understandable. He was anxious because the credit seemed to be taken away by a lady, whom he ignored, right?\u201cWe\u2019ll tell the other nobles too! Then everyone will no longer be able to ignore the Lady. Wouldn\u2019t that be a good thing for the Lady too?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a good thing.\u201d\u201cRight? That\u2019s why\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I will refuse.\u201dFor that reason, I didn\u2019t want to pass the credit on to them even more.When I firmly refused, they paused for a moment.They looked into each other\u2019s eyes and then asked me again.\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cI said I refuse.\u201d\u201cHa?\u201dIt was Viscount Malven who said that.He glared at me as if he didn\u2019t like it and said.\u201cDoes the Lady intend to undermine the prestige of the Empire for her personal gain?\u201dDid I become a Lady again instead of Sir?The way they called me was as rude as their personalities.\u201cDoes the Viscount not think his actions like this undermine the prestige of the Empire?\u201d\u201cLady!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything else to say, I\u2019ll go.\u201dI bowed my head to them and turned around.I firmly refused, so I thought they wouldn\u2019t come anymore, but they didn\u2019t.\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for the Lady\u2019s accomplishment. We just want you to be flexible.\u201dThey were more persistent than expected.\u201cIf the Lady concedes just this once, Marquis Valdir will keep remembering this and be grateful for it.\u201dEven if I tried to ignore them and not deal with them, I couldn\u2019t because they kept sticking to me except when I was sleeping and when I went to wash up.There were no exceptions when I ate.They kept talking next to me to the point that I didn\u2019t even know if the meal had gone through their nose or their mouth.If I left them alone, they seemed like they were going to interfere with my tea time with Diane, which would be a while later.That doesn\u2019t make any sense.I let out a small sigh and looked back at the chattering nobles.\u201cOh, do you finally think of hearing us?\u201dYou\u2019re absolutely wrong.\u201cNo way. I turned to say that I firmly refused.\u201d\u201cWe already explained it so well, do you still not understand what we\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cYes. I don\u2019t even have any desire to understand.\u201d\u201cLady Thebesa!\u201d\u201cOnce again, I have no intention of accepting the offer.\u201d\u201cThen, are you going to crush the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 face like this?\u201d\u201cIf you didn\u2019t like it, you should have investigated it properly from the beginning.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to say these words, but they kept saying weird things, so I couldn\u2019t help but say bitter things.At my words, all the nobles frowned.It seemed that their noble pride was cracked.\u201cPlease also tell Marquis Valdir. I won\u2019t change my mind, so stop making any vain efforts anymore.\u201dI emphasized the word \u2018vain effort\u2019 and turned around.This time, they didn\u2019t come after me because their pride was damaged properly.\u201cSir Thebesa.\u201dAs soon as I was relieved by that fact, another person appeared.\u201cMarquis Hutton.\u201dI had no bad feelings toward Marquis Hutton, but since I had just dealt with annoying people, it felt a bit annoying.Of course, I didn\u2019t show it.\u201cI heard that you played a big role in the meeting with the Natsha Kingdom. That\u2019s incredible. It wasn\u2019t an easy job.\u201d\u201cI was just lucky.\u201d\u201cYou need to have skills before luck follows you.\u201dMarquis Hutton smiled with a friendly face and tapped my shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s very reassuring to have a person like Sir as an official of the Empire. Please continue to take care of us in the future as well.\u201dDoes this person recognize me as an official?Except for Kalian and Ver, Marquis Hutton was the first noble to recognize me as an official.I was touched, and I gained confidence that one day I would be able to be recognized by more people.\u201cThank you.\u201dWhen I bowed my head, saying goodbye with overwhelming emotion, Marquis Hutton smiled kindly.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut in an instant, Marquis Hutton suddenly hardened his face and looked around fiercely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Escort knight?\u201dEscort knight out of the blue?I was wondering, but I answered him truthfully first.\u201cNo. I don\u2019t have an escort knight with me.\u201d\u201cReally? Then, did I feel it wrong?\u201dI don\u2019t think so.Marquis Hutton mumbled to himself and talked to me again with a friendly smile.\u201cBy the way, how old is Sir this year?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m 24 years old.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still young. It\u2019s a waste of time to keep sitting still after failing once.\u201dHe was talking about the break-up with Philen.I felt like he was a little nosy, but it was something anyone could say.Because it\u2019s very rare for a 24-year-old noble lady to live alone without getting married.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, can I introduce you to a suitable partner, Sir?\u201d\u2026this is definitely nosy.\u201cI\u2019ll just accept your goodwill.\u201dI didn\u2019t intend to continue living alone, but I also didn\u2019t intend to get married right away.\u201cIf you have nothing more to say, can I take my leave? I have an appointment later.\u201d\u201cOh my. I\u2019ve kept a busy person for too long. Go ahead.\u201d\u201cThank you, Marquis. Then, I\u2019ll get going.\u201dAfter bowing my head to Marquis Hutton, I hurried to my room so I wouldn\u2019t be late for my appointment with Diane.*****Marquis Hutton smacked his lips as he watched Leila getting farther and farther away.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, such a pity.\u201dIt would be great if a child like that came into the family.Other nobles thought it was bad to have a woman, who was too smart, enter the family, but Marquis Hutton was different.The family was peaceful only when a smart woman came in.Especially if you had to leave your family a lot because you had to go to sea like him.Of course, there\u2019s nothing more he could have hoped for if his sons played that role, but unfortunately, that had already failed.His first son was chosen by God early and became a priest, and his second son, Aldor, was a troublemaker every time.He wasn\u2019t a man who was talented enough to rule Hutton, the port city Marquis Hutton had been carefully working on for a long time.Since there\u2019s no one else to inherit the title other than Aldor, he would one day become the Marquis of Hutton and rule Hutton.That\u2019s why Aldor\u2019s wife had to be a smart one like Leila.There\u2019s a rumor about Leila being the emperor\u2019s mistress, but after a few conversations, he knew it for sure.Leila was never the emperor\u2019s mistress.She must have been purely recognized for her ability and became an aide.\u201cAs expected, she\u2019s a talented person.\u201dThe desire to somehow make her Aldor\u2019s spouse arose abruptly.Leila already said no, but he didn\u2019t care.If she didn\u2019t like it, he could make it happen!Just in time, a small banquet would be held tomorrow evening for the reconciliation of the Natsha Kingdom and the Cardin Empire, so he should aim at that time.\u201cWhere\u2019s Aldor now?\u201dMarquis Hutton went straight to Aldor, who would be the protagonist of his plan.*****After the long five-day meeting, the diplomatic meeting was finally over.Marquis Hutton threw a small party to celebrate the successful end of the meeting.I was going to wear a uniform to the party too, but Marquis Hutton sent me a dress.There were also accessories and shoes that matched the dress.\u201cOh, my. What a beautiful dress, My Lady.\u201dEria praised the dress and carefully looked into my mood.Maybe it\u2019s because I had intentionally dirtied my dress before.I did that not because I didn\u2019t want to wear the dress, but because it was a dress sent by Marquis Valdir.I didn\u2019t intend to do that again this time.\u201cI will wear this dress to the dinner party, so please get ready.\u201d\u201cTh, then, can I keep the dress until then?\u201dEria hugged the dress box and asked me as if she didn\u2019t believe me.Such Eria was so cute that it made me laugh.\u201cAs you like.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dOnly then did Eria smile brightly and go outside with the dress.After a while, Eria returned with another maid.She was the maid to help me dress up.\u201cSince My Lady is one of the only two ladies in this party, we\u2019ll make you look beautiful!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! The Viscount from the Natsha Kingdom was also said that she would wear a fancy dress!\u201dIf she\u2019s a Viscount from the Natsha Kingdom, they must be talking about Diane.\u201cViscount Andrian will also wear a dress?\u201d\u201cYes. They said it was a dress with a hollow on the chest and widely open from here.\u201dEria drew a long line from her pelvis to her ankle.Such a dress exists, huh? It\u2019s amazing.I really wanted to see what kind of dress it was.\u201cMy Lady, the bath is ready.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dAfter washing me with warm water, they applied perfume to my body.It was my favorite rose scent.In the meantime, Eria brought back the dress she had kept carefully.\u201cIf she comes out with an alluring image over there, we go with an elegant image.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019m happy that the dress that Marquis Hutton gave you is just that kind of image!\u201d\u201cShould I put your hair up neatly?\u201dLooking at the chattering maids reminded me of the maids of the Duke of Williot.I wondered if everyone was doing well.I missed them all, but I especially missed Misa, who took care of me since I joined the duke\u2019s family.Should I send her a letter later?There\u2019s nothing good about being caught by Philen, so I\u2019d have to send it off secretly.\u201cI\u2019ll tighten the corset, My Lady.\u201dAt the maid\u2019s words, I put strength in my stomach and held my breath.The maids tightened the corset and put on the underskirt. Then I wore the dress that Marquis Hutton gave me as a gift.It was a blue dress similar to the dress Marquis Valdir gave me. The hem of the dress was covered with sapphires.The sapphire reminded me of the Blue Marine, something that I bought as a gift for Kalian before.\u201cEria, do you know a jewel called Blue Marine?\u201d\u201cBlue Marine?\u201dEria tilted her head. Even the other maid didn\u2019t seem to know.Hmm, is Blue Marine not its original name?\u201cI mean this.\u201dI took out the cufflinks that were in my bag and showed them to the maids.\u201cAh, I know this.\u201dOnly then did the maids respond.\u201cI also have a lot of this in my house. My younger siblings went to the beach to play and they picked up a lot because they thought it was pretty.\u201d\u201cI have a lot in my house, too.\u201dThat meant that this wasn\u2019t a jewel.Can I give this to His Majesty?I was happy to find a gift that matched him, but my heart became heavy again.As I silently fiddled with the button, Eria hurriedly added.\u201cBu, but I\u2019ve never seen such a well-processed product!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! The stones rolling around in my house don\u2019t shine like this!\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a stone, this is a jewel!\u201dI was thankful that they comforted me.Right, let\u2019s think about this later.It wasn\u2019t a problem that could be answered even if I thought about it until I had a headache right now.I put the cufflinks back in the bag and continued to prepare myself.As they said, my hair was pulled up high and secured with hairpins.\u201cHow about the necklace and earrings?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dAlthough Marquis Valdir gave me something\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to wear it.After thinking for a while, I took the spirit stone necklace out of my bag.\u201cI don\u2019t need earrings, but I\u2019ll use this for the necklace.\u201d\u201cWhat a pretty necklace. I understand, My Lady.\u201dI was wearing the necklace while seeing myself in the mirror when I heard a knock.Tok. tok.Who came?I blinked at Eria to open the door.When Eria opened the door, she saw Aldor, who was dressed neatly.Why is this man here again?\u201cFor what purpose are you here?\u201dAldor said, holding out a bouquet of roses.\u201cI\u2019m here to escort you, Sir.\u201dYou had said that before and you come here to escort me again?Does he have no pride? Or is he shameless?\u201cI will decline.\u201d\u201cBut my father told me to come with you.\u201dHaa, even Marquis Hutton meddled, huh?A sigh came out automatically. I could guess what Marquis Hutton was thinking when he did this.He\u2019s trying to tie me up with Aldor, right?I should have known from the moment he brought up the word of introducing me to a good person.But is Aldor a good person?I don\u2019t think so at all.\u201cOnce again, I will decline the escort.\u201d\u201cBut Sir\u2026\u201dI refused again and again, and so him hanging on continuously looked lame and indecent.Does this man have no pride?Or is there another purpose?\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going. I still have a lot to prepare.\u201dWhatever it was, none of it was my business.I ignored Aldor\u2019s words and closed the door again.Then I told the maids who were restless while looking at my mood to finish the preparation and checked outside.Fortunately, Aldor wasn\u2019t there when everything was ready and I came back out.Instead, there\u2019s only a bouquet of roses that he had left behind in front of the door.I ignored the bouquet and headed straight to the main hall alone.\u201cSir Thebesa!\u201dI met Diane on the way.She was wearing a dress I had heard of.It was a really unique dress. In particular, it was impressive that one side of the skirt was torn to the point her bare skin could be seen.Diane looked through me and gave me a thumbs up.\u201cWow, you look so pretty today. As a woman, I\u2019ll fall for you too.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the same with Sir Andrian. I\u2019ve never seen such a unique dress.\u201d\u201cRight? It\u2019s a very unique dress, isn\u2019t it?\u201dWhen Diane spun around, her torn skirt fluttered, revealing her bare skin.\u201cS, Sir!\u201dWhat if someone sees her like that?I panicked and covered Diane\u2019s legs.Then Diane laughed out loud.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so flustered. This dress was originally made for that purpose.\u201d\u201cIs, is that so?\u201d\u201cOf course. Well, no one will fall for an unattractive woman like me after all.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about\u2026 Sir is so attractive, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d\u201cOh my gosh, it feels good to hear that from a very attractive lady.\u201dDiane gave me a wink.We talked and headed to the hall of the main building together.\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll give you a dress similar to this one.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m grateful, but I don\u2019t think it would suit me.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? I think it\u2019ll suit you better than me.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dDiane nodded bigly and spoke in a voice only I could hear.\u201cSir has a better figure than me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIs it because the one who said it is a woman?Or is it because Diane\u2019s words didn\u2019t feel strange to me?Although I was embarrassed by her words, I didn\u2019t feel insulted.As I blushed and waved my hand, Diane laughed out loud.While we were chatting about this and that, we arrived at the main hall.The chandelier\u2019s light was reflected on the clean marble and sparkled like stars.On one side of the hall, a small band was playing music, and in the center, fancy-dressed people gathered in twos and threes and chatted.Marquis Hutton put in a lot of effort, doesn\u2019t he?Well, it\u2019s only natural because the diplomatic missions from the other country were here.\u201cOh, Sir Thebesa is here.\u201dMarquis Hutton approached with a pleasant smile.He greeted Diane lightly and then looked around me.\u201cWhy are you alone? Didn\u2019t Aldor go to escort you?\u201d\u201cHe came, but I refused.\u201dMarquis Hutton\u2019s expression hardened slightly.\u201cWhy did you refuse? Has my son perhaps done something rude to Sir again?\u201dWhat to do? I can\u2019t directly say that I refused because I didn\u2019t like it.\u201cIt\u2019s because I applied for an escort to Lady Thebesa first.\u201dWhen I was contemplating, Diane interrupted the conversation with a smile.\u201cI think she refused because she already had a prior appointment with me. I\u2019m sorry, Marquis.\u201d\u201cHmm, there\u2019s no need. If there\u2019s a prior appointment, there\u2019s nothing she could do.\u201dThanks to Diane, I was able to get through the difficult situation flexibly.I said thank you to Diane through my eyes.Then Diane responded with a wink.She was really a pleasant fellow.That\u2019s why I liked Diane even more. I wanted to emulate her cheerful personality.\u201cThen let\u2019s do this.\u201dAfter thinking for a moment, Marquis Hutton smiled brightly again.\u201cYou can have the first dance with Aldor.\u201dUsually, the first dance was performed with someone closely related, such as a family member or lover.But first dance with Aldor?It was absurd and disconcerting.I wanted to refuse, but it was difficult because I had already rejected Aldor\u2019s escort. Not once, but twice, and it was an insult to the other person if I refused again.There\u2019s nothing good for me to insult Marquis Hutton\u2019s son.But I didn\u2019t want to dance, so what should I do?\u201cSir Thebesa seems to dislike dancing with Lord Hutton.\u201d\u201cLa, Lady!\u201dAs Diane spoke my mind, I hurriedly stopped her and looked at Marquis Hutton.His expression looked worse than before.Of course, he would be like that. Because no one liked to hear this.\u201cIs what Sir Andrian said true?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can tell the truth. I\u2019m not forcing you.\u201dBack when I had breakfast for the first time with Kalian, I heard a similar thing from Baron Delrond.\u2018If you don\u2019t want to eat, you don\u2019t have to eat it.\u2019\u2018I\u2019m not forcing you.\u2019At the time, I really was unsure, but I seemed to know for sure now.This was definitely a compulsion.If the Marquis forced me to, I, a count\u2019s daughter, could still refuse. Because I was the emperor\u2019s agent now, but it\u2019s ridiculous if I asserted that position in such a private matter.There\u2019s nothing I could do. I smiled bitterly and accepted Marquis Hutton\u2019s suggestion.\u201c\u2026no. Of course, I should dance with Lord Hutton.\u201d\u201cHo ho. Well thought.\u201dMarquis Hutton then left with a satisfied smile.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201dDiane frowned and looked at me.\u201cDidn\u2019t you not like to dance with that guy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s just that I was unwilling.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201dDiane hit her chest as if she was very frustrated.\u201cGo now and tell him you don\u2019t want to dance with him.\u201d\u201cHow can I do that? When the opponent is the Marquis.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but the Lady is the Emperor\u2019s lover!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRight now\u2026 what did Diane say?I\u2019m the emperor\u2019s lover?Her words were like saying that I was his lover and not his mistress.The person concerned was in front of her and she just said it after making it more gentle.I didn\u2019t expect I would hear that thing from Diane\u2019s mouth.It was more embarrassing and shameful than when I heard that thing from other people.I blushed and stepped back from Diane.\u201cSir Thebesa?\u201dDiane called me as if she was wondering.I said without looking directly at Diane\u2019s face.\u201cI don\u2019t know why Sir Andrian has such a misunderstanding, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m simply an aide to the Emperor.\u201dIs Diane being kind to me because she thought I was the emperor\u2019s mistress?Thinking like that made my mouth feel bitter and I had mixed feelings about it.I thought I had a good friend with whom I could talk well, but I guessed it was all my delusion.\u201cI\u2019m going to others now. Have a great party, Sir Andrian.\u201d\u201cHold on, Sir\u2026!\u201dI left Diane and headed to the place where the nobles of the Empire gathered with Marquis Valdir in the center.As I approached, Marquis Valdir looked at me with a vigilant look.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just\u2026 thinking of greeting you.\u201d\u201cAre you pretending to be polite now? It\u2019s not even funny.\u201dMarquis Valdir snorted and turned his back.And so did the other nobles.Since I didn\u2019t have any business with them in the first place, I stood calmly and drank the champagne brought by the servant.I could feel Diane\u2019s gaze behind my back, but I tried my best to ignore it.To be honest, Diane didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Because rumor that I was the emperor\u2019s mistress, not an aide, had spread widely throughout the empire. Maybe she heard that rumor and thought I was the emperor\u2019s mistress.I knew that, but it\u2019s still awkward to see Diane. It seemed like I couldn\u2019t treat her with a smile like before.Am I losing such a good conversation partner?\u201cHuu.\u201dI sighed endlessly. Everyone was having a good time, but I couldn\u2019t.I kept drinking the champagne out of frustration.It was champagne with little alcohol, but as I kept drinking it, I got a little drunk.It wasn\u2019t to the point where I couldn\u2019t control myself, it\u2019s just to the extent that I felt like I was drinking.Someone said they feel better when they get drunk, but it was all a lie. I felt down instead.\u201cLady Thebesa, would you like to dance a song with me?\u201dThe fact that I had to dance with Aldor in such a situation made me feel terrible.\u201cGladly.\u201dAldor\u2019s expression brightened at my answer.He also seemed to be a little conceited.As Aldor and I came out to the center of the hall, the people who were occupying it naturally moved aside.It would have been difficult if it wasn\u2019t a waltz, but fortunately, the song that played was a waltz.Still, I was nervous. It\u2019s because I had never danced with anyone other than the dance teacher and Philen.I have to do well.I didn\u2019t want to become a laughing stock by making mistakes such as stepping on his foot for no reason.And so I moved my body mechanically to the sound of the music.As I danced without looking at Aldor, my surroundings naturally caught my eye.Marquis Hutton looked at this side with a happy smile. While Marquis Valdir and the nobles of the Empire looked dissatisfied.Then I saw the diplomats of the Natsha Kingdom talking without paying any attention to me.I also saw Diane looking for a chance to talk to me somehow.The music got faster and faster. I moved away from Aldor for a while, and then back to him again.\u201cYou\u2019re good at dancing.\u201dI was praised, but I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut.\u201cThank you. The Lord is also good at dancing.\u201d\u201cWell, because this is my specialty.\u201dI was just saying it, but he bit it.As I spat out a small laugh because I was speechless, Aldor grinned and pulled himself closer to me.Due to the nature of the waltz, both bodies often stuck to each other, but\u2026 it seemed that this was too close.I thought it was a mistake, so I pulled myself away, but I was pulled to him again.Because of that, I could feel something that I didn\u2019t have, but Aldor had.What bizarre thing is this?I frowned and looked at Aldor.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dAldor replied skillfully.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dThis man is really\u2026I was about to say something, but the music ended.I immediately pulled myself away from Aldor.There were many things I wanted to say to him, but\u2026 let\u2019s just not do it.Now that the dance was over, there was no need to be close to him or talk to him anymore, so what should I do?I didn\u2019t want to get involved with Aldor any further by talking needlessly.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going.\u201dI said goodbye and went straight to the corner, but for some reason, Aldor followed me.\u201cDo you still have something to do with me?\u201d\u201cThere is always something to do with a beautiful lady.\u201dSuch greasy words with a lot of butter covered on it.I already stared at him coldly and turned down the escort twice, but he kept sticking around to me like this.Only his tenacity is uselessly good, huh?\u201cI want to rest alone. Why don\u2019t you go to someone else?\u201dI expressed my wish for him to go.But he stood there naturally, whether he was tactless or pretending not to know on purpose.\u201cAfter dancing, I feel thirsty. You, there!\u201dAldor was given two glasses of champagne by the servant and held one of them to me.\u201cYou\u2019ll be thirsty, so drink it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dI, too, was thirsty, but I refused because I didn\u2019t want any favors from him.Then Aldor said as if he was disappointed.\u201cFor the last time, let\u2019s drink the champagne and I\u2019ll go.\u201dReally?Looking at him suspiciously, Aldor nodded.\u201cIt really is. I won\u2019t bother the Lady anymore. I also don\u2019t want to cling to a lady who is not interested in me.\u201dAldor complained, saying it was because of his father\u2019s order.With that said, I glanced at Marquis Hutton.Marquis Hutton looked at us from time to time while talking to the other nobles, smiling happily.\u201cIf my relationship with the Lady doesn\u2019t progress even after we danced and drank champagne together, my father will probably give up, right?\u201dAldor looked at Marquis Hutton and spoke to me in a low voice.\u201cThat\u2019s why please help me only this once, Sir Thebesa.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still, the fruity scent was strong enough for me to drink it.I wanted to drink it quickly and send Aldor away, but it was against the etiquette, so I had no choice but to drink it little by little.\u201cOh, by the way, I heard an interesting rumor about the Lady.\u201dAs the champagne was almost finished, Aldor suddenly brought up an unpleasant story.I replied before he could tell exactly what the rumor was.\u201cNo.\u201dAldor then chuckled.\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything yet.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the rumor of me being the Emperor\u2019s mistress, right?\u201d\u201cOh my, you\u2019re quick to sense.\u201dWasn\u2019t it stupid to not know when everyone was talking about it?\u201cBut, is it really not?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really not.\u201d\u201cHmm, I see.\u201dAldor looked at me with curious eyes. I ignored him and concentrated on drinking the champagne.At last, the champagne was finished. I showed Aldor the empty champagne glass.\u201cI drank it all.\u201dTherefore, it was a tacit expression of intention for him to go away.As if he wasn\u2019t that slow-witted at all, Aldor looked disappointed and quietly retreated.I was finally alone. I sighed heavily and leaned against the wall.I already drank a whole glass of champagne, but I was still thirsty.\u201cHere.\u201dI handed the servant the empty glass, took a new one, and drank it all at once.There\u2019s no one around me, so there\u2019s no need to be polite.After drinking two or three more glasses, the drunkenness that had subsided while dancing rose again.I felt a little shaky and my head felt dizzy. My body became hot and I felt tipsy.Am I so weak in drinking?I had never drunk this much alcohol before until now, so I never knew.Now that I knew how much I could drink, I had to be careful next time.More than that, I wanted to go back to my room and rest, but was that okay? The party wasn\u2019t over yet, but there\u2019s nothing more to do.Let\u2019s go back.It\u2019s better to do that than to hold on and then get drunk and make a fool of myself.If I went straight out the front door, people would notice me, so I sneaked out through the back door. It was good because this way was close to the annex too.When I came out, the slightly muggy wind blew with a salty smell.In the distance, I could see the sparkling sea with stars.\u201cBeautiful.\u201dIt had a different charm than seeing it during the day. It also felt different from looking from my room.With such a nice view, I couldn\u2019t go back to my room. So, I stood there for a moment and watched the beautiful night sea.As time passed, drunkenness grew more and more.Every breath I took seemed to smell like alcohol.I\u2019m getting sleepy, so I really have to go now.As I turned around, my legs lost strength and I staggered slightly.\u201cMiss?\u201dIn all likelihood, I was caught by a servant passing by.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201dI answered honestly without holding on to my pride.It\u2019s better to be humiliated by one person than to be humiliated by more people for nothing.The worst scenario was to be seen by Marquis Valdir and his remnants.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you help me to my room?\u201dBefore that happened, I asked the servant for help because I wanted to return to my room quickly.\u201cOf course, Miss.\u201dThe servant came and supported me.I left my body immobile at will and headed to the annex.On the way, as I was getting drunk, I fell asleep.I can\u2019t sleep here.I tried to endure it somehow, but I couldn\u2019t overcome the pouring sleepiness, so my memories were sparsely cut off.While I was sleeping and waking up repeatedly, I felt a soft touch on my back.It looked like I had finally returned to my room.The corset that tightened my waist and the accessories I was wearing were uncomfortable to sleep on, but sleeping was my priority.\u201cThank\u2026 you.\u201dI said to the servant briefly and accepted the flood of sleep pouring onto me.*****Hiltine\u2019s routine was simple.When Leila slept, he slept with her, when she ate, he ate with her, and wherever she went, he followed her.But after Leila entered the Marquis of Hutton, it was often difficult to do so. That was when Marquis Hutton was near Leila.As he was the commander-in-chief of the Navy, Marquis Hutton was not an easy one. Even with a little carelessness, he could read the signs.In that regard, he seemed to be one step ahead of Philen.Hiltine\u2019s mission was to protect Leila secretly without being noticed by anyone. So Hiltine had to keep a certain distance whenever Marquis Hutton appeared.It would make it a little difficult to protect Leila if something happened, but he couldn\u2019t help it. Because it\u2019s better than to be seen by Marquis Hutton.That was why the Marquis of Hutton was like the Impregnable Fortress. Since no one here dared to go big enough to harm Leila here, it could have looked rather pathetic.Today too, because of Marquis Hutton, Hiltine was unable to protect Leila as usual and sat on the roof of the mansion. But that didn\u2019t mean that he was just playing.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s like that.\u201dIt\u2019s just in time for daily reporting. Using the magic messenger bird, he reported what had happened today to Kalian.As soon as Hiltine finished, Kalian asked.[\u2026so, you\u2019re saying that Marquis Hutton\u2019s second son is after Leila?]\u201cI don\u2019t know if he is after her, but I\u2019m sure he is interested in her. Because he had come to escort her twice.\u201d[It means he hit on her twice.]For some reason, there\u2019s a hint of murderous intent in Kalian\u2019s voice.It\u2019s common for a noble lord to ask for an escort to a lady, but why is he reacting like this?Hiltine didn\u2019t understand, but he didn\u2019t question it deeply as he thought that he certainly had a reason.[If that guy tries to do strange things to Leila, make him can\u2019t do his role as a man.]\u201cWhat kind of strange things?\u201d[Everything that Leila hates.]Now that he said it, it felt like something was wrong, so Kalian corrected it right away.[I should correct it. Touching Leila\u2019s body without her permission.]\u201cI understand.\u201dEveryone who touched Leila without her permission is suspicious.Hiltine entered Kalian\u2019s command precisely in his head.[Is Leila still at the party?]Hiltine kept watching the entrance to the main building while reporting to Kalian and he didn\u2019t see Leila come out.\u201cYes.\u201d[The party is quite long huh?]Is it? It\u2019s only been an hour though.[It will be difficult because of Marquis Hutton, but keep your eyes on Leila as much as possible.]\u201cI understand.\u201dThe conversation ended there.Hiltine put the magic messenger bird in his pocket and jumped off the roof. He was going to make sure Leila was safe.Using the darkness as a cover to avoid people\u2019s eyes, Hiltine slowly approached the window of the main hall and looked inside.He could see people laughing and chatting, enjoying the party with the frantic music. But no matter how much he looked around, he couldn\u2019t see Leila.It was the same no matter how many times he confirmed it.Did she go to the toilet? Or the lounge?If not that, did she go back to the annex without me seeing her?It hadn\u2019t been a few minutes since he was told to keep his eyes on Leila by Kalian, but he had already lost sight of her.He became anxious. Hiltine moved quickly to find Leila.*****As I was sleeping for a while, someone grabbed my arm.Who is it? Is it Eria?Does she know that I was back and come to help me change?Anyway, it\u2019s good. Because the dress is uncomfortable.I said to Eria, half-asleep.\u201cJust take off my dress and the corset. Ah, and the accessories\u2026\u201dSince you don\u2019t have to take anything else off\u2026I couldn\u2019t speak properly because I was sleepy and drunk.\u201cPfft.\u201dI was mumbling as if talking to myself, and the other person laughed a little.\u2026this laugh isn\u2019t Eria\u2019s though?Come to think of it, the hand holding my arm was also larger than that of Eria.Someone other than Eria?I got goosebumps from my toes.As if being poured cold water, I woke up and was not sleepy anymore.\u201cLET GO, LET ME GO!\u201dI shouted sharply and shook off the hand that was holding my arm.I tried to get up right away, but my drunken body didn\u2019t move as I wanted.All I could do was pull my body back a little.I turned my head to see who it was, but my surroundings were dark. What I could only see was a blurry silhouette.When I focused only on the silhouette, it was definitely not a woman.\u201cWho, who are you?\u201dI curled up and stared at the person who was looking at me silently.\u201cWho are you to come into my room at this late hour?\u201d\u201cThis is not the Lady\u2019s room.\u201dThis voice\u2026\u201cLord\u2026 Hutton?\u201dAs my eyes gradually adapted to the darkness, I could see him.A greasy look and a mean smile.It really was Aldor.\u201cWhy are you here\u2026 No, more than that, this isn\u2019t my room?\u201d\u201cYes. This is my room.\u201dImpossible\u2026I hurriedly looked around. It was still dark, so I couldn\u2019t see well, but I could tell that this wasn\u2019t my room.Everything was different, the furniture arrangement and the bed I was lying on.Why am I here?I certainly asked the servant to take me to my room.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt was strange and absurd, but it must be the same for Aldor. So, rather than making excuses, I apologized first.\u201cThe servant who should be taking me to my room seemed to have misunderstood something. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\u201cWell, you shouldn\u2019t be sorry.\u201dThe corner of his lips was slightly raised, and it was terrifying. His eyes flashing in the dark looked dangerous.I felt like I had to run away, so I pulled myself back a little more.\u201cUgh!\u201dAs a result, I fell down the bed.I felt a sharp pain on my bottom that hit the floor, but thanks to it, it made me a little sober. I was able to move more freely than before.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get\u2026\u201dAs I was about to leave, Aldor approached me and pulled my arm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let go of me right now!\u201dAs I tried to shake his hand away, Aldor threw me on the floor and climbed on top of me.The pain in my back and the weight pressing down on me made me suffocate. The view became dimmed.\u201cMove away from me\u2026 right now.\u201d\u201cWhy should I do that?\u201d\u201cLord Hutton!\u201d\u201cIn a situation like this, rather than calling me Lord Hutton stiffly, you should have called me Aldor affectionately.\u201dWhat a ridiculous thing to say.Not even worthy of a reply, I tried to push him away, but he didn\u2019t budge like a giant prop.Of course, he\u2019s a man and a navy. Physically, he was far superior to me.\u201cPlease move away from me, Lord.\u201dI threw my pride and begged him to move away somehow, but he didn\u2019t listen to me.Jjiig-\u201cKkyaag!\u201dThe weak hem of the dress was ripped open by his violent force.My shoulder, exposed to the cold air, trembled. If it had been ripped a little more, my chest would have been clearly visible.I quickly covered my exposed shoulder.My face grew hot with shame, embarrassment, and fear of what might happen. My tears were about to fall.I can\u2019t cry. I don\u2019t want to cry in front of a man like this.I mercilessly bit the soft flesh in my mouth, holding back my tears.\u201cThat face, it\u2019s nice to see it.\u201dHis hot breath and damp tongue swept through the pinna of my ear.\u201cI want to see a more dizzying side of you than now, can you show me?\u201dHis hand reached the bottom of my skirt and groped my leg.\u201cI, I am the Emperor\u2019s agent!\u201dI grabbed his arm that was groping my leg and shouted anxiously.\u201cDoes the Lord think he would be safe after doing this to me?\u201d\u201cPfft.\u201dWhy\u2026 is he laughing?\u201cAre you going to tell His Majesty what happened here?\u201d\u201cOf, of course\u2026\u201d\u201cThen the Lady won\u2019t be able to work as that great aide anymore.\u201d\u2026what?\u201cThink about it, Lady. Would His Majesty want to keep a damaged lady by his side?\u201dI was speechless. I couldn\u2019t confidently say that he was wrong because what he said was true.It was for this reason that in the past, even though Countess Thebesa was displeased, she refused to do anything about what had happened between me and Andante. Because a noble lady with flaws couldn\u2019t be put on the wedding market.So, even though it was buried, it still remained a great fear in my heart.\u201cBesides, does the Lady think His Majesty will believe you?\u201d\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll believe you?\u201dSuddenly, Andante\u2019s voice was heard, and the harsh and ruthless event of that day came to mind. My body hardened.\u201cIf you want to tell him, tell him then.\u201dAldor said, rubbing his dirty lips onto my hand that grabbed his arm.\u201cBut His Majesty would believe me and my father more than the Lady.\u201dHis confident face was just like Andante\u2019s.Andante said this with a face like that.There\u2019s no way they would believe me. And of course, they would believe him.I thought it wouldn\u2019t be possible, but it was all just as Andante said.People didn\u2019t believe me. It was no use crying out that it wasn\u2019t me.Everyone believed only Andante\u2019s words and pointed at me, saying that I was an unchaste and shameless woman.If it was His Majesty, would he\u2026 would he believe only Aldor\u2019s words, not mine?Since I had already experienced something similar once, my doubts grew bigger and bigger like snowballs.Thinking that Kalian would do that, I lost all my strength and became lethargic. Unbearable tears poured down.\u201cOh my, I haven\u2019t even started yet, so you shouldn\u2019t cry already.\u201dAldor smiled fishily and wiped away the tears running down my cheeks.I turned my head to reject his hand and saw a long blue necklace hanging down.The spirit stone necklace that Kalian gave me as a gift before.\u201cLeila.\u201d\u201cI think you can do it well enough.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how much I trust you.\u201dAh, what was I thinking now?His Majesty said he would trust me, and I couldn\u2019t believe I doubted him.What greater disloyalty could there be than this?If I saw him, I would definitely apologize for this.Before I knew it, the hand that was stroking my leg reached up to my thigh.It was a creepy touch like a snake crawling up.A little while ago, I had no idea how to get out of this situation, but not now.A certain way came to mind.I squeezed all the strength I had to push him away, then grabbed the necklace tightly.\u201cConversion!\u201dWhen I shouted the starter word, my arm holding the necklace became as thick as the arm of the orc.POK-!I swung that arm as hard as I could.It\u2019s not just a part of my body that changed, but it\u2019s also getting stronger.The moment Aldor, who flew away so badly, collided with the wardrobe\u2026BANG-!Someone slammed the door roughly and came in.\u201cSir Thebesa!\u201dOne was Diane.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd the other one was Hiltine.*****\u201cYoung master has entered the room.\u201dAt the servant\u2019s report, Marquis Hutton smiled contentedly and drank champagne.It was all Marquis Hutton\u2019s plan to feed Leila with high alcohol champagne through Aldor and send her to Aldor\u2019s room.A plan to make Leila Aldor\u2019s wife.It took a little while because Leila was the emperor\u2019s agent, but he had perfectly prepared the countermeasures for that. So nothing was a problem. All that was left was for Aldor and Leila to spend the night successfully.\u201cReport to me as soon as Aldor comes out.\u201dMarquis Hutton told his servant again and again and enjoyed the party leisurely.In his head, he happily thought when it would be a good time to hold a wedding.If they got married, he wouldn\u2019t let her work as the emperor\u2019s aide anymore. Because there\u2019s nothing good about a woman working outside.It was when Marquis Hutton emptied about two glasses of champagne.\u201cMa, Master!\u201dThe servant came running panting and puffing.At the servant\u2019s unusual behavior, Marquis Hutton looked at the servant with a frown.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cBig, big problem has occurred!\u201dThe servant shouted urgently, unable to catch his breath properly.\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s knight appears and says he will punish Young master Aldor!\u201d\u201cWhat? Punish?!\u201dWhat kind of ridiculous thing is this?No, more than that, the Emperor\u2019s knight?At those words, Marquis Hutton was reminded of the Crowd Knights. The merciless, infamous knights who work only for the Emperor of the Empire.Don\u2019t tell me that they are here?It can\u2019t be. Because there was no member of the Crowd Knights on the delegation list.However, what bothered him was the strange presence he felt every time he met Leila.Was\u2026 the Crowd Knights secretly escorting Leila?A bad feeling ran down his spine.\u201cLead the way right now!\u201dMarquis Hutton ran straight to Aldor\u2019s room where they were.The front of Aldor\u2019s room was already crowded with people who had heard the news.They stepped aside as Marquis Hutton approached.\u201cFather!\u201dAldor, who found Marquis Hutton, called him desperately.Marquis Hutton glanced dissatisfiedly at Aldor, who was sitting unsightly on the floor, then looked at Hiltine standing next to him.He already thought that a member of the Crowd Knights might be here, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be its leader, Hiltine.Is she really not the emperor\u2019s mistress?Unless the Emperor was crazy, there would be no way that he would attach a knight leader to escort a single aide.If Leila was really the emperor\u2019s mistress, things got complicated.He had an ominous feeling that it would be really complicated, but the water had already spilled. There was no turning back.Marquis Hutton was flustered by the completely unexpected situation, but he pretended not to be at all.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but will you release my son first?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s more important to understand the situation first than to ask for your son to be released, Marquis?\u201dA sharp voice was heard from inside the room.It was Diane.Next to Diane was Leila with a blanket wrapped around her shoulders.When Leila met Marquis Hutton\u2019s eyes, she was startled and averted her gaze. Her hunched shoulders trembled.Judging by Leila\u2019s reaction, it seemed like it would be possible to bury this case if he did well.Although Diane and Hiltine were annoying, one was a foreign noble and the other was a commoner known for being mute. So Marquis Hutton, who decided that only Leila should be coaxed well, said to the butler.\u201cTake everyone off here.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201dWhen the butler made everyone leave, Marquis Hutton closed the door and approached Leila.\u201cOh my, I haven\u2019t looked into it thoroughly. If you don\u2019t mind, could you tell me what happened, Sir Thebesa?\u201dInstead of answering, Leila crouched down, clutching the blanket she was wearing.Diane shouted as she stopped in front of Leila.\u201cSir Thebesa is still in a state of shock, unable to speak properly. So you can ask Lord Hutton over there about the situation, Marquis.\u201dYou impudent, how dare you meddle in someone\u2019s business?Marquis Hutton didn\u2019t like Diane very much when he first saw her.If she had been a noble of the empire rather than a noble of another country, he would have given her a scolding.However, as a noble from another country, there was no benefit to him in the current situation, so Marquis Hutton stepped down quietly.\u201cMy mistake. This is the first time something like this has happened, so please understand.\u201dMarquis Hutton emphasized the word \u2018first time\u2019, then looked at Aldor.\u201cAldor, what happened?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m innocent, father!\u201dAldor made excuses as if he had been waiting.\u201cI came back to my room in the middle of the party, and Lady Thebesa is lying on my bed!\u201dAldor glared at Leila with bloodshot eyes and continued.\u201cBut, of course, I knew she did that because she wanted to get along well with me, but the Lady suddenly pretended to be a victim and accused me of being a molester!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I couldn\u2019t stand still like a fool and be beaten.\u201c\u2026I definitely said no to Lord Hutton.\u201dI said, squeezing out a voice that didn\u2019t come out well forcibly.\u201cI\u2019ve told him again and again that he shouldn\u2019t do this. But Lord Hutton ignored my words and tried to do it against my will.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s lying!\u201dAldor immediately refuted my words.\u201cIf Lady Thebesa didn\u2019t want to do that with me, there\u2019s no reason for her to lie in my bed, in my room!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dMarquis Hutton nodded, listening to Aldor rather than me.Marquis Hutton\u2019s behavior was not surprising. Because it was natural for his arms to bend inward.[T/N: the arms bend inward means that you are more affectionate to people close to you than to people you don\u2019t know.]\u201cDid Sir Thebesa really lie in that man\u2019s bed first?\u201dI nodded to Diane\u2019s question.\u201cLook at that! I told you Lady Thebesa seduced me first!\u201dThen Aldor exclaimed triumphantly.Everyone\u2019s eyes fell on me.It was obvious what would happen next.Everyone would look at me with contempt, just as the people of the Count of Thebesa did in the past. No matter what I said, they wouldn\u2019t believe it.Of course, I already thought they would also\u2026\u201cThere must be some misunderstanding.\u201dDiane\u2019s subsequent attitude was completely beyond my expectations.\u201cSir Thebesa wouldn\u2019t have done something like seducing Lord Hutton!\u201dEven after hearing that\u2026 she still trusts me?I was stunned, rather than happy.I stared at Diane blankly and Diane grabbed my shoulder and asked.\u201cAm I right, Sir Thebesa? There\u2019s another reason, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201dThanks to Diane\u2019s trust in me, I was able to talk more easily.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my will that I came to this room. The servant brought me here because I was drunk.\u201d\u201cEven so, it is true that Sir Thebesa was lying on my son\u2019s bed first.\u201dMarquis Hutton suddenly intervened.\u201cSo it\u2019s only natural for Aldor to be misunderstood.\u201dNatural? Such nonsense.\u201cI already told Lord Hutton that there was definitely some misunderstanding and begged him to not touch me.\u201d\u201cIs that so, Aldor?\u201d\u201cI have never heard of such a thing.\u201dAldor denied it firmly, feigning innocence.\u201cAldor said he never heard of that though.\u201dNaturally, Marquis Hutton took Aldor\u2019s words.I replied without giving up.\u201cOnce again, I definitely said that.\u201d\u201cI told you I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing!\u201dDue to Aldor\u2019s repeated lies, the endless battle continued.Not to mention the whereabouts of the servant who took me to the room were unknown, he was not found even though Marquis Hutton sent the butler to find him.Because of that, I couldn\u2019t prove that it wasn\u2019t my will to come into this room.In addition, as Marquis Hutton continued to take Aldor\u2019s side, the situation gradually became unfavorable to me.Diane was working hard on my side, but there was a limit because she didn\u2019t know the whole situation.It was when the useless battle was getting longer and we were getting tired of each other.\u201cLet\u2019s do this instead then.\u201dMarquis Hutton sighed and settled the situation.\u201cIt seems that you\u2019re both at fault, so let\u2019s bury it as it is.\u201dBury\u2026 you say?\u201cIsn\u2019t that good for you too, Sir Thebesa? There\u2019s nothing good about a noble lady being caught up in such a scandal.\u201dAt first glance, it seemed like it was for me, but it was for Aldor, not me. Because if this scandal spread, even if it wasn\u2019t as bad as mine, Aldor would be in trouble as well. And the fact that I wasn\u2019t an ordinary noble lady, but an aide to the emperor would also take a role. So, it was clear that Marquis Hutton was trying to cover up his son\u2019s fault by burying it.Marquis Hutton knows everything, huh?That Aldor is lying.That he did something bad.If he had believed Aldor\u2019s words, he would have tried to find out every single detail and reveal it to the public, rather than burying it.I also thought that maybe the person who came up with this was Marquis Hutton. That\u2019s why Aldor was very confident when he tried to do something to me.I can\u2019t believe a rich man is doing something like this on purpose.My anger soared.\u201cYou think so too, don\u2019t you, Sir Thebesa?\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t say anything because what Marquis Hutton said was true even if I didn\u2019t want to admit it.For me, it would have been better for this incident to be buried as it was rather than be known to the public.And as expected, I was hoping for that too.\u2026am I really hoping for that?At the sudden question, I clutched the blanket.Actually, I didn\u2019t want this to be buried. I wanted Aldor, who gave me terrible memories, to pay the price and suffer the same as me. But it was practically impossible. Because I lost more than he suffered.If so\u2026 I want to receive a proper apology.\u201cSir Thebesa?\u201d\u201c\u2026no. I won\u2019t let it slide.\u201dI said, clutching my spirit stone necklace.\u201cUntil Lord Hutton sincerely apologizes to me, I will never let it slide.\u201dMarquis Hutton frowned at my words.\u201cDoes that mean Aldor was at fault? Aldor says it\u2019s Sir\u2019s fault though.\u201d\u201cWe will see whose fault it is.\u201d\u201cHow are you going to check it?\u201d\u201cSacred trial, isn\u2019t it the simple way to do that?\u201dIn an instant, the atmosphere froze. Everyone\u2019s eyes fell on me.Sacred trial.It was a method usually used to obtain a confession from a malicious criminal, and like its word, this trial was nothing more than mental torture. After the sacred trial, many people lost their minds and couldn\u2019t live a proper life.When I said I would do it, everyone was so surprised.\u201cIs the Lady seriously going to do the sacred trial?\u201dMarquis Hutton must have been so surprised that he called me Lady, not Sir.I nodded, tightening the hand holding the necklace.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026if you\u2019re thinking of threatening me and Aldor with that, stop it.\u201d\u201cI have no intention of threatening you. I just want to make it clear that what I\u2019m saying is true.\u201d\u201cHo.\u201dMarquis Hutton clicked his tongue and swept his hair up.\u201cFather\u2026\u201dAldor called Marquis Hutton with an anxious face.He seemed to want to run to Marquis Hutton right away, but he couldn\u2019t because Hiltine was right next to him.\u201cAre you okay with that?\u201dDiane also asked me worriedly.Of course not. It was said that there were people who died of a mental breakdown because of the sacred trial, so I couldn\u2019t be okay doing the trial. But if I didn\u2019t do this, they would never admit their fault, so I had no choice but to do it.Of course, there\u2019s a possibility that they wouldn\u2019t admit it until the end. Then at that time\u2026 they had to face the sacred trial. I wanted to at least make it clear that I wasn\u2019t at fault.After thinking for a while, Marquis Hutton opened his mouth again.\u201c\u2026all right, let\u2019s do the sacred trial.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201dAldor jumped to his feet and called Marquis Hutton.As soon as Aldor did that, Hiltine pressed his shoulder and pushed him down again.I glanced at Aldor, then again at Marquis Hutton.He looked calm on the outside, but if you looked closely, his eyes were trembling.He\u2019s agitated, huh? Well, of course, he is.\u201cWhen would be good to hold the trial?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bad thing, so there\u2019s no need to drag it long, right? Let\u2019s request the temple right now and hold it.\u201dI had to finish it at once because I didn\u2019t know what kind of work they would do if I gave them time.Marquis Hutton thought for a moment and then called the butler.\u201cGet the carriage ready! I\u2019m going to the temple right now!\u201dIf we did the sacred trial, it would be clear that this was Aldor\u2019s fault. So, what\u2019s he counting on? Could it be that I was wrong that Marquis Hutton was involved in this?I was skeptical, but I didn\u2019t bother to ask because everything would be revealed after the sacred trial.I changed my torn dress while the carriage was being prepared.Even at this moment, I was worried Aldor and Marquis Hutton might be doing something strange, but fortunately, Sir Hiltine kept a good watch on Aldor.But why is Sir Hiltine, who should be in the capital, here?A question that I didn\u2019t think of earlier because I was out of my mind suddenly popped up.I\u2019ll have to ask him after the sacred trial.\u2026if my sanity is still intact.After changing my clothes, Diane clung to me.\u201cAre you really okay with that, Sir Thebesa?\u201dI wasn\u2019t okay, but I pretended not to be and nodded.\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201dThen Diane shouted with a serious look.\u201cYou\u2019re not okay. Because of such a guy, you even have to do the sacred trial, there\u2019s no way you are okay!\u201d\u201cSuch a guy\u2026 he\u2019s a marquis\u2019s son, Sir Andrian.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even give a sh*t if he\u2019s a marquis\u2019s son! For a molester, even the title of such a guy is a shame!\u201dAlthough her outspoken words that weren\u2019t like a noble lady were a little surprising, I was struck with the same thought as her.\u201cI want to tell you to give up even now, but I won\u2019t say it.\u201dDiane grabbed my hand and said as if pleading to me.\u201cInstead, make sure you come back safely. Because I\u2026 have something I really want to say to Sir Thebesa.\u201dI could feel pure worry from her hands holding mine and her eyes looking at me.\u2026she\u2019s really a nice person, huh?Diane was such a nice person that the minor misunderstanding was forgotten.\u201cYes, I will.\u201d\u201cYou promised, okay? You have to, you really have to.\u201dAfter asking me again and again, Diane let go of my hand.I left Diane behind and headed to the carriage waiting in front of the annex.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere were two carriages headed to the temple, one for me and one for Aldor and Marquis Hutton.Sir Hiltine rode in the same carriage as the Huttons. He watched Aldor without a single glitch, and Aldor looked at him with an uneasy look throughout.It was the same even after arriving at the temple. He looked like a man with a crooked back.\u201cAldor, can\u2019t you get your act together?!\u201dWhen Marquis Hutton shouted with a harsh voice, Aldor looked at him with a white-washed face.\u201cBut Father\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt will be fine. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u2026does Marquis Hutton really know nothing?I was starting to get a little confused by Marquis Hutton\u2019s behavior, which was too confident.I was standing in front of the carriage and looking at them when people came out of the temple. They were priests in unblemished white priest uniforms.\u201cWhat brings you here at this late hour, Marquis Hutton?\u201dA man with a gold rim on his robe stepped forward and asked.It meant that he was a high priest. Lower priests had no rims and were engraved with purple, blue, and gold borders according to their rank.\u201cWe are here for the sacred trial.\u201dOn behalf of Marquis Hutton, I took a step forward and answered.The high priest turned to me.\u201cYou are\u2026?\u201dI put my hand on my chest and bowed lightly.\u201cMy name is Leila Thebesa, who is an aide to the Emperor and is now the Emperor\u2019s agent.\u201d\u201cOh my, excuse me, Sir Thebesa. I am Clima, a humble servant of God.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Priest Clima.\u201dAfter exchanging brief greetings, I explained the purpose of my visit here again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry at this late hour, but I would be grateful if you could conduct the sacred trial to determine who is right because my words and Lord Aldor Hutton are different.\u201d\u201cSacred\u2026 trial?\u201dPriest Clima asked me in disbelief.As I nodded, the other priests, except for Priest Clima, began to chatter.It was natural for them to react like that when they heard two decent nobles wanted the sacred trial, an interrogation usually conducted for heinous criminals.\u201cI don\u2019t know what the cause is, but I think it would be better for the two of you to settle the matter through dialogue rather than undergo the sacred trial.\u201d\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have come here if we could resolve it through dialogue.\u201dI answered while looking at Aldor. Aldor, who made eye contact with me, blatantly avoided my gaze.\u201cOnce again, I want to go on the sacred trial.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026\u201dPriest Clima sighed in regret and looked at Aldor.\u201cIs Lord Hutton on the same page?\u201dInstead of answering directly, Aldor looked at Marquis Hutton. His face was still as pale as a blank sheet of paper.Marquis Hutton, who had been silent with a heavy face despite his son\u2019s anxious gaze, nodded.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026!\u201dAldor called Marquis Hutton in a shrill voice and tried to approach him, but Sir Hiltine blocked his way with a blue-edged sword. He stared at Aldor as if he would cut him off immediately if he took one more step.Aldor\u2019s face, which had already been white due to the harsh situation, became so white as he was frightened.\u201cThis is the only way to prove your innocence! So take it calmly, Aldor!\u201dAnd when Marquis Hutton said that, Aldor shut his mouth.Priest Clima sighed quietly and nodded.\u201cIf that\u2019s what you two wish, I understand. I will prepare it right away. Please wait in the waiting room for a moment.\u201dPriest Clima beckoned, then another high priest right behind him came forward and greeted us politely.\u201cEveryone, please come this way.\u201dWe followed the high priest to the temple\u2019s waiting room.The temple of Hutton, which was one of the wealthiest cities, was large and splendid. All the way to the waiting room, fancy decorations were seen.The waiting room was also splendid. After asking us to wait here for a while, the high priest left.In the center of the waiting room, there was a soft and luxurious sofa for the nobles, but I didn\u2019t sit there. I just stood in front of the door.Marquis Hutton and Aldor would definitely be sitting there. Would it be crazy if we sat together? Even if my legs hurt a little, standing was a hundred times better.As expected, Marquis Hutton and Aldor sat on the sofa. Sir Hiltine sat behind them and kept a close watch on Aldor.I\u2019m glad he\u2019s here.Thanks to him, I was able to feel some peace in my anxious mind.\u201cThe sacred trial is ready.\u201dThough it was all meaningless in front of the sacred trial. But the preparation was done faster than I thought. Was it supposed to be this fast?Priest Clima asked us to follow him and lead the way.As I was about to follow him, Marquis Hutton came to my side and spoke in a voice low enough that only I could hear him.\u201cIt\u2019s not too late now.\u201dMarquis Hutton\u2019s fierce gaze was fixed on me. Without blinking an eye, I met his gaze calmly.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we acknowledge that it was caused by a minor misunderstanding and bury it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dWhen I refused like a knife, Marquis Hutton frowned.\u201cBecause you\u2019re a lady who doesn\u2019t know anything about the world, you don\u2019t know the fear of the sacred trial. You may not be able to stay sane after undergoing it.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re still going to do it?\u201d\u201cYes. Because it is the only way to prove my innocence.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that I wasn\u2019t afraid to go on the sacred trial. Even now, I was so scared and frightened that the hand I was clenching in my sleeve was trembling. But, as I said to Marquis Hutton, this was the only way to prove my innocence.So, let\u2019s do it. Even if you lose your mind due to the aftereffects, just do it, Leila.Marquis Hutton opened his mouth as if he had more to say, but he couldn\u2019t because we had reached our destination.Standing at the door painted with thorns, Priest Clima stepped forward, looking at Aldor, and said.\u201cI will ask you one last time. Are you sure you want to go on the sacred trial?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dUnlike me, who answered right away, Aldor hesitated.\u201cLord Hutton.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes.\u201dPriest Clima asked him again and Aldor reluctantly answered.\u201cYou can sign here.\u201dWhat Priest Clima brought out was a document stating that the temple would not take any responsibility in the event of a problem.When Aldor and I signed the document, Priest Clima beckoned.The door with thorn vines opened, revealing the sacred court, which I had only heard of.Contrary to the frightful appearance, the courtroom itself was ordinary.In a simple room with no special decorations, a wooden chair was placed there.If there\u2019s only one chair, does it mean that only one person can receive the sacred trial at a time?I had a bad feeling about this.\u201cLet the trial begin with Lady Thebesa first.\u201dMy hunch was right on the mark. At Marquis Hutton\u2019s words, Aldor raised his head.\u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea too. That woman was the first to propose the sacred trial after all.\u201dFrom Sir to Lady, and now to that woman.It was funny. I wondered how far a title could be lowered.\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s do that.\u201dHe\u2019s trying to get away while I\u2019m under the sacred trial and even go crazy, huh? As if I will let that happen.\u201cInstead, no matter what my results are, Lord Hutton also has to undergo the sacred trial.\u201d\u201c\u2026is that necessary?\u201dMarquis Hutton asked me in a subdued voice.\u201cThe Lady\u2019s innocence means that my son has been proven to have lied. There would be no need for two people to suffer.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean the Marquis also thinks I am innocent?\u201dMarquis Hutton was silent on my question. He didn\u2019t even say no.Looking at him now, I didn\u2019t think he knew anything. I truly had no idea which one it was.\u201cAs the Marquis said earlier, this may be the result of mutual misunderstanding.\u201dI looked at Aldor, not Marquis Hutton.\u201cThat\u2019s why I think it is necessary to make sure that not only me but also Lord Hutton is innocent. What do you think, Lord Hutton?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAldor didn\u2019t answer, but I didn\u2019t ask anymore because it wasn\u2019t a question I was hoping for him to answer.Instead, I looked at Priest Clima.\u201cSo, please promise me, Priest Clima, that even if I\u2019m proven innocent, Lord Hutton will also have the sacred trial.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that, Sir Thebesa.\u201dPriest Clima smiled kindly and beckoned.Then, from somewhere, the priests brought another wooden chair and placed it next to the existing wooden chair.\u201cBecause the sacred trial will judge you two at the same time.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026!\u201dAldor\u2019s eyes widened like an oil lamp, and his mouth was wide open.[T/N: Oil lamp is a metaphor for eyes that have grown large in surprise or fear.]Priest Clima glanced at Aldor and said to me.\u201cAnd so, you won\u2019t have to worry, Sir Thebesa.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThen please take a seat.\u201dUnlike me, who sat right away on the chair, Aldor hesitated.Sir Hiltine pushed Aldor\u2019s back. Only then did Aldor sit down on the chair.\u201cI hope Marquis Hutton and the Knight could leave.\u201dSince the sacred trial was not open to anyone except for those concerned, Marquis Hutton and Sir Hiltine had to leave even if they didn\u2019t want to.Only me, Aldor, Priest Clima, and two other priests were left in the room.\u201cPlease close your eyes.\u201dI closed my eyes and another priest put a cloth over my eyes. Soon I felt something prickly on my head.It was a laurel wreath made of laurels and thorns.I thought I had made up my mind, but when I was put on the laurel wreath, my heart raced like crazy. And my mouth was very dry.It\u2019s okay.You\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s okay.As I clenched my fists trying to control my pounding heart, I felt someone approaching and standing next to me.\u201cIt will be fine.\u201dSoon, I heard a small whisper in my ear. It was Priest Clima.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything, Sir Thebesa.\u201dWhat does he mean?\u201cLet the sacred trial begin!\u201dI wanted to ask, but I couldn\u2019t because Priest Clima had announced that the sacred trial would begin.It\u2019s really starting now, huh?I felt so nervous as I was clenching my cold sweaty hands.\u201cARGHHHH! I WAS WRONGG!\u201dBut then, out of nowhere, I heard Aldor\u2019s desperate scream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I couldn\u2019t see anything because of the cloth though.\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault! So please stop!\u201dAldor\u2019s desperate screams did not stop. The judging hadn\u2019t even started yet, so why was he like that?\u201cLord Aldor Hutton, do you admit that it is all your fault?\u201dPriest Clima asked solemnly.\u201cYes! I admit it! I, I did it! I was drunk, and I lied because I didn\u2019t know how to fix it!\u201dAldor\u2019s confession continued.Someone then released the cloth that was covering my eyes. And then I saw Aldor sitting on the floor, crying like a child.The chair he was sitting on was wet as if water had spilled on it.His pants too.Aldor couldn\u2019t stand properly. He crawled on his knees and came to me.\u201cI\u2019m ashamed of myself. I\u2019m so sorry, Sir Thebesa!\u201dWhat on earth\u2026 happened?Is Aldor\u2019s sacred trial over in the meantime?That can\u2019t be. Didn\u2019t Priest Clima say that we would receive it together?I couldn\u2019t figure out what on earth was going on, so I just stared at Aldor blankly.Aldor begged me with dirty tears and a runny nose.\u201cPlease forgive me just once!\u201dI didn\u2019t know what happened, but I was sure it ended in a good way for me.\u201cDo you admit that I\u2019m innocent?\u201dI asked him again to confirm.Then Aldor nodded his head bigly and answered loudly.\u201cYes, YES!\u201dHa. Why did he deny like that when he can admit this easily?Even though it was ridiculous, I was glad that he confessed now. Of course, I didn\u2019t think Aldor sincerely repented of his fault and apologized. It was evident that he was plainly terrified, pretended to repent his fault, and apologized to me.Even so, I have nothing to say.I couldn\u2019t tell him to not act like that when he didn\u2019t sincerely repent for his fault. But the important thing was that Aldor admitted his fault and apologized to me. In front of so many people.\u201cCould you please call Sir Hiltine and Marquis Hutton?\u201dI called them in to be more certain.As soon as the tightly closed door opened, Marquis Hutton sprang in. After him, Sir Hiltine followed.Marquis Hutton frowned to see Aldor sitting on the floor and weeping. On the other hand, when he saw me standing normally, his face crumpled even more.\u201cMy son is like that, so how come Lady Thebesa is fine?\u201dMarquis Hutton fiercely asked Priest Clima.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, my son was the only one who underwent the sacred trial?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201dDespite the fierce gaze, Priest Clima replied with a smile.\u201cThe sacred trial hasn\u2019t even started yet.\u201dAs I expected. The sacred trial hadn\u2019t begun.I just thought maybe I wasn\u2019t feeling it because I was dull, but it turned out it wasn\u2019t. Then why was Aldor doing that?I was puzzled, but before I could ask, Priest Clima replied.\u201cThe moment Lord Hutton was put on the laurel wreath for the sacred trial, he suddenly changed and started confessing like that.\u201dSo, he was afraid and confessed to all his faults, huh?It was embarrassing yet funny.\u201cPfftt.\u201dAs I let out the unbearable laugh, Marquis Hutton\u2019s fierce gaze was fixed on me. It wasn\u2019t scary at all, though.\u201cLord Hutton.\u201dI spoke to Aldor while looking at Marquis Hutton.\u201cDid the Lord plan this on his own?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cStop!\u201dBefore Aldor could even finish his words, Marquis Hutton roared.\u201cHow long will the Lady intend to harass my son?\u201d\u201cI have never harassed him. I was just trying to ascertain the truth.\u201d\u201cAldor is so shocked right now that he can\u2019t speak properly!\u201dI thought I had heard it somewhere, but it turned out to be what Diane said while covering for me earlier.It was hilarious to hear that again from Marquis Hutton. The current situation was also.\u201cThen, does the Marquis also admit it? That this was not caused by mutual misunderstanding, but Lord Hutton\u2019s fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to admit it.\u201dWhen Marquis Hutton didn\u2019t answer, I immediately told Priest Clima.\u201cWe will continue the sacred trial to ensure this matter is over.\u201d\u201cNO!\u201dAldor screamed and jumped to his feet.\u201cThis was not planned by me alone! All\u2026!\u201d\u201cALDOR!\u201dMarquis Hutton\u2019s shout resounded through the room.Aldor sat down with his eyes wide open.Marquis Hutton exhaled while shrugging his shoulders. His face twisted uglily.\u201cI admit it!\u201dMarquis Hutton shouted with a great lament.\u201cI admit it\u2019s all my son\u2019s fault! So please stop here!\u201d\u201cOkay, I will.\u201dThere was nothing good about making things bigger than it was when even Marquis Hutton admitted it.I nodded obediently, and it was the end of the matter.As soon as the matter was ended, Marquis Hutton disappeared as if running away with Aldor.It\u2019s over\u2026 huh?As the tension was relieved, the strength in my legs was also released.Sir Hiltine supported me when I sat down on the floor.\u201cThank you.\u201dThen he stood me up straight without a word.Priest Clima approached and asked worriedly.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dIt\u2019s not empty words, I was really okay.Other than losing strength in my body, my feelings were better than ever. Because I cleared myself up and got an apology from Aldor.I was very pleased with the result, which was different from what happened with Andante.\u201cMore than that, there is something I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cYes. Go ahead.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do to Lord Hutton?\u201dI was very curious about what on earth happened to Aldor that he got so scared and confessed before the sacred trial began in earnest.At my question, Priest Clima smiled a little and brought his index finger to his lips.\u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201dIt was clear that he had done something.I was curious, but there was no way for me to know because he didn\u2019t want to tell me.\u201cInstead, let me tell you one thing.\u201dPriest Clima\u2019s gaze reached Sir Hiltine. He smiled brightly and continued.\u201cSir Thebesa has a very good escort knight.\u201d*****In the carriage on the way back from the temple to the Marquis of Hutton. Unlike when went to the temple, Sir Hiltine rode in the same carriage with me.From Priest Clima\u2019s last words, I could tell that Sir Hiltine was involved in Aldor\u2019s abnormal change.There must be a good reason for him not saying it, so it\u2019s best not to ask, but I was still very curious.\u201cAre you willing to explain what happened, Sir Hiltine?\u201dI tried my luck, but as expected, he was still silent as if he had no intention of saying anything.He didn\u2019t say anything else though, so there\u2019s only an awkward silence inside the carriage.Soon the carriage arrived at the Marquis, and I got off the carriage while being escorted by Sir Hiltine who got off first.\u201cSir Thebesa.\u201dI was going straight to the annex, but Marquis Hutton approached me.Sir Hiltine came forward as if trying to protect me.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI have something to say to Sir Thebesa.\u201dSomething to say to me? Was he trying to talk about what happened earlier?\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cEhem.\u201dMarquis Hutton said after coughing loudly.\u201cI apologize once again for what my son has committed. He\u2019s not that kind of guy originally. I will teach him a lesson.\u201d\u201cPlease do so.\u201d\u201cSo, by the way, can you please overlook this matter? If something like this is known, the face of the Marquis of Hutton will be\u2026\u201dIndeed, if it was known that his one and only heir did this, Marquis Hutton would no longer be able to carry his face around.\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen I said okay obediently, he looked at me in surprise.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt would be nice if Aldor\u2019s ugly deeds were known everywhere, but if that happened, I would be in trouble as well, despite being a victim. And I would be tired in many ways too, so I decided to bury this matter here.Since Aldor had already given me enough apologies, I was content to bury it here.\u201cThen you won\u2019t report it to His Majesty, right?\u201dMarquis Hutton looked at Sir Hiltine and not me.Come to think of it, I\u2019ll have to ask Sir Hiltine as well.\u201cSir Hiltine, I beg you.\u201dI earnestly asked Sir Hiltine.\u201cPlease do not report this to His Majesty.\u201dSir Hiltine looked at me silently and nodded.It was positive. Even Marquis Hutton breathed out quietly, feeling relieved at last.\u201cThen I\u2019ll get going because I\u2019m tired.\u201d\u201cYes! Go ahead and get some rest!\u201dI left Marquis Hutton behind and quickly headed to the annex.Sir Hiltine followed me.There were things I wanted to say to him and some things I wanted to ask him, but I held back for now because there were many eyes here.By the time we reached the annex, I stopped and looked back at Sir Hiltine.There\u2019s hardly anyone here, so it\u2019ll be fine, right?\u201cThank you.\u201dI said thank you first.\u201cYou\u2019ve been protecting me, right? Thank you very much. Thanks to you, I was able to stay safe until now.\u201d\u201c\u2026I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dSir Hiltine replied in a low, heavy voice.\u201cRather, I couldn\u2019t protect you when I had to.\u201dHe suddenly fell to one knee and bowed his head politely.\u201cI apologize.\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe that the sincere apology came from the person who had nothing to do with that, not from the person who did that and needed to sincerely apologize for that.\u201cN, no! Sir Hiltine did nothing wrong. It was all Lord Hutton\u2019s fault.\u201dI panicked and shook my hand.\u201cSo please get up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cCome on.\u201dSir Hiltine stood up as I pulled his arm.\u201c\u2026His Majesty.\u201dThen he looked at me with subtle eyes and said.\u201cI was told to kill anyone who touches your body without your permission.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His Majesty gave such a terrific order?It\u2019s a good thing I stretched myself out to stop Sir Hiltine earlier. No matter how much Aldor had done that he deserved to die, I didn\u2019t really want him to die. I didn\u2019t want anyone to die because of me.\u201cThat order is too much. Please don\u2019t do that in the future.\u201d\u201cThis is an order from His Majesty.\u201dHiltine answered firmly with a slightly bitter smile.\u201cAnd I have already disobeyed his orders.\u201dHe was talking about him not being able to kill Aldor earlier. Also about me asking him not to report this to Kalian.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I unknowingly made you disobey His Majesty\u2019s orders. But my intentions remain the same.\u201dI said, looking straight at him as he looked at me with an indifferent look.\u201cSo don\u2019t kill other people. Sir Hiltine, too, doesn\u2019t want that, right?\u201dSir Hiltine\u2019s expression changed subtly. He looked surprised and also shocked.Why is he like that?\u201cSir Hiltine?\u201dWhen I called him in confusion, Sir Hiltine covered his face with his hand.\u201cAre you okay?\u201dI tried to reach him, but Sir Hiltine avoided my hand and took a step back.I put my awkward hand back and looked at him.Sir Hiltine\u2019s expression became a little more distorted when he met my eyes. He hesitated for a moment, then \u2018 swush\u2019 , he turned and disappeared quickly before I could grab hold of him.I, who was left alone in an instant, wanted to chase Sir Hiltine, but I chose not to and entered the annex.I didn\u2019t know where Sir Hiltine had gone, and I didn\u2019t want to go around and go through the same thing that happened to me before.The annex was quiet, perhaps because it was late. And the silence that wrapped around me was scary.So I quickly returned to my room like someone was chasing me.\u201cMy Lady!\u201dEria, who was waiting for me in the room, approached me with a smile.\u201cAre you okay, My Lady? I heard something bad happened at the party.\u201dIs it only known as \u2018something bad happened\u2019?It was best for it all to be buried, but since there was such a commotion, it was difficult to bury it completely. But with this much, Marquis Hutton could be said to be quick to use his hands well.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cJust a minor accident.\u201dIt\u2019s not minor at all, but it\u2019s something I couldn\u2019t tell her, so I just roughly glossed over it.Eria was quick to notice and didn\u2019t ask anymore.\u201cShould I help you change your clothes?\u201d\u201cNo need. I can change by myself. So, can you leave? I\u2019m tired and want to be alone.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAfter Eria left, I sat down in front of the dressing table, rubbing my face.The woman reflected in the mirror was gaunt and unattractive.Why couldn\u2019t they just leave me alone?Andante, and also Aldor.I got goosebumps as I remembered what I had suffered from both of them. I wrapped my arms around my trembling shoulders and lowered my head.Aldor fakely apologized to me, but I also fakely forgave him. How could I truly forgive him when he had done such a thing?I couldn\u2019t do that.Certainly.*****\u201cYou don\u2019t look well, My Lady.\u201dThe next day, late in the morning.Eria, who had prepared a late breakfast, asked anxiously.\u201cDid you not sleep well?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah.\u201dThere\u2019s no way I could sleep comfortably when I went through something like that. Even if I fell asleep because I was so tired, I kept waking up because what I had suffered from Andante and Aldor kept appearing in my dreams alternately. And after waking up like that, I couldn\u2019t sleep for a while due to the aftermath.It will probably be like this for a while.Because it took a year for what Andante did to become dull.How long will this take? I wish it could get dull sooner.\u201cIf you have insomnia, should I bring you some tea for a good night\u2019s sleep? Drink it and then take a nap. You don\u2019t have any special plans today anyway.\u201dHmm, should I?\u201cPlease do that.\u201dAfter thinking about it for a while, I thought it was a good idea and accepted Eria\u2019s suggestion.Eria brought the tea near the end of my late breakfast.It was a light reddish, fragrant tea.\u201cChamomile, huh?\u201d\u201cYou know it right away.\u201d\u201cI used to drink this kind of tea a lot.\u201dIt was the tea that Misa prepared for me, who could hardly sleep due to insomnia after the predecessor Duke and Duchess Williot died.Besides this, she prepared a lot of things like lavender-scented candles and a pillow for a good night\u2019s sleep.Was it just Misa? The butler and the other servants of the Duke of Williot also cared for me and helped me a lot.I still missed them, but this made me miss them even more.I should write a letter to Misa as soon as I get back to the capital. To the other servants too, if possible.With that in mind, I took a sip of the tea.The bitter and sweet taste of chamomile spread fragrantly in my mouth.It seemed that my depressed mood had improved a little.\u201cCan I take away the dishes you\u2019re done eating?\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll sleep after drinking the tea, so you don\u2019t have to come until I call you.\u201d\u201cYes, My Lady.\u201dWhen Eria went out and I was drinking the tea while recalling the memories of Misa and others, a knock was heard.Who is it? Is it Eria? Or maybe\u2026 Aldor isn\u2019t here again, is he?My hand almost lost its strength for a moment, but I managed to put the teacup I had almost dropped on the table and looked at the door.I had to ask who it was, but I couldn\u2019t speak. It was because of the fear that it might be Aldor. But I had to ask. It\u2019s not polite to make the other person wait too long.When I was about to force myself to speak, the other person spoke first.\u201cSir Thebesa, are you not inside?\u201dIt was Diane. I finally answered calmly.\u201cNo, I\u2019m here. Come on in.\u201dWith my permission, the door opened and Diane entered cautiously.She looked quite different from yesterday when she bravely stormed through Aldor\u2019s door.\u201cAre you okay, Sir Thebesa?\u201dNow that I thought about it, I hadn\u2019t explained anything yet to Diane. She must have been very worried, it was my negligence.I smiled brightly and nodded to show that I was okay.\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay. Fortunately, Lord Hutton confessed his fault before the sacred trial began, so it ended well.\u201d\u201cWhat a relief.\u201dDiane sighed in relief and wiped her chest.\u201cUmm, can you give me some of your time?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll have the maid bring the tea right now.\u201dDiane shook her hand as I got up and tried to pull the bell.\u201cNo need. I have other plans, so I have to go right away. I came here just to check Sir\u2019s condition and to say something to you.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dCome to think of it, yesterday she said she had something she really wanted to say to me.Instead of sitting back down, I stood facing Diane.Diane hesitated for a moment, unlike her usual self, and then slowly opened her mouth.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 sorry.\u201dWhy is she sorry all of a sudden?\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d\u201cWhat I said to Sir yesterday.\u201dWhat she said to me? What\u2026\u201cAh.\u201dCome to think of it, she told me that I was the emperor\u2019s mistress. And because of that, I was reluctant to see Diane.I had been through something even bigger than that, so I forgot about it.Yesterday I hated and felt disappointed for Diane, but not now. It was thanks to Diane who came first and apologized sincerely. Also to the trust she showed in me during Aldor\u2019s incident yesterday.It wouldn\u2019t have been easy to trust me in that situation, but Diane trusted me without wavering in the slightest. That alone could absolve her of all her mistakes.\u201cNo. It\u2019s okay, so don\u2019t worry about it. People can misunderstand in their lives.\u201d\u201cBut it was a real misunderstanding.\u201dDiane scratched her cheek with an awkward expression.\u201cBefore I came to the Empire, I looked into Sir Thebesa. Ah, of course, the others as well.\u201dI guessed so. Because I did that too.\u201cAnd everyone said that Sir Thebesa was the Emperor\u2019s lover. So I really thought you were.\u201d\u201cI understand. But that\u2019s a false rumor. I\u2019m simply an aide to His Majesty the Emperor.\u201d\u201cYes, I believe that.\u201dDiane shook her head bigly.\u201cBut Sir is capable of that.\u201dIt was good to be recognized by Diane, but somehow I was embarrassed and smiled awkwardly.\u201cWhatever the reason, I\u2019m really sorry for the strange misunderstanding. It was not intentional.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dDiane smiled bashfully, and then asked carefully, looking me in the eye again.\u201cUmm, Sir Thebesa.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201dPerhaps because it was difficult to say, Diane hesitated, unable to say it easily.What is she trying to say so hard?\u201cIf you have anything you want to say, you can say it, Sir Andrian.\u201dOnly then did Diane speak up.\u201cUmm, if you don\u2019t mind, may I call your name, Sir Thebesa?\u201dCalling someone by their first name, not by their surname, meaning that they were in a close relationship. Usually, names were called between blood relatives, lovers, and friends.Kalian called me by my first name too, but it was a special case.In other words, Diane was asking me to be friends now.I was stunned. I thought I had become quite close to Diane, but I never thought that she would come up with such an offer first.Diane smiled awkwardly as I looked at her without saying a word.\u201cI can\u2019t do that, right? I\u2019m sorry. I asked too much. Then, take a good rest. I\u2019ll get going\u2026\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dI grabbed Diane\u2019s arm as she tried to rush out.Diane looked back at me with her eyes wide open.I looked at Diane and smiled.\u201cYou should hear my answer, Diane.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Marquis Hutton and Aldor were nowhere to be seen.Marquis Hutton went out to the sea yesterday afternoon, saying he had work, and Aldor hadn\u2019t shown up since that day. He\u2019s probably shut himself in his room because of his pride.I also didn\u2019t want to see his face, so it was a good thing.But I don\u2019t see Sir Hiltine either.I\u2019ll look for him later. I have something I want to say to him.I greeted the diplomats of the Natsha Kingdom one by one and greeted Diane at the end.\u201cI\u2019m just barely calling Leila\u2019s name, and I can\u2019t believe we have to part ways already.\u201dDiane said with a sad look.\u201cI think time is really coldhearted.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too sad, Diane. We can meet again.\u201d\u201cStill, what\u2019s sad is sad. Are you not sad to part ways with me, Leila?\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019m sad.\u201dHow could I not be sad? I had to part ways with my first friend in my life. But if I showed it, the atmosphere might become depressed, so I just didn\u2019t show it.\u201cNext time, come to the capital. I\u2019ll show you around the capital.\u201dDiane smiled instead as if she knew how I felt when I promised to meet again.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say the capital is more beautiful than Hutton? I can\u2019t wait to see how beautiful it will be. I will be waiting for that day to come sooner.\u201d\u201cI, too, will be waiting to see you in the capital, Diane.\u201d\u201cAh, I knew it.\u201dDiane breathed heavily and continued.\u201cI\u2019m really sad to part ways with you, Leila. I want to kidnap you and take you to the Natsha Kingdom, you know?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a crime?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m holding it in. I don\u2019t want to be a criminal.\u201dI laughed softly at her joke.\u201cSince we\u2019re at it, I will ask you.\u201dDiane glanced at Marquis Valdir and the other nobles then spoke in a voice that could be heard only by me.\u201cDo you want to be naturalized into the Natsha Kingdom?\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201dNaturalized? I looked at Diane in bewilderment at the sudden remark.\u201cIn Natsha Kingdom, there is less gender discrimination. Women can also become officials if they have the ability.\u201dDiane\u2019s eyes looking at me were very serious.\u201cIt\u2019s too waste for you to work with people like them who don\u2019t even recognize you. So, I want you to be naturalized into the Natsha Kingdom. Of course, I also have the desire to be closer to you.\u201dThe topic that could have been heavy was lightened by Diane\u2019s playful additions.I already had the answer, but because I thought she would be hurt if I answered too quickly, I waited for a while before answering.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Diane.\u201d\u201cAh, the expected answer.\u201dDiane shrugged lightly.\u201cSir Andrian! It is time to go!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be right there!\u201dAt the urging of the other diplomat, Diane answered vigorously and then reached out to me.\u201cWell then, take care Leila.\u201d\u201cDiane, too, take care.\u201dNow it was really the last.I smiled bitterly and took her hand.At that moment, Diane leaned over me and spoke in a low voice.\u201cI want you to be treated properly for your ability, Leila. You are too talented and too good to be treated like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cSo, for my suggestion, think it over. As long as I\u2019m alive, it\u2019s always valid.\u201d*****After the Natsha Kingdom\u2019s envoy left, I returned to my room and pondered what Diane had said.The words were that she wanted me to be treated properly for my ability and that I was too talented and too good to be treated like this.\u201c\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t know if I was a good person, but I used to think that the treatment I received was unfair.Then, because people around me treated me like that naturally, I naturally passed it over at some point.So when Diane pointed it out like that, I was stunned. And it was amazing to know that there were other people who also thought like that.\u201cNaturalize\u2026\u201dI\u2019d be lying if I said Diane\u2019s proposal wasn\u2019t attractive at all.If I become naturalized in the Natsha Kingdom, will I be able to be as confident as Diane? Will I be able to do what I want to do without looking at others?I thought about it a lot for a moment. But it was still the same. The decision not to go had not changed.There were many reasons, but the biggest reason was because of Kalian.The kindness I had received from the first time I met him until now had been so great that I couldn\u2019t even dare count.So how could I abandon his trust and become naturalized into the Natsha Kingdom?I could never do that.Tok tok-When I heard the knock, I shook off my thoughts and unfolded my luggage on the bed.\u201cCome in.\u201dEria opened the door and came in.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to help you pack your luggage.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can do this by myself.\u201dI had only one suitcase, so there was no need to bother to get help from Eria. And I didn\u2019t like borrowing other people\u2019s hands to take care of my stuff.\u201cMore than that, Eria, did you see a silver-haired man on your way here?\u201d\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThen where on earth is he?He said his job was to escort me, so he must have been nearby, but I had never seen him even once.Well, I didn\u2019t realize Sir Hiltine was following me until he showed up on his own.\u201cAll right, you can go now.\u201d\u201cIs it really okay if I don\u2019t help you pack your luggage?\u201d\u201cYeah. So, you can go now.\u201dAfter sending Eria, I checked the hallway. But no matter how much I looked around, I couldn\u2019t see Sir Hiltine.\u201cSir Hiltine.\u201dI called out his name quietly, wondering if he would come if I called him.\u201cSir Hiltine, oh my\u2026!\u201dSomeone suddenly grabbed my shoulder from behind.As I turned around in surprise, I saw Sir Hiltine looking at me with a blank gaze.\u201cOh, since when are you here? No, how did you get in?\u201dI was guarding the door though.When I asked in wonder, Sir Hiltine silently pointed to the balcony.So you came in through the balcony, huh?\u2026but wasn\u2019t here on the 3rd floor?Beyond the balcony was a cliff overlooking the sea. There were no trees to climb up to here, so I was wondering how he got here.\u201cWhy did you look for me?\u201d\u201cAh, I have a question for you.\u201dI closed the door and turned completely towards him.\u201cDid you report to His Majesty about what happened between me and Lord Hutton?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201dHe kept his promise. I was worried inside, so it was a relief.\u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee that I won\u2019t do it in the future.\u201dAs soon as I felt relieved, Sir Hiltine added.I asked Sir Hiltine in surprise.\u201cAre you saying that you will tell His Majesty?\u201d\u201cIf His Majesty asks. I cannot lie to His Majesty.\u201dI understood Sir Hiltine\u2019s position, but I still wanted to stop him.If Kalian found out about this, he would definitely be furious and tried to punish Aldor. Then, everything would be known to the Empire, and I would break the promise I made with Aldor.If the promise was still broken even though I had written a memorandum, Marquis Hutton wouldn\u2019t stay still. That\u2019s why I wanted to somehow prevent it from entering Kalian\u2019s ears, but I couldn\u2019t just ask Sir Hiltine to disobey the Imperial Order.\u2026so wasn\u2019t there only one way now?\u201cLet me tell him.\u201dSir Hiltine looked at me with subtle eyes.I looked straight into his eyes and continued.\u201cI will tell His Majesty, so will you keep it a secret until then?\u201dIf it was something that would be found out anyway, it was right for me to say it with my own mouth and ask for understanding.I didn\u2019t know if Kalian would understand, but\u2026 I should ask for his understanding somehow.\u201cI can\u2019t wait long.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThen do as you please.\u201dIt meant that my request was granted.\u201cIt must be a difficult request, but thank you for granting it.\u201dHe nodded and turned around.\u201cWait!\u201dI hastily grabbed Sir Hiltine\u2019s arm as he was about to leave the room.Sir Hiltine turned his head and looked at me.\u201cHave you had lunch?\u201dIt was a simple question, but Sir Hiltine was silent for a moment, then shook his head.\u201cThen let\u2019s have lunch together. If we leave the mansion, it will be difficult to have a proper meal.\u201dAs we were the imperial delegation, they took good care of meals during the trip, but it was difficult to expect a meal as good as the one at the mansion.\u201cThat\u2019s why we have to eat well before we go.\u201dBefore Sir Hiltine could say anything, I called Eria and asked her to prepare lunch.By the way, where did he get his meals this whole time? What about sleep? Where did he rest?Questions popped up one after another.When the meal was ready, I asked him straight up.\u201cHow did you manage your meals this whole time?\u201dEven though I asked another question, Sir Hiltine remained silent.It meant he didn\u2019t want to answer. No, maybe he couldn\u2019t answer that.There was no way he could have decent meals while escorting me secretly. It was the same for sleep and rest.I felt sorry for making him suffer for nothing.Now that I knew the situation, I shouldn\u2019t bother him anymore.\u201cSir Hiltine, when we go back, ride with me in the carriage.\u201dSir Hiltine, who for some reason was only eating bread, leaving the other good food, looked at me.His eyes were wondering why I said that.\u201cSir Hiltine\u2019s job is to protect me, right?\u201dI didn\u2019t want to trouble him anymore and he\u2019d probably refuse if I said so, so I gave another reason.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be more convenient for you to ride in the same carriage?\u201dSir Hiltine nodded, presumably also thinking it was better to do so.\u201cI will do that.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s have meals together. Ah, I\u2019ll also ask them to let you stay in the room next to me when I sleep.\u201dI was worried he might refuse, but fortunately, Sir Hiltine didn\u2019t say no or okay and kept staying still. Then, it meant I could do whatever I wanted, right?I pushed the appetizing whole roast toward him, thinking that I should tell Marquis Valdir this.\u201cProtecting others requires a lot of stamina, so eat a lot, Sir Hiltine.\u201d***Announcement:Hi guys, thank you so much for supporting ROS through our kofi membership.

    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter lunch, I went to Marquis Valdir and talked about the changed matters.Sir Hiltine was also there with me.Marquis Valdir kept glancing at Sir Hiltine as he listened to me.\u201c\u2026like that. May I do that?\u201d\u201cAs you please.\u201d\u201cThank you. Then, I\u2019ll see you in a little bit.\u201dTo tell this to the other nobles, I had to move busily, but as I was about to leave, the Marquis called me.\u201cLady Thebesa.\u201dWhen I looked at him again, Marquis Valdir asked me with a subtle expression.\u201cWhy do you think His Majesty appointed that man as your escort?\u201d\u201cIt must be because His Majesty was concerned about my safety.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, he could have put him on officially, but why did he put him on secretly? And it\u2019s not a regular knight, but a knight leader?\u201dNow that I thought about it, it was a bit of a question for me too.\u201cDoes the Marquis know the reason?\u201d\u201cWhy are you asking me that? The Lady must know better.\u201dI asked because I don\u2019t know.As I stared at him quietly, Marquis Valdir grinned and passed me by.\u201cMaybe soon the day will come when I will have to bow politely in front of the Lady.\u201d*****Finally, the time for us to leave came.On the absent Marquis Hutton\u2019s behalf, the mansion\u2019s butlers and aides saw us off. And Aldor still didn\u2019t show his nose.In the carriage, there were me and Sir Hiltine.Although it was not right for men and women to ride in the same carriage, there had always been exceptions, and the escort knights were among the exceptions.As I gazed at the ever-changing scenery, I recalled what Marquis Valdir said.At first, I didn\u2019t understand what he meant by that, but now I understand.He meant that I might become an empress (concubine).Other than that, there was no reason for anyone like the Marquis to bow politely in front of me.Marquis Valdir still thinks I\u2019m His Majesty\u2019s mistress, huh?It was an absurd misunderstanding, but the reason I couldn\u2019t blame the Marquis was because I also thought it was strange.It was an exaggeration to say that it was purely because he was worried about me.\u201cSir Hiltine, did His Majesty say anything else when he ordered you to escort me?\u201dIf he had, I could have known what he was thinking, but unfortunately, Sir Hiltine shook his head.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dMy doubts deepened and I was confused.Don\u2019t tell me, is he really interested in me as is known for a while to the public\u2026What am I thinking right now!I can\u2019t believe I have such absurd thoughts.Even if I was crazy, I wasn\u2019t usually this crazy. I shook my head, erasing the delusions that came to my mind.Then I found Sir Hiltine looking at me strangely, and so I smiled awkwardly.\u201c\u2026are you okay?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay. Ah, I\u2019m a little hungry. Are you not hungry, Sir? I have cookies, would you like some?\u201dI wasn\u2019t hungry at all, but to divert the topic of conversation, I took out a box of cookies and held it out to Sir Hiltine. It was cookies that Eria gave me to eat on the way.Sir Hiltine took a cookie without a word.I was relieved that he didn\u2019t ask any more questions. Thinking I should eat too, I picked up a cookie, but when I was about to eat it\u2026TAK-\u201c\u2026!\u201dSir Hiltine slapped my hand with the cookie hard.What is\u2026I looked up at Sir Hiltine in bewilderment.Sir Hiltine then took the entire cookie box I was holding and carefully examined the cookies inside.\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s poison in the cookie.\u201dWhat did I hear now?Poison?I looked at the cookie box, more startled than when Sir Hiltine hit my hand.There\u2019s poison in there\u2026\u201cWho would do that\u2026 No, more than that, are you okay, Sir Hiltine?\u201dI didn\u2019t eat the cookie thanks to Sir Hiltine stopping me, but it was after Sir Hiltine ate one.I moved to the seat next to Sir Hiltine, grabbed his hand, and looked over his face.There was no place where his skin turned purple. The color of his eyes and lips was also fine.Still, it was unpredictable. I had to detoxify him right away.\u201cI\u2019ll tell the coachman right away and tell him to go to the nearest temple. Let\u2019s go get your treatment.\u201dAs I was about to open the window connected to the coachman, Sir Hiltine grabbed my arm.\u201cIt\u2019s just a paralyzing poison that doesn\u2019t affect life. It doesn\u2019t affect me at all.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt really is. I have been trained against poisons since I was young, so you can trust me.\u201dA body trained against poisons. Was that possible?No matter how much I thought about it, it would still be better to go to the temple, but Sir Hiltine refused.\u201cAll right.\u201dHe was so stubborn, but there was nothing I could do.\u201cInstead, if there\u2019s any inconvenience, please tell me right away.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSo that was it, and all that was left was the poisoned cookies\u2026I looked at the cookie box that Sir Hiltine was holding.It was Eria who gave me that cookie box, but I didn\u2019t think she was the one who poisoned it.Someone else must have done the trick in the middle.I had no idea who it was. No, rather, there were too many people to guess, so it was impossible to make a conclusion.From Marquis Valdir to Viscount Malven, the other nobles, Marquis Hutton, and Aldor.I surprisingly had many enemies.I didn\u2019t think I had ever done anything worthy of a grudge against myself, but how did this happen?It was bitter. I smiled bitterly and clenched my fists.\u201cIt is impossible to determine who the enemy is, so it would be better to be careful at all times.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ll try all the food you eat first.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201dWhat if something went wrong with Sir Hiltine?\u201cI\u2019ll just be careful.\u201d\u201cPoison is not something that can be avoided just by being careful.\u201dThat\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201cBut I can\u2019t let you sacrifice yourself.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my job.\u201dSir Hiltine said firmly.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t forget my job.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, I\u2019m just worried about\u2026\u201d\u201cAs I said, my body is trained against poison. Most poisons don\u2019t do any harm to my body.\u201dSir Hiltine paused for a half beat before continuing.\u201cAnd if anything happens to you, His Majesty will ask me for my fault. So it is right for me to try first.\u201dIt was so true that I had no choice but to admit it even if I didn\u2019t want to.\u201cAll right. Please do that, Sir Hiltine.\u201dPlease let nothing happen.Inwardly, I prayed and hoped for that.*****After Leila joined the mission and left for Hutton.Kalian\u2019s work ended with hearing the report from Hiltine through the magic messenger bird.As the Emperor\u2019s agent, and Hiltine by her side, the chances of anything happening to Leila were very small. But he didn\u2019t feel at ease if he didn\u2019t hear from Hiltine that Leila was safe today.There was a time when he didn\u2019t hear it because he was charging the messenger bird.Kalian was worried all day long that something might have happened to Leila until he heard from Hiltine the next day. Was that all? He was worried again if he got the call later than usual, and he was worried even if he got the call earlier.Ver, who was watching the scene closer than anyone else, clicked his tongue.\u201cAre you that worried about Sir Thebesa?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dKalian answered right away as if it was natural.Ver looked at Kalian as if it was ridiculous.\u201cAren\u2019t you worried too much?\u201dKalian, who was looking at the documents, looked at Ver.\u201cIs it too much?\u201d\u201cYes. When I went to another city for work in the past, you weren\u2019t that worried.\u201dWas that all? Unlike Leila, he didn\u2019t attach a separate escort knight. And he didn\u2019t even ask for a report on his daily routine.But when he was asked why he was so worried about Leila, Kalian answered plainly.\u201cWell, it\u2019s because you are a man and Leila is a woman.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have anything to do with this?\u201dWhen Ver, unable to understand his answer, asked again, Kalian added.\u201cLeila is the only woman in the delegation. All of them are men. Leila was thrown alone in a den full of wolves, isn\u2019t it natural to be worried?\u201dThat\u2019s\u2026 right.He would try to be sarcastic if he came up with an absurd reason, but that was such a made-sense reason that Ver nodded without saying a word.\u201cMoreover, the members of the delegation were all displeased with Leila. They might try to do weird things to Leila if something didn\u2019t turn out the way they wanted.\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be. They can think as well, would they do such things?\u201d\u201cCan you say that when you see Duke Williot?\u201dLost in words at the added question, Ver shut his mouth.Even though Philen knew that Leila was away, Ver knew he had visited Leila\u2019s house from time to time.Philen\u2019s actions were obviously wrong, but Ver knew why, so he couldn\u2019t just curse Philen.\u201cSir Thebesa\u2026 Did she really do such a terrific thing?\u201dSimilarly, Kalian, who knew the reason, replied \u201cNo.\u201d immediately.\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\u201cBecause the Leila I know isn\u2019t the kind of person who would do that.\u201dWhat is that\u2026It was a ridiculous and absurd reason, but for some reason, Ver was also convinced and nodded.\u201cRight. Sir Thebesa is not the kind of person who would do that.\u201d\u201cIf you know, investigate the truth. Someone must have set a trap.\u201dThere were more things to do at the moment, but Ver replied that he would do it without hesitation.After checking the documents, Kalian got up from his seat.Ver, who was helping him, raised his eyebrow slightly and asked.\u201cYou still have work to do, where are you going?\u201d\u201cI should have dinner.\u201dHe was about to scold him that he couldn\u2019t have a leisurely dinner when he had so much work to do, but\u2026\u201cToday, I will have dinner at the detached palace. Ver, you get ready too.\u201dVer shut his mouth at the added remark.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf it was to go to the detached palace, of course, he had to go.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201dVer brought the documents he had brought to the aide\u2019s office and went back to Kalian.In the meantime, Kalian, dressed in a neat coat, was holding a large box in his hand.At other times, the servants would have made a fuss saying that they would hold it, but for some reason, they did not say anything.It was the same with Ver. He just looked at what was inside the box and smiled.\u201cHe will like it.\u201d\u201cI hope so.\u201dA faint smile was drawn on Kalian\u2019s lips.\u201cThen, let\u2019s go.\u201dThey headed to the detached palace located in the deepest part of the Imperial Palace, a little deeper than the inner palace.The detached palace was very beautiful. The garden was full of golden royal roses and there was a large fountain in the center.In the center of the fountain, there\u2019s a stone statue of a baby angel carrying a large water bucket which was continuously pouring out clear water.It was just after Kalian and his party passed the fountain.Step step step stepAn urgent sound of footsteps was heard from somewhere.After a while, the bushes beside Kalian shook and a boy about the height of his waist popped out.His blue hair, a little lighter than Kalian\u2019s, fluttered softly in the wind. Under the sunlight, his clear skin stood out.The boy hugged Kalian by the waist, but no one stopped him.It was the same with Kalian.Instead of scolding him for being rude or asking \u2018what are you doing\u2019, he smiled softly and looked at the boy.\u201cHess.\u201dWhen Kalian called his name, the boy, who was burying his face in his waist, lifted his head and looked up at Kalian.The sky-blue eyes that resembled the sky shone brightly.The boy smiled brightly, revealing his white, well-groomed teeth.*****Sir Hiltine had tasted every food I was going to eat first to make sure it wasn\u2019t poisonous.It\u2019s a pity that I couldn\u2019t eat with others, but if they had seen this, it would have been very embarrassing.Hiltine not only distinguished poison but also taught me how to distinguish it.\u201cThe most basic way is to distinguish it with silver. Silver is the best tool to detect poison, but there are many more poisons in the world that cannot be detected by silver.\u201d\u201cWhat do you do in that case?\u201d\u201cThe second is to tell by taste or smell, but it is dangerous in many ways. People who are not resistant can die if they eat it incorrectly.\u201dDie? Just hearing it gave me chills.\u201cThe third way is to feed the suspect first.\u201d\u201cTo the other person?\u201d\u201cYes. If it was poisoned, they would never eat it.\u201dAh, indeed. It made sense.The carriage, which had been running diligently, stopped in front of the inn. It was the inn we stayed in today.Even here, Sir Hiltine tasted the food I was going to eat first.This was usually done by commoners. The children of nobles who came to the palace as servants or maids sometimes did it, but it was for the higher-ranking imperial family, higher than themselves. They didn\u2019t do this for the same-ranking nobles.So was he okay? If it were the children of other nobles, even if it was because they had to escort, their pride would have been hurt.\u201cYou can eat it.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter Sir Hiltine gave his permission, I ate the soup.It tasted good because it was the special soup that the innkeeper was proud of.The meal was held in a quiet atmosphere. It wasn\u2019t awkward or anything like that.At first, Sir Hiltine was so expressionless and silent that it was awkward for the two of us to eat together, but now I was used to it.About halfway through the meal, a waiter came over and filled the empty glass.I was about to drink the water because I was thirsty at the time, but Sir Hiltine took the glass.\u201cI will try it first.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any need to check this too.\u201d\u201cThere are no exceptions.\u201d\u2026I guessed so.Sir Hiltine returned the glass to me only after confirming that it was not poisoned.I drank it with a spoon because it felt a bit strange to drink the water that someone else drank.\u201cAre you still eating?\u201dWhen the soup bowl was almost empty, Marquis Valdir came and asked.It didn\u2019t look like he came just to greet me as he passed by. He wasn\u2019t the kind of person who would do such a thing.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cI have something to say to the Lady, can we talk for a while after dinner?\u201dWhat did he want to talk about?I was curious. As I was almost done eating, I put down my spoon and stood up.\u201cWhere should we go?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s talk in my room. Because that\u2019s the best place.\u201dI nodded and followed him. Sir Hiltine also followed me and Marquis Valdir as if it was natural.Marquis Valdir frowned and looked at Sir Hiltine.\u201cDid you not hear that I wanted to talk to Lady Thebesa privately?\u201dHiltine remained silent without answering.As I had felt before, he hardly ever talked to anyone other than me.It could be dismissed as him being reticent, but not even answering questions was just a good way for others to misunderstand that they were ignoring you.It was the same with Marquis Valdir. His expression turned even worse.\u201cPlease calm down, Marquis.\u201dAfter calming Marquis Valdir, I looked at Sir Hiltine.\u201cSir Hiltine, please wait here for a moment, as I\u2019m going to talk to the Marquis.\u201d\u201cI cannot do that. Something could happen in the meantime.\u201d\u201cYou mean I\u2019m going to do something to Lady Thebesa?\u201dOh, no. He\u2019s pissing him up.\u201cTell me, is that what you meant?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could it be, Marquis.\u201dI answered on behalf of Sir Hiltine, who did not answer.Then Marquis Valdir looked at me as if it was ridiculous.\u201cSince when did the Lady become his spokesperson?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not like that, let that damn guy answer me directly, not the Lady.\u201dNo matter how angry he was, but \u2018that damn guy\u2019?I frowned at the excessive language.\u201cDid you hear me or did you not hear me?\u201dIf he didn\u2019t answer this time, it would be really bad.I looked at Sir Hiltine with an anxious look.Sir Hiltine\u2019s eyebrows twisted slightly as our eyes met, and he slowly opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026I heard.\u201dHe answered. That\u2019s a relief.\u201cBut you\u2019re still going to follow us?\u201dSir Hiltine affirmed in silence.Marquis Valdir clicked his tongue and looked at Sir Hiltine.\u201cHow dare you ignore me, a marquis, when you\u2019re just a commoner?\u201dCommon\u2026 er?Although I often thought that the way he spoke and behaved was not like a noble, I never thought he was a commoner.I turned to look at Sir Hiltine in surprise and Sir Hiltine averted his gaze.It was the first time he had avoided my gaze since that night.\u201cAs a marquis, I command you. Wait here.\u201d\u201cHis Majesty\u2019s orders take precedence over the Marquis\u2019s orders.\u201dDespite Marquis Valdir\u2019s order, Sir Hiltine did not retreat at all. As it was the Emperor\u2019s orders, how would he keep on persisting?\u201cDo what you like!\u201dMarquis Valdir became red and turned.When I arrived at his room, I sat facing the Marquis with a table in between.Sir Hiltine was standing behind me.His aide came in. He set the teacup and teapot on the table and left.\u201cThis tea was recommended by the innkeeper. They say it\u2019s a specialty here.\u201dMarquis Valdir kindly filled the teacup himself and put it in front of me.The pale yellow tea was glittering.\u201cI wanted to introduce it to the Lady, so I asked him to bring it. Give it a try.\u201dHis uncharacteristic kindness was weird.\u2026could it be that this man was the one who poisoned the cookies?As I was staring at the teacup, a hand suddenly popped out from behind and picked up the teacup.It was Sir Hiltine. He poured the hot tea into his mouth without saying anything.Marquis Valdir and I looked at him in bewilderment.Either way, Sir Hiltine looked at the empty teacup for a moment, put it back in front of me, and nodded. It meant that it was safe to drink because it was not poisoned.\u201cI DON\u2019T EVEN KNOW THIS KIND OF MANNERS\u2026!\u201dMarquis Valdir, who soon came to his senses, glared at Sir Hiltine indignantly.I knew why Sir Hiltine did this, but Marquis Valdir knew nothing. So, it was natural for Marquis Valdir to be angry.Big trouble.Even though Sir Hiltine was His Majesty\u2019s knight, he was lower in rank than Marquis Valdir.If the Marquis punished him with this, he couldn\u2019t be stopped.I hurriedly spoke to the Marquis, trying to distract him.\u201cWhat do you want to say to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFortunately, Marquis Valdir\u2019s expression calmed down in an instant.\u201cEhem.\u201dHe coughed lightly and then said.\u201cThis is not my opinion. This is the opinion of those below me.\u201dHearing only that, I immediately knew what he was trying to say.He\u2019s talking about \u2018that thing\u2019, huh?\u201cEveryone said that it would be better to attribute the Lady\u2019s credit during the diplomatic meeting with the Natsha Kingdom to the entire Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u201dIt was as expected, too. Since they rarely came over, I guessed he took over it in person.Marquis Valdir\u2019s proposal didn\u2019t need to be considered. Because my answer was clear.As soon as Marquis Valdir finished, I answered.\u201cI refuse.\u201dMy answer made Marquis Valdir frown as if he was very displeased.\u201cYou answered without hesitation, huh?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s something I\u2019ve already refused several times.\u201d\u201cStill, can\u2019t you think about it one more time?\u201dShould I? I didn\u2019t think I needed to do that at all though.But Marquis Valdir wanted me to think about it for a moment and there\u2019s no reason not to. It wasn\u2019t hard either. So I thought for a moment, then answered.\u201cAs expected, I will refuse.\u201dI did what he wanted, but he still didn\u2019t like it. Deep wrinkles formed on his forehead.He asked me without hiding his unpleasantness.\u201cWhy do you refuse?\u201dI wanted to ask him why he was trying to steal my ball, but it was a pity that I couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s because I already knew the reason, so there was no need to ask anymore.I also couldn\u2019t tell him why I refused, so I asked him a question.\u201cIs the Marquis a person who steals other people\u2019s credit for his own authority and gain?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looks that way to me though.\u201cI\u2019m doing this purely for the sake of the Empire! Not a bit of personal greed!\u201d\u201cSo am I.\u201d\u201c\u2026so are you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI didn\u2019t understand Marquis Valdir\u2019s mind at all, but I pretended to understand and said with a smile.\u201cI also want to attribute this to everyone for the sake of the Empire, but if it is found out that this is not true, all the aftermath will go to you, Marquis.\u201d\u201c\u2026all the aftermath will go to me?\u201d\u201cYes. There are bound to be people like me who don\u2019t notice your sincerity and think you\u2019re stealing the ball.\u201dMarquis Valdir didn\u2019t say anything as to whether it might be true that he might get stabbed.Fortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to have sold out his conscience completely.\u201cThat\u2019s why I thought it would be better to just tell the truth from the beginning.\u201d\u201c\u2026in summary, it\u2019s okay if others don\u2019t find out about it, right?\u201d\u201cAt that time, there were many eyes in the conference room, starting with the diplomatic envoy of the Natsha Kingdom. Are you confident it won\u2019t be found out for the rest of your life?\u201dMarquis Valdir shut his mouth after giving off a nuance that he would do what he wanted. He couldn\u2019t seem to be confident about that.Marquis Valdir\u2019s expression was still bad. Well, if things didn\u2019t go his way, it couldn\u2019t have felt good.Whatever Marquis Valdir felt, it had nothing to do with me.\u2026no, he could go around cursing me behind my back, right?I was skeptical because there were similar records before.If Marquis Valdir did that, my image among the nobles would be worse. That would be a big hindrance to me becoming a baron in the future, and it would interfere with my work.I can\u2019t let that happen.I didn\u2019t know anything else, but I had to prevent it from interfering with my work.If that happened, not only it wouldn\u2019t end my problem, but it would also affect Kalian and Baron Delrond, so I had to prevent it unconditionally.But how?I can\u2019t say I\u2019m accepting his offer now.\u2026ah!Right. I can use that method.Thinking of a good trick, I said.\u201cBut if they did find out, as the Marquis said, it wouldn\u2019t be good for the honor of the Empire and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u201dMarquis Valdir looked at me strangely. He also looked suspicious.\u201cOf course, I don\u2019t want that either, so I would like to make a suggestion to you.\u201d\u201cSuggestion?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s not that the Marquis and the members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs couldn\u2019t do anything during the diplomatic meeting this time, it\u2019s that you didn\u2019t.\u201dIt might sound like a pun, but there\u2019s a huge difference between \u2018couldn\u2019t do anything\u2019 and \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019.\u2018Couldn\u2019t do anything\u2019 meant that they didn\u2019t have the ability, but \u2018didn\u2019t\u2019 meant that they didn\u2019t do it for some reason even though they had the ability.\u201cThe reason was to help me fully realize my ability. I think that would be enough. It turns out, I actually did.\u201d\u201cThat, that\u2019s right!\u201dPerhaps he liked my explanation, Marquis Valdir smiled brightly and immediately responded.\u201cIt\u2019s, it\u2019s a matter of course!\u201dWhat a matter of course? Ridiculous.Not only did they come up with silly plans and have a meeting without me, but they also turned me into a liar.He seemed to have completely forgotten that he didn\u2019t even want me to attend the meeting.\u201cOkay, that\u2019ll do. There will be no problem then.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad your concern has been resolved. Can I get going now?\u201d\u201cOf course. Have a good night, Lady Thebesa.\u201dSeeing him smile and saying that friendly goodbye, he seemed to be in a better mood.It would end here, right? I didn\u2019t want other nobles to praise me. I just wanted them to not gossip behind my back.That was enough.\u201cHave a good night, Marquis.\u201dI politely said goodbye to Marquis Valdir, left the room, and headed to my room.Sir Hiltine followed me silently.When I arrived in front of my room, I turned to Sir Hiltine.\u201cI\u2019m going to rest in my room now, so Sir, too, can go back to your room and rest.\u201dI knew that even if I said this, he would only nod and not go right away. He would stay in front of my door even after I entered. Even if I told him not to do it and just rest, he hardly listened.Still, I was hoping while saying that, but Sir Hiltine looked at me without a nod unlike usual.\u201cDo you have anything to say to me?\u201d\u201c\u2026nothing.\u201dNo, it looked like he had.\u201cGo in and rest. I\u2019m going to rest too.\u201d\u201cAre you really going to rest?\u201dSir Hiltine didn\u2019t answer but kept his mouth shut.He won\u2019t, right?Should I think that it was better not to tell obvious lies?It made me uncomfortable to see that he would be guarding my room all night again.\u201cAfter a while, go back to your room and rest.\u201dSir Hiltine nodded silently.He seemed to do that, but contrary to his answer, he kept standing in front of my door all night.*****In a country located on the eastern continent, there\u2019s a saying that if you remember to be patient three times, you will avoid even murder.Ver was acutely aware of how wrong those words were.The culprit was, of course, Kalian. To get into more detail, there\u2019s a problem with his order to find a house for Leila a while ago.Ver had presented a decent mansion five times so far, but Kalian rejected it every time.He gave various reasons for why the mansions were rejected, such as it was downtown, far from the Imperial Palace, making it inconvenient for Leila to go to work, or being close to the Duke of Williot.And this was already the sixth time.Ver looked at Kalian, who was reading the document, hoping that this time it would pass safely.Finally, after reading the document, Kalian nodded satisfactorily.\u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhen Kalian gave a positive answer, Ver\u2019s face, which had been tearful, became bright in an instant. It was like the face of a person who had gone to heaven.Kalian glanced sideways at Ver, and then put the document down on the desk.\u201cBut there\u2019s a problem.\u201d\u201cRight! I have worked so hard to prepare\u2026 Yes? Problem?\u201dVer\u2019s face, which had been thrown back to hell from heaven in an instant, crumpled badly.Ver sighed deeply, putting his hand on his forehead, and then asked Kalian.\u201cWhat is the problem again this time?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too small.\u201dKalian answered as if he was asking what was so obvious.\u201cIt\u2019s a house granted by an emperor who is only a name, how can you give her such a small and shabby house?\u201dWhat? Such a b*llsh*t\u2026Ver had an absurd expression on his face.He must have forgotten that he had given Leila a smaller house.This house has just the right size. Because Leila doesn\u2019t have a family with her, she\u2019s the only one!\u201cAre the conditions I make too difficult?\u201d\u201cNo. Not too difficult, but almost impossible.\u201d\u201cImpossible? It looks simple to me though.\u201dVer kept his mouth shut as he tried to argue where the heck was the simple part.He was well aware through long experience that he was the lose one. And that he also couldn\u2019t give up.It was more difficult to find a house that met Kalian\u2019s conditions than to get a star in the sky. No, he wondered if there was one.Far from the Duke of Williot and close to the imperial palace, it had to be not downtown but not in the suburbs either.Was that all? Security must be good, there must be no troublesome neighbors, and where on earth was such a reasonably large place\u2026\u201c\u2026there\u2019s one.\u201dVer, who thought of one place for a moment, briefly exclaimed.Kalian said as he held out the document he had put down on the desk toward Ver.\u201cIf there\u2019s a place that comes to mind, fill this out.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I need to fill that out. Because it\u2019s a place Your Majesty knows well.\u201d\u201cA place I know well? Where is it?\u201dVer grinned and pointed his index finger at the floor.\u201cHere.\u201dKalian\u2019s eyebrow rose slightly when he heard he was talking about the Imperial Palace.Ver continued with a grin.\u201cThe Imperial Palace is the perfect place that meets all the conditions Your Majesty has put forward. So just bring Sir Thebesa into the Palace.\u201dThe Imperial Palace was the residence of the imperial family. Occasionally, some distinguished guests stayed, but that was literally a brief stay. It was nonsense for a person who was not of the Imperial family to live in the Imperial Palace.The reason he said this even though he knew it well was purely because he was annoyed. He was just saying that because Kalian asked so many impossible things.\u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026yes?\u201dAs Kalian quickly accepted it, Ver was bewildered and blinked his eyes wide.Kalian smiled brightly and said again.\u201cFrom now on, Leila will be staying in the Imperial Palace.\u201d\u201c\u2026you are kidding, right?\u201dThere\u2019s no way Kalian didn\u2019t know that only the imperial family could live in the Imperial Palace.If so, he must be simply playing along with his prank, but looking at his expression, it seemed that it wasn\u2019t the case again.No way\u2026 is he serious?Ver shouted, asking Kalian back.\u201cAre you really going to bring Sir Thebesa into the Imperial Palace?!\u201d\u201cYou say so, no?\u201dNo, I meant it as a joke\u2026\u201cI also think it\u2019s better to do that.\u201dVer, lost for words, shut his mouth.Ver thought seriously about how to solve this situation.Kalian, on the other hand, was very happy that the matter had been resolved and read the other documents that Ver had brought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Won\u2019t Pick Up The Trash I Threw Away AgainCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter talking to Marquis Valdir privately, his relationship with me had noticeably improved. It\u2019s not like it really had improved, but since our relationship wasn\u2019t that good before, it seemed to be getting better even with only this much.About two days after that.We finally arrived at the capital.\u201cFinally, the capital.\u201d\u201cWe can go home now.\u201dThe sounds of joy were heard everywhere.I too was happy going back to the capital. It felt like I had returned to my home.Is Sarah already here? Must be not, because I came back a little earlier than planned.I wanted to go home quickly, but I had something to do before that.It was to go to the Imperial Palace and inform the Emperor that we had arrived safely, and to report on what had happened.The thought of seeing Kalian soon made my heart beat and made my heart full.I fiddled with the spirit stone necklace I was wearing.I didn\u2019t take off the necklace all the way back to the capital from Hutton. I wore it all the time even when I was taking a bath and sleeping. As if it were an amulet.In fact, wearing this actually made me feel comfortable.The carriage, which was running diligently, slowed down little by little and then stopped.As I got off the carriage while being escorted by Sir Hiltine who got off first, I could see a familiar scenery.\u201cSir Thebesa!\u201d\u201cBaron Delrond!\u201dThe familiar and friendly person.Baron Delrond\u2019s face that I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time looked pretty good.What a relief. I was worried that he might have had a hard time doing my part.Baron Delrond greeted Marquis Valdir and told him why he had come.\u201cHis Majesty is waiting in the audience room.\u201dMarquis Valdir nodded solemnly.\u201cLead the way.\u201dWe followed Baron Delrond to the audience room.Blue Dragon, the guardian deity of the Empire, was clearly engraved on the huge door. Its blue eyes seemed to be really looking at me, so I was scared for a moment.The guards standing in front opened the door.I looked back before entering, but I didn\u2019t see Sir Hiltine. It was the first time he disappeared without a word, so I was bewildered.Where did he go? Did he leave because he thought his mission was over now that we arrived at the Imperial Palace?\u201cLet\u2019s go in.\u201dMarquis Valdir took the lead, followed by the other nobles.The magnificent audience chamber revealed the majesty of the empire as it was.Nobles stood on both sides of the long red carpet that stretched all the way to the front of the stairs.The closer to the higher seat, the higher the nobility, and Kalian was sitting at the higher seat.It\u2019s been a long time since I saw Kalian.I was happy to see him again, but at the same time, I was also nervous. The reason was not just because of Kalian. Numerous nobles gathered in the audience chamber also played the role.I licked my dry lips in tension and stood politely in front of Kalian.\u201cYour Majesty.\u201dMarquis Valdir, on behalf of the delegation, reported to Kalian the safe return. Then it was time to report on what had happened at the diplomatic meeting.\u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201dKalian crossed one leg and tilted his head at an angle.\u201cSince when did the Minister of Foreign Affairs have a higher position than the emperor\u2019s agent?\u201dIn an instant, the atmosphere of the audience chamber froze.Now, Kalian was asking me to report, not Marquis Valdir.Of course, he\u2019s right if you followed the rules, but to report instead of Marquis Valdir, who was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and a marquis? It felt strange.Maybe the others thought the same, but they all kept their mouths shut and looked into each other\u2019s eyes.At first glance, Marquis Valdir\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look good.It couldn\u2019t be good. Because it seemed like I, a count\u2019s daughter, had pushed him at an official event like this.\u201cWhat are you doing, Sir Thebesa?\u201dIt was Duke Giltian who broke the more or less short but long silence.\u201cWithout reporting to His Majesty immediately.\u201d\u2026you really want me to report?\u201cHurry!\u201dAt the command of Duke Giltian, I came forward.Marquis Valdir stepped back, blushing slightly.\u201cThen\u2026 I will report to you.\u201dI would have been so shocked and said nothing if I hadn\u2019t read the report before coming to the palace,\u2026I was still shocked, though.I recounted the contents of the report and reported steadily.\u201c\u2026That is all.\u201dThe tensest report of my life was over.I was more nervous than when I first reported to Kalian without adding any lies.\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201dKalian smiled contentedly and looked at Duke Giltian.\u201cDo you have anything to say, Duke Giltian?\u201dDuke Giltian politely bowed.\u201cI have nothing to say.\u201d\u201cWhat about the other nobles?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dThe answer of the nobles echoed through the audience chamber.As the deafening sound disappeared, Kalian stood up and shouted.\u201cI give the surname \u2018Aster\u2019 to Leila Thebesa, who has done a great job in this diplomatic meeting, and seal her as a baron.\u201d*****Usually, when someone received a title, people around them would congratulate them.However, no nobleman congratulated me. They were just staring at me openly and gossiping about me.I wasn\u2019t upset or anything because I also thought I wouldn\u2019t get congratulations from them from the beginning.Rather, it would have been strange if they had congratulated me warmly.\u201cCongratulations, Sir Thebesa.\u201dJust like now.\u201cNo, I should call you Sir Aster now.\u201dWhat is he thinking?I looked at Duke Giltian, a little wary.Behind him came a man with thick gray hair and glasses.\u201cDuke Giltian, have you been acquainted with Sir Aster? It\u2019s unexpected.\u201dHe was Sophia\u2019s father, Duke Huddlen.Rumor had it that he was not feeling well, so he delegated the chair of the Academy president to his son and stayed at home.Was that a false rumor?Duke Huddlen\u2019s condition looked very good. His expression was also bright with no shadows.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Leila. You\u2019ve grown a lot since we didn\u2019t see each other.\u201dOf course, I would.The last time I met Duke Huddlen was about 10 years ago, when his daughter, Sophia, trespassed the Count of Thebesa.As we parted after meeting on something that wasn\u2019t good, it was awkward and uncomfortable seeing Duke Huddlen pretend to be close and greeted me.All I could think of was that something was up.\u201cYes, it\u2019s been a while.\u201dEven though I was suspicious inside, I replied with a smile outside.Duke Huddlen smiled kindly.\u201cIt seemed like Duke Huddlen was really close with Sir Aster, huh?\u201dDuke Giltian suddenly interrupted the conversation.Duke Giltian\u2019s mouth was smiling, but his eyes were fierce while observing Duke Huddlen.He seemed to gauge what our relationship was.Duke Huddlen replied, still smiling as if he had not noticed it.\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a long time.\u201d\u201cA long time. How long ago do you mean? Is it 10 years or so?\u201dHe was subtly appealing in that he knew everything about what happened between me and Duke Huddlen ten years ago.Ten years ago, Sophia\u2019s uproar was an incident that Duke Huddlen wanted to bury enough to hand over his bonanza gold mine.When he said it like he knew it, Duke Huddlen\u2019s expression collapsed.Duke Giltian, on the other hand, smiled with interest.Haa.I couldn\u2019t believe I had to deal with two people when one was too muchNothing had happened yet, but my head was already throbbing.It was fortunate that Philen was not here. If he had been here, it would have been a real headache.But I also didn\u2019t see Duke Cloud.Even if Philen was on vacation and stayed in the estate as a reward for his hard work on the battlefield for a long time, Duke Cloud was in the capital. He even attended parties.It was surprising that he wasn\u2019t here.Well, it\u2019s simply to welcome the returned delegation, so there\u2019s no need for Duke Cloud, the lord of a faction, to appear, but still\u2026\u201c\u2026I guess that\u2019s why.\u201dWhile I was thinking about something else for a moment, Duke Huddlen and Duke Giltian were still fighting.It wasn\u2019t that the relationship between the two dukes was bad.They just insulted each other so that they didn\u2019t lose their own rice bowl.Duke Huddlen and Duke Giltian, in particular, had fought countless times over the position of the empress.It was Duke Giltian who won during the reign of the late emperor.Then, what happened after that? The late emperor had no interest in the late empress at all, and to make matters worse, the late empress couldn\u2019t bear a son to succeed to the throne for a long time and was on the verge of being deposed.She barely gave birth to a son, but her body became weak and then passed away a few years later, and the son\u2026\u201cSir Aster.\u201dHearing a familiar voice from behind, I turned around.There\u2019s a baron who I didn\u2019t know when he came.\u201cBaron Delrond.\u201d\u201cYou can call me Baron comfortably now.\u201d[T/N: All this time Leila called Ver Baron with -nim added, so Ver told Leila to call him Baron comfortably without -nim.]Baron Delrond said with a smile.\u201cBecause we are both barons now. Ah, I guess rather than calling you Sir, I should call you Baron now. Baron Aster.\u201dWhen I was given the baron title in the audience, I was a little surprised, but not very impressed.I was like, \u2018I finally get it, huh?\u2019. But when Baron Delrond called me Baron, I realized that I really had become a baron. It felt weird.\u201cGreetings to the two Dukes as well.\u201dWith Baron Delrond\u2019s appearance, the long fight ended.Duke Giltian turned around and walked away as if he had nothing more to do. His followers also disappeared quickly.On the other hand, Duke Huddlen said goodbye to me with a smile.\u201cSee you next time, Leila.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke.\u201dDuke Huddlen tapped me on the shoulder and disappeared with his followers.As the tide ebbed away, the people disappeared, leaving only me and Baron Delrond in the hallway.Baron Delrond glanced in the direction where Duke Huddlen disappeared and asked me.\u201cWere you originally acquainted with Duke Huddlen?\u201d\u201cWe have a little relationship.\u201dIf you could call it a relationship, that was it.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAh, His Majesty is looking for you. If you\u2019re not busy, let\u2019s go together.\u201dIf His Majesty called me, I had to go even if I was busy.\u201cOkay.\u201dI followed Baron Delrond to the palace\u2019s drawing room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have a lot of work to do, so I\u2019ll get going now.\u201d\u201cThank you for the guidance, Baron(-nim) Delrond.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Baron, Baron Aster.\u201dBaron Delrond urged me to follow him.Now that we\u2019re both barons, it was right to remove the \u2018-nim\u2019, but it felt awkward.I hesitated and carefully opened my mouth.\u201cBaron\u2026 Delrond.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lot nicer to hear.\u201dBaron Delrond disappeared with a smile as if he was very pleased, though I had only removed the \u2018-nim\u2019.When I sat down where I used to sit before, the maid brought tea.\u201cIt\u2019s Ann Marie tea.\u201dWhen the teapot was tilted, the teacup was filled with yellow tea.As I looked at the tea, I naturally thought of Sir Hiltine.I wanted to thank him for escorting me to the Imperial Palace. It was a pity that he disappeared so suddenly that I couldn\u2019t say goodbye properly.I was fiddling with the tea and thinking about Sir Hiltine when I heard the door open.It was Kalian. I immediately got up and greeted him.Kalian waved his hand in annoyance and sat across from me.Soon the maid prepared his tea.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have kept you waiting. Something came up all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201dCome to think of it, why did His Majesty call me privately? Did he have any questions about the diplomatic meeting?There was no other reason that came to my mind other than that, so I thought it would be it, but it wasn\u2019t.\u201cI\u2019m going to give you a new mansion.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dA new mansion?\u201cAre there any problems with the house I live in now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you, who live in that house, know better than me.\u201dThat\u2019s right.\u201cThen, why are you giving me a new mansion\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause the house you\u2019re living in now is too small for you to live in.\u201dSmall? It was too big for me and Sarah to live in.\u201cOther nobles will laugh at you if they find out that a baron, as well as the emperor\u2019s aide, lives in such a small mansion rather than a proper one. You will lose face, you know?\u201dI tried to refuse, but when he said that, I couldn\u2019t refuse anymore.\u201cIf that\u2019s the reason, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\u201cBy the way, this mansion is the house I give you in commemoration of becoming a baron. I don\u2019t accept rent or anything like that.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cLeila.\u201dI was going to say that I didn\u2019t think so, but Kalian cut me off and replied coldly.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn down my gift because of that small sum, are you?\u201d\u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cOkay. That\u2019s a relief.\u201dKalian picked up the teacup with satisfaction.I was concerned if I could get such an expensive mansion. As he said, it was not polite to reject the emperor\u2019s favor too much.I wonder what kind of mansion he will give me? It must be bigger than the house I live in now, right?I couldn\u2019t leave Sarah to manage such a big house alone. I should look for a maid before Sarah came back. Also servants.Looking at the size of the house, should I look for hired servants? Since I didn\u2019t pay rent, I could afford to hire hired servants.Then, first of all, I had to stop by the cashier immediately and get my unpaid salary on my way home. After that, I had to check the house and go to the employment office to hire people.\u201cLeila.\u201dAs I was making plans in my head, Kalian called me.\u201cI haven\u2019t decided on a mansion to give you yet.\u201dAh, it hasn\u2019t been decided yet?\u201cSo, will you stay in the palace until then?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dYou want me to stay in the palace?Staring at him blankly at his sudden suggestion, Kalian asked with a smile.\u201cWhy are you so surprised? It\u2019s as if I said something impossible.\u201dEven though it wasn\u2019t impossible, it was a strange thing to say.The Imperial Palace was the residence of the imperial family. And he wanted me to stay here until a new mansion was decided?\u201cIs the mansion going to be decided tomorrow?\u201d\u201cTomorrow will be too much.\u201dI would understand if it\u2019s going to be decided tomorrow, but it\u2019s not.\u201cThen the day after tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be done then either.\u201d\u201cThen when\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dKalian tilted his head and thought for a moment before answering.\u201cI think it will take about two weeks?\u201dTwo weeks? It was a ridiculously long time for me, who\u2019s not an imperial family member or a distinguished guest of another country, to stay in the Imperial Palace.\u201cI cannot stay in the palace for that long.\u201d\u201cEven if I, the owner of the palace, allow it?\u201d\u201cI am not a member of the Imperial family. If I stay in the palace for a long time, other nobles will find it strange.\u201dWhen I subtly told him that it would be an act of igniting the rumor that I was the emperor\u2019s mistress, Kalian smiled.\u201cIt\u2019s a useless worry. The reason I want you to stay in the palace is not only because of the house but also because of the childcare project.\u201dKalian put down his teacup and continued.\u201cNow that you\u2019re back, we\u2019re going to work on it in full swing, so it is more convenient for you to stay in the palace.\u201dThat\u2019s true, but I was worried that the other nobles wouldn\u2019t think the same.I couldn\u2019t answer that I would do it easily, and when I stayed still, Kalian who was silent for a while, then added.\u201cVer will also be staying in the palace for the time being, so you don\u2019t have to worry about anything weird.\u201d*****\u201cAchoo!\u201dVer\u2019s sneeze echoed loudly in the quiet outer palace\u2019s office.The servant, who was helping him, handed him a handkerchief and asked.\u201cDo you have a cold?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dVer answered, wiping his nose with the handkerchief.\u201cMy ears are tickling. It seems like someone is speaking ill of me.\u201d\u201cNo way. Who dares to speak ill of the Baron?\u201dVer wanted to reply that there were so many people who would do it, but he just shrugged his shoulders and handed the handkerchief again to the servant. Then he got up and grabbed his documents.\u201cAre you going to His Majesty?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cShould I help you?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need. After all, you can\u2019t enter the inner palace.\u201dThe palace itself was a place where access was strictly controlled, but the inner palace was even worse. Because it was the place where the Imperial family lived.Only those with permission from the Imperial family could enter. Even servants working in the palace couldn\u2019t enter without permission.Because of this, Ver had to carry all the documents in his arms. There were so many that it was still overflowing even if he hugged it with both arms.Ver walked carefully not to drop the documents. If he had known this would happen, he would have brought a servant of the inner palace.As he was passing between the inner and outer palaces with belated regret, he saw a familiar face from a distance.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201dIt was Kalian.Kalian, who found him only after being called, approached.\u201cWhat are you carrying so much?\u201d\u201cThese are the documents from the outer palace. I\u2019ll organize it all and report it to you tomorrow.\u201dAt those words, Kalian\u2019s eyebrow rose slightly.As he glanced at the amount of documents Ver was carrying, he sighed.\u201cIs there a magic tool for printing documents somewhere?\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s such a tool, I would have gone and destroyed it right away.\u201dKalian smiled at the words full of sincerity and took half the documents Ver was carrying. Then the documents were passed into the hands of the attendants who followed Kalian.Thanks to that, Ver sighed in relief as it made it easier for him to move.They naturally walked towards the inner palace.\u201cBy the way, aren\u2019t you on your way somewhere?\u201d\u201cI was on my way to meet you.\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dVer\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI have something to tell you.\u201dYou were on your way to the outer palace to see me simply because you had something to say?An ominous feeling came up from below.He wanted to ask what was going on, but he felt like he shouldn\u2019t.\u201cAre you not going to ask me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201c\u2026I should ask, should I?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t ask. I\u2019m just going to tell you anyway.\u201dVer tried to argue why he still asked if he was going to say it, but he swallowed his words.Kalian beckoned the attendants and escort knights that followed to stay away. Then they spoke in a quiet voice as they stood from them at a certain distance.\u201cI told Leila to stay at the palace for a while.\u201dVer glanced at the people following them and replied.\u201cDid she say she will?\u201d\u201cFirst of all.\u201dIs it yes or no? What first of all?\u201cIs something wrong?\u201dKalian paused for a moment and answered.\u201cLeila said that if she stayed at the palace, others would find it strange.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty brought Baron Aster in as a mistress, not as an aide \u2013 kind of thought like that, right?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dWhat? I thought it was serious, turns out it\u2019s not.Ver, who looked tired for some reason, replied indifferently.\u201cWhy are you worrying about that? It\u2019s something that you would have expected.\u201d\u201cYeah. And I found a solution.\u201dOh, you found a solution? This is a bit surprising.\u201cWhat is the solution?\u201dIn response to Ver\u2019s question, Kalian stared at him silently.Ver brushed his cheek awkwardly.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Is there something on my face?\u201d\u201cYou.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYou are the solution.\u201dWhat is this again?Ver, who blinked at the words he couldn\u2019t understand, soon understood what Kalian was trying to say and frowned.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you want me to stay in the palace for the time being?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201dVer\u2019s roar resounded loudly.\u201cWhat is going on, Your Majesty?\u201dThe attendants who followed were surprised and asked.Kalian replied that there was nothing wrong, and then gave Ver a scolding.\u201cYour voice is too loud.\u201dWho\u2019s to blame for all of this?!Ver replied with a silent roar.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dKalian replied with a smirk.\u201cI never asked for your opinion.\u201d\u201cWhy are you putting me in this tough job? What did I do wrong?!\u201dKalian answered as if he was asking what was so obvious.\u201cYou being my aide.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dVer, lost for words, shut his mouth.Kalian took a step forward and continued.\u201cHang in there a little bit. I\u2019ll let you go once the thing with Duke Williot is settled.\u201dVer was going to ask when on earth that was, but he asked something else.\u201cHave you told Baron Aster that Duke Williot was here? She didn\u2019t seem to know it.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t told her yet.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to tell her?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to want to.\u201dKalian answered with a smile instead.\u201cWell, the situation is not good right now. It looks like it\u2019s overheated over there too, so I think it\u2019s okay to tell her once it calms down a bit.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you agree with me.\u201dI bet.Ver snorted and walked a little faster than Kalian.\u201cAh, come to think of it.\u201dThen, as if he had suddenly remembered, he looked back at Kalian and asked.\u201cDo you know that it\u2019s Baron Aster\u2019s birthday soon, Your Majesty?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
