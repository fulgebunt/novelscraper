To boot, it was addressed to the wrong class.Zhang Heng no longer had it in him to grumble about these two people\u2014before he even graduated from primary school, the two\u00a0immortals1\u00a0had already packed their bags and made haste for Europe to get started with a whole new life.His parents who had met in an academic exchange conference, were both theologians\u2014who specialized in religious and mythological studies. Naturally, in their\u00a0materialism1\u00a0oriented homeland, theirs was not a popular field.However, unlike deceitful\u00a0shenguns1, Zhang Heng's parents were the real deal: one had graduated from the University of Oxford majoring in Nordic and Greek mythology whereas the other was a Durham University graduate who had published several papers Christian mythology, proving to be quite an influence in this field.In the end, they found themselves having trouble fitting in back home in China.By chance, his father's academic advisor took over a large project and was short-staffed. After a brief dialogue between the couple, Zhang Heng's parents handed their son over to his maternal grandfather, and then left in a hurry to begin a hectic life of research that moved them all around the world.They return home to visit only once a year, which meant that Zhang Heng spent his entire childhood with his grandfather.Maybe because they felt guilty about it, these two immortals never deprived the old man and their young in expenses.Excluding school fees or boarding fees, Zhang Heng's one-year college allowance was about thirty-thousand yuan. Although not as much as what the sports-car-driving\u00a0fuerdais1\u00a0get, it was considered pretty decent among the average students.Alright, back to the main subject.The whole thing with the watch was pretty weird. Zhang Heng had just woken up from a night's sleep to look at the time when he noticed that the marking at the top of the dial had changed from 12 to 24.Zhang Heng blanked out for a moment, then very calmly returned the watch to its place before drawing up his covers and continued to sleep.An hour and a half later, his friend that slept opposite him sent him a text message to inform him regrettably, that the attendance for Further Mathematics class was taken.It was not a dream?After a ten minutes shower, Zhang Heng sat down at the desk at the foot of his bed and switched on his computer.The first thing he did was to check into Taobao and lookup '24-hour-dial watch prank'. The search results read\u2014Sorry, we cannot find you're looking for.Zhang Heng deleted the word 'prank'; still, nothing matched his search.Was this not a prank?Zhang Heng rubbed his chin pensively. If he turned a blind eye on the twelve extra dials that appeared out of nowhere, the time on his watch was consistent with the one on his desktop. Upon a closer look, Zhang Heng also confirmed that this twenty-four-dialed timepiece was the same one he had been wearing.Even the scratches on the case back and creases on the strap were consistent\u2014little details, that no one else, other than he as the owner of the watch, knew.Of course, there were those hardcore pranksters who would make sure the lookalikes were undifferentiable from the real thing, but who would have so much time to spare to pull such an elaborate prank? They might as well spend such skills and zeal restoring relics in the Forbidden City.To sum it up, Zhang Heng knew that someone was messing with him.The average person would have had a fit encountering such a supernatural event. Zhang Heng, though, was not your average joe, thanks to his immortal parents.Most parents would coax their children to sleep with fairytales starring the little rabbit or baby squirrel. Zhang Heng's parents, on the other hand, put their professional knowledge to use, so that that young Zhang Heng went to bed with Nordic mythologies and Bible stories.Even though he did not waste away the nine years of compulsory education, and became a materialist, the foundation that had been established in him when he was younger remained.He was better at accepting situations like this much better than most.To explain using the concept of the trending boardgame 'The Call of the Cthulhu', his character's Sanity points depletion was slow.Instead of feeling fearful, he found whatever that was happening to him to be very interesting.The normal watch had twelve dials and after the hour-hand completed two rotations, a day would have passed. Now, his limited-edition watch with twenty-four dials only needed to complete one rotation to indicate the passing of one full day.Looking at it that way did not make it seem like a big deal at all. Once he had gotten used to it, it would feel almost natural.But Zhang Heng believed that whoever did this would not have been satisfied with just simply changing the clock face.His instinct told him that whatever that was supposed to happen would most probably happen when the needle completes one round.It was about fifteen hours before the end of the day, and Zhang Heng did not plan to remain idle during this period of time.There was no need to attend the Further Mathematics class since the attendance had already been taken. The lecturer that had warned the class that an absence would mean a deduction of\u00a0five points in their final examination.The damage had already been done.So, he decided to go down to the park and make up for the morning run he had missed.To his classmates, Zhang Heng was actually quite unique. Ever since they began attending university, the student became even wearier of getting out of bed early. This classmate of theirs was the only one insisting on waking up to go for morning runs. But for all that, he had never signed up for any competition during sports day, and rarely participated in group activities. He especially disliked gatherings. But once you have talked to him, you would find that he was not the arrogant person he appeared to be; in fact, you might even find this person to be quite interesting.A rumor about Zhang Heng being multi-talented had been circulating among the girls. Apparently, someone had returned to university before the holiday ended and saw him alone in the piano room playing Paganini's No. 3 Etude,\u00a0La Campanella\u00a0(The Bell), cleverly adapted by Franz Liszt from the Italian violinist's 'The Violin Concerto No. 2 in B minor' to a piano solo. Written using the cyclic form, the piece was notoriously difficult to play with various new technical methods cropping up every now and then, testing the pianist's dexterity and prowess.Some people remarked that they had seen Zhang Heng training in the archery range, and according to his roommate, he was also a member of a certain rock-climbing club.These were true yet also false.Zhang Heng was not as extreme as the stories described him to be. The morning runs was a habit imposed upon him by his grandfather\u2014he was simply used to the routine. He might be slightly faster and tougher than most people but was not nearly as good as the specially recruited student athletes.Archery was something he had only recently decided to try on a whim. With only three lessons under his belt, he was scarcely a novice. Rock climbing, on the other hand, was one of those things you enthusiastically sign up for and then forget about almost instantly.The piano was the only thing that he had grown up playing, but his level was only at about eighth or ninth grade. That La Campanella piece was just a recording in his phone that he had played when he was alone in the piano room. He never thought that it would get him famous.Wherefore, the unordinary Zhang Heng was actually not that unordinary.He was interested in many things but like it or not time is fair to everyone.Regardless of whether you value it, whether you decide to spend every minute productively or play as a useless person spending most of the time in bed, every person only has twenty-four hours at their disposal\u2014not a second more, not a second less.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe ran seven laps around the field\u20142,800 meters.After that, he showered in the public bathroom, changed into a clean white T-shirt and a pair of jeans, enjoyed his breakfast at a leisurely pace in the canteen and then finally walked to the library with the book 'Xiao Shan Wanhua Mirror' he had finished reading.Like the morning run, reading was also one of Zhang Heng's routine which he kept at the speed of one book per week.But unlike the run, reading brought him many pleasures. It was more like a pastime for him\u2014one that he had always enjoyed.As a matter of fact, if it were not for the limitation of time, he would be reading more than just one book every week.After he returned the book at the service desk, Zhang Heng pulled out the phone in his pocket and opened an applet called Random Number Generator. With the setting adjusted to eight digits, he eagerly rolled the virtual dice.Admittedly, it was not without ground that people thought that this guy was a genius.The regular person would never have thought to use this dice-rolling method to choose a book to read.But there was merit or perhaps eccentricity to Zhang Heng's reading style. Perhaps it was because he had gone through too many books since he was child, Zhang Heng could read any kind of books. From world-famous works to\u00a0Dragon Proud Sky*1, Xiaobai\u00a0Wen2*, and even the Perfect Man from Jin Jiang, Zhang Heng would soak them up like a sponge. And he got worse after that. He would still complete vapid books like Compendium of Medical Herbs and Scientific Swine Raising Handbook.To avoid the trouble of having to select a book and to experience the pure joy of having chanced upon a good book, he developed a normal distribution applet to help him pick his weekly reading material.It was such a pity that the appeal for campus research grant had fallen through, where he lacked the funding to market his invention.Zhang Heng concluded it was because the capital market lacked vision.\u2026Using the last two digits of the randomly generated number as a guide, Zhang Heng found himself in the management section.Although not literature like the last time, he considered it to be quite a stroke of luck. At least it was much better than the 'Bill of Quantitates for Water Drainage, Heating, and Gas Engineering' he got last month.Stretching out a finger, Zhang Heng pulled out the title for this week\u2014Adam Smith's 'The Wealth of Nations'.This was going to be a very pleasant afternoon.Zhang Heng found himself a seat by the window and began to engross himself in the book.Some of you might be scoffing right now. Really? He's not going to fuss over that recently turned-faerie watch of his?Well, as evident by Zhang Heng's attitude, he really could not care less about it.Addressing the issue proactively was the appropriate response, but only if it was within your capability.\u00a0But in the face of a supernatural phenomenon like this, where there is a lack of information, perhaps not doing anything about it is the better option. Have you not seen those classic horror films where the ghosts touch the person and the person would die? The actors or actresses had to pack their bags and go home since they were no longer part of the horror film.On the contrary, you have to pretend that it did not exist at all, keeping a cool and composed mind, and keep moving. Who knows, it might just be a frightening but harmless haunted house tour.Which is exactly why, many a times, staying calm and collected is the most important thing.Right now, Zhang Heng was exactly that. No one would be able to tell that this guy had just experienced paranormal encounter; he missed class and use the time to go for a morning run, spent a whole afternoon poring over 'The Wealth of Nations', and then attended his elective Critical Thinking class. Come night, he even honored his promise to his roommates and went to the restaurant opposite for\u00a0barbeque skewers1\u00a0and ended the evening watching American TV-series back in their dorm.At eleven-thirty, it was lights-off in the dormitory.Zhang Heng's laptop had another three to four hours of battery life but he did not want to disturb his roommate's sleep, so he powered it down.There was still another half an hour before the day ended, and while other people's watch hand had circled twice, Zhang Heng's familiar yet alien analog was only about to complete one cycle.Was anything going to happen? He did not know.All he could do was wait.Earphones plugged into the MP3 and into his ears, Zhang Heng spent the last thirty minutes of the day waiting quietly on his bed.00:00All three hands converged pointing upwards. There was a split-second pause before the seconds hand continued to travel.Zhang Heng did not notice anything unusual.Was his guess wrong?He pulled out his earphones and immediately\u2014he could sense that something was off.The surroundings\u2014it was too quiet.Summer nights were especially full with activities: the small electrical fan above the door groaning and squeaking as it swiveled from side to side, the mosquitos droning tiresomely at people's ears, the water tap next door dripping onto the sink, the stray cat mewing as it hurried across the plant beds downstairs, the snoring of his roommate in the bed opposite\u2026Tonight, all of it was gone.The whole world suddenly lost its sounds, and became unprecedentedly, and eerily silent.If it were not for the faint music playing in his earphone, Zhang Heng might have presumed that he had lost his hearing.Borrowing the dim light coming from the screen of the MP3, Zhang Heng peered at the time on his watch.It was now 00:01.Usually, the people in the dorm opposite theirs would still be up playing League of Legends and their loud hurrahs at their completion of a brilliant kill or narrow escape were perceptible through the thin walls separating the rooms.Zhang Heng also noticed something else unusual\u2014the date display on the right side of the watch face, instead of changing along with the time, remained the same as yesterday.An idea popped into his mind, and he jumped off his bed\u2014he had gone to bed fully-clothed.His laptop lit up in the dark, and in less than seven seconds, the QQ login interface popped up. But Zhang Heng's attention was not on the main portion of the screen.\u00a0His gaze was on the toolbar at the bottom.00:002017/9/20Wasn't it the last moment of yesterday?Zhang Heng waited for a moment, and then pressed his fingertips against his wrist, and counted to 200. That was seventy-two beats per minute. Two minutes had passed yet the time on his monitor remained at 00.00.Zhang Heng's raised an eyebrow at this, but made no hasty conclusions.He walked to the bed opposite his and shook the sleeping Chen Huadong who was the lightest sleeper in the dorm. Normally, someone getting off their bed to get a drink of water would have startled him but this time, no matter how hard Zhang Heng shook him, he remained unresponsive.\"I'm sorry, bro. Although I don't have a girlfriend, I'm not the kind of person you may think I am.\"Zhang Heng put his finger under his friend's nostrils and tried to have fun in such a weird atmosphere.This guy's mental state was rather excellent.After five minutes, Zhang Heng still could not detect any breath.If this was part of the prank, then Chen Huadong's breath-holding ability was out of this world. He could even break the Guinness World Record.So, Zhang Heng did the same, testing his two other roommates' breath.The results were the same as Chen Huadong's.Zhang Heng could say for certain that he really was facing a scientifically unexplainable otherworldly phenomenon.He was in a time zone that should not exist.An example would be like the river of time had purposely branched out another stream just for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng pushed the door of his dorm opened. The hallway was quiet, it felt like he walking in one of those hospital morgues, with only the sound of his footsteps echoing.The door to the opposite dorm was left ajar and there was a bright light pouring from it. Zhang Heng stuck his head in to take a look and saw four people engrossed in a computer game.On the screen, their characters were pursuing a low health point\u00a0Annie1. The skills emitted were suspended in mid-air, and the excited expressions on their faces were unmoving like four very life-like statues.Zhang Heng noticed an alarm clock on of their desks\u2014the time showed 00.00.After that, he went around to all the other dorms on the same floor.Some of them were locked before their tenants went to bed, so he could not enter them. The ones he did enter were all the same, all frozen at the very last moment of the day.In the bathroom, someone was huffing away while hiding from the dormitory caretaker. The sparks from the cigarette butt were clear as stars but they were not spreading, and the smoke the person exhaled from the corner of his mouth was suspended in the air.Zhang Heng could not help but take out his phone and took a picture of this magical scene.When he was clicking on the camera shutter, he made another interesting discovery\u2014in this world where the time had stopped moving, it was not only the people who were on pause, the things all around also remained in the state it was in at the very last second of the day.Just like that skill in mid-air, the electric fan in standstill, and now, this cigarette that never burns out.But there were also exceptions.To test his theory, Zhang Heng plucked the cigarette out from between the person's fingers.When the tab was tucked in between his fingers, it began to continue burning.So that was how it was.In this space of time, where he was the only one who could move about, anything that he touches would continue to function as usual, just like this cigarette, and his cell phone, computer, and MP3 player. The only thing was that the time displayed on the screens remained unchanged.However, this trick did not seem to work on humans. Earlier on, he had shaken Chen Huadong to wake him but his friend had remained unresponsive.Then what about all the other living creatures other than humans?Intrigued, Zhang Heng returned to his room, turned on the torchlight on his phone and went near his roommates. After two minutes, using his 20MP soft-light dual camera in the pitch-black room, he finally found his what he was looking for\u2014the most commonly seen, most detested creature in the summer\u2014mosquito.Once this insect enters your room, you can forget about having a peaceful night.Zhang Heng's dorm was on the third floor, which was considered quite close to the ground. At this height, the mosquito did not need to take the lift to move into their room. To keep those pests away, people resorted to all kinds of repellents: lighting up mosquito-repellent incense, applying repellent sprays, hand mosquito nets, et cetera. But there were always one or two fugitives.This particular mosquito was lurking next to Dorm Leader Wei Jiangyan's pillow, waiting for its chance to enjoy a full meal.Unfortunately for the insect, its dream was about to be crushed tonight.Zhang Heng reached out a hand, plucked the mosquito from the air by its wings, and then place it on his palm.The insect maintained its mid-flying posture like a most dedicated actor\u2014ignoring the target that was near to it.\"It looks like it doesn't work on animals either.\"Once the experiment was over, Zhang Heng crushed the mosquito and successfully eliminated the pest.Alas, now that he had explored the building, it was time to go out and take a look.He went to the bathroom and washed away tall traces of the crushed insect, and then continued his walk downstairs.The caretaker lady on duty was standing by the door holding a large U-shaped locked. She was probably locking up.Now, this was another distinguishing feature of higher education institutions, although some other universities had very different managerial styles on dormitory.Zhang Heng's school had a twelve o'clock curfew. But if the students for some reason had to return late, they could always wake the caretaker by tapping on her window.They would be allowed to return to their rooms once their details were taken down. Nonetheless, if this happened frequently, the student would be reprimanded and punished.Zhang Heng walked past the caretaker without so much as breaking a sweat. On a normal day, she would have stopped and questioned him.But right now, she seemed to have suddenly developed the ability to see through things. Her eyes were focused on the handle of the door, past Zhang Heng's body, as if a living person had not just walked past in front of her.That was how Zhang Heng strolled out of the dormitory building. He raised his head to take a look at the night sky as he walked through the empty campus, and finally came to the school gate.It was much busier here.While the campus was not very big, it was in a pretty good location, sitting on the edge of the third ring road, facing the main road.Nights in the city were especially long.The fried pancake stall on the overpass was packed with customers. Many of the white-collar workers who had just left their offices stopped by for supper on their way home. Not far away, a street cleaner was quietly sweeping the walkway. Under the platform, two bald uncles in suits and leather shoes were talking into their phones as they waited for the very late night-bus.\u00a0Behind them, in a twenty-four-hour convenience store, a girl with a bear hairclip sitting at the counter yawned\u2026At precisely 00:00, they froze synchronically.It was like pressing the pause button while watching a movie.The cars speeding on the road had all went still.Zhang Heng had seen what this city looked like at midnight the one time he went to the train station to pick up a friend.But this was the first time he was able to observe it up close.He could see the green onions that the pancake hawker was sprinkling onto the dish, the street cleaner's calloused hands and darkened complexion, the bald uncle's oily nose and the picture of his one-month-old baby on the screen of his phone, the idol poster that the girl behind the counter hid under the cash register\u2026All these little details that were overlooked every day now stood out to Zhang Heng.It was as if he was getting to know the city all over again.Zhang Heng used his WeChat to unlock a mobike. While riding through the city, he also tested his presumptions.Before the hour hand on his watch had completed its second rotation, he hurried back to his dorm before the caretaker lady could lock the door.At 00:00, Zhang Heng was not wearing any earphones.The next second, sounds and noises poured into his ears like water.\"Nice! I'm going to kill that person! I can finally use my Infinite Blade!\"\"Push tower! They don't dare to go against us!\"\"I can't! I have to go back and replenish my hp!\"\u2026The electric fan above the door creaked as it oscillated. Outside the window, a feral cat wailed. In the hallway outside, slippers slapped the floor as someone ran past. Zhang Heng who had not closed his night for more than a day was finally overcome exhaustion. After plugging in his phone to the charger, he threw himself onto his bed and entered dreamland.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Hey, did you girls hear? A media senior girl lied to a freshman about an internship opportunity but when she arrived at the place, she found out that she had been tricked into drinking with other men. They even took naked pictures of her. Yesterday night, that senior's dormmate suddenly disappeared. Her roommate said that she saw her go to bed. But she vanished just like that.\"\"I heard that too! All the girls in Block Two are freaking out. They searched the entire campus but didn't find her. Then the police called the school and asked the head of the university to go to the station. Apparently, someone sent all her dirt to the authorities. Among them were two pictures that had close shots on her. But, it seemed like the person in the picture did not realize that there was a camera in front of her. This is just weird.\"\"Speaking of weird, isn't the Wumart twelve o'clock legend even scarier?\"\"What twelve o'clock legend?\"\"How can you not know about that? It has been spreading around the campus like a wildfire! Every Monday, exactly at midnight, a bottle of Nescafe coffee would go missing at that Wumart near the library, and every time, there would be exactly 4.50 yuan in the cash register. The two cashiers who work there are scared to death! When they looked at the surveillance videos, the coffee just vanished in split seconds. There was no one in the videos.\"\"Wow! Just hearing the story gives me the chills.\"A group of girls chatted as they passed by Zhang Heng who was fussing with a newly acquired Sony compact camera.For a month now, since he found out that he had extra twenty-four hours, he had been experimenting and got the hang of this newfound ability.That media senior incident was just something he came across. He was just merely trying his hand.If he prepared well, he could incite\u00a0World War III1\u00a0if he wanted to.Of course, doing that would not benefit him in any way.Other than that, he could also walk down the street with a fire axe and hack away at all the ATMs. He could become a Top 100 millionaire overnight! He could also just steal one yuan from every person's wallet, and earn twenty million while inflicting the smallest impact.But for the time being, he had no need in this regard.To a sophomore, thirty-thousand yuan allowance was more than enough. He would not know where to spend the extra money.His family did not need financial support from him\u2014forget about his parents that were focusing on their research in another country; his grandfather was the first batch of university students during the reintroduction of\u00a0gaokao1\u00a0in 77.\u00a0After graduation, he became a senior engineer of a water conservatory project. Now that he was retired, he had a pension and a retirement home with a courtyard where he planted his own crops and play chess. He was currently very contented with his life.As a matter of fact, now that he was familiar with his abilities, Zhang Heng did not need to break the law to earn money.Take his recent participation in the photography club, for example. Next month, a major photography competition with the theme 'city impression' was taking place. The senior in charge managed to find pretty good sponsorships, so the first place winner would be getting five thousand yuan and a Canon EF 17-40mm f/4L wide-angle zoom lens, and the second and third place winner would be getting three thousand yuan each along with some prizes.Having joined the club late, Zhang Heng had only been to two classes and one seminar. He was still heavily reliant on the internet to learn.\u00a0His progress was currently only at composition and exposure. During Zhang Heng's private twenty-four hours, everyone would be standing still for him to take pictures of them. To an ordinary photographer, it was a golden opportunity. Without any editing, the pictures of all those frozen moments were enough to touch someone's heart.Since his skills were still insubstantial\u2014he was still perplexed by color warmth and depth of field. But through his lens, the city had a certain unusual charm about it.Zhang Heng had picked out two of the more satisfactory photos from the shots he took last night and signed up for the competition.He was not necessarily eyeing the prizes, but to that he could to gauge his own progress.Ever since he found out about the extra time he had, instead of slowing down, Zhang Heng became even busier.In the beginning, it was mainly because he was testing and experimenting. For example, would the objects that he touched break away from complete stillness? Would it resume its stillness after he had stopped being in contact with the object? How much area did this stop-in-time cover? Was it limited only to this city? He bought a plane ticket to fly to a place one thousand miles away on a Saturday\u2026Through these experiments, he was able to find the answers to most of these questions. For now, he had no way of verifying the more difficult ones.After that, he had to figure out what to do with the extra twenty-four hours.First was sleep, which was necessary. He used to sleep at midnight.Early on, his curiosity would bring him all over the city for the entire day. But once he got used to it, he could not do it anymore.In the twenty-four hours when everyone was motionless, and the time on his wrist continued to move, his physical needs were still present and he still experienced hunger, thirst, discomfort, and exhaustion from a full day of activity.\"Hmm, does this mean that I would age faster than normal?\" Zhang Heng stared at his own reflection in the mirror. Unfortunately, this was a question he would not be able to answer in the short term.After all the time he spent eating and sleeping, he had about fourteen hours left. His remaining period of time was enough for him to do plenty of things like reading. Perhaps it was his theologian parents' influence that caused him to be interested in all kinds of bizarre knowledge. Previously, because of time limitations, he could only read a book a week. Now, he had made a new arrangement and was dedicating six hours every Monday and Wednesday to reading.The bright and spacious library had become exclusively his. He did not need to book a place in advance or sit next to a strange person\u2014he could even visit the library in his pajamas and flip flops.An interesting book, paired with a cup of cold coffee was enough to pass some meaningful time.Other than that, Zhang Heng even picked up the rock-climbing hobby he had abandoned and added a new one, photography to his list of hobbies. He continued to attend classes as usual, and then practice and consolidate what he had learned in his own time.He had continued to practice in the shooting range and his coach was constantly surprised by his incredible progress every week. He was even encouraged to seriously consider the possibility of expanding in this area.Of course, Zhang Heng's favorite activity was his nightly city roams. Every day, he would spend at least two hours walking around town.The big city at midnight held many secrets.Zhang Heng took advantage of the frozen time and his camera, quietly observing every corner of the city, as if he was watching a stop-motion film. Most of the time he was just a silent observer, but on occasion, he would take action to change some of the circumstances that he did not like very much.These changes had nothing to do with good or evil. He had no interest in playing God or the devil. He was simply enjoying the time that belonged only to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThursday afternoons were set aside for staring into space.This time every week, he would normally refrain from being involved in any work or activities. Instead he would burrow in a place of his liking and waste his time away to his heart's content.These places could be the park, the temple, the museum\u2026 and, of course, it could also be a maid caf\u00e9 like the one he was in right now.Just the eye-candies in that place alone made it Zhang Heng's favorite place\u2014which was also why this was the place he went to daydream most frequently.\"A cup of Forbidden Love, and a plate of\u00a0Gege1\u00a0Can't Do It Today, thanks.\" Zhang Heng tried to keep a straight face and not give away the fact that he had no idea what he was ordering.\"Yes, Master. Please hold on.\" The maid with cat ears answered subserviently, hugging the tray she was holding to her chest.Professional! Zhang Heng gave her a big mental thumbs up. The maids working in the caf\u00e9 were mostly part-time university students\u2014a major topic of discussion among the neet community.In comparison, the owner of that maid caf\u00e9 down Chun Xi Road was less sincere in his efforts. He employed a whole bunch of ladies in their thirties and forties to make up for the number. It was even said that the owner himself would pitch in when they were short-staffed, torturing his customers' mental wellbeing with his thick bush of leg hair. Dining there was more like volunteering for torture.While he waited for his orders to arrive, Zhang Heng picked out a copy of 'Shokugeki no Soma1' from the rack nearby. He was flipping through the pages when someone said, \"What a pity. I prefer his former works.\"Zhang Heng looked up and found a stranger in the form of a small old man in a\u00a0Tang suit1\u00a0paired with a tie and a homburg sitting across the table. His unremarkable, half eastern-half western dressing gave him an uncanny appearance.All eyes in the caf\u00e9 were drawn to this strange little man.Zhang Heng's eyebrows rose to his forehead. \"Shun Saeki1? He used to be a Bilibili mangaka.\"\"Then it looks like my memory does not fool me.\" The old man grinned, revealing a row of yellowed teeth. \"So, how has this month been, Zhang Heng? Are you pleased with my little gift? Don't worry. That thing that you're worried about won't happen. The extra twenty-four hours is a gift. It won't deduct your lifespan.\"\"Did you do something to me?\"\"That's not easy for me to do. But you are the one that I choose, it is only right for me to give you a gift. Isn't that right?\"The old man reached out and picked up the cup of Forbidden Love from the serving tray a maid walking past was carrying, startling the waitress.Zhang Heng smiled at the girl apologetically. \"Thank you. We won't be needing anything for the time being.\"\"I won't take advantage of you. After we've finished our conversation, you'll still be able to drink your beverage.\" The old man mumbled something unintelligible and then said, \"Now, let's get down to business. I'm quite pleased with your performance this month. Now, since the trial period is over, let's discuss the conditions of transfer.\"\"Conditions of transfer?\"\"Yes, simply put, I need you to help me win the next round of game. This game will bring you a generous return. Other than that, you can still continue to use that little gift I gave you.\"When the old man saw Zhang Heng open his mouth to speak, the old man waved him off. \"I know your family's situation. Money is not very attractive to you. Not to mention, with this ability, it's going to be effortless for you to acquire money. But trust me, the things that this game can bring you is beyond your imagination.\"\"What game?\" Zhang Heng asked.\"In the distant past, we used to employ war to solve conflicts. It's simple and effective. My god, how I miss those good ol' bloody days. But the times continued to develop and change, and a civilized society shouldn't be using those barbaric, primitive means, right?\" The old man paused, and proceeded to gulp down the entire cup of Forbidden Love. \"Which is why nowadays, we use games to decide the winnings or losses. The person sitting on the throne right now is that despicable bloke; because of the ancient pledge, I cannot reveal the content of the game in advance. Strictly speaking, this meeting is also prohibited. But don't worry. I can handle this little problem.\"\"If this game is so important, why don't you participate in it yourself?\"\"Like I said, I'm restricted by some ancient pledge, we cannot participate in the games ourselves. You are like my representative. I'm betting all my chips on you. When you win, I win; but if you lose, I lose too. The both of us are like locusts tied to the same rope. We're on the same boat. But I don't have very good luck. My rankings in the game have been pretty bad recently.\" The old man sighed. \"As you can see, I am growing weaker. So, this time, I've decided to limit my bets earlier even though it's a big risk, and you might be eliminated halfway.\"\"Who are you?\" Zhang Heng studied the man.\"For the time being, you can think of me as your investor and partner. As for the future, I can only tell you one thing\u2014the longer you persist in this game, the closer you will be to the truth about this world. Alright, we don't have much time. Now, tell me your answer.\"Zhang Heng looked at the old man in the eye. He has just been given a long speech that sounded very absurd with the maid caf\u00e9's atmosphere.\u00a0But the fact that the old man knew his name and had good insight into what had happened to him, this comically dressed old man was not joking.Zhang Heng thought about it for a moment before answering, \"Sounds interesting. How do I join?\"\"It's very simple. Let me find the checkpoint closest to your school\u2026\" The old man took out a Xiaomi cell phone from his pocket and opened the Baidu Maps app. \"Sex and the City bar, checkpoint 137, eleven o'clock tonight. You don't regret this decision. Oh, I almost forgot.\" The old man reached out a hand. \"The last step: concluding the contract. Once we shake hands, you belong to me.\"Zhang Heng put out his right hand. \"Please refrain from using these terrible, ambiguous statements. I'm already starting to regret it.\"When they shook hands, Zhang Heng felt as if he was holding onto a hard, icy rock.The old man was in good spirits. \"Be careful of other representatives. You probably won't meet at the initial stage of the game. But no matter what happens, you have to prioritize survival.\" (Editor Note: Omg why does this remind me of Mirai Nikki?)\"Wait a minute. You can die in this game?\"\"No, just dead in the game. To be precise, it's more like disappear. Your physical body will disappear and all the memory related to you will disappear as if none of it ever existed. I happen to know a guy who's an expert in this.\" The old man said in the most casual manner.\"\u2026\"Zhang Heng was about to say something when his eyes dimmed for a moment, and the old man suddenly vanished right in front of him.A maid walked up to his table with a deep red beverage, her smile revealing to cute pointy little fangs.\"Master, your Forbidden Love. Please enjoy.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was 9:45 when he pushed the door open to see Zhang Heng in sportswear, bending down to tie his shoelaces. \"\"Yeah, there's an activity tonight.\"\"Activity? Is it a date?\" Wei Jiangyang shot his roommate a knowing smile.Chen Huadong who was enjoying a bottle of coke with his movie gasped. \"What? Young Master Zhang, am I not the person you like?\"Ma Wei, the oldest among the roommates, put down the English book he was reading. \"Zhang Heng, you have such good qualities, it should be really easy for you to get a girlfriend, yet you've remained single. If we're not roommates, I would've thought that you're actually gay.\"Ma Wei's lament was not unjustified. Among the four roommates, his family's circumstance was the least favorable\u2014with his parents being only simple-minded farmers.There was a girl back in high school whom he secretly liked. He never told anyone about until the one time this group of roommates took him out to celebrate his birthday and he drank too much. That was when his roommates found out that that girl Ma Wei liked was studying in a university in the same city. They urged him to confess his feelings for her, and he was rejected.They all knew of Ma Wei's family's circumstances, and that he had to rely on the China National Scholarship to pay for his tuition fee and to lighten his family's financial burden. He buried himself in his studies, spending all his free hours either in the library or giving private tuition to earn money. He had no time for dating.These were things that other people could not help him with. Ma Wei had very strong self-esteem. He would always refuse his dormmates' offer to pay for him whenever they went out.Zhang Heng patted Ma Wei on the shoulder and said, \"Stop teasing me. There's no date tonight, and I'm not gay. I just haven't met a girl that I like yet.\"Chen Huadong raised the bottle of coke as if he was giving a toast. \"When you finally meet her, you must bring her to meet us. We want to see what kind of succubus can capture our Young Master Zhang's heart.\"\u2026It took Zhang Heng quite a while to wrestle his nosy friends off his back. By the time he walked out of the school gate, it was already 10:05.If he had not found the string of numbers on his right arm while he was in the shower, Zhang Heng might have suspected that incident at the maid caf\u00e9 to be a delusion.The cute little maid with the cat ears had confirmed that from the moment he walked into the store up until the moment he left, he had been alone, and the handsome lady in charge of making the drinks revealed that she had only made a cup of Forbidden Love during that short period of time.\"Never ever doubt a bartender because every cup is filled with the thing called love. People never forget the things they love,\" the latter had said.\"\u2026\"To everyone in the caf\u00e9, his conversation with the old man had never happened.That Tang suit and homburg wearing guy did mention that their meeting was forbidden and that he could take care of the problem.Zhang Heng postulated that this could very well be the solution he was talking about.Zhang Heng was growing more and more curious by this guy. All his abilities seemed to be related to time. But this was not the time to think about this; right now, what he needed to was to get through that game that was about to begin.Once he was outside of school, he followed the navigation on Baidu and took the subway to an industrial area outside 5th Ring Road, then jogged the rest of the way to warm up.He arrived at the bar called 'Sex and the City' at 10:45.It was in a remote area, and on the way there, Zhang Heng walked past a couple of people who looked like trouble with their cigarettes hanging on the corner of their mouth and their eyes seizing him up. There were even a few scantily-clad, drunk girls throwing up on the side of the road.Zhang Heng wanted no trouble so he pulled his hood up over hid head, and kept a steady but swift pace as he jogged past them.The bar was even more crowded than he imagined it to be. It was converted from an abandoned factory, so it was huge. The rusty fa\u00e7ade was painted with all kinds and styles of strange graffiti, and the front of the building was parked full of luxury cars and racecars.This was the peak business hour for the bar\u2014the young people from all over the city had gathered here.Before he even stepped into the building, Zhang Heng could hear deafening music booming from inside, as if it could rip his soul apart. Zhang Heng frowned. Even though his companion at the caf\u00e9 had stressed that he could not reveal anything to Zhang Heng and that he would find out everything once he was deep into the game, there was a vague message in between the lines.Whatever it was, the organization that old man was involved in must be ancient and very well hidden. This was not their first time coordinating a game like this yet the world did not even know that they existed.This indicated that they were doing a good job covering their tracks.However, there were at least seven to eight hundred people here. There were thighs and buttocks everywhere he turned. Cool laser lights were blinking and pulsing along with the deejay's mix. If that supposedly dangerous game commenced here, Zhang Heng was willing to bet that it would all over TikTok and YouTube.Could the address he was given be wrong?This was a common mistake, especially considering that old man's age. It really would not be surprising.Just then, Zhang Heng's attention was suddenly drawn to a dark shadow above him on the right.Technically speaking, that was not considered a second floor. It was just a giant container fastened with steel structures to the west wall. At the bottom of the ladder that led up to it stood two brawny men in suits and black sunglasses.A couple of gin-soaked boys and girls made an attempt to climb the ladder but was turned away by the two men.One of them, probably a\u00a0fuerdai\u00a0from a wealthy family, threw a handful of banknotes at the face of one of the guards. When the other around him realized that they were hundred-dollar American bills, they began snatching at the scattered papers.But neither of the buff men reacted.The\u00a0fuerdai\u00a0appeared to be provoked by this and threw contents of the glass in his hands at both men. He was probably so used to getting his way that he bolted for the ladders. Whatever happened next was a blur. He was suddenly sent flying across the room, knocking over a few people and some tables. He landed on the ground with his face covered in blood and dirt, barely alive.His drunk companions were shocked into sobriety. Some of the guys wanted to throw in a few hostile words but when they saw one of the guards methodically cleaning his sunglasses, their balls shrank and they fled to the parking lot carrying their unconscious\u00a0fuerdai\u00a0friend.As the commotion subsided, the people in the bar cast wary glances at the two strapping men, keeping a good distance from them.Zhang Heng waited for another five minutes, and when he was sure that no one was paying attention, he took in a deep breath and walked towards the ladder.The two men in suits watched him with from behind their glasses. Their stony faces gave off a glacial vibe. Zhang Heng felt as if he was the victim of two lions on the prowl. He rolled up his sleeves, and revealed the numbers on his arm.He was a little worried remembering what happened to that\u00a0fuerdai. Even though he had an inkling that the numbers on his arm was the entrance ticket to the game, he could not rule out other possibilities.Luckily, nothing bad happened. He did not end up like that\u00a0fuerdai\u00a0as a human bowling ball.The two towering giants stepped aside and revealed the path behind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng climbed up the stairs and pushed the blue steel door open.Considering everything he had seen on his way to the bar and the group of young men and women swaying their bodies downstairs, he thought that while the style might be different, it was not going to be that much different in the dance room either.However, in reality, this place was more like VIP lounges at international airports.When he pushed the door open, Zhang Heng felt as if he had stepped into another world. Soft lights, red Persian rug, leather sofa, silverwares on the side table, light refreshments and fruits laid out on the buffet table, and a small bar counter on the right. When the door closed behind him, a gentle and soothing piano music entered his ears.The pounding music downstairs had probably exceeded 100 decibels. Even though he was not a professional, Zhang Heng knew that material of a container had next to none soundproofing property.But the truth was right in front of him\u2014when the door shut behind him, the noise outside was completely cut off.Perhaps it was because Zhang Heng had recently experienced something even more inconceivable than this, he seemed to have developed a certain immunity to similar events. He quickly regained his composure and continued forwards after only a brief moment of doubt.\"Welcome,\" the woman in a red evening gown standing behind the bar greeted.Zhang Heng looked around the room, and saw that other than himself, there were about another dozen of people in the lounge. Some were seated in banquettes not far from where he was standing, chatting away while others sat alone. But what puzzled him was that even though the person nearest to him was only about a few meters away, he could not see their faces clearly.It was a very strange experience. He could sense that there was nothing wrong with his eyesight, and his retinas were able to form a clear image but there was something that was preventing the signal from reaching his brain.Zhang Heng refused to believe in this nonsense, and tried very hard to concentrate. He was feeling like he was about to break through the invisible barrier when a nauseous feeling suddenly surged from his stomach. He had to hold onto the bar to keep himself from falling.Right on cue, a glass of lemon water was placed in front of him.\"Relax. This is something all the new players who had just arrived here experiences. Unless the other party allows it, the faces of the players are, by default, in incognito mode. As a matter of fact, your voices have also undergone a special process. What you hear is not the actual voice. This is to protect you to the greatest extent.\"\"But I can see your face.\" Zhang Heng picked up the water and thanked the bartender. Because of the dim lights and the fact that he was distracted by the others, he only just realized that the bartender looked very familiar. She was wearing lipstick and a different outfit. She looked as different as night and day but Zhang Heng recognized her. \"You are\u2026 the bartender from the maid caf\u00e9?\"\"Not bad. Your observation skills are sharper than I expected.\" The bartender was wiping a glass cup. She was still as frosty as she was earlier today. \"No one stipulated that one person can only work one job, right? By the way, I'm just a receptionist here. I don't need to conceal my face like players do.\"\"I'm sorry. Since I walked in, you kept mentioning words like 'players 'and 'receptionist'. Forgive me for being forthright but I have no clue what game it is that I'm joining. Blackjack? Texas Hold'em? Legends of the Three Kingdoms? E-sports?\" Zhang Heng asked as he settled down on the stool in front of the bar.\"I normally don't like to brag about my employer in front of the customers, actually, I don't like bragging about that at any time, but this time, I have to say\u2014congratulations, Mr. Zhang Heng. You're very lucky to be a part of the greatest game in the history of mankind. I can promise you that all the other games that you've ever played before this are weak and pathetic. This game will completely change your life.\"\"That is a rather high evaluation.\"\"Oh, quite the contrary. No compliment can compare to the game itself. Now, it's your turn to answer one of my questions. What do you think makes a person truly himself?\"The bartender put down the now sparkling glass. Her expression was solemn.Zhang Heng took a sip of the lemon water and then answered, \"DNA?\"\"That's not wrong. Each of us has a unique set of DNA, and some parts of our bodies have been coded since birth. Your looks, family, family history of illness\u2026 But fortunately, even then we still have a lot of choices\u2014you can go to university, work, build a career, become a primary school teacher or astronaut or something.\"There was a strange flash of light in the bartender's eyes, and she was speaking faster. \"Put aside all those things that had already been determined\u2026 Let me phrase my question more accurately\u2014What do you think makes a person who he is today? For example, how is it that astronauts could walk in space? How could a boxer knock his opponent down on stage? What is it that makes a teacher pick up teaching aids?\"\"Experience? You're talking about experience and learning that makes us who we are today?\" Zhang Heng quickly understood what the bartender was trying to convey. Cocking his brows, Zhang Heng commented, \"But I still don't get what this has to do with me joining the game.\"This time, however, he did not get any answers.\"No amount of words can describe what you can witness yourself. Mr. Zhang Heng, your first round has begun. Please cherish this hard-to-come-by experience. I look forward to meeting you again.\" The bartender winked knowingly at him.The hour hand on the clock on the wall was pointed at eleven.The next thing he knew was a strong dizzy feeling rushed to his head and caused his vision to blur again.Had he fallen into a trap?!Zhang Heng's first reaction was to suspect that the lemon water. That was the only thing he had tasted. From the moment he set foot into the bar, he had been on high alert. He never expected to see a familiar face\u2014and that caused him to let his guard down a little. He did not know when it happened, or what powerful anesthetics was added that one little sip could have such a powerful effect. He could feel his head getting heavier and heavier until he could not resist anymore, and allowed himself to collapse onto the bar until he was completely unconscious.He did not know how much time had passed in between, was it days, hours or seconds?A stranger's voice rang in his ear.[Verifying player's identity\u2026][Identity confirmed.

    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng's eyes fluttered open and he found himself lying face down on a foreign beach.The saline waters bathing him was soaking into his clothes, as a hermit shell in a conch shell scurried past in front of him.Zhang Heng was in a terrible condition. Upon regaining his consciousness, he was gripped by an intense thirst and hunger, overcome with exhaustion. It felt like he had been drifting in the ocean for days.He found a dry spot and plopped down against a large rock facing the direction where he was washed ashore\u2014all he could see was a vast, boundless ocean.What is this? Some survival reality TV-show film set?Maybe it was the after-effects of that lemon water, or maybe because he had not eaten for too long, Zhang Heng's head felt heavy and groggy. Forcing himself to calm down, he began to mull over everything that had happened to him.He had done as that strange fellow in Tang suit had requested, and had come to this\u00a0Sex and the City\u00a0bar as the old man's representative to participate in some obscure game. When he finally found the person, he was drugged, and then cast on this desert island.But the question was\u2014how would doing this benefit them? And that mysterious voice he heard in his head just now, the one that sounded like a game login, did he imagine it? If that was not the case then what did it mean?His body was still his, but the sports attire he was wearing had been replaced with a pair of beach shorts and a floral T-shirt. The swiss knife he was carrying in his pocket for emergencies was nowhere to be found either.The only item that had not gone missing from his person was that watch on his right wrist.Zhang Heng looked down at his watch and froze momentarily.The date on the analog face had not changed\u2014it remained on Thursday, the same night he visited the bar, and it had only been a minute since he had blacked out.Zhang Heng looked at his watch again and noticed that the seconds hand was not moving.Was it broken?That was a surprise. He had done one too many experiments on the watch and found that it could never be adjusted and that the time on the watch was always accurate. He was the only one who could see the extra twelve hours on the watch face and no matter what he did\u2014subjecting it to fire or soaking it in water\u2014the watch could not be damaged or destroyed. It was so durable it was unlike anything from this world.Once, he even threw the watch from the top of a building down onto the concrete pavement 200 meters down below. In the end, the watch survived the fall without a scratch, and even made a dent in the hard, concrete surface.He was convinced that the watch would outlive him and continue ticking until the end of the world. He never thought that there would come a day that it would ever stop functioning\u2026But in his panic, he was suddenly struck by a thought. Again, his mind returned to that mysterious voice in his head. The person had mentioned that the time flow rate was 480.Zhang Heng raised his eyebrows. Could the person have meant it literally?If anyone else wanted to verify this, they may have to wait for the forty days to be up. But Zhang Heng had his own way to do that.He pressed his fingers against the inside of his wrist and, after twenty minutes, confirmed a frightening thing\u2014his watch was not broken. It was just moving according to the real-world time. When converted to the time here, one second was now eight minutes.So\u2026 this really was just a game?Zhang Heng was stumped. The scenery before him was so realistic\u2014the golden sand, the coconut trees swaying in the wind, the drenched T-shirt clinging to his body, the uneven rock surface that was causing his back to ache, the hunger and enervation that shrouded him so that he feels the passing of life so clearly it was almost tangible.In any case, his priority right now was to find a way to recover some physical strength.Right now, thinking alone required a whole lot of effort.He knew he needed to eat and rehydrate.\u00a0But although he was mentally stronger than most people, he was still just an ordinary university student. A modern man like him had no clue how to live on a desert island; he could not distinguish which plant was edible and which one was not, he did not even know how to hunt, or look for water source, how to build a shelter\u2026Thank god, though, that at least he recognized the coconut tree.There were some twenty meters to his left, with a couple of the fruits hanging from the trees still green. The water inside could quench his parched tongue and throat, and the flesh could provide him with much-needed energy and vitamins.Zhang Heng picked up a small rock the size of his palm at his feet and aimed it at a leaning coconut tree that may have been swept sideways by a typhoon.He managed to dislodge the coconuts with the rock.There were seven of them, about three to four meters above the ground.Normally, a task like this would not have been difficult at all, but considering his current physical condition, it took Zhang Heng a lot of effort to knock those coconuts down.By the time he cracked these green coconuts open, one by one, on the rock to get to the water inside, half an hour had already passed. After he had drained the fruit, Zhang Heng scraped the meat of the coconut with a rock and scarfed them down. When he was done, some of his energy returned, allowing him to consider his current plight.He could no longer tell if he was in a game or in the real world.If this was all make-believe, it did not explain realness of the senses he was experiencing and his physical state, nor the strange flow rate on his watch; but if he was in the real world, then how could whoever who got him here get him from his dorm to this deserted island in a blink of an eye?Zhang Heng shook his head to clear his mind. He would just do it the old way\u2014set the unsolvable questions aside first.Like what the old man in the caf\u00e9 said, whether this was a game or reality, he needed to figure out a way to survive.He was just an average modern person who lived on his own in the city. Could he really be able to overcome this enigmatic natural world veiled in mystery?Zhang Heng's lips drew upwards into a bitter smile. He had always been a glass-half-full kind of guy but in his current circumstance, Zhang Heng was not convinced that he could hold out for forty-days on this remote little island behind him.As a matter of fact, even four days would be a stretch.He lacked the knowledge and skills to survive out here in the wild, he was in a poor physical state, and he was all alone. Right now, Zhang Heng kind of hoped that he was in a game. Because, normally, an outstanding game should not have sure-death circumstance, especially since this was just the beginning of a novice checkpoint.As if in response to his expectation, three little black dots appeared in the distant waves.Zhang Heng tossed the coconut shell in his hand aside and got to his feet. Shielding the top of his head from the hot sun, he sprinted towards the beach as fast as he could. He squinted his eyes to focus on the dots, who were actually three people floating in the waters.They were all foreigners\u2014male.One of them was dressed, from head to toe, in Gore-Tex and hiking boots, and he had what looked like a dagger hanging from his waist. The wind and waves were too big for Zhang Heng to be sure. Among the three of them, he was the one who seemed the calmest. The other two were an expressionless laddie in shorts, and a stark-naked bald uncle.The three of them were in a precarious situation, as they struggled to get ashore. For some mysterious reason, the only thing they could do was float, as the current pulled them back.Zhang Heng knew that he had to make a decision. Although the coconut had helped his body recover some energy, saving three people in one breath was not realistic. Right now, his strength only allowed him to attempt to rescue one of the three people.In the end, he decided to save the naked fella for a very simple reason\u2014he was nearest to the shore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Zhang Heng dragged the buck-naked man to the beach, both of them were ready to drop.Zhang Heng did not even know how he even managed to swim the final stretch of water. It was only when he knew near the man that he found out that the man's lumbar spine was injured, and there was a tear on his thigh where a coral had pierced him. The man could barely move; no wonder he had to drift along with the wave like a plastic bottle.Getting him back to the beach was not going to be an easy task.On the way back, Zhang Heng considered giving up several times, but the man was surprisingly optimistic and even cheered him on.So, Zhang Heng gritted his teeth and dragged the man to shore.For a while, the both of them slumped on the sand. Zhang Heng did not want to move at all, not even to lift a finger. If he could, he would have shut his eyes and dozed off.But after about two minutes, the man in the buff spoke. \"Hey, bro. We can't stay like this. We're not far from the equator. At midday, the temperature could go up to as high as 35 degrees. We'll lose a lot of water if we keep this up.\"Zhang Heng said nothing a minute before replying, \"I'll bring you to a shady area now.\" Then he took in two deep breaths, gathered up all the strength in his body and pulled the man to the bottom of a cliff where he used his own t-shirt to bandage the man's wound.After that, Zhang Heng was completely drained of energy\u2014he could barely even throw a stone. Fortunately, not far from where they were, he picked up a couple of coconuts that had fallen to the ground.When the bald man saw Zhang Heng about to break the coconut, he opened his mouth to speak, but then stopped himself.\"Oh?\"\"I don't want to seem like I'm ungrateful or anything but if you can, please give me only green coconuts? The ones that have fallen from the tree are old. The milk-white water inside can cause diarrhea when consumed. On a resourceless island like this, it could be fatal.\"\"You seem to know a lot about survival in the wilderness.\"\"I served in the military for a while. I once spent more than two years crossing the Amazon forest, so, yes, I suppose I can be considered an expert in terms of surviving in the wilderness.\"Zhang Heng realized that he had made the right bet. There was no way that a well-made game would leave the players in a sure-death circumstance. The man in front of him was his hope of surviving on this island.However, he could not help but wonder what the other two people could do.After all, in terms of difficulty, saving this bald man was the easiest. Based on a game designers' usual train of thought, the more effort you put in, the better the reward.But Zhang Heng did not regret his decision at all. He understood that in his physical state, saving the naked man was already pushing the limits. Even if he could reach either of the two men who were further away, he would not have the energy to return to shore.Moreover, so far, this man with a severely receding hairline seemed to be pretty easy-going.Sometimes attitude is much more important than ability.Sure enough, shortly after, his new companion said, \"My friend, can you please find a green coconut for me? My throat is really dry. I will teach you how to find water later.\"\"No problem.\" Zhang Heng had taken the opportunity to rest for a moment, and had recovered some strength to be able to fulfill his companion's request.This time, he took down fourteen coconuts in one sitting, five for the man and three for himself. The remaining six were set aside as provisions.After the naked gentleman had drunk from the coconut, his condition seemed to have improved a lot. He reached out a hand to Zhang Heng. \"I haven't introduced myself. My name is Ed Wilson, a British national, and formerly the captain of the British army in Afghanistan. You can just call me Ed. Thank you for saving my life.\"\"Zhang Heng, Chinese. University sophomore. You're welcome.\"Zhang Heng and the former captain of the British army in Afghanistan exchanged a friendly handshake.Immediately after, however, the captain's tone grew solemn. \"Those two poor guys. Other than this little island, there's no other land nearby. Not being able to get to shore means that it's not going to end well for them.\"The Ed guy, however, seemed to be able to adjust his mental state pretty well. After only a brief moment of good, he recovered his cheerfulness. \"Alright. As per our agreement, I shall fulfill my part and teach you how to find water. When I was at sea, I was able to visually estimate that this island is about 120 hectares. I noticed some animal tracks nearby the bushes which means that there may be a stream on the island. Follow the tracks and you'll be able to find it. But that's also bad news because it means that there may be predators. Night is coming soon\u2014exploring the island without some sort of light like a torch would not be a wise move; you could get lost or be attacked by wild beasts\u2026\"Ed patiently imparted his knowledge of survival in the wilderness to Zhang Heng, and even deliberately slowed down his speech so that Zhang Heng understood each word.Even so, every now and then, Zhang Heng would interrupt Ed to inquire the meaning of certain words. Even though his parents worked abroad, the time that those two spent at home was too short to have seen to the improvement of Zhang Heng's foreign language proficiency.As a result, Zhang Heng's English language level was only a standard Band 6. It was not too much of a problem for the everyday conversation but once jargons were added to the mix, Ed would have to explain the meaning of the words.With one teaching and the other listening, twenty-minutes later, Zhang Heng finally learned how to find fresh water in the wilderness. Heeding Ed's suggestion, for the time being, the both of them would be using coconuts as their main source of water. At the same time, they also searched the cliff nearby and managed to find a few small water holes, and a cave.The cavity was about ten square meters big and full bird droppings. The smell was unpleasant but the ground was higher, so they would not have to worry about being carried away by the tide when they sleep. Most importantly, the cave was sheltered against the wind, yet remained cool throughout the day and night.As the sun set in the west, Zhang Heng used the last of the daylight to pick up a few more coconuts to add to the ones they had for dinner. After that, the two bid each other good night in the cave.Growing up in the city, this was the first time Zhang Heng had ever slept out in the open. Even though his body and mind had been stretched to the limit and was in urgent need to rest, for a long time, he was still unable to close his eyes. Be it the stink of the bird doo-doo, or the hard rock he was resting on, the unidentified insect that was crawling up his arm in the darkness\u2026 everything seemed to be tormenting his mind, causing him to feel uneasy.Ed suddenly spoke, \"Zhang, did I tell you what the most important thing you need to survive the wilderness is?\"\"What is it?\" Zhang Heng had not heard any movement behind him and assumed that his companion had fallen asleep.\"Survival skills are very important\u2014there is no doubt about it\u2014but the most important thing is to always keep an optimistic outlook. When you feel like you're suffering, think about happy things, tell yourself that perhaps tomorrow, a boat will pass by and bring me back to the civilized world.\" Ed really was as optimistic as ever.Zhang Heng sighed inwardly. If this really was a game, within forty days, there would be no boat passing by. But Ed's words did help him feel much better. More importantly, he realized that he was not alone in this.Zhang Heng had never been one to grumble and complain. He only needed to persevere on this island for forty days. With someone guiding him, he believed that he could do it. Zhang Heng pushed the negative thoughts and emotions out of this mind, and very soon, exhaustion kicked in, and he closed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe sun rose just above the horizon, a new day had come.In the cave, Zhang Heng opened his eyes and saw that Ed was up, sitting. \"Good morning, Zhang.\"\"Morning,\" Zhang Heng yawned\"My goodness. How I wish to have a cup of coffee, fried egg, sausage, and toast right now,\" The former captain lamented, \"But given our current situation, we can't ask for too much, can we? Too bad the coconuts are giving us too little calories. One of those green ones can only provide 200 calories worth of energy. Even if don't exercise, we'll be burning at least 2,000 calories a day. Also, we need to expand our menu in order to obtain a richer source of nutrients. Well, since we're by the sea, I think we can take advantage of that.\"\"What do I need to do?\" Zhang Heng asked.\"Hold your horses. Your life in the city has caused your digestive system to be very fragile. Even if I told you how to catch food from the sea, with no way to cook it, one crab can cause you to the runs so bad it'll lead to dehydration. We need fire. The water that you found earlier will need to heat before drinking. It only needs to be cooked for three minutes to kill most of the bacteria in it. Right now, I'll teach you how to start a fire first.\" Ed paused for a moment before beginning to explain, \"The most important thing you'll need to start a fire is to find the right wood. Fast-growing softwoods are the best kind. The drill [stick] and the base can be taken from the same tree. Tear off a tree bark and dry it under the sun\u2026\"Zhang Heng listened to the instructions intently, but when it came to actually performing the task, it was not as easy as he imagined it to be.He spent the whole morning trying to start a fire.Alas, it was one failure after another. The action of twirling the drill-stick alone rubbed away a whole chunk of skin from his hand. It hurt so bad that he grimaced. At the same time, because they did not have time to search for food, he and Ed ate all their reserve-coconuts which barely filled their stomachs.What was even more frustrating was that even after all the effort they put in, they had nothing to show for it.\"Zhang, you cannot go from a rookie to an expert in one day,\" Ed comforted. \"The beginning is always the hardest.\"Zhang Heng tossed the broken stick on the ground in contempt. \"That is true but failure is still agonizing.\"\"Failure is also a valuable experience. Tens of thousands of years ago, our ancestors have continued to evolve from failures.\" Ed empathized. \"You are a smart student, Zhang. Don't worry. There's still time for you to learn and grow. Now, tell me what have learned from this failure?\"\"The wood is still no good. The skin on my hands are flayed and there're still no sparks. I have to try using other woods.\"Nevertheless, fortune is as unpredictable as the weather. At sundown, a gust of wind blew, and a mass of dark cloud gathered above their heads. It happened so quickly that Zhang Heng did not have enough time to gather the things. The tree bark that had been drying on the rock was soaked in rainwater.His entire day of work was wasted.Disheartened, Zhang Heng lay on the cavern floor with his arms and legs spread out like an 'X' staring at the ceiling of the cave. \"Ed, I don't think your chicken soup for the soul is going to work anymore.\"\"Give up then,\" Ed said in a quiet voice.\"Huh?\"\"But it's limited to only before the rain stops. It's only after you've vented all your negative emotions can you better devote yourself to work.\"\"Are you always this optimistic, Ed?\"\"It could be that I've encountered situations than this in my travels across the Amazon forest. Thinking about how I've managed pulled through inspires me not to give up.\"\"Does experiences make us who we are?\" Zhang Heng muttered under to himself, remembering what the bartender told him, feeling as if he had on to something.\"It looks like the rain is not going to stop before dark.\u00a0You should go to bed. There is still a lot of work to do tomorrow,\" Ed said and as he lay down to sleep.The two went to bed on the second night with an empty stomach.\u2026The next morning, Zhang Heng got up before first light\u2014mainly because he was starving. The first thing he did was to run to the coconut tree to quench his thirst and hunger with a few fruits. The coconut tree at lower ground was nearly picked clean. The remaining trees were taller, and knocking the fruits down with rocks was going to be very difficult. Zhang Heng was aware that he had not much time left, he had to get that fire going, or else he would not be able to continue with the rest of the tasks.On that account, he decided to take a little bit of risk. After bringing breakfast back for Ed, he ventured a little deeper into the native forest behind the beach.The end result was gratifying. Not only did he find suitable wood for the fire, he also found an animal that he suspected was a fowl. Unfortunately for him, the little thing was very agile; before Zhang Heng could even approach it, the creature flapped its wings and disappeared. There was nothing Zhang Heng could have done about that.He broke a tree branch and returned to the beach. Using the same method he used the day before, at noon, a tendril of smoke finally rose from the wood shavings. Employing the knowledge that Ed had passed on to him, Zhang Heng sprinkled the sawdust onto the leaves of the candlenut tree, and then carefully blowing until the sawdust glowed and ignited the tinder underneath.After a short while, the two people on the island finally had a long-awaited fire.\"Well done! Now we can avoid the danger of infection!\" Ed exclaimed.Zhang Heng never thought that he would ever be so excited to see fire. He was about to say something when a third person's voice sounded in his ear.\"Started a fire successfully. A new skill is obtained\u2014Wildlife Survival: Level 0; Game Points: +3; character panel has also been activated; you may view your personal status.\"The voice sounded very familiar. Zhang Heng thought about it for a moment before realizing that it was the same voice that had heard earlier when he was unconscious.Zhang Heng looked at Ed. \"Ed, did you hear something?\"His companion looked taken aback and then concerned. \"Should I be hearing anything? Zhang, are you experiencing hallucinations due to dehydration?\"\"\u2026\"Zhang Heng, too, wondered if he was suffering from heatstroke because something that resembled a character card appeared before his eyes.Name: Zhang HengGender:\u00a0MaleAge:\u00a019Player ID: 07958Game rounds experienced: 0Current game points: 3Skills: Piano: level 1; Language Proficiency: level 1 (both languages at general communication skills level)Assessment: The player is unremarkable with no quality worth commending, has no special skills and is not expected to be able to last longer than the first three rounds.Zhang Heng was speechless. The harsh evaluation at the bottom aside, how was it that he only had two skills?Okay, he could see a line of words in small prints under skills\u2014Level 0 skill cannot be displayed.His amateur grade nine piano playing level was passed off for a pathetic Level 1?!This game's definition of skills was too harsh! Not everyone out of a hundred people could start a fire using their bare hands, yet it barely even made Level 0 on his list of skills!It would seem that this game was more difficult than he imagined it to be.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng finally started a fire.That meant that his menu was no longer limited to just coconuts. Shortly after, following Ed's instructions, Zhang Heng found conches on the rocks by the beach, even lucked out and found crabs and oysters.The latter especially, was fresh and sweet, rich in nutrients\u2014calcium, iron, phosphorus, and vitamin B2\u2014reputed as the milk of the sea. It was pity, however, that the calories they provide were not high; each of them containing only 70 calories. For chowhounds, this was a good thing but on a deserted island, Zhang Heng preferred something with higher-calorie content to provide him with the necessary energy.He did not need to worry about exceeding his calorie count and getting out of shape seeing that he had been starving these few days.Thank goodness, they just might able to enjoy a decent meal tonight.Zhang Heng collected about seventy over little conches, six oysters, and four hermit crabs which were sadly, rather small. Ed had told him that the hermits were edible but tasted average. Nevertheless, the two of them were not dining in a Michelin star restaurant so taste was no longer an important factor.Zhang Heng even spotted some fishes by the coast but without the right tools, he could only watch them swim about from afar.To boot, they also had the small puddles of water that he had found two days ago. With the shells of the mollusks he picked up, Zhang Heng was able to scoop and transport the water. But for all that, the pair found themselves having problems with the tools for boiling the water.\u00a0They did not have bowls and the shells they were using were too well insulated that even under direct heat, the water refused to boil.Ed thought for a moment and then said, \"Go find some pebbles\u2014not the ones with a lot of holes or stratification.\"Zhang Heng nodded and did as Ed instructed. They spent twenty minutes cooking the pebbles until they were burning red, and fastened them to the clams using small branches. Soon, the water inside began to boil.\"There's not a lot of water in here. Two should suffice.\" Ed said.The water inside the shells boiled for around a minute, enough to get rid of most of the bacteria.Zhang Heng put these little outdoor survival skills to memory.Ed was a good teacher. With the injury to his waist, he could not move about freely. But Zhang Heng was able to benefit from his companion's comprehensive survival know-how, so he had no complaints about having to take on full responsibility of collecting food and water for the both of them.At the same time, Zhang Heng was careful not to be too reliant on Ed; he hoped that he could make all the knowledge he had picked up from Ed into his own practical skills\u2014not so that he could get rid of Ed later on, of course. As a matter of fact, he was so grateful to Ed that if there was only one morsel of food left, Zhang Heng was willing to give half of it to Ed.Having said that, Zhang Heng could not shake off this ominous feeling; he had noticed that Ed appeared to be worse than the first day he came to shore. This period of rest had not improved his condition. Since the last time Zhang Heng bandaged the fatal wound on Ed's thigh, and stopped the bleeding, there was nothing else he could do to tend to the injury.There were no antibiotics so readily available in the hospitals in the city. Once the wound was infected, it would be untreatable.Zhang Heng believed that the former captain knew this better than him\u2014yet, Ed never raised the subject in the past few days.This seemed to confirm the foreboding hunch that Zhang Heng had been feeling. Not knowing what he could do for his companion, Zhang Heng looked after Ed as best as he could.For the rest of the days, Ed taught Zhang Heng how to make simple stone tools, use wood charcoal to clean his teeth, collect rainwater, make ropes out of tree barks, build a basic raft out of wood, use corals to trap fish\u2026Compared to the time when the both of them had just arrived on the island, the pair had moved past the most dangerous period, and now had extra reserves. The leftover dried fish was hung from the ceiling of the cave so that should they encounter terrible weather and were unable to go out to scavenge for food, they would not go hungry.Things seemed to be going uphill, and the forty days no longer seemed like an unattainable goal.Just when this notion appeared in Zhang Heng's mind, doom showed up.On the sixteenth night, Ed suddenly developed a high fever. Zhang Heng devoted his time and energy to care for his companion, and gradually, their supply of food and water gradually depleted.\u00a0Their search range was also greatly reduced. The food they had set aside for a rainy day was immediately put to use in this crisis.What even more worrying was that Ed's condition did not improve at all.When Zhang Heng undid the makeshift T-shirt bandage on Ed's thigh, he discovered that the gash that was so deep you could see the bone had festered.Since yesterday, the former captain of the British Army had been in a comatose state.What little food they had in the cave was slowly diminishing. Very soon, they were on the brink of running out of food.Finally, on the nineteenth night, Ed's eyes suddenly flew open. He turned to his side, and murmured to Zhang Heng, half-conscious, \"Do you know what's the most important thing to survive the wilderness? It's never being satisfied with what you've achieved yesterday. Live each day better than the last. You have to find a way to conquer nature.\"Zhang Heng rubbed his eyes, and smiled sadly, \"Ed, that's not what you told me the last time.\"But Ed made no response.Zhang Heng put a finger under Ed's nose and discovered that his friend was no longer breathing.Even though he had been mentally preparing himself for Ed's passing, he was still sad. While the two of them had not spent a lot of time with each other, Zhang Heng's ability to navigate in this wilderness was all thanks to Ed's teaching.The shared a student-teacher relationship, but they were also friends.Zhang Heng dug a hole in the forest near the cave, and buried Ed. To prevent wild beasts from damaging the grave, he outlined the grave with some sharpened twigs.Only when he had done all that did he drag his starving body to the beach to search for food.The good news was that he was already halfway into the forty-day goal. Even though he was alone again, Zhang Heng was confident that he could survive the island.On the noon of the twentieth day, Zhang Heng's coral trap caught him a large two\u00a0catty1\u00a0fish. This meant he could go to bed tonight with a full stomach.But just when Zhang Heng thought that his bad luck had finally passed, he suddenly received a voice prompt in his ear.[Alert! Alert! An anomaly had been discovered in the quest! Critical time error][Reporting error][Second level authority enabled, verification approved, report canceled\u2026][Remove the error permanently from the decision-making sequence][Assignment objective remains unchanged; the return time has been changed from 40 days to 520 days. Please pay attention!]Zhang Heng's head nearly blew up at the series of messages. When he finally registered the drastic, unanticipated changes, his eyes flitted to his right hand.All three hands were pointed upwards.No way. He had been so preoccupied learning how to survive in the wilderness, and having experienced all kinds of situations, he had forgotten about that twenty-four-dial watch on his wrist.On the first few nights when he first arrived on the island, he was not able to enter that still world and had thought that it did not apply to this game. He did not think that the game would actually be holding back!The first thing that came to Zhang Heng's mind was where did the 520 days come from. The extra twenty-four hours he had every day, after being multiplied by 480, left him with the most frightening string of numbers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySo, this really was all just a game?In reality, once watch hands pointed to twelve midnight, Zhang Heng would enter Still Time. But here, the wind continued to whistle in his ears, and the coconuts trees swayed along, except for that voice that appeared suddenly not long ago, nothing else had changed.Zhang Heng had tried playing several computer games during Still Time.Following the contact-recover principle, as long as he was not in contact with other people, everything would continue to work.But now was not the time to talk about such things.Just as victory was within reach, the difficulty of the game was raised to a hellish level.Realizing that he had another five hundred days and not twenty days left on the godforsaken island, Zhang Heng did not even have the strength to draw a bitter smile.Instead, he sat by the beach, staring at the horizon, doing nothing else until sundown. This was the first time he felt like life was full of spite.But at this point, griping was meaningless.Even if he wanted to settle scores with whoever, he would have to wait until five hundred days later.Before dark, Zhang Heng finally roused. He was never the kind of person who was easily knocked down by difficulties. He did as Ed had taught him in between the lessons, to let go, to vent out all his negative emotions first, and then regain his composure.With the fish and crabs he caught, Zhang Heng enjoyed a full meal, and then early the next morning, devoted himself fighting against nature.Fire can be used to cook food and boil water, and keep him warm at night. Simultaneously, keeping the fire burning had become Zhang Heng's responsibility.Every day, not only did he have to go out to collect food and freshwater, he also needed to find firewood that would burn easily\u2014this task was especially tough after a shower of rain.He had wanted to collect more firewood and store them in the cave to cope with the rainy weather, but earlier on, he had to focus his energy on scavenging for food; now that Ed was gone, the amount of food he needed to find was halved, leaving with ample time to do other things.Other than collecting firewood, Zhang Heng also attempted at fashioning a couple of stone axes. Ed was not very good at making tools, and had only imparted the rough idea of how to put together a stone axe. Before this, Zhang Heng had used the sharper edge of the clams to hack at the trees but it did not work very well\u2014it took him at least two to three hours to cut down a small tree.That got him thinking about trying out the stone tools so highly favored by the primitive man. But for some unknown reasons, the axes he made either crack after only two chops, or the heads would be separated from the handle at a swing.Zhang Heng could only comfort himself that failure is the mother of success.In a blink of an eye, another twenty days had passed.That familiar voice, again, sounded in Zhang Heng's ears.[Task complete\u2026][To return after 480 days\u2026]The sentences were fine on their own but when put together like that, it sounded like a bit of a joke.Zhang Heng ignored the voice. He had just finished his lunch, and was looking for some shells to carry water. The one he had used was burnt. He was picking up goods from the 'free market' when he suddenly noticed two black dots from afar.Huh? This was a rather familiar scenario.What was more familiar were the two people struggling in the water.Were those option B adventure man and option C laddie in shorts?Zhang Heng found himself speechless. What kind of humans were they? That was some powerful will and tenacity to live. It had not been easy for him to have survived on this island and yet those two were still living and kicking after drifting in the water for forty days.Zhang Heng's thoughts immediately went back to the late Ed. Before he breathed his last breath, Ed had thanked Zhang Heng for saving him, and being able to die on land, unlike the two other people who would be swept into a watery grave.Instead, right now, Zhang Heng felt sorry for Ed.If he had not 'saved' Ed, Ed might still be alive, floating on the waters with the other two.This was not the first day Zhang Heng played games. He knew that this situation meant that he was encountering a bug.The root cause of that was probably that extra twenty-four hours he had that disrupted the quest.Theoretically speaking, the game should cease to exist after forty days. The other players had probably all returned to reality. He was the only was still stuck in the game\u2014still suffering.Most games would have crashed or broken down. Yet, this game continued to run. This fact alone was enough to prove that this was no ordinary game.The bartender lady had said that this was the greatest game in the history of mankind. Right now, Zhang Heng found himself a little convinced of that. Ever since he arrived in this 'world', everything he had seen was extremely realistic, from the plants to the animals on the island, everything was true to the real world. Even Ed did not appear any different from a real person.Right now, however, a flaw had finally appeared in this impeccable world.\"Is it because the plot has ended, it has no choice but to repeat?\"However, unlike mechanical loops, the Ed whom he had buried in the little forest did not reappear, meaning that the repeat followed a logical sequence.Zhang Heng peeled off his clothes as quickly as he could; of course, he was not going to miss such a good opportunity.Unlike the physically weak and feeble person he was forty days ago, Zhang Heng was well-fed, and was even able to perform some training exercising outside of labor.His body had nearly recovered to its most optimal state.Having gauged the distance between himself and the two people in the water, Zhang Heng decided to save the laddie in shorts, who was further away. Because according to game designers' logic, the more effort you put in, the better the reward.With Ed's help, he had basically overcome the problem of finding food; now, he wanted to know what kind of changes would saving that young man bring to his life.\u2026Ten days later, Zhang Heng found himself marveling at the brick kiln and tile-roofed house.There were actually people in this world who could build a house with their bare hands! All throughout, Zhang Heng trailed behind the lad in shorts from finding clay, to constructing beams, firing the bricks in a kiln, to finally building the half a meter tall bricked house. In addition to that, the lad even showed him how to make a proper stone axe, set up a wooden shed, make ceramics, prawn traps, and sandals, and use the fibers from tree barks to weave, make bow and arrows, and slings.Not having to worry about food, Zhang Heng was able to spend his time taking it all in.It was a pity, however, that the short pants lad never spoke. He merely did as Zhang Heng requested and quietly demonstrated all the techniques.Then on the nineteenth day, he accidentally ingested poisonous mushrooms and died in the forest.Killed by the plot?Now Zhang Heng understood that the game was designed in a way that the player would have to spend the later half of the game alone. So, no matter what they did, the already injured Ed and the lad in shorts would not last until the twentieth day.Zhang Heng buried the lad in shorts next to Ed's grave.Unlike Ed, this lad never spoke a word; so, they did not share very strong ties. In addition, after knowing that it was all just a game, Zhang Heng was not terribly upset.But, at the end of the day, they were teacher and student. Zhang Heng felt obliged to give him a proper burial.After that, Zhang Heng digested and began to put everything the lad in shorts had thought him throughout their nineteen days together. In between, the adventurer drifted past twice, but Zhang did not 'save' him.He would come back again some other time.If Zhang Heng saved him, he would have only nineteen days left to live.On the 130th day on the island, an announcement rang in Zhang Heng's ear.[Tiled-roof house successfully constructed; Wilderness Survival Skill has increased from level 0 to level 1; Game Points +5; you may view the character panel\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng looked at his character panel, and found that his skills had increased from two to three. But the mean evaluation at the bottom remained unchanged.Since the lad in the shorts taught him how to make bow and arrows, Zhang Heng had another activity added to his days. He had carved out an area on the beach just for archery practice.Using the knowledge imparted to him by Ed and the lad in shorts, Zhang Heng managed to overcome his plight finding food and water, and moved out of that bird-droppings filled cave into the clay house he had built with his worn hands.Just as his life was improving, a new crisis soon emerged.Ed had told him that the biggest enemy of a person who had mastered the skill of surviving the wilderness was not the ever-changing and unpredictable nature, but yourself.Once a person's survival needs have been fulfilled, chances are, the person would fall into a vacant state; having lost all direction and motivation, being the only person on the island would soon bring on an overwhelming sense of loneliness.Zhang Heng must find tasks to keep his mind and body constantly occupied so that he would not have the time to think about the fact that he was all alone on a deserted island.When he was with the lad, Zhang Heng took into consideration that he needed to survive for another four hundred days and more, and set a new target for himself.He decided to explore the heart of the island.So far, his area of activity had been limited to the periphery of the island. The furthest he has been was to the virgin forest to look for firewood where he saw the fowl and some animal bones, which confirmed the presence of predators.From then on, he had been very careful to limit his area of activity, staying away from that stretch of forest. After all, the resources on the beach were enough to keep him alive.But now, in order to battle this terrible sense of loneliness, Zhang Heng needed a goal that would keep him going\u2014exploring the center of the island and see what was there.With this end in mind, Zhang Heng began to allow himself to be invested in it, and work hard towards the goal.Taking into account that there were predators in the forest, he would first need to learn to protect himself.His second companion had taught him to make two long-ranged weapons\u2014the bow and arrows, and the sling.The latter was easier, but the most difficult to use. The angle and timing at which the stone was flung had to be precise. If the sling was released a little too early or a little too late, you would find that the stone was miles away from hitting the target.Hitting the target four or five times out of a hundred was not going to be easy.On the other hand, bow and arrows are much more accurate and easier to control. With Zhang Heng already equipped with the basics of archery\u2014the tips about posture, strength, and breathing technique that his coach had taught him, the only thing that he lacked was practice.This was not something that could be done lackadaisically; it required the grind of time. In the real world, even though Zhang Heng had forty-eight hours a day, there was so much to do that he could not spend too much time on a pastime.\u00a0Now, on this island where he was the only human being, the thing he did not lack most was time.Going from the recurve bow he bought in the market to the handmade primitive bow was not considered a drop in expenditure.Compared to the store-bought bow, the handmade bow's accuracy, and durability of the was a bit troubling. Drawing the bow also required much more strength and the tree bark that he used had a risk of breaking after being used more than a hundred times. The average lifespan was about 150 arrows.The target he had set for himself was 300 arrows per day, which meant that he needed to change the bow strings twice.By day 172 since he arrived on the island, Zhang Heng achieved his goal of hitting a still target within ten meters without fail, and a success rate of 70% at thirty meters. The threat of his arrow was greatly reduced if he aimed for anything beyond this distance.After that, he was notified that his archery skill was raised from Level 0 to Level 1.Zhang Heng was still not satisfied.His goal was to reach Level 2 before entering the forest for his expedition. That way at least he would be able to protect himself.Outside practicing his archery skills, Zhang Heng did not idle. He had moved from the cave into the clay house which sat on the border of the forest, and after moving all of his belongings, made another batch of clay tools. Today, he was finally able to eat out of a bowl.With his Level 1 archery skills, Zhang Heng went deeper into the forest, close to where he had found firewood the first time. Again, he encountered that fowl-like creature.The animal made some strange sounds upon their meeting, as if mocking Zhang Heng's failure to capture it, and then speed its feet and disappeared into the bushes.But the very next moment, a wooden arrow came down from the sky and pierced its body.Concurrently, the voice in Zhang Heng's ear made another announcement.[Successful hunt, Game Point +3, you may view information on the character panel\u2026]Zhang Heng's palm was drenched in sweat. The distance between him and the fowl creature was only about seven meters\u2014a distance he was comfortable with but once his target moved, his shots would not be as accurate.This shot was much more urgent than usual, and his breath was slightly ragged when the arrow left his bow. Good thing, his many hours of practice came into play. It also did not hurt that the bird was on the plump side.The creature struggled for a while, and then finally gave up reluctantly.Zhang Heng walked over, collected his arrow and then bend down to examine his game.The creature had a strange appearance. Zhang Heng had thought that it was a fowl but upon closer look, he realized that its beak resembled a duck's but with a curve at the tip; its body was much larger a fowl and had blue-gray feathers, short and small wings, and a pair of rather thick legs.This thing looked a little ugly\u2026Zhang Heng had come across a bird atlas once, and this thing was not in the book. But since it ate fruits and seeds, then theoretically, probably, maybe, it should be\u2026 edible.This whole time, on the island, Zhang Heng had eaten some meat. But the flavor of seafood like fish, prawns, and crabs could compare to meat that lived on land.Zhang Heng had been thinking about this fowl-like creature since the first time he saw it. Unfortunately, that time, he had no idea how to capture this nimble thing. Today, having honed his archery skills, Zhang Heng reached out his claws to grab this innocent little creature without a moment's hesitation.Zhang Heng returned from his hunt fully loaded. Other than the 15 catty 'fowl', he also stumbled across some wild potatoes on his way back.The thing was rich in starch, and could be used as a staple food. At the same time, potatoes are also high in calories. Zhang Heng did not eat much of it, he set two of the largest ones aside to be eaten with the meat tonight, and then placed the rest carefully into his basket. He planned to grow a vegetable garden by the house when he got back.Potatoes grow very quickly. Once he got them into the ground, he would have an endless supply of potatoes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The 'chicken' soup he boiled for dinner brought back memories.Actually, strictly speaking, the meat of this creature was much tougher than chicken meat. Its texture was actually closer to that of pigeons.But to Zhang Heng who nearly went crazy thinking about meat, this was the most delicious chicken he had ever tasted. Unable to finish the entire 15 catty 'chicken'\u00a0at one meal, Zhang Heng removed the internal organs, soaked the flesh in seawater and then smoked it. The 'chicken' jerky now hung under the eaves of his house.Behind the house, Zhang Heng found a plot of land that received a good amount of sunlight and planted the potatoes he saved. He also burnt some grass and wood, sprinkling them over his crops as fertilizer. Finally, he fenced up the plot of land, looking forward to see the surprise it would bring him after about half a month.Early on, Zhang Heng had recorded the time on the wall of the cave but he could not move the wall to his new dwelling so he relied on the watch on his wrist.With the watch's scientifically unexplainable toughness, Zhang Heng had used it to whet stones in the earlier days on the island. By looking at the positions of the hour hand and the seconds hand, he could use a simple calculation to determine the date. Today, it had been 201 days since he was 'washed ashore'.The clothes he was wearing was the first to crumble, then his shoes acquired a large hole. He was lucky to have been in the tropics, he did not need to worry about temperature even if it was winter. Zhang Heng even settled on going about the day completely nude.His skin was now a tan shade of bronze, his beard unkempt and his hair a frizzy mess. He looked a little scruffy.Today afternoon, Zhang Heng put down whatever he was doing, and climbed onto a cliff by the beach. He sat down with his legs crossed, staring into the distance.After about half an hour, the old friend he had been waiting for appeared.The adventurer was struggling against the waves, looking as if he could drown at any time.Zhang Heng looked at the silhouette rising and falling with the tide, conflicted.The great philosopher, mathematician and historian\u00a0Russel1\u00a0once said that his life was governed by three pure yet overwhelmingly strong passions: the longing for love, the search for knowledge and the unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.Thing for Zhang Heng, right now, was much simpler.There were only two things that was going to keep him alive for these five-hundred days\u2014exploring the center of the island, and seeing the man in the water who would appear every forty days. The former kept him busy and kept his mind from wandering; the latter reminded him that he was not alone.So many time, Zhang Heng had been tempted to save the adventurer.Saving him meant having someone with him for nineteen days, providing him with the much-needed interaction, company and warmth from a creature of the same kind.But Zhang Heng had never taken any action.He thought about a movie he had seen called 'Cast Away'. The plane that the protagonist boarded had crashed and he was washed ashore with a heap of packages. To survive, he opened up all the packages leaving only one because it symbolized hope to him.Seeing the adventurer every forty days held the same meaning to Zhang Heng.He had been on this island for more than two hundred days. That would be the equivalent of five rounds of game time for the average player. He was still very far from the day of return to reality.If he recurred the man now, the man would die after nineteen days, and he would be truly and completely alone for the rest of his days on the island.Even after his Wildlife Survival Skills had reached Level 1, he was still lacking in many ways (for example, he really wanted a game console, even if it was just Tetris or Snake). Still, levelling up was not as pressing as it was when he had first arrived on the island.In contrast, he needed a helper to explore the island. He could it alone, of course. But it would definitely be much safer when there are two people.Zhang Heng had planned to bring the adventurer with him into the forest after he had rescued him.He was able to confirm from his encounter with Ed and the lad in shorts that while both of them were wilderness survival experts, the areas of their knowledge differed. The skills and knowledge that Ed had imparted were basic survival skills, whereas the lad in shorts was more inclined towards construction and creation. Having observed the adventurer's dressing, Zhang Heng surmised that he was probably an expert in exploration. It would be awkward for him to save the person now.Zhang Heng had to suppress the burning desire to save the man as he watched the waves swallow his for the fourth time.With one last look at the spot where the explorer had disappeared, Zhang Heng jumped down from the cliff and continued his archery practice.It took him three months to get his accuracy up to 90% at thirty meters.As a result, there was no notification of any skill upgrade. But this did not discouraged Zhang Heng. He had already expected it. This game was very demanding benchmark for skills. English, which he had learnt for fourteen years, and his native language, was only graded only as Level 1. But considering how many languages there are in the world, this classification seemed fair enough.The same applied to surviving the wilderness. Zhang Heng felt that it everyone in the world was thrown to this island, even if he was not the last person alive, he would at least be on of the top ten survivors. But again, his skills were severely skewed.\u00a0If he was placed in another type of harsh environment, he might not have done that well, take the polar regions or a desert. He would barely be able to survive. That was the biggest difference between him and experts.Therefore, Zhang Heng was in no hurry to level up his archery skills.Once he had mastered his thirty meters shooting, he began practicing on moving targets.At first, he used the fishes swimming near the coral reefs as practice but after two shots, he was reminded that what he could see above the water was actually a deflected. If he continued to practice like that, his archery skills would go crooked.Then he turned to practicing on crabs. But these crustaceans were the kind of prey that does not move if the enemy remains still. They proved to be terrible practice targets. Zhang Heng never even considered practicing on birds mainly because they mostly stood on tree tops. If he missed, it would be very difficult for him to retrieve his arrows.In the end, Zhang Heng settled on the broken pottery pieces, stringing them up on branches so that when the wind blows, they would sway.This made it very difficult to shoot.It took Zhang Heng two months of practice to learn the ropes. During this period of time, he caught another hideous looking 'fowl' in perfect condition. Somehow that creature had gotten into Zhang Heng's vegetable plot, probably to munch on some free breakfast, but got its head caught in the fences instead.Zhang Heng thought about and decided that he was in no hurry to eat it, so he tied the creature's leg to a wooden pole. Now he had an upgraded moving target.Zhang Heng wrapped the head of his carbonized arrows and then began an inhumane attack on the 'fowl'.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The more you keep an eye on time, the slower it seemed to pass.So, Zhang Heng no longer kept a record. During the fourth harvest of the potatoes he had planted, he received an alert.[Archery Skill has progressed from level 1 to level 2. You may review the information on the character panel]Zhang Heng dashed into his house and dug out the Tissot buried in the corner. After putting the watch on, he saw that he had been on the island for a total of 385 days\u2014it had been more than a year.Even though he could not compare to Robinson Crusoe, it was considered pretty incredible for a city person.In fact, Zhang Heng had already gotten used to life in the wilderness. To make life more comfortable, his clay house and vegetable plot had undergone two stages of expansion. The house had transformed from a single-room building to three rooms and one living room. Zhang Heng even added floor heating. The vegetable plot, on the other hand, was producing more potatoes than he could consume. Zhang Heng sliced the excess tubers into thin shreds using his stone knife and left them out to dry under the sun. Thus, began the birth of his 100% organic baked potato chips.In addition to that, he also found some onions in the forest and transplanted them in his vegetable garden. After that, he spent a good portion of his time setting up a fish pond, an outdoor bath, and a breeding garden next to his little hut. In the pond, he kept the fish and crabs he did not eat, and that 'fowl' which had its head stuck in the fences became the first tenant of the breeding garden.After shooting at it for a month and a half, the creature went from 'I'm not afraid of anything, I challenge you to come and try me' to a blanked-eye, spiritless empty-nester.Zhang Heng felt sorry for it and resisted the urge to eat it. On a whim, he decided to keep the 'fowl' as livestock, in hopes that he might be able to harvest eggs someday. But the dream was destroyed when he found out that the creature was a male.Forget it. Zhang Heng decided to keep it as a pet and named it 'Mickey Mouse'.Compared to the fish, birds, and crabs, the creature had a slightly higher IQ. After a while, some interaction was established between master and pet.For 80% of the time, Zhang Heng was able to hit a moving target within a ten meters distance, and 50% at thirty meters. When his archery skills had advanced to Level 2, he knew that it was time to make a move.So, he spent ten days putting together food and supplies for two people, and preparing one month's worth of ration for Mickey Mouse. Then he chose the toughest wood he could find and fashioned them into spears to be used as melee weapons.On the 401st day, when he went to save the drifting adventurer, Zhang Heng was paddling on a wooden raft that he had made.\"Thank you, friend. Are you an indigenous person on this island? A typhoon sank the ship that I was on. I was the only one who swam here. I'm exhausted. If it weren't for you, it would not have ended well for me.\"Zhang Heng was dumbstruck. 'In what way do I resemble an indigenous person?'He consulted his reflection in the seawater. Fine, this face does look aboriginal. He had been on the island for too long. Other than the watch, everything that he had with him when he first arrived was all either broken and unusable.Nonetheless, it was still a pleasure to be able to see someone of the same species. It had been almost a year since Zhang Heng had spoken to another person. He could barely contain his excitement as he handed a wooden pail filled with fresh water to the man.\"My name is Zhang Heng. I'm not a native. I was in a shipwreck like you, but that was a year ago.\"After the adventurer drank the water, his complexion improved tremendously. At first, he was worried that this aboriginal man had saved him so that he could have him for dinner, but was relieved and delighted to find that the other was a civilized man.\"My name is Bell Butre, and I served in the United Kingdom Special Forces Reserve 21 Special Air Service (21 SAS), climbed Mount Everest and then decided to become a host, explorer, and author\u2026 You said that you've been living on the island for a year? That's really quite incredible.\"\"More precisely, I used to have two companions. But neither one of them made it.\" Zhang Heng paused for a moment and then asked. \"Do you remember the two people who fell into the sea with you?\"\"What two people who fell into the sea with me?\" Bell appeared genuinely puzzled. \"When it happened, I wanted to save people but a huge tide knocked me unconscious. When I opened my eyes, I saw this little island.\"Zhang Heng was not surprised by his answer but felt that it was a great pity that Bell had no memory of Ed or that guy in shorts. He most probably did not recall that he had been drifting in the ocean for a year either.Zhang Heng decided to play along even though he really wanted to know why the game repeatedly brought this bug back.They paddled back to shore, and Zhang Heng brought Bell to his little hut.\"Did you make all of these yourself?\" Seeing the clay house with a 180-degree sea view, the thriving vegetable garden, and the pond brimming with fishes and prawns, Bell exclaimed, \"I don't think there's anything I could teach you. Even I could not have done better.\"As he was speaking, Bell's eyes fell upon Mickey Mouse that was howling in the breeding garden, and he let out a shriek.Zhang Heng thought that Mickey Mouse's hideous looks had managed to bring a grown man to tears, and was about to introduce them to each other when Bell suddenly cried, \"My god! What am I seeing?! Dodo bird! There's still a living and breathing Dodo bird on this earth!\"This time, it was Zhang Heng's turn to be stunned.He was no stranger to the name of the Dodo bird. According to the records, this bird lived comfortably on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of a group of European colonizers. A calamity fell upon this species and in a short period of 200 years, the birds were completely wiped out. Until now, not a single complete specimen had been found.Zhang Heng could not believe that he had so casually eaten the national bird of Mauritius.But since it was a game, nothing was too surprising.Seeing how confident Zhang Heng was, Bell was a little troubled. So, he decided to give his new friend a scientific explanation. \"Dodo birds were completely extinct in 1681. Opinion differ about how that happened\u2014some people say that the Europeans ate them all, some say that the animals that the colonizers brought with them brought about a biological invasion, there are also theories that it's because of the environmental changes\u2026 whatever it is, they have completely vanished from earth. Sixteen years ago, the bones of the Dodo bird were sold at an auction for 500 thousand pounds. Your discovery on this island will shock the whole world!\"'Unfortunately, this was just a virtual game world. The plot outside of the island was a whole lot of nothing\u2026' Zhang Heng thought to himself.Instead of telling this to Bell, Zhang Heng decided to use a different, more easily acceptable method to convey the message to him. \"Bell, if this really is a Dodo bird, we have to find a way to leave this island and show it to the world.\"\"You're right.\" Bell agreed. \"The fact that Dodo birds exist on this island is not good news for us. It means that no one has ever come across this place. I'm afraid this place is not in any of the ships' courses.\"\"I've been on this island for more than a year. I'm already very familiar with the outer regions of the island, and I was thinking of going into the heart of the island to explore\u2026 Hmm, who knows, I might be able to find a way that could get us out of this place.\"\"Then let me come with you. I think I could be of help when it comes to exploration.\" Bell said excitedly. \"When are we leaving? Tomorrow?\"\"No, no\u2026 Let's wait for two more days so that your body can recover fully, and in the meantime\u2026 have a chat with me.\" Zhang Heng looked at the explorer with eager eyes.\"???\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBell was in excellent physical shape. Even though he had drifted for so long in the ocean, exhausted and on the brink of dehydration, when given enough food and drink, proper rest and favorable environment, he bounced back to full strength in less than two days' time.Even so, Zhang Heng was in no hurry to leave. The island's acreage was neither large nor small; walking around the island's entire periphery only took Zhang Heng about eight hours. Going into the virgin forest would take a longer time, but even then, it would only take about three days to get from the hut to the center of the island.If his assumptions were right, Bell had nineteen days to live, which meant that they still had more than enough time to prepare.After being in each other's company for two days, Zhang Heng had a basic understanding of his new companion's abilities.Bell's survival expertise was indeed different from Ed's and the lad in shorts'; his leaned towards hunting and self-preservation\u2014precisely the kind of skills necessary for exploring the virgin forest.At the present time, Zhang Heng was capable of making a large variety of tools, equipped to seek out a place to stay, water, and many other basic survival skills.From the simple variety of vegetable in his garden and the bareness of the breeding garden except for Micky Mouse, it was obvious that Zhang Heng did not understand too much about the nature that he was living in.This was especially true in species identification\u2014a weakness that Zhang Heng and most city-living modern people possessed.There were many types of plants in the forest, but not knowing which ones or which parts were edible, and afraid of falling victim to food poisoning, Zhang Heng had only taken the potatoes and onions\u2014which were the only things that he recognized.It was pretty much the same with animals. All this while, he had thought that Mickey Mouse was ugly as sin; never once did it cross his mind that it was actually the extinct national bird of Mauritius.This explorer that he rescued could finally help him make up for this shortcoming of his.Seeing that there was not a lot of time left, Zhang Heng decided to bring Bell on a tour around the island.Bell taught him how to identify and obtain a variety of resources from the forest.Zhang Heng could not help but be surprised. For the past one year, he had been recklessly wasting natural resources\u2014he had been sitting on a pile of treasure-trove and he was completely clueless as to how to use them.But the more Zhang Heng listened to his companion, the more uneasy he felt because it seemed that Bell was deeming practically everything that he laid eyes on to be 'edible once the head is removed'.On the afternoon of the tenth day, both men returned to the house. Zhang Heng was very pleased with the yield of this short little trip. Even if there was nothing in the heart of the island, he had learnt a lot in the past ten days.Beyond that, Bell was also very good listener and conversational partner.After taking a day's rest, Zhang Heng planted the seed they had collected from the trip in the vegetable garden. As he was doing so, he suddenly received another message.[Successfully collected more than ten varieties of vegetables. Wilderness Survival Skills advance from level 1 to level 2. Game Points +5. You may refer to the character panel to view the information\u2026]Until now, Zhang Heng still had no idea how the game points were used in the game. Including what he had accumulated previously, he now had a total of 16 points, which was displayed on his character panel.It seemed to him that this was a sort of reward system. Once certain criteria were met, points would be rewarded, just like previous 11 points which came from starting a fire, building a house and hunting.Anyway, Zhang Heng was not too caught up in these sorts of things. He had always been the kind of player who let things run its course as long as he completed a level; definitely not the hardcore-bigot kind who had to attain complete dominance of the game. This time, it was only because he had played this game on his own for too long, he had to attain those achievements even if he did not want to.In addition to that, he also noticed that some changes had been made to the evaluation portion on the panel.It read,[Evaluation: The player is unremarkable with no quality worth commending, but has some wilderness survival skills and archery skills. He is not expected to be able to last longer than the first five rounds.]Zhang Heng found this rather puzzling. He thought that his archery skills were pretty good, and he had enough knowledge to survive harsh environment\u2014how could he not last longer than five rounds? What about the other players?The thought merely flashed through his mind. After that, Zhang Heng focused his attention on matters that needed to be done.After a night's rest, the pair had almost completely recovered from the fatigue of their little expedition, and the conditions of their physiques were at optimal level.Next, it was finally time for the main event.Zhang Heng slung the longbow and quiver over his shoulder. The night before their departure he had already prepared two persons' worth of rations and water. He and Bell each carried their own. If they were frugal, these provisions could very well last them for a week in the forest.With Bell the human hunting machine next to him, there was no need to worry about running out of supply anyway.When Zhang Heng handed the two spears he had prepared to his partner, Bell shook his head and then showed him the knife on his waist. \"This is enough for me.\"Zhang Heng felt a twinge of envy. Seeing the knife brought back memories about that Swiss army knife that he had\u2026 Ever since he was thrown to this island, he never saw that piece of ironware again. He thought about how he, when he was with Ed, had completed the feat of sawing a tree using a shell. The tip of the spear he was holding had to be carbonized and then sharpened.While it was a pretty effective weapon, it was still not nearly as good as the real deal.Moreover, the workmanship on the knife appeared to be exquisite. Bell's name was even carved on it.\"If you like it so much, I can give it to you once we're safe. You can also come to my house to visit. I'll introduce you to my wife and son.\"Even though he knew that that day would never come, Zhang Heng thanked the explorer politely.Once they were ready, the pair began their journey into the virgin forest. On the first night alone, Zhang Heng realized how lucky he was to have Bell with him.Even though he had made ample preparations, he had clearly underestimated the dangers in the forest.One person could not be on constant alert for twenty-four hours, especially at night when the forest was not particularly quiet. There always seemed to bushes rustling in the dark.For the first half of the night, Zhang Heng was constantly on his toes, tightening his grip on the spear at every sound or movement. Eventually he realized that he could not go on like this. One sleepless night meant that his mind would suffer and his response slow.Eventually, Zhang Heng had to force himself to close his eyes.It took a while for him to ignore the suspicious sounds all around him and enter the half-asleep state. But it was then, he suddenly felt something rubbing against his midriff.This was also the time when Zhang Heng was most lethargic, so he did not bother to open his eyes until whatever it was tangled around his body and began to squeeze. It was when he suddenly felt suffocated that his eyes flew opened and he saw the thing stacked around his body.It was a python, about three meters long and a body that was thicker than Zhang Heng's forearm. Its belly was white and its back was covered in brown cloud-like spots.Zhang Heng attempted to free himself from its grasp but realized that he could raise his arm at all. The thing was tightening around him and it felt as if all the bones in his body were broken.Luckily, his struggling woke Bell from his sleep.\"Burmese rock python, a subspecies of the Indian python\u2014one of six of the largest snake species in the world. Commonly seen in tropical rain forests. They have great strength and few enemies, but they are not without weaknesses.\" Bell reached to touch the giant serpent's tail and very lightly jabbed at a spot, and the Burmese rock python actually loosened its grip.When Zhang Heng finally freed himself, Bell explained, \"Anus\u2014they are python's most vulnerable spot. Attacking this body part will allow you to have time to escape.\" And then he plunged the knife into the snake's head.\"Not such bad luck at all. Our breakfast for tomorrow morning has fallen into our lap.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng woke up from his sleep and saw Bell roasting the python that nearly swallowed him the night before.\"Zhang, you're awake just in time for breakfast.\" The explorer stirred the bonfire with a stick to adjust the flames, and then pointed at the thing next to him that was still dripping with blood. \"Snake skin. I just peeled it. After I wash it, we can use it to make a water bag of some sort, it'll be much more impervious than pails; or we could use it to make clothes. It can keep us cool\u2014very useful in hot weather.\"\"Thank you for last night.\" Zhang Heng found a place to sit on the ground. The red marks around his arm were still visible.\"Oh, don't worry about it. You saved me from the sea. If we want to survive in the wilderness, we have to help each other, right?\" Bell said as he passed a roasted snake skewer to Zhang Heng.He was about to refuse when a thought struck him\u2014this might be the only chance in his life that he got to eat a python without being thrown into jail. So, he accepted it.He took a curious bite and found that it tasted pretty good. It did not have a strong smell and tasted a bit like chicken, only chewier.When he thought about how this creature nearly took his life last night, Zhang Heng decided to have a second helping.\u2026After breakfast, the two set off again.Bell continued to play the role of a capable guide, clearing the path in the front with his knife and explaining the various organisms they encounter to Zhang Heng along the way.\"The python we ran into last night is not the only predator in this forest. When pythons eat, they normally swallow their prey head-first. Because of their poor eyesight, they sometimes eat prey that are too big for their stomachs to handle and their belly would explode. But snakes have very good digestion. They could digest bones and flesh all together without a problem. The animal bones we saw back there, some of them are still in perfect condition. It didn't look like they were the python's victims.\"Zhang Heng quietly noted down this trivia. Many things seemed to be of little use but you never know when the time would come that you would actually come to use it.For example, Ed and the guy in shorts never taught him how to salt out of seawater; it was something he had seen from a video on some bullet screen website. Using heat, crystallization and repeated filtration process, you could obtain relatively pure food-grade salt and make food much more appetizing.Speaking of which, when Zhang Heng was in primary school, he had visited Xishuangbanna with his grandfather. The forest park there left a deep impression on him.But that place was developed by man, and only a small portion of it was opened to the public for safety reasons. This was the first time Zhang Heng had been in an all-natural forest like this. Like Bell said, the colony in this place was rich and it really opened Zhang Heng's eyes.For instance, along the way, he spotted a little amphibian with a semi-transparent belly that gave Zhang Heng a view into its heart, liver and digestive system. What was more incredible was that the frog's body was only about 1-2milliliter.\"Glass frogs generally reside in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. To date, 134 types of glass frogs have been identified. Among which, sixty of them are on the verge of extinction,\" said the explorer as he carefully placed the tiny creature back onto the leaf.\"What about this?\" Zhang Heng pointed at a bump growing on a Banyan tree like a tumor. There was a new shoot growing out of it.\"Oh, staghorn fern. A type of epiphyte. They are tender green when they are young, and turn light brown when they mature. They mostly live on the trunks and branches of other trees. It's commonly found in tropical rain forests.\"Other than that, Zhang Heng also saw: a colugo. This thing was neither cat nor monkey with wings like a bat's that enclosed its neck, limbs, and tail. Spreading them allowed the mammal to glide in the air. It looked rather playful; a Bagheera kiplingi, a species of jumping spider and the only species of spiders with a herbivorous diet\u2014they eat nubs at the tip of leaves. The name was too difficult to pronounce. Zhang Heng had Bell repeat it three times and was still doubtful; bird-of-paradise whose cries sounded like gunshots. When Zhang Heng first heard it, he nearly jumped out of his skin. But the bird was very beautiful, especially its feathers that changes colors\u2026Even Bell could not help but exclaim, \"This place is a biological paradise! This is the first time I've seen so many tropical plants and animals from different regions gathered in one place! This is unbelievable! Biologists would love this piece of land.\"Just then, Zhang Heng felt something underneath his feet. He bent down to pick it up and saw that it was the tooth of some animal with a circular hole at the bottom.\"This thing looks man-made. Naturally formed holes are generally not that regular.\" Bell took the tooth from his companion and examined it. \"I know that some aboriginals would wear the teeth of the animals they hunted around their neck to show off their strength. The more powerful their game is, the more powerful they are deemed to be. That way, when it comes to choosing their partners, it would be easier for them to pick their desired mate. I have a friend, who went hunting a lion alone so that he could marry the most beautiful girl in their tribe. He never came back. \"There was indeed a reason for the smaller population of foreigners. Zhang Heng made no comment about this. Instead, he asked a question that he was more concerned about, \"Are there aboriginals living on this island? Could they be cannibals?\"Bell shook his head. \"The chances are small. The island is not very big. You said that you've been living on this island for more than a year now. If there were other people on this island, there's no reason that you haven't met them yet\u2026 Also, this thing looks like it's quite old.\"\"So, you're saying that there were aboriginals living here?\" Zhang Heng could feel sweat dripping down his back. If those aboriginals were still alive, they could have captured him and Ed to make soup on the first day they arrive on the island.'Mm, let's keep going further.\" Bell was also interested to find out. The possibility of a lost civilization appealed to the explorer in him. He nearly forgot that they had come to search for a way to leave the island.The two continued towards the heart of the island.As of now, they were already nearly halfway into their journey, and the deeper they went, the more evidence of human civilization they found.Bell took a look at the completely eroded little huts, and the moss-covered stone wares and tools, and could tell that a long time ago, an aboriginal tribe had once lived here in the forest of this island.What happened to them? Why have they all disappeared? The explorer was getting more intrigued by the minute.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng was not surprised mainly because he was aware that this was just a game and he would not have been surprised if they had found Winnie the Pooh in the forest.But, at the moment, Zhang Heng could not deny that everything around him right now was so realistic. If it had not been for his extra twenty-four hours causing a major complication and lengthening the span of the game, he would not have detected any bug at all.Other than the huts and stone tools, the pair also found a small, almost 1-hectare lake nearby. Bell tasted the water and said, \"It's drinkable. This is a freshwater lake. No wonder they built their village nearby.\"Zhang Heng's eye, however, was drawn to something half-buried in the mud by the lake.\"This tribe\u2026 Did they already possess the skills to smelt metal?\"Zhang Heng pulled out the item and found that it was a piece of very rusty ironware. It appeared to have been attached to a piece of wood but the handle was beyond recognition.Upon inspection, Zhang Heng found himself clueless as to what that item was.Bell was not all-knowing: he did not know what the thing was used for either. So, he could only analyze. \"From the look of the craftmanship, they are most probably still in the stone age era. This piece of metal may not have belonged to them.\"It was getting late so they did not continue further but found a place nearby and started a fire for cooking.The closer they were to their destination, Zhang Feng found himself in a tangle of emotions.For the past one year, he had relied on the objective of exploring the center of the island to keep himself working hard on improving his archery skills, and exercising to keep in shape until it became essentially almost like second nature to him. But to say that he was concerned about what was in there was not entirely true either.In light of this, Zhang Heng often envied Ed, Bell and the guy in shorts. They could comfort themselves that perhaps tomorrow a ship would dock at the island, or perhaps there was something on the island that could bring them home. On the contrary, player Zhang Heng knew very well that unless the time was up, he was not going anywhere.When he thought about how they were going to solve the mystery tomorrow, he was both emotional and excited\u2014he had been thinking about this day for the past one year, after all\u2014but most of all, he was at a loss.Once this was over, what was he going to rely on to survive?Thank goodness four-fifths of the time had already passed, leaving only another hundred over days to go. Even if he did not have a goal to work towards, he should be able to bite the bullet and pull through.On the third morning of the expedition, Zhang Heng rose early but when he opened his eyes, he saw that Bell was already up.\"Morning, Zhang,\" the explorer greeted him excitedly. \"I just took a walk around the lake again. Guess what I found?\"\"Er\u2026 new breakfast?\"\"That's actually true. I caught a catfish so that we can have a change of flavors. But other than that, I also found something else.\" Bell placed two rusty little balls on Zhang Heng's palm.\"What is this? Marbles?\"\"This is a bullet.\"\"How are solid bullets fired?\" Zhang Heng asked. He was not a fan of weapons but he had some basic knowledge about them. Modern weapons relied on the ignition of gunpower in the bullets to be fired. Without gunpowder, the bullet could not penetrate anything.\"Remember that thing you found by the lake? I know what it is.\" The explorer was beaming in excitement. \"It's a matchlock\u2014widely used in the fifteenth, sixteenth century Europe. The gunpower and cartridge for this type of weapon are filled separately, and then the match cord is lit up\u2026 At that time, the slave trade was booming, and the aboriginals here must have been attacked and captured by the slave traders and then sold off to farmers.\"The speculation seemed reasonable and in accordance with what they had seen. Zhang Heng decided to accept this friend's statement as the truth. However, later on that day, when they finally arrived at the heart of the island, they came across a structure that resembled an altar with a mountain of bones stacked up on top of it.Zhang Heng turned to his companion. \"Were your fifteenth, sixteenth century European slave traders this ruthless?\"\"\u2026 This is not the work of the slave traders. This was a dark and bloody period. As far as I know, slave traders do, in fact, kill those who try to resist captive in order to scare the others. Sometimes, they would also kill the ones who were too old or too young, those too inconvenient to transport.\" Bell walked up to the altar and picked up a skull. \"But this\u2026 this is not their practice.\"\"If it's not the slave traders who killed aboriginals of the island, then who did? Could they have done it themselves?\"Zhang Heng's question stumped the both of them.The architectural style of the altar was very similar to the ruins they had stumbled on by the lake.\"Alright, say the slave traders arrived on the island, and these aboriginals saw that they could were no match for the enemy so they came to the altar and ended their own lives\u2026 It's a little far-fetched.\"Bell walked to the center of the mound of bones, bent down and wiped away the dust on the stone floor. \"This is something else. It's a totem depicting a half-human, half-snake creature. It looks like it could be the gods that these aboriginals worshipped.\"Zhang Heng was a little disappointed. Although he did not care too much for whatever was in the heart of the island, finding the indigenous ruins that had no use to him caused him to feel dispirited.He had prepared for this for one an entire year, and it was a dangerous journey coming here. He was even nearly swallowed by a python. In the end, all they found was just a bunch of bones and some altar.But seeing how excited Bell was by all that, Zhang Heng kept this opinion to himself.The pair had plenty of food and water. There was still more than half of the food they had brought with them, and then on the way Bell killed quite a number of 'games', which might have looked like things that most people would be reluctant to put in their mouths, were actually surprisingly okay.Zhang Heng was contemplating whether or not to cut directly through the forest to the other end of the island then travel along the coastline to return to their dwelling when a dark shadow suddenly emerged from behind the altar and sprung for the explorer.Zhang Heng jumped. He did not need Bell's scientific explanations to recognize what that thing was\u2014jaguar, the king of the rainforest, with a likeness to a tiger, armed with sharp teeth and claws that could tear into a caiman. It was that large predator at the top of the food chain.Bell's reflex was very quick. The explorer rolled across the floor and evaded the beast's lightning attack, then drew the knife at his waist.Zhang Heng quickly drew his bow and arrow, but another jaguar appeared.This time, Bell's face fell.What?! Zhang Heng felt a wave of nausea come over him. By right, the explorer's death was still four days away. Why had these cats showed up so early? Did they get the wrong script?But there was no time for him to think about these things right now. Bell was in grave danger. No matter how good he was there was no way he could fight off two jaguars alone. Zhang Heng raised his bow and shot at the second jaguar.The cat dodged the arrow swiftly. Zhang Heng had already expected that. They were both now about 27 or 28 meters away from each other. If he had shot at Mickey Mouse from this distance, his accuracy rate was about 50\u201460%.\u00a0But the jaguar was much nimbler and lither than the Dodo bird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng's missed shot caught the attention of the jaguar. The latter quickly turned its attention to him.Bell was still wrestling the other jaguar, which meant that Zhang Heng would have to face this king of the rainforest on his own. If he had this encounter when he first came to the island, he would have been dead meat.He probably would not even be able to fight a goose, much less a jaguar.But was not his entire year of archery practice for this moment?Quickly, Zhang Heng drew another arrow, and placed it on the bowstring. He was not in a hurry to shoot because he and the beast were still quite far from each other.At this distance, he did not have the full confidence to be able to hit the target. So, he had to rein in the fear he was experiencing and wait for the jaguar to attack first.This might sound simple but actually doing it was not easy.Because for a long-range profession, the further the range, the safer it would be. Every shooter should know the kiting [1] technique.All the same, reality is cruel. Zhang Heng knew for a fact that in terms of agility and speed, his own two legs could never outrun the creature with four. He could kite but what if the jaguar chooses to join its partner and attack the explorer instead?Then when the two jaguars had him surrounded, Zhang Heng would never be able to leave this forest.So, both man and cat came into a confrontational stance. Zhang Heng maintained his aim and an upright position as his instructor had taught him, regulating his breathing.Opposite him, the jaguar's patience finally ran out, so it arced its body and prepared to pounce.Panic rose inside of Zhang Heng. This was a completely different situation from hunting a Dodo bird. Even if he missed his target, the consequence would just be not being able to eat meat. But if his arrow misses, with the jaguar's fleet-foot, he would not even have another chance to reload his bow.The one who would be eaten was him.Zhang Heng quickly chased all this jumble of thoughts away, and anchored his emotions. In that split second, the jaguar made a move. It was much faster than Zhang Heng had imagined it to be. Kicking the ground with its hindlegs provided the creature with a frighteningly explosive force.The distance between them was rapidly shrinking. At less than seven meters, finally came the sound of bowstrings being released.You could say that this shot was Zhang Heng's most satisfactory shot so far. After an extended period of preparing and gauging, his mind went into a sort of Zen state, where the world before him seemed to be moving in slow-motion and he could see the motion of the jaguar's whiskers.Be it strength, angle or calculation\u2014everything was perfect.As soon as the arrow left his hand, Zhang Heng knew that it would hit the target.And he was right.At such a close distance, and running at a full sprint, the jaguar was unable to elude and could only watch as the incoming wood arrow hit its head.But what happened next was completely out of Zhang Heng's expectation. He did not know if it was because the carbonized arrowhead was not lethal enough because he had terrible luck, the arrow hit the cat's skull but did not go any deeper.The jaguar let out a shrill cry of pain but the injury to its head was not enough to kill. Instead, it provoked the beast which then proceeded to charge towards Zhang Heng, knocking him to the ground.Zhang Heng pushed the bow up against the jaguar's neck to keep it from ripping his throat out but the jaguar was pinning the lower half of his body to the ground and was clawing madly at his shoulder, boring bloody holes into it.But the harrowing pain provided Zhang Heng with a surge of strength that he had never experienced before.With death just around the corner, he momentarily forgot his fears. He knew that no one could save him at this time. If he wanted to live, he would have to rely on himself.Keeping one hand on the bow, Zhang Heng allowed his free hand to flail about the ground. Sensing the pressure against its neck weakening, the look in the jaguar's turned savage. The beast stretched out its neck to reach Zhang Heng's neck, the saliva from its razor-sharp teeth dripping down onto his victim's face. The stench nearly knocked Zhang Heng unconscious.He was now in much more danger than before.But at that very moment, Zhang Heng's free hand managed to reach the spear he had dropped on the ground.The putrid, hungry mouth was about to tear down on his neck when he plunged the spear into the jaguar's neck. The creature's eyes went blank. But Zhang Heng did not let go; instead he pushed harder, twisting the weapon deeper into the cat's neck.He had tossed his wooden bow aside, and reached for the arrow that was lodged in the jaguar and thrust both hands with all his might.All that whirlwind adrenaline had him forget about the pain all over his body. This was battle of life and death. There was no such thing as mercy here. Zhang Heng did everything he could to inflict damage on the wild beast before him until a voice announced in his ear:[Successfully exterminated an adult jaguar single-handedly. Game Points +10. You may view your character panel for further information\u2026]Only then, could Zhang Heng confirm that he was the winner of this bloodbath.Pushing the breathless piece of dead meat off of himself, Zhang Heng saw that Bell's fight with the other jaguar was also drawing to an end.The explorer had punctured the jaguar's lower abdomen with his knife, and the creature was losing a lot of blood. Its movement was also more labored and leaden. It looked like it was going to follow after its partner's footsteps.\"Heh, you alright, Zhang?\" Bell asked, concerned. He had seen that Zhang Heng was in danger but had been unable to help.\"\u2026 I've always wanted to own a piece of tiger-skin skirt, but I guess jaguar skin works too,\" Zhang Heng huffed, and then dropped to the ground with his arms and legs spread out. Having verified that he was absolutely safe, all the energy in his body suddenly drained away. He did not even want to lift a single finger.When he thought about how insane everything that had just happened was, his beating heart could not seem to calm down.He had never thought that one day he would have to fight such a large beast up close and personal. According to the time count back in reality, just an hour ago, he had just been drinking lemon water at the bar.But now, he was a man who had just killed a jaguar.It was pretty cool if you think about it. But it was still better if something like this never happens again.\"The stone on the altar broke during the struggle, and I found this.\" The explorer walked up to his companion once he had taken care of his opponent.\"What is that?\" Zhang Heng looked at the furry thing in Bell's hand. It looked like some sort of tail. The strange thing was if the aboriginals did hide this thing under the stone, it would not be in such a good condition after such a long time.He was about to tell Bell to keep then changed his mind the last minute and asked the explorer, \"Can I have it?\"\"Of course, you saved me. Twice now.\" Bell was just a generous guy.\"Thank you. This thing might just be useful for me.\"Zhang Heng changed his mind because when he picked up the furry thing, a voice notified him,[Found game item\u2014Rabbit's foot (unidentified)]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng had been on the island for more than a year now, but this was the first game item he had come across.But other than the voice in his voice, there was nothing else.He did not know what this thing was used for, or what it does. It seemed as if the voice did not intend to inform him either. After it had notified him about the item, it just disappeared.Zhang Heng surveyed the rabbit's foot but found nothing special about it. He would just have to keep it in his waist pouch for the moment.After Bell looked at the wound on Zhang Heng's shoulder, he decided not to take any risk and sterilized the wound with saline. \"The wound is too deep. The claws of beasts that live in the wild like this are normally full of germs. There's a chance it could be infected.\"Zhang Heng understood the horrible consequence of infection. In the city, this would have just been a matter of an antibiotic injection. But on this barren island, the chances of surviving an infection was next to none. It was because of the injury on his leg that Ed contracted high fever and passed away. Even though his death was premeditated by the game; that would mean the game designers could be trying to inform the players of such dangers.But there are some things, that even if made known in advance, could never be helped.What should he do in that situation?Being able to fight back and kill his attacker had already exceeded his limit. It was impossible to think that he could have come out unscathed.The explorer comforted, \"It may not be infected, for sure. Maybe nothing would happen.\"Zhang Heng smiled bitterly. He could only hope for that right now.After they had rested for a day, since they had already made it here to the center of the island, Zhang Heng suggested that they go straight to the other side of the island. Ed did not express any opinion against the idea, of course.So, they spent another two days or so to pass through the forest.When they were finally greeted by the sight of the beach and the ocean, Zhang Heng was rewarded for his achievement 'toured island' and had another 3 points added to his game points.But this was none of his concern right now.There were two things that were giving him a headache right now, was the possibility of being infected and that time for Bell's death was approaching.The first matter was purely dependent on luck\u2014there was nothing he could do; the second matter was having stayed together for such a long time, and that Bell saved him from the becoming python food, Zhang Heng regarded him as a friend. In the end, he decided to give his friends a heads up.Of course, he would not mention that they were in a game and that Bell was a non-player character (NPC) with a buff that set him up to die after nineteen days. The discussion of whether this would yield some unpredictable reaction aside, Bell would have found this explanation difficult to believe.\u00a0Chances are, he would conclude that because Zhang Heng had been alone on the island for too long, his mind was in a state of confusion.Which was why Zhang Heng only told Bell to be extra careful tomorrow.The explorer did seem to mind it too much. After all, the both of them did just massacre a jaguar each. Now that they had left the forest, they had moved past the most dangerous portion of the journey. Whatever happened next could not possibly be as severe as this.Zhang Heng thought that it made sense, but after what happened with the guy in shorts and the poisoned mushroom, Zhang Heng knew that anything could happen tomorrow. He persuaded Bell not to hunt the next morning and kept his eye the explorer for the entire span of twenty-four hours.Zhang Heng also wanted to see to what extent this death could be done and if it could be changed.\u2026Nothing happened in the morning.Zhang Heng trailed behind the explorer the entire day like an idiot, giving his friend the chills.\u00a0In the afternoon, Bell suggested that they go outside the forest to pick some wild vegetables and mushrooms to make a seafood soup but was sternly refused by Zhang Heng.What kind of joke is it? Were they seriously using the same trick again?Zhang Heng was thoroughly traumatized by mushrooms. Besides, even if he really wanted to eat them, today was not going to be the day.Unable to do anything, Bell had wanted to go for a walk by the beach but seeing how resolute Zhang Heng was, he decided not to ask for fear that it would only give trouble to his friend.In the end, they settled on walking toward the direction they lived in quietly.Throughout the entire journey, neither one of them spoke. Bell was not a man with a temper but he did feel that Zhang Heng was making a big deal out of nothing.Then as they were passing by a shallow beach, the cliff on his right suddenly came crashing down without warning. Caught off guard, Bell watched in horror as the falling rocks were coming down at his head. But right at that very moment, someone pounced on him and they rolled away together sideways.The crumbled rocks smashed against the coral reef next to them, giving the explorer the shock of his life.After that, he saw blood in the sea and a motionless Zhang Heng lying face down. \"Zhang, are you alright?\"Zhang Heng replied only after a while, \"\u2026 I'm fine, Bell. I just jumped at you too forcefully\u2014my nose is bleeding from the impact.\" Zhang Heng sat up, hands cradling his nose.The situation was fraught with danger but it was no match for the vigilant Zhang Heng. When he heard the rumbling noise above him, his first instinct was to throw himself at Bell, and managed to get his friend out of harm's way.Upon remembering the warning yesterday, the explorer exclaimed, \"My god. Are you an oracle? You could foresee the future! This is incredible!\"\"Don't celebrate so soon. It's not over yet.\" Zhang Heng reminded him.The truth was, he did not know when this was going to end\u2014when today was over? Or until Bell dies? If it was the latter then no gods nor ghosts could save the explorer.Zhang Heng could not guarantee for sure that he would be as keen-eyed as he was today for the next hundred days.But fortunately, this incident earned him some credibility, and Bell was now taking his 'prophecy' much more seriously.To be safe, neither one of them slept a wink the entire night. When the sun peeked out from the horizon, Zhang Heng was lost for words. He did not think he would be able to help the explorer live past twenty days.Bell yawned. \"So? Am I safe?\"\"I don't know.\" Zhang Heng shook his head. \"But you can move about freely.\"Having passed the most dangerous nineteenth day, who knows what would happen in the future. But like the wound on Zhang Heng's shoulder, he would only know only after the infection set in.However, whether it was Bell or Zhang Heng, their luck seemed to be pretty good. Neither one of them encountered any life-threatening danger, and a scab had already begun to form on Zhang Heng's wound. There had been no swelling or puss.A week later, the pair finally arrived at the hut. Seeing Mickey Mouse sunbathing in the garden brought a feeling of familiarity to Zhang Heng. He even thought that the bird did not look as ugly as before.This little trip, although short, was filled with danger. Fortunately, the payoff was also good.Not only did Zhang Heng earn another 13 points, he also took home a prop that he did not know how to use; most importantly, though, was that Bell was alive and breathing.This meant that for the rest of the 100 days, Zhang Heng was finally not alone on this island.While he was clearing out a house to be turned into the explorer's room, Zhang Heng asked, \"Bell, can you be my teacher?\"\"Sure, what would you like to learn?\"\"English. I have a grade six exam in December.\"\"\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBell's English was excellent, probably because he was English.\u2026The first thing they di upon their return from their expedition to the center of the island was to plant the seeds they collected in the vegetable garden. Zhang Heng went back and forth, eventually deciding on giving up on the idea of making a skirt. It was mostly because he still would not be able to cosplay as Monkey King without the staff.In the end, Bell conjoined the two pieces of jaguar pelt into carpets. Not long after, the breeding garden was full of animals the explorer brought back from his hunts.Mickey Mouse seemed slightly taken aback by the sudden increase of neighbors. Zhang Heng even found the dodo bird's wife allowing the two people on the island to enjoy some eggs at last.Finally, Zhang Heng had this feeling that he had conquered nature. He had eaten more than 20 varieties of vegetables, added two more seasonings to his pantry, owned a pond full of seafood, which he could take from whenever he liked and ate meat every day. Most importantly, he eventually found someone he could talk with.That feeling was just like when Robinson met Friday.Well\u2026 alright. From the student-teacher perspective, probably more like Friday.For 4 hours every day, Zhang Heng would be learning English from Bell, which included listening, speaking, reading, and writing. On top of that, he continued his archery practices, although he'd already achieved his goal. Over the course of the year, it had now become a habit. The only thing was, that he no longer spent as much time on it as he used to. As an added bonus, Bell taught him some defensive moves.His time on the island was coming to an end. On the 520th morning, a rescue vessel passing by spotted the signal fire by the beach and sent a lifeboat to the island. Before the boat could even reach the shore, a woman jumped off the vessel and came running towards the men in tears.\"My wife, Kaya!\" The explorer dropped the homemade fishing rod in his hand and stood up abruptly.The relieved couple embraced each other.Bell then removed the blade he stowed across his waist and placed it in Zhang Heng's hand.\"As per our agreement previously, this belongs to you now. I've been to many dangerous places all over the world\u2026 the polar regions, deserts, highlands\u2026 but this was the first time I've been marooned on a desert island. It has been an incredibly unforgettable and valuable experience. You are my forever friend. Of all our days here, it's not just you who was the one learning. I've also learned a lot from you - I learned for the first time that there's such a thing as grammar in the English language.\"\"\u2026\"\"Let's go, my friend. We should go home.\"Zhang Heng followed the Butre couple onto the lifeboat, surprised to see that there were reporters from several TV stations on board. Everyone roared into claps and applause the moment they caught a glimpse of the explorer who had returned safely.On the ship, Zhang Heng took a long, hot bath and changed into clothes the sailors had provided. Finally, that feeling of returning to a civilized society dawned upon him. Instead of joining the celebration, however, Zhang Heng found himself a secluded and quiet corner on the ship that no one would take notice of. He was almost two hours away from leaving this virtual world.It felt like the longest two hours of his life.Zhang Heng was wondering what the return process was going to be like when suddenly, darkness enveloped everything around him, and a familiar voice spoke in his ear.[Arrived at the return deadline. Task completion confirmed\u2026][Beginner's edition of Desert Island Survival successfully completed. The first round of the game is over. Returning to reality\u2026]\u2026When Zhang Heng's vision had been restored, he found himself sitting by the bar holding the cup of water and lime he'd taken a sip from.The first thing he did was to reach out and touch his face. That thick stubbled and coarse skin weathered by the wind, and the sun was gone.The bartender lady, obviously considerate, took out a compact mirror from her purse and passed it to him.With the help of the little mirror, Zhang Heng was able to confirm that he looked no different from when he first walked into the bar. He was still dressed in his sports attire and running shoes. His swiss army knife was still safely tucked away in his pocket.\"So, what was that? A strange dream?\"\"No, you did disappear for two hours\u2026 not just from this building or this bar - you could not be found in every corner of this world.\" The bartender took back her compact. \"Now, you must have a lot of questions, but unfortunately, I cannot answer most of them. You will have to find that out for yourself in the game.\"Zhang Heng listened, speechless.\"What I can tell you is that this game takes place once every month. You can pick whatever time you like to come to the checkpoint and join the game. It won't always be the Sex and the City bar, though. There is more than one checkpoint in every city. If you can't find them, you can always give customer service a call and use the special login service after paying a sum. Failure to log in on time will result in your disqualification. Also, game participants, by default, must accept a strict non-disclosure agreement. You're forbidden to disclose anything related to anyone other than the players and staff. Mm, I think that about sums up the basic restrictions. Don't hold on to your fluke mind.\"The bartender rubbed her chin. \"What else is there. Let me think\u2026 oh, other than log-ins, the game venues also provide other services. You can consult customer service for more details.\"Peeled off a sticky note and scribbling down some numbers, she continued, \"This is the number. Don't call for nothing because I am your customer service.\"\"You have an awful lot of jobs.\" Zhang Heng noted in surprise.\"It's not like I have a choice. Houses in big cities are so expensive.\" The bartender sighed. \"Alright. Is there anything else?\"Zhang Heng searched his pocket and took out a furry item. \"Tell me. The services you mentioned. Do they also include item identification?\"Everything from the game, not excluding even the beard and the scar on his shoulder, the collection of stoneware he made, and the knife that Bell gifted him, did not make it back with him to reality.Everything had just been sitting quietly in his pocket\"Game item?\" The bartender gasped. \"It looks like you've got yourself quite the bounty this time. These kinds of things are very uncommon. Most people can't even find one after several rounds of the game. I do provide an identification service here, but it's going to cost you five game-points. Do you have it?\"\"How do I pay?\"The bartender took out a tablet and after a few taps, brought up a payment interface. \"Just enter your player ID number. No need to worry about other people using your number, though - you have to be present for the payment to be effective.\"Probably because he had seen too much since he set foot in the bar, Zhang Heng had already turned a little numb.He had already memorized the set of numbers and quickly regurgitated them. After keying them in, the bartender slid on a pair of gloves before placing the rabbit's foot into a small wooden box.\"This will take some time, about two to three days. I'll text you when it's done.\"Drawn to her movements, Zhang Heng had a sudden ominous feeling. \"Wait. Now, why are you bring so careful?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\"Fine. Considering you've just made a transaction with me, I'll reveal something useful to you.\" The bartender took off her gloves. \"Do you know why game items are so valuable?\"\"Err\u2026 I think you've mentioned that there are very few of them.\"\"Rarity does not equate to value. The term 'game item' is used to correspond with the theme, and it's not accurate at all. In reality, this is a very magical item. It contains inconceivable supernatural forces. They work in both games and reality. If you use it well, it will be beneficial to you. But sometimes, it could create problems for you. No one can guarantee that this force will bring positive effects, so you have to be extra careful when handling game items. Just because it has not been identified yet does not mean that the results are not present. Speaking of which, did anything strange happen to you after you picked it up?\"\"No.\" Zhang Heng thought back to the time after the rabbit's foot was given to him. His life went on without incident.\"Then, this is probably not the type with negative effects, or perhaps it could be triggered under specific conditions.\" For some reason, the bartender's tone was laced with pity. \"When these negative effect game items are used well, they can do wonders. A wooden box made of tulewood can isolate its supernatural powers - the best option to store the items. If there's a need, you can always buy them from me. Oh, and also, if you have any game items that you do not need, you can choose to leave it here so I can help you sell it. There's always a large-scale auction at the end of every year. Keep an eye on your mailbox. An e-mail will be sent to you before the event. If there's nothing else, we'll meet again next time.\"\u2026The bartender's service was terrible. That initial excitement after earning his five game-points had dwindled and suddenly lost all interest to explain anything else to her.Zhang Heng asked her what services were available at the game site, and she said that she would send him a pdf to him through WeChat.Upon exiting the metal room, Zhang Heng was bombarded with loud thumping music, which he no longer thought was raucous. After spending a year and a half on that island, hearing the symphonies of a civilized society made him feel a little warm and fuzzy inside.Zhang Heng descended the iron ladder and quickly disappeared amongst the crowd of people.Although it was already one in the morning, the number of cars parked outside the bar seemed to have increased.Zhang Heng did not return to school because one, it was quite late already, and two, too much information had been dumped on him for the past two hours. He needed to go someplace quiet to sort through and digest them. Besides that, there was something else he needed to verify.So, Zhang Heng checked into a room in the express hotel by the road and asked the receptionist for a pen and some paper. Tired as he was, he did not feel like sleeping right now. He turned on the table lamp and promptly listed down every important detail that had happened today and his theories.When dawn broke, he reread the stack of lists he had written and rewritten, tore them up, and flushed them down the toilet.After that, he checked out of the room before heading straight to the archery range across the road, the very place he'd been coming to train.As soon as it opened at 8 am, Zhang Heng went in, took out the SF recurve bow he deposited there, and selected a 30-meter archery range.He drew his bow and released an arrow.6th Ring.Zhang Heng was not at all surprised. He had been using a primitive homemade bow and was not used to this modern bow yet. The first shot was just a test. Of course, it was not the least bit startling that the results weren't satisfactory. Adjusting his angle, he released the bowstring once more.The second one was much better.8th Ring.That very moment, Zhang Heng's coach walked in. He was just about to greet his student but decided not to bother him when he saw how absorbed Zhang Heng was. He stood silently at the back with his thermos cup, ready to correct Zhang Heng's posture and movement.Then the next arrow pierced the ninth ring.Not bad. That was a good shot; the instructor thought to himself. Most of the time, when newcomers first started, they would have kinds of problems ranging from not holding the bow firmly enough to the wrong posture, thus deviating from their center of gravity.Zhang Heng had only just begun to pick up the sport, but his posture was spot-on as if he had done it many times before. It was solid as a mountain.If that was not talent, then what was that?Zhang Heng's coach was a former member of the city's archery team. Alas, his talent was limited. No matter how hard he trained, he could not seem to improve. Soon after, he was defeated by an amateur who had only trained for less than half a year. Disappointed in himself, he left the professional circle and was invited by the archery range's owner to coach there.Seeing how well the sport had been doing these two years, he could not help but feel a stirring inside him. But he was too old for this - he had no more potential left to discover. Even if he returned to the game, he would end up nowhere.Thus, he decided to focus his attention on the young people training in the range. He wanted to see if he could develop a keen eye for scouting able players and take talented apprentices under his wing.Who would know that perhaps one day, one might be able to compete at the national level and fulfill his dream on his behalf?With that thought, he began to keep an eye out for potential candidates. Initially, he focused mainly on eight to fourteen-year-olds, the best age for laying a foundation. Any older and it would be too late, which was why he never paid too much attention to Zhang Heng.In the three previous sessions, this young man did not show any special skills and was no different from amateur hobbyists who played just for sport.Zhang Heng's progress gave him quite a shock.He had not even started training but yet, he was surprisingly good. He had risen so quickly above his peers from the same batch.At the same time, however, the instructor felt sorry for Zhang Heng. The boy had gotten in touch with the sport too late in the game. Even if he had the talent, without sufficient practice, it would be extremely challenging for him to go any further.While these thoughts were running through the instructor's mind, Zhang Heng drew in a deep breath. When he was done with the adjustment, he released five arrows in succession.Each shot was less than 2 seconds apart.Out of the five arrows, the 4th hit the 10th ring, and a slightly faulty one landed on the 9th ring.Zhang Heng knew that this had to do with his coordination. He was used to that body back on the desert island. A year and a half ago, his strength and response had already deviated by a little. However, from these few shots, he had already found out what he needed to know.The skills he had gained while training retained in his muscle memory. Now, he just needed two weeks of practice to return to his level back on the island.In fact, with a more powerful and more accurate modern bow, his shots would have much higher accuracy and a greater range.It appeared that the skills acquired in the game could be brought back to reality.This was actually not too surprising since those skills did not fall from the sky - he had actually trained hard for them.Zhang Heng also noticed that unlike traditional games, this game did not utilize the four attributes system. The body he 'used' in the game was his own. When he was in trouble, he had to use his knowledge and abilities to solve them.\u00a0Therefore, the skills each person developed were essential. Thinking about it now, those extra 24 hours did not seem so bad after all.This meant that he would have more game-time compared to the other players, and could better improve himself. The critical thing here was that these in-game improvements were just as applicable in reality.Zhang Heng groaned, utterly unaware of how much his five shots had affected his instructor.The latter nearly dropped his mug.A hardworking amateur hobbyist could hit 49 points with five arrows. However, considering how recent Zhang Heng had started learning, which were only three sessions and that quick succession of shots - only a precious handful of hobbyists would be able to do that.He was a prodigy! A prodigy for sure! What other explanations could there be? The coach was now seeing Zhang Heng in a completely different light. He looked at Zhang Heng as if he was looking at an inimitable jade. The longer he looked, the more he liked what he saw.How could I not have noticed such a brilliant treasure?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He would shock the judges in his first competition and then return defeated from the nationals, but just as he was about to give up, he would rise from the ashes under his coach's counsel. He would finally join the national team and win the Olympic gold medal. The instructor even thought about the interviews that would take place after that.In the end, before this youngblood's story could even begin, it died a premature death at the young man's tactful decline.Archery was just a hobby for Zhang Heng. He had no plans to make a living out of it.In fact, he knew better than anyone else that his archery skills were simply a culmination of time. He did not possess any unique talents. He might perhaps be able to become master among the amateurs, but if he had gotten involved in the professional circle, it would be challenging, to say the least, for him to rise to the top.On top of that, this was the second time Zhang Heng had rejected his instructor. The latter finally recognized that the young man before him had no intention of mixing in this circle and could not help but feel that it was such a shame.You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. He could not put a gun to Zhang Heng's head and force him to make him his coach.After a few more shots, and Zhang Heng got his answers and stopped training.The morning had classes in store for him. Thank goodness it was at 9.45. Depositing his bow, he promptly returned to school.The moment his peers spotted him in the classroom, they shot him knowing, sassy smiles. Zhang Heng did not know how to explain himself, so he blurted that he had actually spent a year and a half stranded on a deserted island, before finally finding another man.The lesson was underway when Wei Jiangyang snuck up to the seat next to him and tried to make him confess. In spite of that, Zhang Heng did not appear to be lying, nor did he blush or react suspiciously.When he finally accepted that nothing of the amorous sort had befallen his friend the night before, Wei Jiangyang quickly changed the subject.\"Xiao Xiao and her roommates are thinking of going camping next week, but I'm concerned about their safety. I'm looking for some guys to join. Chen Huadong has already agreed to come. Not so for Ma Wei. How about you?\"Xiao Xiao was Wei Jiangyang's girlfriend. If Xiao Xiao wanted to go camping, it was without question that Wei Jiangyang would want to join her. One lone male, however, was not strong enough. Also, wherever the couple went, they would always attract flak - his girlfriend's roommate and the other girls would definitely make fun of them. Instead, Xiao Xiao gave her boyfriend the task of recruiting more people to join them.Wei Jiangyang was not very hopeful. Zhang Heng was the kind of person who stayed away from large groups and rarely joined group activities. This guy had his own rhythm in life.However, to Wei Jiangyang's surprise, Zhang Heng agreed!Previously, Zhang Heng would never be caught red-handed participating in activities like this. But after spending such a long time away from society, he needed lively environments to 'heal' himself. Although Ma Wei had opted out, he was most likely to spend his entire day in the library, only returning to the room at lights out - like he did every day. So, if Zhang Heng were to stay, he would have to spend the whole weekend alone in the dorm.\"That's great!\" Wei Jiangyang chirped. \"Other than Xiao Xiao, all her other roommates are still single. Don't say I never gave you the heads up. The Shen Xixi performing in this year's welcoming party tonight is also from their dorm. Oh, I forgot you're not going. Anyway, what you need to know is that whenever she sings, the boys would fall head over heels for her. She's the most popular girl in her department.\"It was obvious Zhang Heng bore no interest in these departmental celebrities. With so many things happening one after the other, he was not inclined to think about romance. He agreed to the camping purely for the fun of it.Considering he did not have any classes scheduled on Friday afternoons, Zhang Heng decided to prepare ahead of time for the game next month. Back at the express hotel, he had already completed preliminary planning and made adjustments to his schedule.After lunch, he found a 24-hour gym nearby, and immediately signed up for a membership card.On top of that, he had also increased his rock-climbing and running hours. Since he did not know what he would be facing next, the safest option would be to improve his physical fitness.Also, in every game, he would be using his own body. In other words, different levels of physical fitness could bring completely different gaming experiences.For example, during the Desert Island Survival game, where the players were given the option to save the people drowning in the ocean, the person with an average fitness would be able to save Ed, whereas those who were stronger could save the guy in shorts and Bell who were further away. Of course, the most pitiful ones were those who did not know how to swim at all. As a result, they could only watch from the safety of the shore.For the most part, Zhang Heng's fitness was considered average among the students of the university as he had never undergone any targeted science-based training. But he did have his own advantage, having double the preparation time compared to the other players. They only had a month between each game, but he had two.If the two months were used well, he could improve his fitness by a lot. The thought of joining Taekwondo or boxing classes did cross his mind, but one couldn't rush these kinds of things. He would have to tackle them one by one, starting by working on his foundation first. After all, those skills could be practiced in the game as well.The following week was spent with a full schedule.He had begun training the strength of his waist, back, arms, and legs. He even took up flexibility training in the gym. On top of his endurance-training long runs, he included sprints that tested his explosive-force in his training plan.He also made time to visit the Sex and the City bar during\u00a0still time1.That place was filled with secrets. Having been inside the game himself, Zhang Heng was naturally intrigued and wanted to know more about it. Since he got only scarce information out of the bartender lady, he decided to take matters into his own hands.He should at least be able to uncover some clues from the furnishing and decoration of the sheet-metal room and the collection behind the bar.\u00a0Also, he really wanted to find out if the rule about not seeing the other players still applied during still time.However, when Zhang Heng arrived at the bar, an inexplicable feeling of panic overcame him, which only grew more intense the moment he placed his hand on the handle of the metal door.Zhang Heng hesitated for a moment when he suddenly decided to let go of the handle.He did not know where this warning came from, but the message it conveyed was very clear - do not attempt to enter the game venue at siesta.Even though he was burning with curiosity, Zhang Heng decided to play it safe; after all, whatever he was facing could not be explained with logic.That was how Zhang Heng's first secret exploration was brought to an end, not managing to gather much useful information.It was already Monday when during class, his phone suddenly vibrated. Glancing at the message, it turned out to be from customer service.\"Your item has been delivered to your desk in your room. This is a notification message. Please do not reply.\"Zhang Heng put his phone under the table and typed as stealthily as he could, \"What about my game checkpoint service list?\"He tapped on send and after a while, the bartender replied, \"Oops! I forgot. I'll send it to you once I'm done dealing with the matter at hand.\"\"\u2026\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhang Heng stared at the card with the bartender's handwriting, speechless.Such short and simple words cost him five game-points?Even though he had a decent amount of points, he could tell that it was not cheap having seen how excited the bartender was when she'd received the points.Zhang Heng was not the least bit surprised by the results of the identification. A rabbit's foot was an amulet believed to bring good luck in many cultures. This item was probably responsible for how his wound remained uninfected back on the island.His doubled time aside, this was the first supernatural item he possessed.Taking into account its positive effects, Zhang Heng decided to wear it as a keychain.Who would know how much that little bit of luck actually was?Since he had nothing else to do, Zhang Heng decided to experiment with something. He went to the Wumart next to the library and bought two scratch cards costing him 20 yuan. One of them won him 10 yuan and the other 5 yuan.After subtracting the principal, he sustained a 5 yuan loss.After that, Zhang Heng went to another supermarket. Out of the two he bought, one said, 'Thanks for your patronage' and the other one won him 20 yuan.He had broken-even.Now, Zhang Heng had now somewhat understood the lucky rabbit's effectiveness. He had initially hoped that his earnings would be higher than average, but alas, he still sustained a loss. Although his luck did improve, it was nothing to rave about. Any intentions of using this little bit of luck to earn money would prove to be quite the challenge.As he was leaving the supermarket after completing the experiment, Zhang Heng spotted a young couple under a tree nearby.\u00a0The guy was trying hard to explain something, but the girl kept shaking her head. When the guy reached out to pull the girl in, she sidestepped him instead.Zhang Heng looked away. He was not about to meddle in other people's business. Things like that practically happened every day in school. The university was the gathering of a cesspool of hormones, where all kinds of drama occurred all the time.That being said, Zhang Heng did not have to worry about the guy doing anything beyond the pale because it was broad daylight, and they were within school grounds. Any scream whatsoever would draw the scents of overzealous young men, pouncing to save the damsel in distress.So off to the library, Zhang Heng went.At noon on Friday, Zhang Heng bought some snacks and outdoor supplies, its contents some mosquito repellent spray, towels, and band-aids. Wei Jiang Heng had already rented the camping gear and car; its cost split evenly among those who were going. It was 300 yuan a piece. Any overpayment was refunded, and imperfections reimbursed.Zhang Heng was checking his camera to make sure the batteries were full when Chen Huadong and Wei Jiangyang walked into the room carrying large and small bags.\"The girls bought these. It's tonight's dinner. Help us load them into the car later.\"\"Sure! Thanks,\" exclaimed Zhang Heng, who was pretty much all packed up.Wei Jiangyang deposited the bag he was carrying onto the table. He guzzled down the glass of water on the table, then heaved a long sigh. \"I've been so busy these two days, running around all day working myself to the ground like a horse. You guys are the wiser ones. Come to think of it, being single isn't all that bad.\"\"No, please, Childe Wei. Thanks to you, I am only beginning to see a ray of light. Don't pour cold water on me so soon.\" Chen Huadong said with a twinkle in his eyes.\"You're going after Shen Xixi?\" Wei Jiangyang glared at his friend from the corner of his eyes.\"No, no. Brother, I know my limits, alright. She's like the Public Relations Departments' number one wholesaler of the 'good person card1.' Just too many guys are falling into unrequited love for her. I'm not going to be part of that madness. I don't mind give up this treasure that is Shen Xixi for our Childe Zhang to conquer. Personally, I much prefer Xu Jing,\" Chen Huadong grinned.\"The hell. I knew you liked that kind, you pervert. Xu Jing is a legit Loli, a popular one at that. The only thing's that she's quite poor at managing herself - she only learned how to take the subway when she came to university. In fact, until now, she would at times go in the wrong direction, or even miss a stop. Also, she washes her clothes and socks in a washing machine.\"\"That's not a problem. Not a problem at all.\u00a0Adorkable-ness is justice1! You know me, brother. I've been a loyal\u00a0Love Develops2\u00a0fan for so many years.\" Chen Huadong pushed his sparkling glasses up the bridge of his nose.\"How inhumane and immoral! Where is the\u00a0one-one-zero1\u00a0when you need them?\" Wei Jiangyang exclaimed in distress before turning to Zhang Heng. \"Shen Xixi is pretty good, though. You won't even consider it? Most girls despise those who are popular with the guys, but Shen Xixi is an exception. In fact, Xiao Xiao said the girl she admires most is Shen Xixi - she's pretty, is an ace at studies, sings well, and is quite genuine with people. She may have rejected many guys, but she has never kept them as 'spare tires2.'\u00a0It's always a clean rejection.\"\"That's why she's been given the nickname 'Kill em' all1.'\" Chen Huadong chuckled.\"\u2026\"\"But after getting to know her a little, I find her not too bad. She has been the one among the girls who's been taking care of the trip.\u00a0When we went to get the stuff for the camp just now, she tried talking to us, and we even enjoyed a few laughs \u2014 not the slightest bit of arrogance. Hmm, I guess you can never completely trust spreading rumors,\" added Chen Huadong, plainly singing a different tune this time.\"Are you guys done talking?\" Zhang Heng chipped in.\"Almost. Don't worry. Our relationship has come to an end. I have always known that this day would come,\" Chen Huadong stubbornly retorted.\"\u2026\"\"Why don't the both of you spend your free time by paying some attention to current international affairs instead? Why are you always so concerned about my love life?\"Wei Jiangyang and Chen Huadong looked at each other. They whispered in a grave tone, \"Zhang Heng, we're a little worried for you.\"\"Huh?\"\"I always thought that you're the kind of person who plays by his own rhythm, completely unaffected by the outside world. But since last week, we've felt this new inexplicable edginess out of you.\"Chen Huadong joined in, \"Mm, I know this sounds a little melodramatic, but right now, you give off this vibe of loneliness that seems to come from deep within your bones. Do you how many recluses there are on\u00a0Zhongnan Mountains1? That's the kind of feeling you're giving me. Be honest with us, brother. Has something happened to you? Why are you suddenly so withdrawn?\"The words struck a chord in Zhang Heng's heart. Of course, he knew what had happened to him. No one was as withdrawn from the world as he was. Spending over a year all alone on a deserted island where even his toothbrush was self-made left him with a tremendous feeling of loneliness.Even though he had returned to the real world, physically unchanged, that period spent in isolation had left him an entirely different person.Had experience and learning shaped us into who we are today?Drifting along with his thoughts, Zhang Heng recalled the bartender's words and was suddenly intrigued. If he continued playing this game for many years to come, what would he be like when it ended?Would he a completely different person from who he was today?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe minibus Wei Jiangyang booked had just arrived downstairs. The three boys loaded the vehicle with the camping equipment and food they had prepared.Zhang Heng checked out his sf recurve bow from the shooting range the day before.After about a week of practice, his skills were almost fully recovered. With the help of modern technology, he was able to hit ring 9 at 50-meters. But Zhang Heng's specialty at was shooting moving targets, although it all depended on the target's speed and the trajectory.One particular thing bugged him. He kept feeling that a pair of resentful eyes were gazing at him, which made him a little hesitant to unleash his full potential. By and large, he had to wait for still time to find a place for practice. Now that an opportunity to traverse the wilderness had presented itself, he could find a serene place to practice his archery skills.\"Childe Zhang, if anything dangerous happens, you have to protect me first,\" Chen Huadong trilled jokingly. Zhang Heng did not keep his archery lessons a secret from his roommates. All of them knew that he'd just started. In fact, only a week ago and had even searched the net for tutorial videos. How much progress could he have made?\"Alright, don't forget to fall into my arms when it happens.\"They chatted and laughed as they repeated up and down the stairs. Finally, after loading everything into the back of the van, the three girls made their way to them.Chen Huadong gave Zhang Heng a nudge with his elbow and said, \"The one on the left is Shen Xixi.\"Zhang Heng looked in the direction his friend pointed at and saw a tall girl. Wei Jiangyang sure wasn't lying when he said that her physical condition was good - she had the body of a model, and was easy on the eyes. Not to mention that, unlike the coquettish superstars on the television and magazines, there was purity in her eyes. There was none of that pretentious, deliberate 'girl shyness' on her. It was no wonder that she was the girl of so many boys' dreams; the Public Relations Departments' number one 'good person card' wholesaler.Shen Xixi flipped out three bottles of water from her bag and handed them to the three boys. She piped excitedly, \"Thank you for the hard work, guys!\"Zhang Heng accepted the bottle and thanked her.It was the little things that told a lot about a person's upbringing. It was apparent that Shen Xixi did not consider the three boys as free labor and personal bodyguards, nor did she think that just because she was a girl, letting the boys do the heavy lifting was by default. Such qualities on a woman, especially a beautiful one, was more than hard to come by.Chen Huadong continued to play the role of an inept, fumbling advisor, He whispered into Zhang Heng's ear, \"It's been said that Shen Xixi's father is a university lecturer and her mother is a novel translator. Seems like a good family. So\u2026 what do you think? Childe Zhang, I believe your families are well-matched.\"The person that Wei Jiangyang was waiting for was missing. He could not help but ask himself, \"Where's Xiaoxiao? Why isn't she here yet?\"\"Hahaha! Each time we go out, that woman is the most troublesome of all. Putting her makeup on takes forever! Wei Jiangyang, you will suffer when you marry her!\" laughed the shortest girl among the three. Standing between the two other girls, she attained a humble 1.5 meters give or take. Needless to say, she was the legal loli, Xu Jing, that Chen Huadong had eyes for.She had only just finished when someone smacked her over the head.\"Ugh. I'm sorry you had to hear that! I will make sure to discipline this child!\" Shen Xixi told Wei Jiangyang, keeping a straight face.The atmosphere was just starting to feel a little warmer when they suddenly heard a voice call out, \"Xixi.\"It was then that the girl's expressions immediately changed.\"Xixi, are you and your roommates going out to have fun? Why didn't you tell me? I could send you there.\" A flashy chili red BMW 5 Series sports sedan pulled to a stop next to the group.The guy driving the car pulled the handbrake and stepped out.Zhang Heng's eyebrows raised. He was wondering why Shen Xixi looked so familiar - apparently, they had met earlier on when he was leaving the supermarket after buying the scratch cards. Now, he recognized the couple he saw. It was Shen Xixi, and this guy clad in a Supreme t-shirt.\"Cheng Cheng. Why are you here again?! Xixi has already rejected you so many times! Why haven't you taken a hike already?\" Unlike her name,\u00a0Xu Jing1\u00a0was a straightforward girl who did not keep her thoughts to herself.This blatant announcement that exposed his rejection had put a dent to Cheng Cheng's dignity and cut his 'face', but because Xu Jing was a girl, it would be embarrassing if he threw any tantrums. Instead, the\u00a0fuerdai\u00a0swallowed his anger.\"Xixi, can I talk to you for a moment? It'll just be nearby. I know a coffee shop with excellent Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee,\" said Cheng Cheng.Shen Xixi frowned. Even the ordinarily good-tempered girl was starting to lose her patience. She and Cheng Cheng had been strangers until that welcoming party for freshmen.That very night, after performing a song, Cheng Cheng approached her and had been coaxing and pestering her for more than half a month since.From flowers, snacks, and fruits, to an iPhone and concert tickets, Cheng Cheng would entrust some girl to leave them at Shen Xixi's dormitory door.But this modus operandi that had worked so well on every other girl failed miserably on Shen Xixi.The gifts that he had given her were always returned to him untouched, and Shen Xixi also made it very clear to him that she was not interested in being in a relationship right now.This rejection, though, seemed to only fuel Cheng Cheng's zeal. He even toned down his lordly attitude. Shen Xixi's parents had always taught her to be polite and respectful. Now, when she found herself in an exasperating situation, she found it difficult to be abrasive, ergo, causing her to continuously be the recipient of Cheng Cheng's persistent badgering.There were even rumors about the both of them going around the school, which gave Shen Xixi a massive headache.What's more, she seemed to be running into Cheng Cheng a lot recently. How did he find out about their plans to go camping? Was it not too much of a coincidence that he showed up just as they were about to depart?Shen Xixi glanced at the girl called Wang Huan who was standing behind Xu Jing. The girl shot an embarrassed smile back at her. Wang Huan hailed from a middle-class family but a few days ago, a stick of YSL lipstick magically appeared in her drawer. The aspiring detective of a Xu Jing looked the up the price of the lipstick and found that to own one, a princely sum 700 - 800 yuan would have to be forked out.Owing to that, everyone jeered at Wang Huan, asking her if she was a mistress to some wealthy merchant. But now, it seems that her lipstick had come from somewhere else.Against the odds, Shen Xixi had no intention to pursue this issue. When she saw that Xiaoxiao had left the dormitory and was approaching them, she turned to Cheng Cheng and stated sternly, \"Cheng Cheng, haven't we already talked on Monday? I don't really drink coffee, and we're leaving right about now.\"\"Never mind, they can go first. I'll send you there later. Don't worry, I won't take up too much of your time,\" retorted a relentless Cheng Cheng.Chen Huadong could not hold it back any longer and was about to speak up when Wei Jiangyang shot him a sharp look.\"Don't provoke this guy,\" Ao Jiangyang said under his breath.Chen Huadong pursed his lips. \"Why? Isn't he just a\u00a0fuerdai? Look at our Childe Zhang - now that's the model\u00a0fuerdai.\"Zhang Heng shook his head. \"Nonsense. I'm not a\u00a0fuerdai.\"Zhang Heng came from similar financial circumstances as Shen Xixi - both intellectual types, comfortable enough to not worry about what they ate or wore. They were considered pretty well-off compared to the average person, but they were not in the same league as those ultrrich tycoons.Wei Jiangyang smiled acridly. \"This Cheng Cheng is not an easy person to deal with; he's a troublemaker. He's our senior by a year. When he first came to university, he got into a fight with a senior. His family appears to be in the hotel business. He spends lavishly and has quite a following. The student union is a disorganized mess of a pestilence thanks to him. Xiao Xiao was so averse to his ways that she quit the student union.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFuerdai\u00a0is just a label.On its own, it carried no derogatory connotations. For people who were either good or bad, they were further classified into superior and inferior. Objectively speaking, compared to the average person, these children of the nouveau riche had the privilege of enjoying better educational resources, therefore turning most of them into the superior kind.But why do\u00a0fuerdais\u00a0have such a bad reputation?It was only a simple explanation, though. The average person's vice was smaller, perhaps only affecting those around the individual. By comparison, due to the\u00a0fuerdai\u00a0having control over more resources, the repercussions would often be more severe once they committed any wrongdoing, descending into an entire series of problems for the society.Take Cheng Cheng, for example. Although his sins were not that grave, many people in school condemned him. When he joined the student union in his freshman year, he quickly turned the school into his territory. In a matter of months, he had already dominated all elections causing the old council members who disapproved of him to withdraw from the union.By his sophomore year, he became the president, and all the newly promoted council members were all his people. He basically dictated the entire student union. Birds of a feather flocked together.When he was recruiting people, he would continuously pay extra attention to the prettier girls. Once they joined the union, he would covertly appoint his subordinates to deliberately make things difficult for the girl. Then, he would use his position in the student union to settle this matter, making him the hero nobody had asked for.One thing led to another, and many of the innocent freshmen took the bait. Eventually, while they were discussing matters of the school, they would somehow or rather end up in his bed.There was a rumor going around that by the time Cheng Cheng was in his second year, that more than five girls had undergone abortion because of him.One even threatened to commit suicide, but the matter was eventually resolved with an undisclosed sum. Of course, it was a sensational amount. At the end of the day, plenty of people disapproved of Cheng Cheng.After hearing about all these, Chen Huadong, who had initially planned to speak his mind, found himself on the horns of a dilemma. He did not work at Cheng Cheng's family hotel and, it did not matter to him whether or not Cheng Cheng was a\u00a0fuerdai.However, after finding out about how Cheng Cheng dominated the student union, he could not reconsider his decision. As there was no student league in their school, club funds had to be first approved by the student union before it was reported to the teachers.On top of that, the student union was also in charge of the periodic assessment of each club.During their freshman year, Chen Hua Dong and few guys set up an anime club called Tiger Shark, which had been doing pretty well so far.Although their club had only a few girl members, a group of pansy guys coming together to exchange mysterious codes and indecent material was good fun. If he were to offend Cheng Cheng, Chen Huadong had to think about the problems Tiger Shark would be facing.To top it all off, the school had a rule that required everyone to participate in morning exercises for a set number of times. No surprises there as the ones in charge of taking attendance was the student union as well.In summary, the student union was the kind you would usually not notice, but if you rub them the wrong way, it would be problematic, to say the least. Cheng Cheng had quite a substantial number of followers, to begin with.Chen Huadong finally decided to pursue a relationship with Xu Jing because he did not want to have to walk around on eggshells every day, always on the lookout for anyone who might want to beat him up.Shen Xixi was looking kind of helpless. She had already said everything she could say. Most people would have given up already, but Cheng Cheng did not have the slightest intention of letting go.Next to them, it appeared that the Wang Huan girl realized she had done something wrong, and kept her head down saying nothing.In the end, Zhang Heng broke the awkward silence, \"Excuse me, your fly is open.\"\"\u2026\"Cheng Cheng looked down and saw the gap in his pants on his groin. Even though his underwear was not visible, it was still somewhat indecent.Zhang Heng would have been better off not mentioning it at all. He could have pretended not to notice it. Now that it was pointed out, he did not know if he should pull up his zip in front of everyone. It was the most awkward of situations.Cheng Cheng stared at Zhang Heng for a while before telling Shen Xixi, \"Xixi, someday I will make you understand how I feel about you.\"At that, he quickly hurried back into the safety of his BMW. If you pay attention to the way he was walking, you could see how unnatural his movement was, as if he dared not stretch his legs.\"Hurry! Hurry! Let's go!\" Xiao Xiao implored. \"Once he gets his zipper up, he'll come back to intrude.\"Like bats scurrying out of hell, everyone piled into the minibus, hastening the driver to scoot as they slammed the door shut.Xu Jing was in fits of laughter. \"Hahaha! Did you see that guy's face??! Oh, it's too funny!\"When she finally caught her breath, she imitated Cheng Cheng's tone, \"Xi Xi, someday I will make you understand how I feel about you\u2026\"The legal-loli made sheep's eyes at Shen Xixi as she spoke.Everyone exploded into laughter.Xiao Xiao covered her mouth. \"Enough. Stop talking. It's so disgusting. He's a bastard who specializes in deceiving freshman girls. What the hell was all that innocent love act.\"Shen Xixi looked at Zhang Heng apologetically. \"I'm sorry. You got involved because of me.\"Zhang Heng shook his head. \"It's no problem. I'm not part of any student clubs.\"Because of her boyfriend, out of the four girls, Xiao Xiao was the most familiar with Zhang Heng and the others in her boyfriend's dorm. Last semester, they even hung out a couple of times over skewered barbeque meat.Somehow, someway, she seemed to be influenced by Wei Jiangyang and became very interested in her roommate's love life. She turned to Shen Xixi and said, \"Xixi, didn't you want a band? You should consider Zhang Heng. He's really good at the piano. You know Paganini's La Campanella, right. This guy could play it with his eyes closed.\"Zhang Heng was getting tired of the rumor, having constantly heard it around his extremities.But before he could deny the gossip, Wei Jiangyang carried on, \"Yeah! Yeah! Zhang Heng loves working out. He runs 10 kilometers every morning, and he's part of the rock-climbing society and is aiming for the\u00a0K2\u00a01peak now. Oh, and he has also learned archery since he was five. The bow never leaves his side. His skills surpass all. People call him the\u00a0Zhang Sun2\u00a0from\u00a0Water Margin3.\"\"Ahem, it's actually\u00a0Little Li Guang Hua Rong1!\" Xiao Xiao buried her face in her hands.The legal-loli, another a mischief-maker, chipped in chirping, \"I did say that when I first laid eyes on Zhang Heng, I could tell that he's a gallant and intelligent person. He's so much better than that Cheng Cheng who can't even zip his pants.\"Chen Huadong was a little slow on the uptake. Whatever that had to be said had already been said. It took him the better part of the day to come up with something. Eventually, he said, \"Zhang Heng loves small animals too. Frequently, after dining in the canteen, he would always keep the fish bones and then bury them in a nice, quiet place.\"\"\u2026\"\"Hey, that's enough! If you want to make up stories, you should at least be thoughtful about it!\"Everyone laughed. The glumness accompanying Cheng Cheng's appearance was suddenly gone, and everyone was in a chatty mood again.In this age, when guys and girls come together, there was constant teasing and goofing, instinctively unleashing their youthfulness without much care or thought.After Shen Xixi had heard everyone's presentation of Zhang Heng, she found herself a little intrigued by him. But that was it. She gave him a friendly nod, and then turned to the despondent Wang Huan and began chatting with her.Likewise, Zhang Heng thought nothing else of Shen Xixi. She seemed like a pleasant girl who made people feel comfortable around her. He, however, did not harbor any romantic feelings towards her.Dark shadows flitted past as he looked out the window.Sometimes, he also wondered\u2014what kind of girl did he like? Chen Huadong had always been legal loli-phile, and Wei Jiangyang preferred girls like Xiao Xiao who appeared to be tough on the outside but, at the same time, also gentle deep down inside.It seemed like everyone knew for sure what they wanted. Yet, he could not even begin to describe his type.But for all that, Zhang Heng somehow believed that he would be able to tell when he meets the right person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt five in the evening, the minibus arrived at the camping destination.Everyone unloaded their stuff from the trunk and bid the driver a cheerful goodbye.When these city-bred students saw the foothill nearby covered in lush greenery, sheltered by the blue skies and white clouds, they were estactic.Xu Jing was especially eager. \"Wow! This place is not bad at all. We should come here every weekend.\"Xiao Xiao retorted, \"Does your family's money fall from the skies? 300 yuan?! I can't afford coming here every week!\"\"Knock it off! It's going to be dark soon. We need to find a place to set up tents and cook.\" Shen Xixi chided.Xu Jing giggled. \"I don't know how to cook. I'm only responsible for the eating.\"\"Fine. Exchange your cuteness for food then!\"The group chatted as the chortling continued; the mood light and cheerful. The girls were the ones who had chosen the camping location - mainly Xiao Xiao idea - situated in a less popular and crowded area.She had a backpack traveler uncle who enjoyed traveling on foot and was familiar with the uncultivated mountains nearby. The girl had badgered her uncle into providing her a list of unspoilt locations with breathtaking views.Even better, the visitors there were few and far between; there was none of that hubbub and chaos.Sad to say, except for Xiao Xiao who had gone camping with her uncle once or twice when she was younger, all the others did not have any camping experience whatsoever. To make matters worse, Xiao Xiao was only occupied with playing at that age; her uncle completely handling the bonfire-building and cooking business.As a result, even choosing a place to set up the tents proved to be a challenge for the group of coddled university students.Everyone seemed to be in disagreement - one said that it should be at the top of the mountain, the other that it should be somewhere sheltered from the wind. Then someone also added that they had to watch out for falling rocks.In the end, Zhang Heng could not stand watching the conversation going nowhere, so he said, \"Err\u2026 this place nearby is not dangerous. It's summer now, so we don't worry about keeping warm. We can choose whichever place to set up camp and it'll be fine for sure.\"Predictably, everyone ignored him.\u2026Immersed in the excitement of playing house in the open air, they found Zhang Heng's make-do attitude to be unacceptable.It was almost sundown and after careful and elaborate deliberation, they finally settled\u00a0for an open space by the foot of the hill.To say the least, the spot they had chosen was pretty good - it had an expansive view, and other than being a little further from the water, it had no other faults.However, the problem was that the sky was starting to turn dark, and their tents were still unbuilt.Such a task must not be undermined. For a novice, setting up a tent was extremely technically challenging: inserting the tent poles into the sleeves, stringing the ropes, staking the pegs into the ground, and then guying out the tent to stabilize it.Without any experience, it would take the novice a long time to figure out single step.Fortunately, this did not prove to be a problem for the Zhang Heng, as he had buit a house with his bare hands before. He nearly built up the three tents entirely all by himself. Even up to the last one, he was made up the steps as he went along.Xu Jing clapped her hands. \"Alright, Zhang Heng! The next time I'm stranded on a desert island and can only choose one person to come with me, I will choose you!\"\"You're so bad! Even on a deserted island, you're going to make someone your scapegoat?!\" Chen Huadong clicked his tongue.\"I've seen a few wilderness survival shows! It would still be useless even if it were the whole group of us on that island.\" Wei Jiangyang shook his head.Zhang Heng merely smiled and said nothing.No one took this kind of idle chatter to heart.Just then, an idea popped into Xu Jing's mind. \"It's already dark now. Let's have a campfire party!\"It was like this girl never worried a day in her life.\"Campfire, my ass. Let's eat first. I'm starving to death.\" Xiao Xiao grumbled.Only Shen Xixi was able to lend Zhang Heng some help when he was setting up the tent. As the others simply could not get the mechanics of pitching a tent, they took the initiative to prepare dinner on the other side instead.In the civilized world, there was no need to start a fire using the bow and drill method, not even in the wilderness. Only a portable cassette furnace for outdoor use would be needed. It was ready for use once the gas cartridge was inserted; a very convenient alternative.Naturally, Zhang Heng was glad to see that thing. He came to have fun not to show off his skills. Any survival skills he possessed were to be used to protect lives in the event of emergencies. If only he had a lighter on the island, he would not have to chaff off the skin on his hands to get fire.Dinner that night was hotpot - the most convenient outdoors menu for large, noisy, hormone enraged students. First, the base ingredients. Then chuck in washed vegetables and meat all together. There. Done.When Zhang Heng had finished building the tent, the group sat around the hotpot in a circle with single-use plastic bowls in their hands, watching and waiting for bubbles to form.To many of them, it was a refreshing feeling.In the summer, the temperature in the mountains was just right; not too hot and not too cold. It was much more comfortable than the stuffy, unair-conditioned dorm room. The only thing that seemed to take comfort there were the hordes of blood-sucking vampiric mosquitoes.Zhang Heng and Shen Xixi took out mosquito repellents from their bags almost simultaneously. Seeing this, they smiled at each other\"Why isn't the meat done yet?\" Xu Jing muttered pitifully. Just a while ago, she was still demanding a campfire party, and now she was more concerned about the meat in the pot than anyone else.A mischevious Chen Huadong was about to make fun of her when a rustling noise came from the woods nearby.That alone had pushed timid Xu Jing into a panicked frenzy. \"My god!!! Are there wild beasts in these mountains?!\"\"No. There are none,\" said a startled Xiao Xiao. Although the place was not a tourist attraction, it was close to the city. In the autumn, many photography enthusiasts would come here to visit. They also spotted other campers not far from where they were earlier on. If there were wild beasts here, it made no sense that no one had ever seen them before.As soon as she had spoken, something scurried out of the woods.The beast turned out to be not an animal but just a person. However, before they could breathe a sigh of relief, the outward appearance of the trespasser unsettled them.His was a rowdy-looking youth lined with tattoos on his arm. The young man smiled mischievously at the group and said, \"Oh, I knew I smelt something fragrant coming from somewhere. Turns out there's something tasty here! Count me in! It just so happens that I haven't had dinner yet.\"When the trespasser had finished talking, Zhang Heng got up, turned around, and went into his tent.The youth smiled at that. \"Okay, okay. Smart. Now that I have a place to sit, I'll just help myself then.\"Everyone could see that this lad had ill-intentions. Wei Jiangyang and Chen Huadong shared a look. This was the perfect time for the guys to step-up their game.Wei Jiangyang spoke first. \"Dude, we're not used to eating with strangers.\"\"No problem. I can introduce myself first. We can all be friends. A little chat, and we'll get to know each other,\" the youth grinned as he reached into his pocket and took out a folding knife.Wei Jiangyang's and Chen Huadong's face fell, and Xu Jing looked like she had just seen a ghost. They were all university students. They had never been in a situation like this before. Fights were rare back in campus. Even if a quarrel did get physical, no one had ever used a knife.Everyone's heart sank at the next announcement as the young man declared, \"I have three other friends who hadn't eaten too. They'll be here soon, but it looks like there's not enough space.\" He looked around and then pointed at Wei Jiangyang, Chen Huadong, and Wanghuan. \"Why don't the three of you give up your spots to them eh?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWei Jiangyang and Chen Huadong trembled n the presence of the folding knife. It would have been fine if they were just being robbed. At most, they would have to give up their possessions, and no one would be harmed but from the way the young man was acting, they could tell that he had other intentions for the girls.The girls in Xiao Xiao's dorm, except for Wang Huan, were not bad looking, not to mention, Shen Xixi who was generally acknowledged as the prettiest girl in the public relations department. Xiao Xiao was in the school's volleyball team and had always maintained a perfect physique. Needless to say, Xu Jin, the legal-loli, was a magnet for perverts.Normally, neither of them had to worry about their safety in school. But this was the wilderness, the outward-bounds. Even though there were other campers in the area, they were too far from them. Even if they cried for help, there was a good chance no one would be able to get here in time.The girls were beginning to regret coming out here. They had already done their research and found that there were villages nearby, leading them to presume that it was quite safe. Why were they so unlucky this time?Wei Jiangyang could feel his forehead growing damp. His girlfriend was behind him - he could not retreat. But being afraid when in such scary situations like this was a normal reaction. As the youth moved towards him, Wei Jiangyang froze, and his throat went dry.The very next moment, however, something sliced through the darkness.The youth paused. In front was an arrow with its tip buried deep into the ground, its fletching still quivering. It was a shot at an ungodly speed.Zhang Heng was standing in front of the tent with his recurve bow. He did not stop after the first shot. Swiftly, he drew the second arrow. Before Wei Jiangyang and the others could cheer for him, the second arrow overshot by ten thousand meters, hitting a small tree far away.Zhang Heng's friends were dismayed, thinking to themselves that it was over. They had hoped that the shot would frighten the intruder away. They did not expect Zhang Heng give away the game so quickly.The young man was also taken aback by the first arrow. The country had strict firearms control, so in the general run of things, bows and crossbows were the most powerful long-range weapons people had access to. He did think there would be a bowman in this group.But that second shot missed him by at least a few meters.Was the first one a lucky shot?The youth subconsciously turned around to see where the last arrow had landed and was immediately alerted because his mates were hiding behind that tree.\"These first two shots are just a warning. If you don't leave, the third arrow will draw blood,\" Zhang Heng said calmly.The expression on the youth's face changed. Everyone else was bowled over.The youth was about 3 - 4 meters away from Wei Jiangyang and Chen Huadong. He was computing in his head if he could grab either one of them as hostages. He had second thoughts, not sure if Zhang Heng would actually do it.In the end, he chose to put away his knife and raised his hands. \"I apologize for interrupting. It looks like my friends and I will have to go elsewhere to make friends.\"He glared at Zhang Heng as he spoke and then slowly backed away until he disappeared between the darkness of the trees.\u2026The incident was over, but everyone had lost their appetite. They quickly packed up their things and wanted to leave the place, but there was no taxi in this suburbia. Xiao Xiao was still worried that the strange guy would harass the other campers, so one of them called the police while the others went around to inform other vacationers.Shen Xixi opened her mouth to say something but decided to keep it to herself.After the danger was over, the other girls gathered around Zhang Heng.Xu Jing stuck out her tongue and said, \"That's impressive, fellow student Zhang. I thought you ran away because you were scared. Turns out Iron Man was summoning his armor.\"Chen Huadong joined the conversation. \"Big brother, I must say I'm impressed! The second shot was way off course, yet you could still stand there and threaten him so boldly. Respect, respect.\"\"Apparently those degenerates are easily frightened. They saw you holding a bow and off they went running for their lives! But, really, thank you for that! I was so scared I almost died,\" continued a very relieved Xiao Xiao.\"To thank your hero, I have made the executive decision to betroth the prettiest girl in our dorm to you!\" Xu Jing concluded. Suddenly, she received another smack across the head! But after that, Shen Xixi also thanked Zhang Heng.After informing the others scattered all over the campgrounds, the group gathered again, feeling a lot safer by the numbers.Zhang Heng put down his bow and opened up his backpack, distributing a bunch of snacks that did not require cooking to everyone.While taking a bite out of her custard pie, Xu Jing mumbled, \"What a day full of action! It's my first time camping, and it may very well be my last!\"With food filling their stomachs, the group was feeling much better, and they began discussing the precarious situation they were in just a while ago.It was then that out of the blue, Shen Xixi said, \"Zhang Heng, can I talk to you?\"\"Mmm.\"The pair stepped away from their friends' bemused gazes.Shen Xixi thanked Zhang Heng again for the night, saying, \"Did you notice?\"\"Notice what?\"\"That guy didn't look like he's from the villages around here. He's probably from the city like us.\"\"You're saying that the guy came here tonight just to look for women to assault?\"\"No, if he was prepared, he wouldn't be dressed like that. The shoes on his feet were an Adidas Coconut 500. It's at least 2000 yuan and above for the authentic one! He would not have willingly worn those here and risked having his sneakers scraped by twigs and branches. Also, when he was talking, he kept scratching at his neck. He must have gotten bitten by a lot of mosquitos! If this was premeditated and he did not even prevent that, that would just too careless. So, chances are, he came here at the last minute.\"\"That's a very detailed observation!\" Zhang Heng looked surprised. \"Most people would not have noticed so many fine details in that situation!\"\"Aren't you the same?\" Shen Xixi answered softly.\"I didn't notice any of that.\" Zhang Heng shook his head. \"I don't know much about shoes. I was busy paying attention to his friends in the woods. I didn't notice his little movements. If you didn't mention it, I really would not have known.\"Shen Xixi was taken aback slightly. \"Then why have you been keeping an eye on Wang Huan?\"\"Because when the guy appeared, her reaction was a little too intense. Everyone was paralyzed by shock and fear but she was very, very frightened. After the guy left, everyone was so relieved, but she seemed even more alarmed instead.\"Shen Xixi smiled bitterly. \"That is why I didn't agree with them calling the police.\"\"Even though she put everyone in danger tonight?\"\"Wang Huan has her share of problems. Cheng Cheng threatened her, telling her that if she refused to help, he wants her to reimburse him for the lipstick. Her parents were laid off a while ago, and she has a younger brother at home. And just like you said, she didn't expect this to happen. She only sent our location to Cheng Cheng. All she thought was that he wanted to join us. She never expected the person someone like that to pop out. She was terrified\u2026 worried that police would find out.\"\"You decide then.\" Zhang Heng declined to comment. They were all adults. They have to be responsible for their own actions. Circumstances and her family's situation may have induced her to behave that way, but it's no excuse for her wrongdoing! One straightforward justification: society may not be just to you but you can't go kill people in a kindergarten or set public transportation on fire just like that!However, Shen Xixi was the target here. Whatever she would decide to do was entirely up to her. Zhang Heng had no opinion on that.As for Cheng Cheng, he had an idea of what kind of game the guy was playing at, sort of\u2026 In light of the declining favorable impression between him and Shen Xixi, he probably wanted to play the hero and save the damsel in distress in this self-directed drama to make up for it. It, however, appeared that this guy had underestimated Shen Xixi's intelligence.At the moment, it did not look like they were on the same level.Shen Xixi let out a breath of relief. \"I am not a person who keeps forgiving - Wang Huan promised to move out of our dorms when we get back. We won't have any social interactions with each other. So, that's how it's gonna be. You, on the other hand, will have to be very careful. Cheng Cheng wouldn't dare break the law, but he has no problem crossing the line. Mm, it's best if you don't leave the campus for the time being. I'll help you figure a way out of this!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their statements were taken down, but unsurprisingly, the police could do very little about it.That was a small crime that did not result in anything serious, so they merely entertained them and warned other campers. Unless a similar incident were to happen again, they were not going to invest resources in conducting an investigation.An unavoidable situation, the officers already had plenty of cases piled up. Sorting the cases by priority was an essential skill of every officer.And just like that, the outing was ruined. By the time the group reached the campus, it was already close to midnight. They bid each other goodbye and returned to their respective rooms.Chen Huadong was in luck! Thanks to his heroic performance of standing his ground when the trespasser threatened him, he successfully obtained Xu Jing's phone number!With him setting the ball rolling, everyone else started to exchange contacts with each other.\u00a0As soon as they returned to their room, the seats on their chairs still cold, the pair had already started hooking up.Shen Xixi sent Zhang Heng a text to remind him to be extra careful.Zhang Heng thought about it and then politely replied thanks.He had only just sent the text when the world around him suddenly went eerily quiet. After more than a month, Zhang Heng was no stranger to this phenomenon.Setting the alarm on his phone to 7 hours, he climbed into bed.When he opened his eyes, the world was still steeped in darkness. Zhang Heng turned off his alarm and rolled out of bed. After making himself a cup of oats, he walked down the stairs with the cup.The caretaker lady arrived a little earlier than usual, already locking the main door the moment the clock struck twelve.Zhang Heng went straight into the control room and very deftly fished out a set of keys. He proceeded to unlock the door.He dropped by Wumart first, grabbed a\u00a0pineapple bun1\u00a0from the rack and them left the change on the cashier. It had actually been a long time since he'd done anything like this. Not since a terrified grandmother ran all the way home with her grandchild after hearing about the 12 o'clock rumor. He switched to stocking up his food before bed.This time was an exception due to an unforeseen circumstance. If Cheng Cheng had not interfered, he would still be out there camping. After he had finished his oats and bun, he left his cup on the supermarket's rack, then jogged to the 24-hour gym. By that time, the contents in his stomach were almost fully digested.He began his training with the water resistance rowing machine. Three hours went by quickly. After that, he took a quick shower before checking himself into the rock-climbing club\u2026 Finally, he wandered around the city on his daily tour with his camera.He was passing by a small hotel when a red BMW caught his eye. Zhang Heng stopped cycling as he slowly glanced at the license plate. It was Cheng Cheng's car.Zhang Heng was for all intents and purposes, not bothered by this son of some wealthy tycoon. Like he had told Shen Xixi, he was not involved in any clubs or group activities and had very little interaction with the student union. If Cheng Cheng wanted to take down Zheng Heng, it would require quite a lot of effort on the former's part.Cheng Cheng might be famous in school, but he was no fool. It was because of money that they were willing to be his accomplices in tricking na\u00efve young girls. But if they had to give up their certificate of graduation for him, or even break the law, sorry. No one would do it.Outside school, on the other hand, even though that young man was not a member of any society. After Shen Xixi's cue, however, Zhang Heng realized that he was also another bored fuerdai with nothing to do like Cheng Cheng.That was just purely asking a friend for a favor,\u00a0but these people were sometimes even more of a nuisance than thugs. They were willing to do almost anything for their face.Zhang Heng figured that since he had so fortuitously come upon him, it was best to get rid of this trojan horse once and for all.He parked the shared bicycle by the building and walked into the hotel. He did not know where Cheng Cheng was, but that was not a problem as he easily accessed all customer information on the computer at the front desk.He found Cheng Cheng's name quickly, took down the room number and borrowed a set of spare keys. Two minutes later, he pushed opened the door into room 305.There was steam all over the glass door of the bathroom but there was no sound of water.Zhang Heng could make out the silhouette of a girl but he was not the kind to take advantage of situations like this. He immediately looked away and then continued into the room. There were clothes strewn everywhere.There was even a brassiere handing from the television.On the bed, Cheng Cheng was naked except for an underwear, smoking while texting on WeChat.Zhang Heng plucked the phone from his hand and saw that the person he was chatting with was a guy called Wu Fan with a picture of a tattoo as his profile picture. Zhang Heng tried to recall to the intruder's tattoo but failed to realize anything significant. That was alright, though. Zhang Heng clicked on the contacts, scrolled down, and found the same picture.The owner of the WeChat account had taken a full body picture with his wardrobe, with a caption underneath\u2014Can't put the shoes down. What should I do?The face on the picture belonged to the guy with the folding knife.Zhang Heng went back to the conversation page, and then looked through the messages. It was almost exactly as he had guessed. Cheng Cheng was indeed the one who came up with the idea! He was nearby when it happened, ready to show up once he got the signal!He did not expect his plans to be disrupted by Zhang Heng. Forced home with a belly full of anger he couldn't vent, Cheng Cheng invited a junior he had wooed to go out on a date with him.Wu Fan asked Cheng Cheng if he wanted to try and push the bowman around for a bit.Out of caution and not kindness of the heart, Chen Cheng replied that he would have to look into Zhang Heng first.After that, the conversation grew boring, delving into what club had awesome girls, which limited edition shoes were worth collecting, who managed to get the girl, or whose boobs were bigger\u2014that kind of subject. Other than that, Zhang Heng also found out that Cheng Cheng was dabbling with recreational drugs and had tricked the girls he was with into doing them.Zhang Heng shook his head reprovingly. This guy had caused so much harm to other people. When Zhang Heng was done reading the dialogue, he created a new chat group which included Wu Fan and all the other contacts in the list which looked like fuerdais, and then began typing\u2026'Wu Fan that dumb fuck! I just need to bring up our friendship and loyalty to get him to do whatever I want. He will do anything I ask him to do. Now, he's as obedient as my dog.'When he was finished composing the text, Zhang Heng even added an emoji with a coquettish smile and shades at the end, then hit the send button.He could foresee that after zero o'clock tonight, a solid friendship was about to face a brutal test.This, however, may not humble Cheng Cheng. So, Zhang Heng decided to give him a warning.He did not do anything too inhumane\u2014he was not a monster. He only gave Cheng Cheng some water to drink.After forcing down two bottles of water down Cheng Cheng's esophagus, Zhang Heng was worried that Cheng Cheng would not be satisfied so he took another two from the front desk. Then, to prevent permanent damage to his nervous system from water intoxication, he took another three bottles of Pocari Sweat.In the end, though there was a bottle, Cheng Cheng's stomach had already grown a size larger and when shaken, Zheng Heng could hear water slushing inside.To top it all off, Zhang Heng deleted all the apps in Cheng Cheng's phone before setting a Bride of Chucky picture as wallpaper. Finally, he left a grave message in the memo\u2014Think about what you've done.When it was all done, Zhang Heng jumped onto his little yellow bike, leaving the hotel behind to continue exploring the artistic path.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCheng Cheng was absent from school for two days. Word was that he was sent to the emergency ward in an ambulance. The doctor's final diagnosis was 'drowning'. The strange thing was that Cheng Cheng claimed that he had been lying in bed in the hotel room and had no contact with any water at all.What was worse than his physical condition, however, was his mental state. He appeared to be suffering from severe psychological trauma and was advised by the doctor to seek psychiatric help after his treatment. As a result, his parents spent a large sum of money to hire a world-famous expert, and after two sessions, he was finally stabilized.He was finally able to return to school a month later. A few close acquaintances even arranged a welcome-back reception in his honor. They were going to invite his side-girl, but Cheng Cheng was too terrified after everything that had taken place that night. Although they had proven that he did not have any sexual contact with the girl who was in the shower, Cheng Cheng would rather have a small-time model come over than anyone from that day.That night, after a couple of beers and the company's admiration, Cheng Cheng's mood improved considerably and was willing to practice what the expert said, which turned out to be convincing himself that that was just a bad dream.Upon his return to university, he decided to restore his former glory and figure out a way to win Shen Xixi over. Humans were like that. They thought the harder it is to achieve something, the more valuable it must be.In the beginning, during the welcoming party, he thought that she was good looking singe, and had wanted to woo her just for the fun of it. But Shen Xixi would have none of it. She did not even give him a chance, which only made him even more obstinate in going after her.This matter quickly plagued him. As he was humping the small-time model, Cheng Cheng covered the poor girl's face with a pillow cover and imagined that she was Shen Xixi. This got him even more excited than usual.He kept at it for another three minutes before laying down, whereupon a rush of exhaustion flooded his head, and the tired Cheng Cheng closed his eyes and fell asleep immediately. He was jolted awake in the middle of the night and he felt something resting on his face.When he opened his eyes, he saw the Bride of Chucky's face resting against him! Goosebumps sprouted all over his terrified body!His screams not only waken the model sleeping next to him, but had also startled the guests in the rooms downstairs. Cheng Cheng did not even bother to dress properly and left the room running and screaming for his life in his underwear!Alas, misery loves company. He was only a short distance away from the hotel when a minivan suddenly screeched to a halt in front of him! The door opened and the tattooed youth grinned at him from the inside. \"Brother Cheng, your little pug has come to bring you home!\"Then, the passengers inside the van dragged the horrified Cheng Cheng into the vehicle!Following this, a 15-minute video of Cheng Cheng in a dog collar barking and scoffing down dog treats appeared on the university forum. Although it was quickly taken down by the school authorities, it had already left its severe, unerasable mark. The whole school was in a frenzy!Cheng Cheng's reputation was already on eggshells. Pretended indignance from the varmints in the student union aside, the reactions were mostly\u00a0schadenfreude1\u00a0from the common folk.A week later, Cheng Cheng's parents came to the school and after applying leave for their son, left in a hurry. A rumor quickly spread around that they had sent their son overseas for treatment.\u2026Everything that happened after that no longer concerned Zhang Heng. In fact, after he had taken the time out to leave a warning for Cheng Cheng, he continued with his busy schedule. He simply threw in the doll in-passing to keep Cheng Cheng busy from his boredom! Zhang Heng never in the slightest expected that the outcome would be so severe.Later on, Zhang Heng did go back, intentionally this time, to stick the haunted doll's face in the dark hotel room. The situation was undeniably quite scary. Cheng Cheng had already been frightened once before, and in his extremely fragile state, all it would take was one more scare and a complete mental breakdown would be no surprise. As for Wu Fan's appearance after that, Zhang Heng knew nothing of that.In short, this matter was considered closed. Zhang Heng did not actually spend much time and energy on Cheng Cheng. The harassment was done out of convenience. During this period, he had employed a new plan of action\u2014attend classes and prepare for the next round of games.The results of his workout were a little more evident now. He was not seeking to have one of those muscular bodies, being more concerned about being pliable than being strong. He had now passed a beginner's level in rock climbing as well.The second game was drawing near. In theory, he could actually wait until the last day to join the game but Zhang Heng did not want to cut it too close. What if he fell sick or sprained his ankle? That was a fun thought.So, 5 days before the end of November, Zhang Heng returned to the Sex and the City bar.This time, he did not need to flash the number on his arm for the two burly men guarding the steps to let him pass.Zhang Heng thanked the gentlemen and pushed the metal door open. The lounge was no different from the last time he visited, except the music had changed to jazz.The bartender looked to be in a pretty good mood. She was mixing some strange drink when she spotted Zhang Heng and greeted him, \"How has this month been? What would you like to drink?\"\"Not bad. I won't be having any drinks.\"Then as reading his mind, she pushed the freshly-made masterpiece in front of him. \"You don't think it's this lemon water that you passed out the last time, do you? Even if you did nothing, you would still enter the game the same way.\"\"Last time, you said the time was fixed only for the first game. I have the freedom to choose after that, right?\"The bartender pointed at something nearby. \"Do you see that booth? Each one of them has an alarm clock. Take a seat at one of them and adjust the time to your liking. When it's time, the game will start.\"\"Thank you. But I won't need the booze. The game starts soon, so it's better for me to stay sober!\"\"This is not a cocktail, just a mix of fruit juices.\" The bartender raised a brow at him; her patience obviously pushed a notch further.Zhang Heng had the good sense to pick up the glass filled with the unknown liquid. From its appearance, this thing perfectly replicated Maid caf\u00e9's style. In all honesty, it looked suspicious. Speaking of which, Zhang Heng had visited that coffee shop a couple of times before, but the bartender lady acted as if she did not know him, sticking to that cold, indifferent front.\"Oh, right! You've also mentioned last time that the wooden box made of Tulewood that could isolate supernatural powers is sold here. How much is it?\" Zhang Heng tasted the drink in his hand. It had a peculiar taste to it, a little like durian and a little like mango. There was probably soursop and avocado in there. It was as strange a mix as it could get. So, Zhang Heng resolved to changing the subject, slowly and stealthily put the drink back down.From all the previous information he had gathered, there were two precious things in the game. The first one was a very realistic atmosphere and settings that allowed people to gain a lot of experience and skills in a short few hours. The second was the so-called game items.Needless to say, having a supernatural item that continued to have effects in the real world was very advantageous! The lucky rabbit's foot had been with Zhang Heng for more than a month now. He even found money on the road twice now, although only 2 yuan. The rabbit's foot was E-class, indicative that there were also other classes\u2014A, B, C, and D\u2014above it.But because the game items' effects were unidentifiable, carrying them around uninformed would be very dangerous. It was possible for him to have such good luck all the time, so he needed a better way to contain it.The last time, after the bartender told him about the Tule tree, he went back and looked it up on Baidu and discovered that this tree only grew in Mexico's Oaxaca state, revered dearly by the locals. It was practically impossible to take a piece from the tree to make a box.That being the case, he had no other choice but to buy it from the bartender. It felt a bit like he was forced to do it even though he knew the outcome was bad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng was preparing himself up to the sacrificial lamb, but the bartender answered nonchalantly, \"Since you've had a taste of my masterpiece, I'll give you a tip\u2014if you want to use the box to store the game items, I suggest that you forget about it.\"\"Huh?!\"\"Didn't I tell you the last time? Only game items can travel freely between the game and real world. To ensure fairness for everyone, you're forbidden to bring things from the game back to reality, nor can you bring anything from the real world into the game. So, the only thing the Tule box can do is to contain game items for you here in the real world. You'll have to figure out a way to do that yourself on the other side.\"\"The wooden Tule box is not a game item?\"The bartender shook her head. \"There are very few things that can be called a game item, even the lowest F-grade ones. But there are game items that function almost like the Tule box. That'll all depend on your luck. You can also wait till the year-end auction. There'll be a lot of goodies there! Of course, provided that your pockets are not empty!\"\u2026For now, there was nothing Zhang Heng could do to get a suitable object to store game items. It was not an urgent matter, so he would have no choice but to heed the bartender's words, noting to himself that most game items became effective upon direct contact.All he had to do was to be careful and perhaps put on a glove or something to minimize risk.If he stayed on, he might be coerced into tasting some other strange drinks, so Zhang Heng left the bar.He picked an empty booth and found a small alarm clock under the seat.Even though that extra 24 hours had prolonged his hardship on the island, he had to admit that the rewards were not insignificant either.His time he spent in the game was 12 times longer than other players, which gave him a better opportunity to explore the island. Considering the dire consequences that game over could bring, he would have to rely on this ability of his for the rest of it.He only hoped that it was not some remote and humanless place again this time.He set the time on the clock to 23:55 before leaning back onto the padded seat and rested his eyes.After about half an hour, a dizziness filled his head, and he felt weak. It was as if he'd been swallowed by a night hag, having none of the energy to even lift a finger.Then that familiar voice rang in his ear again.[Verifying player's identity\u2026][Identity confirmed. Random extraction of newcomer's quest for player number 07958\u2026][Extraction complete\u2014Current quest is Tokyo Drift!]\"Tokyo\u2014an international metropolis with a population of 37 million, deserving of its reputation as the center of Japan's politics, economy, and culture. During the day, this place is the vanity fair for financiers and politicians, but the grand opening of the truly entertaining stories only take place against the backdrop of the night\u2026 Will you, an exchange student from China, be able to leave your mark and become a legend here?[Mission objective: Win first place in an underground drifting championship.][Mode: Single player.][Time flow rate: 360] (One hour in the real world is equivalent to 15 days in this game. After 60 days, the player will be extracted and returned to the real world.]A friendly reminder: the game will begin in 5 seconds. Players, please get ready!\u2026Zhang Heng opened his eyes and found himself standing right in the middle of a crossroad.Perhaps his prayers had been heard by someone. This place was the exact opposite or his first game on the desert island!\u2014he was surrounded by colorful neon lights and advertisement boards, a seemingly endless number of people strolled past him, speaking an unfamiliar language that he only heard on tv and games before.A phone rang somewhere blaring a tune alike Mika Nakashima's 'The Reason Why I Thought I'd Die'. There were a few youths zipping through the crowd on skateboards.Hot young girls sported miniskirts, and middle-aged salarymen in suits clutched onto their briefcases as they hailed for cabs. Zhang Heng even spotted a large number of western faces. It was night, yet it appeared to be livelier than during the day!Tsk-tsk! This was indeed the world's largest hotpot of urbanization!After Zhang Heng was sure of signs of danger in his surroundings, he checked his personal profile.Name: Zhang HengGender:\u00a0MaleAge:\u00a019Player ID: 07958Rounds played:1Current game points: 24Skills: Piano, Level 1; Language proficiency: Level 1 (both languages at general communication skills level); Archery skills: Level 2; Wilderness survival skills: Level 2Item in possession: Lucky Rabbit's Foot (E)Assessment: The player has slightly better luck than the average person, but otherwise, do not possess qualities that are worth commending. Has minimal wilderness survival and archery skills. Not expected to last longer than the first five rounds.Although Heng had been practicing rock climbing and photography for the past month, it appeared that neither of these skills even made it to level 0, which was why they were not displayed in the skills section.Other than that, the biggest change was the addition of an 'item in possession' category and the rabbit foot's effects. His assessment was now slightly different too. At least he had gotten rid of that comment about him being unremarkable. Still, he might not be able to make it far enough.Once he had reviewed his current status, Zhang Heng took in his surroundings again. The place was thriving. Right opposite him was an emporium with a giant outdoor LED screen playing a SONY earbuds commercial. Bustling shops and bright neon signs crowded the entire skyline. It was quite crowded, indeed.This place\u2026 looked a lot like Shibuya!Zhang Heng had tagged along with his mum on a trip to Tokyo to attend an academic conference when he was much younger. But his memory of that time was little fuzzy now because the conference was lengthy and he spent most of the time cooped up in hotel rooms. It was only on the last day, that his mother had brought him out shopping in Shibuya. She got him a PSP before they left, which was why he had some sort of impression at all of this place.Getting to play the game in a thriving civilization was a good thing, but the situation was still slightly delicate.For the most part, Zhang Heng did not understand Japanese at all. Even though there were Chinese characters in the words which allowed him to guess the approximate meaning on the signboards, at this rate, he would not be able to carry out his mission. How could they just leave him here?He played the role of an exchange student in the game. This meant that he would not have to worry about his accommodation at the very least. There was no mention, however, the name of his school. There were dozens of universities in Tokyo - national, public, and private. He could not possibly go around asking each one of them.In a time as such, Zhang Heng decided he might as well find out what he was carrying on his character.He began searching his pockets when a girl in a short skirt suddenly ran towards him, huffing and puffing, carrying two ice cream cones in her hands! \"Zhang Heng! Thank God you're here! I was scared to death! I thought I lost you on your first day here!\"The girl exhaled in relief when she saw him.The traffic light on the opposite lit up green.\"Ah, crap. We're running out of time! Let's go!\" The girl said, pulling his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTen minutes later, Zhang Heng was standing in front of the door into\u00a0ITS'DEMO\u00a01with an ice cream cone that had magically appeared in his hand.\"I'm sorry,\u00a0Zhang-san1! I had a sudden craving for ice cream while we were walking and left you wandering on the road on your road,\" the girl bowed apologetically.\"No, it's my own fault. I was so busy looking around that I didn't follow you closely, fellow classmate Ameko!\" Zhang Heng had just finished searching all his pockets.Its contents were simple: a passport, student ID, wallet (with 30,000 Japanese Yen and a transportation card), keys, and cell phone. Among these things, Zhang Heng's priority was the phone. According to the girl, this was his first day here.Then, chances were that she could be a friendly schoolmate who had taken the time taking him around to admire Tokyo's night view.\u00a0In most situations like these, both parties were most likely to have exchanged phone numbers. Zhang Heng checked a recent missed call and typed in Ameko's name.Of course, he could have asked the girl directly, making up an excuse that he did not know how to spell her name, but it seemed a little rude to him.When he looked up and saw the girl's expression, he knew that he had guessed correctly.Ameko looked adorable whenever she smiled, revealing her two snaggleteeth.\u00a0\"Zhang-san, Shibuya is a fashion center! There are a lot of very interesting storeS and places of interest here! But occasionally, hanky-panky business goes on around here. So, you better stay close!\"\u2026Zhang Heng had no objections to that. Ameko had been so warmhearted by being his tour guide, introducing Tokyo as they walked the streets. Up until now, the both of them had been conversing in Mandarin, and she was pretty proficient. She majored in Chinese at the university and planned to apply as an exchange student to China next year, furthering her studies.But her understanding of China only came from what she saw on the TV and her teachers, so, in order to deepen her knowledge, she made it a point to be friends with this term's exchange student.\"Ah, actually, my home is in Shinagawa.\u00a0I've studied in Tokyo since high school. I've never been away from home before. Talking about going to a place far away makes me excited, yet a little worried at the same time!\" Ameko rubbed her nose shyly. \"My parents back home was always worried if I could care for myself in the future! So, I want to take this opportunity to train myself! Err\u2026 Is that very childish of me?\"\"No, it's terrific!\"This time, the quest title was 'Tokyo Drift'. From the name itself, Zhang Heng could tell that the primary purpose of this game was to test the player's driving skills\u2014also confirmed by the mission target.Although it seemed like the rate of time flow was reduced when compared to the previous game, which only lasted for two hours, this mission was actually going to take twice as long to complete. 60 days to be precise.It might sound generous, but unless the player was already a competitive race driver or a hardcore car tuner, being good enough to win an underground street race, even the easiest one in a mere 60 days, was a practically impossible task.What more, the problems the players would face in this version of the game were not as simple as merely improving their driving skills.Right now, in Zhang Heng's wallet, there was only 30,000 yen. How should I put this into perspective? Well, take the ice cream Ameko bought for example, which cost 300 yen each. From the flyer the ramen shop had given them when they passed by, Zhang Heng found out that a bowl of ramen cost between 800 to 1,200 yen.Of course, the food in the campus should be slightly more affordable, or if need be, he could consider cooking for himself.\u00a0He might be able to last 60 days but he was not really here to be an exchange student.In this period of time, he would need to get his hands on a car, find out the location of the race, figure a way to improve his driving skills and sign up for a race. And to do all that, he would need to have the most basic of communication skills to support himself.If it were other players in his shoes, they might not have listened to Ameko explaining her personal growth journey and jump right into the main issue.But Zhang Heng was different\u2014he had enough patience. Apart from his own great character, he also knew that everything happened for a reason.Human beings have continued to progress because they are consistently reflected on themselves and draw inferences\u2014and this had always been Zhang Heng's strength.The first game had not only gave him twenty-over points and a prop\u2014Zhang Heng had analyzed his experience many times and came to a very important conclusion\u2014whoever the game creator was, it was evident that he always encouraged the players to explore the world they were put in.The lucky rabbit's foot was a good testament to that. The really good things did not appear in the main mission. If his only purpose was to survive, there was no need to travel to the center of the island at all. Yet, it was this side mission that had earned him the greatest reward. On top of that, the things that he did to improve his quality of life often earned him bonus points and rewards.Not to imply that the other player did not understand this, but having to think of a way to complete the mission under the pressure of the return deadline, none of them would be in the mood to enjoy the luscious views around them.However, Zhang Heng did not have any problems here because time was always on his side.For this game, he had a good 420 days\u2014seven times more than the average place. Other than that, he had also developed a personal interest in the various worlds the game presented. During his first-round back on the island, everything felt very real to him. If it were not for the time-bug that had caused a loop, there was no way of him finding a flaw.Compared to this megacity with a population of 37 million people, that was nothing.Everyone here seemed to have self-awareness and responded spontaneously to external stimuli. If all these were expressed through programming, it would take a frightening amount of calculations! In fact, no amount of coding could achieve this level of sophistication. This was not so much a game as a flawless work of art!Unfortunately, the players were just rushing sojourners in this world, no time to stop and admire. Zhang Heng might very well be the only exception.Ameko stuck out her tongue. \"Am I talking a little too much? I'm supposed to be introducing Tokyo but then I somehow began talking about myself. You must be really bored! Why don't I buy you a\u00a0taiyaki1\u00a0to make up for it?\"\"\u2026 I feel like you're just looking for an excuse to eat it.\"\"Hehe!\" Amiko flashed her signature snaggleteeth after exposing her love for food.\"But let me pay this time! You've already treated me ice cream. I should thank you\u2014if you hadn't volunteered to be my guide, I'm afraid I would not have left campus at all!\" Zhang Heng pulled out his wallet. He could not keep taking advantage of this girl's generosity.He bought four taiyaki from the stall by the road. A ubiquitous snack in Japan, it was an affordable preposition. Even though the name taiyaki literally meant 'baked seabream', it was actually a cake with fillings like red beans. Four of them only cost Zhang Heng 640 yen.\"Zhang-san\u2026 you really are a good person,\" Ameko mumbled as she bit into a steaming hot taiyaki. \"We're not too far from Yoyogi park, but too bad it's already so late. Otherwise, I could bring you there for a walk.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAmeko had proven herself to be a very competent tour guide. This was especially true after eating Zhang Heng's taiyaki, turning her even more zealous. She showed Zhang Heng around before reluctantly sending him back to school around nine at night. Then, she took the tram back to her apartment.Because land was so expensive in Tokyo, only a few universities had dormitories. Owing to that, most students had to rent rooms outside of campus like Ameko. Although her home was within the city, she chose to rent an apartment unit with other university students because it was nearer to campus.However, the school treated exchange students pretty well. They had an international house, which provided accommodation for students from abroad. What more, they were all single rooms.Zhang Heng found his room number on his phone and unlocked the door with the key he was carrying in one of his pockets.The room was mediocre in size, only about 15 square meters. It was, however, furnished with a bed, wardrobe, study table, air conditioner, and even a full-sized bathroom.Zhang Heng took a quick shower before finding some clean clothes in the closet to change into. There was a half packet of biscuits on the table, a bank card, a notebook, and a bunch of photocopied papers. It all made him look like a real exchange student who had just moved in that day.He picked up the notebook and found a list of his expenditures. The handwriting was a one to one copy of his. On the second page, a timetable with only one subject was scribbled down, which was Japanese.Under normal circumstances, universities would never arrange pure lingual classes for exchange students.Generally, when enrolling exchange students, the university would specify Japanese as a requirement the students must meet. Of course, some did not, but only because most majors were taught English.That must have been the hidden benefit that this game version gave its players, a sort of tutorial for those who spoke nor read Japanese.But it was not possible to fluently learn a language in 60 days. For the time being, he would still have to rely on Ameko, the trusty human translating machine, to communicate with others.He was musing on that thought when he received a text message from her.Zhang-san. I've reached home safely. Damn it!\u00a0Momo1\u00a0went to drink from the toilet again while I was out. She left pawprints everywhere!Ameko had told Zhang Heng about Momo, a Japanese paddy cat she adopted, to which, Zhang Heng replied: Cook it in a stew.\"(\u2299\u25bd\u2299)\"Ameko sent him a shocked face!Zhang Heng typed back: I'm just joking! Oh, by the way, Ameka, do you know where the nearest ATM to school is?He flipped to the third page in his notebook. There was a list of things to do\u2014one of which was signing up for a bank card. The fee for the months to come would be deducted from the card.Of course. I'll bring you there tomorrow. If there's anything else that you don't know, you can always ask me! I'm very familiar with the area!Ameko was still as earnest as the first time they met.Thank you for letting me trouble you.Zhang Heng bid the girl good night. He then went online to look up some information. Soon after, he flipped the lights off and climbed into bed. And that was how he spent his first night in a foreign country.\u2026The night passed without incident.The very next morning, Zhang Heng attended the language class. At an entry-level, the learning was relatively simple\u2014to master the goujon* or fifty-sounds chart, which mainly tests the student's memory. Then, in the afternoon, he and Ameko proceeded to apply for a bank card. The process would take about a week.Once they stepped out of the bank, Zhang Heng asked his companion, \"If I want to find work, is there a place you would recommend?\"The 30,000 yen he had was far from enough. The two-month estimate he made previously was simply too optimistic. Rental for the room alone was already 20,000 yen! Luckily, the first month's rent had already been paid for. Realizing that he was going to spend another 14 months or so here, Zhang Heng decided that he had to find a way to earn some money.He did not know how the other players were going to resolve this financial problem. They would probably opt for some high-risk solutions, but Zhang Heng preferred to opt for working. While the money may not come as quickly, it would allow him to familiarize and affiliate himself with this city.\"Hmm, most people work in restaurants, supermarkets or convenience stores, but being able to speak Japanese is a requirement.\" Ameko paused for a moment to think. \"Or do you have any skills?\"\"Skills?\" Zhang Heng cocked his brow. \"Does archery and playing the piano count?\"\"Ah? Archery and piano! That's incredible! If that's the case, you can work at the kyudo practice hall or western restaurants. Mm, but Japanese archery (ky\u016bd\u014d) is slightly different from western archery, emphasizing on the cultivation of the spirit and the mind. Also, there's no way you could avoid talking to people in the practice hall. It looks like your best option is to play at a western restaurant.\" Ameko carefully broke down the pros and cons of each option for Zhang Heng.This girl was through-and-through an executive\u2014she immediately dragged Zhang Heng to an Italian restaurant to apply for a job. Unfortunately, they already had a pianist. Next, the pair tried the Spanish and French restaurants next door. Eventually, a western restaurant owned by a local Tokyolite was willing to give Zhang Heng a chance after hearing him play. Even so, the owner was still bothered by the fact that Zhang Heng did not know how to speak Japanese.Ameko pointed at the job advertisement outside the shop and said, \"You're still short on servers, right? I used to work in Roast Beef Ohno. How about this\u2014I'll work here too! If there are any language problems, I can help him translate.\"\"Then we don't have a problem anymore!\" The restaurateur nodded. \"We pay 1,200 yen an hour, three days a week, 4\u20145 hours a day. There will be day and night shifts. You can choose to come on the days you don't have classes. I will try to put you two in the same shift.\"\"Thank you for your trouble!\" Ameko bowed.Only when they stepped out of the door did Zhang Heng find out what the two had been talking about. When Ameko sensed a protest on the way, she quickly explained, \"The trip yesterday night was really fun! Everyone is normally so busy with their own lives that very few people would be willing to listen to what other people's opinions! Zhang-san\u2026 is a very gentle person. Also, it's not all because of you. I just quit my last job and have been looking for one. The environment and pay here are pretty good as well! Also, isn't it much safer with you around?\" Ameko flashed her snaggleteeth.Could this be the perks of a good first impression? Zhang Heng said nothing. When he saw that it was already evening, he treated Ameko to dinner at a restaurant nearby.The two were chatting about school when a spray-painted Subaru BRZ and a green Volkswagen Golf R pulled up in front of the shop. Young boys and girls with colorful hair stepped out of the cars. One of them, a guy with a bandanna, shouted at the owner to bring beers the minute he stepped in.From the looks of most of them, it was apparent they had a round of drinks before this. They were already somewhat drunk.Ameko whispered, \"Don't keep staring at them! That guy is a recent\u00a0bosozoku1. Quite a few of them are from our school. They hang out with good-for-nothing worthless punks all day long! They do nothing good from morning to night.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng did not avert his gaze immediately. He was thinking of a way into the primary mission when voil\u00e0!\u2014the cue was right in front of his eyes!This group of so-called bosozoku were markedly car-tuning enthusiasts. If he could somehow be involved in their circle, he should be able to be acquainted with all sorts of underground street races. Building a good relationship with one or two people, he might just get the person to teach him some racing skills.But there was one problem\u2014he could sense Ameko's discrimination of these people. Without her to help him translate, he had no way of communicating with them.Should he try convince Ameko to help or should he just drag her in?Zhang Heng did not have a lot of time to dilly-dally. The moment the headbanded guy glanced over, he lowered his head and avoided eye-contact. The other customers pretty much reacted the same. The group of bosozoku appeared to have a sense of superiority over the average person, whistling and laughing loudly as they sauntered to an unoccupied table at the back.At the last minute, Zhang Heng decided to go\u00a0against breaking friendship with Ameko, purely because this bunch of people was too dim-witted. If he were going to associate himself with them, he would have to lower his intelligence to match theirs.Zhang Heng did not have any masochistic tendencies and decided to abandon that decision instead. He knew that this wasn't the only way to get involved in street racing, not to mention learning nothing at all from this bunch of goons.For the next two weeks, Zhang Heng spent his time learning Japanese and working at the western restaurant. There were no developments on the racing front, but his relationship with Ameko was getting better. The pair worked together, with Zhang Heng helping correct Ameko's Mandarin pronunciation, and in return, Ameko tutored his Japanese. On top of that, Zhang Heng started to realize Ameko's growing fondness of exchanging text messages with him.After getting to know her more, he realized that Ameko was the kind of girl who could really talk. From Momo the cat, the stray dog on the road, to the supermarket bento discounts\u2014everything she saw, she would send him a text telling him about them!During his Japanese class, he would receive Aemko's text:Ah! Today, the Chinese language teacher is wearing an extremely adorable floral skirt that does not suit her age at all! Everyone is shocked.While he was having his meal, he would get:Big news! This is a disaster! Did you know that the school's dog Matsuko is actually male?!Or before going to bed:Zhang-san, don't you think that the world would be a horrible place if cats don't exist?The one that he received nearly every day:Oh no, am I too keen on sending messages? Do you hate me? Yes? No?Zhang Heng put down the rollerball pen he was using and rubbed his eyes.\"No. I was revising today's lesson.\"He had not been loafing about even though he was unable to find out about the covert night street race. It felt like he had gone back in time to his senior year in high school. For the sake of picking up Japanese as soon as possible, or at least be able to understand the dullest everyday conversation, he went all out\u2014paring down his sleeping time to just 5 hours to tirelessly practice his language skills. He even kept a book of Japanese basics next to the piano in the restaurant.The whole thing undoubtedly was like attending extracurricular classes instead of playing a game!\"Zhang-san, you're too industrious. Compared to you, I feel like I'm wasting time,\" Ameko said admiringly.\"I'm just doing what I have to.\" Zhang Heng smiled bitterly. Truth be told, he was not very interested in learning languages. But on the second evening here, he received a prompt from that mysterious voice again.It confirmed that his return time had been extended to 420 days. Some things could be planned in advance, though. He could not possibly rely on Ameko to be his translator for such a long period. Moreover, she had already applied to be an exchange student in China and may not be around for the next school year. Zhang Heng decided that he needed to be independent.A fourteen-month long study tour like this was hard to come by. If he did take advantage of it and pick up the local language, it would be a waste of opportunity.Zhang Heng had a sneaking suspicion that if this game continued, he would have to learn all mainstream languages of the world first.Ameko still kept up with her prattling messages about trivial things, and after one week of bombardment, Zhang Heng could read between the lines of her message today that she was in low spirits.So, he typed:What happened to you?But before he clicked send, he erased the message and then dialed her number. \"Ameko, have you been in some sort of trouble recently?\"The girl was shocked to hear from him! Her voice was a little hoarse as if she had just cried not a while ago, and she was sniffling. \"Zhang-san. I'm sorry for worrying you. It's nothing actually. It's just a family affair, no, not really a family affair\u2014that person left us six years ago.\"\"You'll feel better if you talk about it. If you're want to, you can tell me. I can keep it a secret for you. After all, other than you, no one else here understands what I say.\"The upset Ameko chuckled and then proceeded to tell her story to Zhang Heng. It turned out when she was younger, her father became addicted to betting on horseracing. He lost the entire family's fortune. When her mum could not stand it anymore, they got divorced.After they had broken all relations, her mother married her stepfather and had Ameko's younger brother. Their lives had been very harmonious until she started university. Somehow her father found her and reached out.The first time they met, he asked her to lend him money. At first, he said that it was because his business was trouble and needed some turnover money. But if there was one time, there would be a second. After a few more, Ameko grew suspicious. She found out that not only was he still gambling, he also picked up a terrible drinking habit. fThe father and daughter broke into a fight and stopped contacting each other for a few months. Then during the afternoon an hour ago, Ameko received a call from her father saying that he had been beaten up by debt collectors and did not have any money to see a doctor. Having learned her lesson, though, Ameko did not send her hard-earned money right away. Her father called her ungrateful and even said that he did not have a daughter like her!Ameko broke into tears, and asked Zhang Heng who was on the other line, \"Zhang-san, am I very cold-blooded?\"\"Err, I think your father is extremely unreasonable. From the looks of it, he's most likely lying. But if you're worried about him, I can go with you tomorrow.\"\"Really? Isn't it unbecoming of me to trouble you for my family's problem?\" Ameko felt abashed.\"No! Recently, I feel like I'm nearing my limits as well. If I'm not learning Japanese, I would be playing piano at the restaurant. It just so happens I need to a breather.\" Zhang Heng blurted all these from the heart. If he had to look at another one of those\u00a0kana1\u00a0syllables again, he might just throw up.\"It's Saturday tomorrow. Let's go after work then!\"\"Okay!\"\"Thank you so much, Zhang-san!\"\"Don't worry about it.\"Ameko's problem was just a brief interlude. Zhang Heng did not mind it at all.After he hung up, he began thinking about how to improve his driving skills again. It was already 15 days into the second game and had still not started on the main mission yet. If another player were in his shoes, they would be panicking already!But because he had fourteen months, Zhang Heng was not in too much of a hurry. But he could not continue to squander time away so rampantly. It would be better for him to set a deadline for himself\u2014if he were still unable to find a way to improve his driving skills, Zhang Heng would have no choice but to try getting involved with this bosozoku.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter getting off the bus, they took a fifteen-minute walk, and after crossing an intersection, they finally arrived at the destination.Zhang Heng looked at the small shop called Kurahara Seafood and asked, \"Your father lives here?\"\"Yeah. It doesn't smell so good inside\u2026 so you can wait for me outside.\" The closer they were, the more perturbed Ameko looked but she was ever so considerate.\"Since I'm already here, I might as well go in with you.\" Zhang Heng, on the other hand, was not reluctant.The both of them passed roll-up banner stands and an abandoned old freezer as they walked into the seafood supply shop. A pungent fishy stench immediately assaulted Their noses as they took in the overpowering smell of fishes and prawns\u2014all sorts of seafood\u2014everywhere. But there was no one in the shop\u2014all but a Moray eel struggling inside a polystyrene box.\"Father! Father!\" Ameko called out, but no one replied. \"Could he really have gone to the hospital?\" The girl muttered and hesitantly walked up the stairs with Zhang Heng following closely behind.The wooden stairs had not been mended for a long time, leaving cracks and chips everywhere. Every time they took a step, the stairs would groan and creak under pressure threatening to give up the load they could barely bear.If Zhang Heng thought the ground floor was packed like sardines, there was barely any space to walk on the first floor. There was dirty laundry, beer bottles, and even porn magazines scattered all over the place. An unshaven, half-naked man was lying on the ground, snoring away.'I'm such an idiot! I believed the same lies over and over again!\" Ameko held her forehead in her palm.\"In some way, this is also good news, right? It's better than lying on a hospital bed.\"\"This is even worse, so much worse! Why do men who lie to their own daughters exist in this world?\" Ameko pulled the man by both hands and tried to get him onto the tatami on the side.When he saw that Ameko seemed to be struggling, Zhang Heng offered to help. \"Come, let me help.\"As they were dragging the man, something fell out of his pocket. Ameko picked it up to examine it. It was a brown wallet. She was stunned and appeared to be lost in thought when the man suddenly sat upright on the tatami! He lunged for Ameko, shouting at her furiously!In an emergency, Zhang Heng instinctively employed the defensive move that Bell had taught him and threw the man onto the floor with an over-shoulder throw. The man fell to the ground with a loud hard thud; his eyes rolled to the back of his head as he slumped to the ground, unconscious.Only then did Ameko react and shouted, \"No! Is he dead?!\" The girl jumped backward in shock.\"Err, no! But it will be a while before he wakes up. What is he screaming at you about?\"\"Give me back my wallet\u2026\" Ameko mumbled.\"I will go back and continue learning Japanese.\" Zhang Heng answered sheepishly.After that, the both of them carried the drunk and unconscious man back onto the tatami.Zhang Heng saw that Ameko was still holding onto the worn wallet and asked, \"Why? Is there a lot of money inside?\"Ameko shook her head. \"No, this wallet was a birthday gift from my mum twelve years ago. I can't believe he's still carrying it.\" She opened the wallet and found an old, yellowed picture through the semi-transparent film on the right flap. It was a family picture.Ameko pointed at the one-year-old baby and said, \"This is probably me, and that's my mum and dad at the back. Mum said that wasn't a gambler back then. We were all very happy!\"Zhang Heng's gaze fell on the very eye-catching Nissan behind the man. \"You never told me that your father was into car tuning.\"\"Car tuning? No, no. How is that possible? Don't see him for what he is right now. He was a great role model when I was younger. When the seafood supply shop first opened, business was not very good. It couldn't compete with the local competition. To increase the shop's income, he began learning English, scouted for overseas clients, calling them one by one, and sometimes even showing up at their doorstep! At the store's peak, he even sold seafood to London, Los Angeles, and even Peru! Such a serious man wouldn't have ever been involved with the bosozoku\u2026 and since I can remember, he has never driven a car. The goods have always been delivered by hired hands.\" Ameko recalled and then took another look at the picture. \"This car must have belonged to someone else. They probably parked it there when the picture was taken.\"\"Oh, is that so\u2026\" Zhang Heng did not ask any more questions but said, \"I'm quite interested in cars. This car is probably a relic now, huh. Can I take a picture of that?\"\"Sure, but keep me out of the picture. I was an ugly child.\" Ameko blocked out her one-year-old face with a finger as Zhang Heng took a picture.After that, she rinsed two teacups and boiled some water with the electric kettle on the table. She rummaged through a cupboard and found a packet of black tea leaves.Ameko brought it up to her nose and sniffed. \"This\u2026 is probably oolong tea.\"The pair chatted as they enjoyed the tea. But the conversation was mostly Ameka talking about her childhood. After about half an hour, the stubbled man on the tatami opened his eyes and rubbed his throbbing shoulders. When he saw Zhang Heng, his eyes widened with caution.Ameko quickly explained their relationship.Only then did the stubbled man relax a little. The animosity quickly turned into disregard, and then father and daughter spoke in native Japanese.Finally, Ameko took out 15,000 yen from her bag and placed them on the table, but the man did not look very happy. His speech became even more impassioned, and he got up from the mat angrily.Zhang Heng stood protectively in front of Ameko, his forehead creased! The results of his workout had been pretty evident lately. Although he was not super muscular, there was not an ounce of extra flesh hanging from his body. On top of that, after that shoulder throw Zhang Heng had given the man, the man's manner softened a little at the sight of him.Ameko pushed herself off the floor, looking crestfallen and the rims of her eyes red and raw. \"Let's go!\"All the way back on the tram, Ameko only stared out the window. Zhang Heng was careful not to interrupt her. After a while, he took out a packet of mixed-flavored gum and said in broken Japanese, \"Don't eat. I'll eat strawberries.\"\"It's 'if you don't eat one, I'll eat all of the strawberry-flavored ones,\" Ameko corrected as she picked one. The crease in her brows slowly disappeared, and she switched to Mandarin. \"I'm sorry, Zhang-san, that you had to see all those unhappy things.\"\"Not at all! You have always been helping me; letting me help you once in a while makes me feel pretty good! So. What happened? Did the two of you end up in good terms?\"\"No. My dad's employee is returning to his hometown this month. He couldn't find anyone suitable to help him deliver the goods. The store is not going to survive for much longer. He always finds all kinds of excuses, anyway! I couldn't be bothered to differentiate the truth from lies, so I gave him all my allowance for his month. That should be enough to keep things peaceful for now.\" Ameko said helplessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had navigation on his phone and could actually find his way again, but Ameko always insisted on sending him regardless.To thank her, Zhang Heng bought her dinner in the canteen. Ever since he started working at the restaurant, he was able to work out his pressing financial problem. Now, his monthly income was around 70,000 yen.This sum of money was enough to sustain him in the city, but that was just about it. Using this method to save up for a car was just too unrealistic. Presently, Zhang Heng still had not found a solution to this setback, but he had at least found a prospect in regards to brushing up his driving skills.On their way back, Zhang Heng asked Ameko for his father's name. He keyed in\u00a0Kurahara Tetsuya1\u00a0on his phone along, and the search results that came up were all related to Kurahara Seafood.Everything appeared as healthy as it could be.After that, he used the editing tool to crop the man's face from the picture, magnify it, then upload it to Facesaerch, an image search engine created by Google application programming interface (API) that allowed its users to track down similar pictures on the web.The search results varied inaccuracy, and could sometimes be very inconsistent. You could upload Bai Baihe's picture and get Wang Luodan, and a search for Takeshi Kaneshiro would get you Zhao Benshan!Looking at the masses of pictures that popped up on his screen, Zhang Heng knew that he was going to have a lot of work to do tonight.\u2026The second morning, Zhang Heng slept in, which was something he rarely did. Since he did not need to work or attend classes that afternoon, he lay in bed until 10 am before rolling out of bed, not forgetting to make up for his morning run.After brunch, Zhang Heng checked his phone and saw that he had two messages from Ameko.One was:Thank you so much for yesterday.And the other:Momo drank too much toilet water and is having diarrhea! I'm taking him to the vet!Zhang Heng employed his recently upgraded Japanese and typed:Be careful!After that, he set Kurahara Seafood as his destination on his phone.This was the first time he traveled so far without Ameko accompanying him. Fortunately, he had a map at hand and recollection for the place. After an hour and a half, he finally made it to the place they had been to yesterday.This time, the stubbled man was awake but still looked like he had just got out of bed. Garbed in pair of boxers, slippers, and a sleeping robe, he examined a batch of scallops\u00a0in front of the store.He was startled when he turned around and saw Zhang Heng, then rambled on and on about something unintelligible as he kept retreating into the store, his hands searching his surroundings for any defensive weapons. When he saw that Zhang Heng had no intention of withdrawing, he fished out his phone and indicated that he was going to call 110.\"Uncle, I heard from Ameko that you understand English?\" asked Zhang Heng in English.\"So what?!\" The stubbled man found a mop and held on like his life depended on it! \"Hey, kid! I'm warning you! Even if you're Ameko's boyfriend, you have no right to get involved in our family's business! If you don't leave, I'll call the police!\"\"I'm not here about yesterday.\" Zhang Heng shook his head. \"Can we please talk inside?\"\"Don't! Don't move! Don't think that you can use this trick to get near me! The same move won't even work on Saint Seiya!\" The stubbled man barked, raising his voice. It seemed that yesterday's shoulder throw had somewhat scarred him.They spoke in English anyway, so Zhang Heng did not have to worry about any eavesdroppers. Zhang Heng did not push it any further and simply said, \"Then I'll just say it\u2014I was hoping you could teach me how to race cars.\"\"\u2026.\" The man was stumped for a short minute. \"You want a seafood supply storeowner to teach you how to drag race? Is your English bad or is there a problem with my hearing? What is this? Some cold Easter Sunday joke?!\"The man paused for a moment and then continued, \"Didn't Ameko tell you? I don't know how to drive at all. Why do you think I have so much backlog ever since my delivery man quit?\" He gestured towards the pile of boxes miserably.Zhang Heng did not budge. \"Isn't your English too good to be a self-taught learner? Takeda Tetsuya, or should I call you Yosuke Tsuchiya? The famous racing prodigy who left for Europe immediately after graduating from high school. Your excellent driving skills attracted the attention of sponsors, which led to your participation in the FIA GT Grand Prix! Your biggest success was winning second-runner up in New, York but because you offended the racing team manager, you were forced to return home. Seventeen years ago, you won the Tokyo D1 GRAND PRIX, then in the same year, set out to challenge the Drift King (DK) title! You beat all the street racers from 22 wards out of Tokyo's 23 special wards. But you suddenly gave up and vanished at the final juncture.\" Zhang Heng said unhurriedly.\"I don't know who the hell you're talking about!\" The man said, keeping a straight face. \"Kid, if you want to go race cars, don't stand in front of my shop and disturb my business!\"No matter how hard he pretended to remain calm and unaffected, Zhang Heng, who had been staring at his face, noticed that when he mentioned the name Yosuke Tsuchiya, the man's pupils contracted. Zhang Heng was 90% sure that he had found the guy.\"Why did you quit, and why change your name to Takeda Tetsuya? Is it because you don't want to be found?\"The stubbled man's poker face finally thawed. \"Kid, are you threatening me?\"\"Are you finally admitting to it, Mr. Yosuke?\"\"I'm not admitting to anything!\" The man answered cautiously.Zhang Heng did not continue to twist the man's arm since he only wanted to confirm his identity. This guy reeked of deceit, but lucky for him, Zhang Heng was not going to threaten to expose the man for Ameko's sake.But the man never explicitly denied Zhang Heng's accusation either.\"Aren't you short on a delivery man? What about me? I'll help you deliver goods. I don't need to be paid. You just have to teach me how to race.\"The man's eyes lit up at the mention of not having to pay but began quickly weighing the advantages and disadvantages. It mostly revolved around the consequences of refusing the young man's offer. After a moment, he looked at the Chinese boy, and Zhang Heng could tell that the man was tempted. But the profiteer in him saw Takeda Tetsuya asked, \"How about I teach you to race cars, and other than helping me deliver goods, you pay me a fee as well?\"\"\u2026\"When he saw the expression on Zhang Heng's face, he quickly changed his tone. \"That was a bit too flagrant of me. Alright! Forget about the fee. But let me get this straight\u2014we need to set some rules. First, don't ever mention the name Yosuke Tsuchiya ever again! There is no such person. Second, you and I are not master and apprentice! I am your boss, and you are my delivery guy. I'm just worried that you might be too slow in delivering, and slow down business, so I'm just giving you a few pointers. How much you can learn will depend on you. Third, Ameko cannot know about this.\"\"Add one more to it\u2014don't ask Ameko for money ever again,\" Zhang Heng added.The stubbled man thought about it and then agreed reluctantly. \"\u2026 Fine!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After I've sorted the goods, you'll deliver them to the places they need to go. That's all the work for the day. Understand, kid?\"\"One in the morning?! Then do I still have time to sleep after all that?\" Zhang Heng asked, his brows furrowed.Takeda Tetsuya grinned, revealing a mouthful of yellowed teeth. \"That will depend on how fast you deliver the goods! Alright, do you have any other questions?\"\"I have one last question.\"\"Hm?\"\"You will help me get a driver's license first, right?\"Takeda Tetsuya's face froze. \"Repeat what you just said?!\"\"I don't have a driver's license. If I'm going to deliver goods for you, I will need to get a license first, right?\" Zhang Heng answered honestly.\"\u2026. You don't even have a driver's license, and you want me to teach you how to race?!\" Takeda Tetsuya looked defeated. \"Are you messing with me? Why would someone who hasn't touched a steering wheel in his life be interested in underground drift racing?!\"\"Actually, I'm not interested in drift racing at all, but because of reasons I'm disinclined to share, I have to join the race.\"Takeda Tetsuya glared at Zhang Heng, only speaking after a minute through his teeth. \"Then, you will have to pray that you can drive faster than the cops.\"\u2026Tokyo at midnight and Tokyo in the morning were like chalk and cheese.In the dead of night at midnight, most people were already asleep at home. Only residential buildings by the streets would occasionally still have a light on. Zhang Heng left the campus and took the last train. It was almost empty except for a few exhausted salarymen and a couple of geisha with heavily painted faces.He disembarked at the last station, walked a very long way before finally arriving at the seafood supply store at the agreed time.Takeda Tetsuya had somehow pulled himself together. Instead of snoring away upstairs, he was squatting in the store, sorting the order forms.When he heard the footsteps behind him, he did not even bother to look up. \"Give me 5 more minutes.\"After exactly 5 minutes, he got up and picked up two freshly dead crabs and tied them up with a straw rope. He tossed a set of keys to Zhang Heng and then snorted, \"Come with me!\"Zhang Heng followed the man to a small open-air carpark nearby. Takeda Tetsuya gave the metal gate a shake, and after a while, the lights were turned on. Then, a hunched elderly man slipped on a shirt as he came and unlocked the gate.Takeda Tetsuya smiled at the old man, telling him something in Japanese as he handed the crabs over while pointing at Zhang Heng.The elderly man looked delighted receiving the crabs\u2014his smile stretching out the wrinkles on his face. He glanced at Zhang Heng and gave the young man a friendly nod.\"Mr. Crab\u2014to be honest, I don't know what his real name is. It doesn't matter. Nobody cares about these kinds of things anyway. His old partner passed away a long time ago, and after his children went overseas, they never contacted him anymore. He makes a living for himself with this carpark, and this is also where he lives. We're old friends. I give him dead crabs that can't be sold, and he lets me park here for free.\u00a0Also, I've already introduced you to him. From now onward, you can just come here to pick up\u00a0and return the car.\"\"Which one is it?\" Zhang Heng looked around at the car park, and finally, his gaze settled on a mustard yellow van parked in the corner.\"Isn't it beautiful? Mitsubishi's second-generation L300 (Delica), launched in 1982. It's the first four-wheel-drive van in Japan!\" When talking about cars, it was like Takeda Tetsuya had become a whole different person! That dejected uncle seemed to have vanished. He lit a cigarette and ran his hand along the body of the car. \"It runs a 4D56 diesel 2.5 engine and the same chassis as the Pajero, powerful enough to cope with bad weather and terrible road conditions. This van has the performance of an off-road vehicle\u2026\"\"1982? Are you sure it still runs?\" Zhang Heng asked uncertainly.\"Don't worry, I found it in a scrapyard, and I've refurbished the interior. This 4-wheel-drive is now a 2-wheel-drive. In terms of stability, it's much better than before. 4-wheel-drive adds to the weight of the car, but a car that is too heavy is not very good for the driver\u2026 it uses too much petrol\u2026 Most importantly, I fixed the cassette player!\" Takeda Tetsuya opened the codriver seat, climbed into the car, and picked a cassette tape.Zhang Heng climbed into the driver's seat. After getting home yesterday morning, he quickly looked up on some driving knowledge, especially videos and pictures on the web. On top of that, he even downloaded a driving simulation game on his phone and played it on the subway on his way to the store, which was why right now, he\u2026 still had zero confidence.Zhang Heng pushed the key that Takeda Tetsuya had given to him into the ignition. It took him three tries to get the car going.Takeda Tetsuya completely ignored him. He waited until the vehicle roared to life and then slipped the Chage and Aska cassette into the player on the dashboard. But before the car could even move 5 meters, the car suddenly jerked and came to a stop. Takeda Tetsuya lurched forward hard, hitting his head on the glove compartment in front of the passenger seat!Zhang Heng said flatly, \"Sorry. Wrong gear!\"As he spoke, he shifted to 5th gear.\"Please inform me when you sign up for a race. I will buy insurance for you. I will be the benefactor, of course. You win!\" Takeda Tetsuya stopped the tape player. \"Start with the first gear. Press the clutch with your left foot. Push it down all the way. Then slowly, with your right feet, step on the gas pedal as you depress the clutch\u2026\"After about three minutes, the L300 finally wobbled out of the parking lot, and under Mr. Crab's supervision, it slowly bumped into a fire hydrant.Luckily, it was very early in the morning, and the road was still quite deserted.Zhang Heng drove the van onto the open road, lurching every now and then. When he looked over at his passenger, he saw that Takeda Tetsuya had fastened the seat belt like an honest man.The fifteen-minute journey took Zhang Heng twenty-five minutes. On the way, the engine stalled five more times, and he ran two red lights. He even drove over the curbs! Fortunately, though, they arrived at their destination in one piece.Tsukiji Fish Market was the biggest seafood market, not only in Tokyo but in the world. Fishermen from all over Japan would deliver all the produce they caught to be sold here. In its heyday, they could sell 3,200 tons of seafood a day worth 3 billion yen. Every single day, over 60,000 wholesalers would come to select and bid for the products they want. To them, this was not just a marketplace, it was a battlefield.Zhang Heng pulled the handbrake.Takeda Tetsuya was about to say something, but he blanked out. Finally, all he said was, \"Wait here.\" Then he jumped out of the van and greeted someone he appeared to know. The man produced a packet of cigarettes, and the pair walked into the market, puffing away.By the time Takeda Tetsuya returned, it had already been an hour. Following him was a forklift carrying the boxes of seafood he had selected. To the man's surprise, instead of taking a nap while waiting for him to return, Zhang Heng was practicing his driving skills! Compared to his jerky driving this morning, his skills had now improved noticeably.Takeda Tetsuya, however, did not comment but instead, grumbled grumpily, \"Get down and load the van!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhang Heng realized that he underestimated the extent of Takeda Tetsuya, his new boss' ruthlessness.He sent the man back to the shop at 3.15 in the morning. Then after spending ten minutes unloading and packing the seafood, Zhang Heng left the shop at 3.35. By 6.30, he was still driving with about half of the undelivered goods at the back of the van.By then, the street was growing busy\u2014all the office workers who lived far from their workplaces were already out the door, spilling into the underground subway and bus stations. The number of cars on the road were also gradually increasing. Zhang Heng went to two other places, and when he left an\u00a0izakaya1, he encountered two traffic policemen who were just starting their shifts. As a result, he decided not to risk continuing the delivery.Driving without a license in Japan would be a severe offense. Not only would the offending driver have to serve less than 3 years of jail time and pay a 500,000 yen fine, all passengers and owners of the vehicle would also be convicted and fined. It was almost at peak hours. If Zhang Heng did not leave, chances were, he would be stuck in a jam.Zhang Heng brought the L300 back to the store to an unsurprised Takeda Tetsuya. The latter picked up the phone and contacted the former delivery man, before turning to Zhang Heng and said, \"You have one more week. After that, Takahashi Koichi will be back in his hometown. If you still can't complete the delivery by then and I suffer a loss, would you pay me back?\"\"Alright.\" Zhang Heng answered.Zhang Heng's unwavering answer was not quite what Takeda Takashi had expected. This situation was, in all honesty, quite a tragedy for the store owner\u2014not only was he unable to contend with the young man, but he was also in a vulnerable position that the young man could capitalize on. He could do nothing about Zhang Heng not completing the job, so he could only grumble and make a fuss. He really hadn't expected the young man to actually agree so breezily.Takeda Takashi said cunningly, \"Hey, kid, you better don't lie. If you can't do it, then you can't! The sooner you tell me, the sooner I can figure out a way to hire another driver. I worked hard to get each and every one of these customers! Don't make empty promises. If you still cannot complete your task, the one at stake is my shop!\"\"If I fail to complete the deliveries, I will pay you back whatever you lose!\" Zhang Heng hopped down the van and stretched his shoulders and wrists.\u00a0His first delivery was unsuccessful, and after driving from the wee hours of the morning, his body and mind were exhausted. But he found that somehow, this pressure had drastically improved his driving. It would appear that this nonstop driving around was much more useful than if he were to practice the entire day.Of course, he could always tell Takeda Takashi to reduce his cargo, but if he was not even willing to accept a small challenge like this, then why bother to participate in the competition? He might as well just give up then.Zhang Heng took the bus back to campus and was only able to wash his face and quickly gobble down a few pieces of bread before he had to rush for another Japanese lesson.Only in the evening did he get the chance to make up for being awake the whole morning. He had set the alarm for four hours. Later, he had dinner. He then visited the bookstore nearby to buy a map of Tokyo.As mentioned previously, self-reflection and deduction were Zhang Heng's strengths. On his way back to campus that morning, he had already started mulling over reasons he was unable to complete his task that day. Other than his unpolished driving skills and the L300's poor performance, his unfamiliarity with the roads and lack of route planning were also crucial factors.No matter how good a driver was, it would be challenging for him to be able to perform to be at fullest capacity if he was unfamiliar with the location of the competition.At 1.20 in the morning, Zhang Heng arrived at the parking lot, gave Mr. Crab two\u00a0onigiri1, who gleefully opened the gate for him. He returned to the store at 7.34 am. Unfortunately, his performance today was worse than the day before, delivering only about 40% of the goods.Takeda Takashi was cleaning the sink in his pajamas when he saw the young man return. \"Young people should not be too confident. It's not too late for you to give up now. Otherwise, in six days, you will have to sell yourself to me as a slave and work for free your whole life.\"Zhang Heng said nothing in reply. He had only himself to blame, taking too much time planning the route and unfamiliarity with the names of the places causing him to arrive at the wrong location a couple of times. He even nearly drove all the way to Okinawa to see bikinis!Zhang Heng added another item to his to-do list\u2014Get familiar with Tokyo's streets.Takashi Seafood Products' customers could be divided into two main types: regular customers and new customers. The former received their goods at the same locations while the latter was more spontaneous, which, at the moment, Zhang Heng could do nothing about. For the regular clientele, on the other hand, Zhang Heng could mark their location on the map, then use a pen to connect the dots and find the best route for delivery.After that, he simply had to slot in the new customers' locations that were en route. That way, he could save a large portion of his time.So, on the third day, Zhang Heng delivered 70% of the goods, and for the first time, when the L300 pulled up the in front of the shop, Takeda Takashi did not make fun of him.On the fourth day, only 20% of the goods did not make it to the clients. On the fifth day, however, Zhang Heng found himself at a bottleneck.Although he had done his best to make every minute count, he still had 15% of undelivered goods. It was only thanks to the careful planning that he was able to send them to nearby clients. The remaining ones were located further from town or in more secluded areas\u2014completely overlooking them.If he were to deliver them now, it would take him an exhaustingly long time to reach. While his driving skills still had room for improvement, he only had two more days before the 'deadline'- not delivering all of the remaining goods was out of the question. Once again, Zhang Heng found himself deep in thought.Takeda Takashi, who had his head buried in an adult magazine, looked up suddenly. \"To a racer, his car is more important than his wife. So, how could a person who doesn't even understand his own wife manage the relationship? Tsk, tsk! Young people nowadays are so foolhardy.\"\"Do you have the blueprint of the car?\" Zhang Heng asked the man poring over an ocean of cigarette butts.\"A great racecar driver simply needs to listen to be able to tell the horsepower of an engine, but I can't be so harsh to a rookie like yourself, right?\" Takeda Takashi answered in a patronizing tone. It was like this guy had to accomplish something, however small, or he would die. \"I have the drawing of the modification on my computer. Take a look at it yourself. Don't compete against it. Get to know its temper, then you'll be able to control it well.\"Zhang Heng turned on the computer and was immediately greeted by Takeda Takashi's 'hidden files.' Among the mountain of porn, Zhang Heng found what he wanted. To his surprise, there was not only the blueprint for the L300 but also blueprints for other cars as well. They were all earlier models, though. It seemed like they had all been modified by a certain Mr. Takeda Takashi.On top of that, there was also a copy of a manual.Takeda Takashi called out from downstairs, \"Focus on studying the L300. Ignore everything else. You're not at that level yet. Don't try to run before you can even crawl!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhang Heng was now able to deliver all the goods before the traffic police showed up for the first time. The moment he achieved that, that familiar voice spoke in his ears:[Acquired new skill\u2014Driving skills: Level 0]Zhang Heng took in a deep breath. This period of nocturnality finally paid off, not knowing what the benchmark for skill levels was until now. About instances when his survival skills were recognized in the previous game, Zhang Heng knew that Level 0 meant that he had stepped over the threshold, at the very least.When it came to time, this wasn't considered fast, but it was definitely not slow either. It had only been a week since he first touched the steering wheel. Now, even the Takeda Tetsuya, who had been waiting for Zhang Heng to screw up, could only murmur to himself, \"Did he throw all the undelivered stuff on the side of the road?\"Zhang Heng simply ignored the remark, returned the keys, and silently took the bus back to school.He was starting to get used to this kind of life now: go to class, then work, and then to deliver goods for an unkind employer. Whenever he had the time, he would reply to Ameko's strange everyday messages.The days went on like this, and in a blink of an eye, two months had passed. It was now drawing close to three months since he'd started this game. At this time, other players would have been removed from the game and had returned to reality, but for Zhang Heng, he wasn't even a fourth of the journey in.He was in no hurry to complete the primary mission, and as he was working towards achieving his goal, he unexpectedly completed two small achievements.One was for visiting ten places of interest in Tokyo, and the other was for tasting thirty Japanese delicacies. Each achievement earned him 3 game points.These weren't actually tricky things to do at all.\u00a0As long as you were willing, you could visit ten of any of Tokyo's tourist attractions. The only thing to consider was the limited time given to complete the tasks. An exceptionally few people would be willing to spare a few days just to visit non-mission-related places.Zhang Heng, on the other hand, had Ameko dragging him around places like Skytree, Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Sensoji Temple, and many other sites. He never refused to go on these outings since he had plenty of time, and his daily schedule was so packed that it was nice to take a break and relax every now and then.Having a cute, snaggleteeth tour guide bringing him around the city was a rare opportunity that somehow earned him 6 points.Other than that, having learned from his previous games, Zhang Heng kept an eye out to see if anything would be refreshed once the 60-day time limit was up.\u00a0Lo and behold, he discovered a bug!Japanese Universities typically had new intakes during March or April every year. Also, with the increasing number of foreign exchange students, the other peak period for club and society recruitments were in September. When Zhang Heng first arrived at the university campus, there were posters and flyers everywhere, but because he was so busy learning Japanese, he did not join any of them.So, when the 60 days reached its end, these associations began recruiting again. When Zhang Heng asked Ameko about it, she too replied that she had no idea either and that it was probably because they did not have enough club members.But ever since that unresolved inconsistency with Bell, Zhang Heng became very sensitive about these anomalies. He was almost sure that he knew what secrets these organizations were hiding.So, Zhang Heng came up with a solution\u2014to collect every club and society's recruitment flyers. They included the typical football club, swimming club, baseball club, taekwondo club,\u00a0shogi1\u00a0club, and\u00a0hanafuda club2. The hanafuda club was hugely popular, notably when their brochures featured their president and co-president, both of whom stunningly beautiful girls.But just to be clear, Zhang Heng's attention was not on all these. His focus was on car-related clubs. So far, he had found a 4WD club, a racers workshop, and an Autoshow model photography club. After he inquired about the 4WD club, though, he found out that it was not the four-wheel-drive that he thought it was.This group of people were not racing 4WD cars but instead, the mini 4WD toy cars from 'Dash! Yonkuro1' developed by Tamiya Incorporated\u2014Audley, which was also popular once upon a time, was China's knockoff version. It was, however, yesterday's news among today's generation. Zhang Heng was pleasantly surprised that a group of hardcore fans still existed in the university!At the moment, Zhang Heng did not feel like collecting dust behind some toy cars while cheering for\u00a0Shooting Star, Cannonball, Burning Sun1\u2026 that would be quite a sight to behold! On the other hand, he thought that the name 'Autoshow model photography club' sounded rather dubious. So, in the end, Zhang Heng decided to join the racers workshop.This one sounded the most legit out of the three.To his delight, he really did learn quite a lot from this group, which was founded by a senior who started as a racecar fan. He and a group of like-minded friends decided to start this society, and after much self-teaching and practice, he was able to obtain specialized skills. Eventually, a team signed him when he was in his fourth year in university to become a professional racecar driver driving for the GT300 race season.Three years ago, he put all the discoveries from his training down on paper and shared them with the members of the club. He even shot daily tutorial videos and recorded his experience and opinions in a blog, which he kept up-to-date.He was extremely generous when compared to Takeda Tetsuya, who only gave Zhang Heng minimal pointers on their way back to the shop whenever they went to the fish market together. Still and all, both of them had very different training and driving styles.The senior was a feistier, go-all-in kind of competitor who believed in momentum, flooring the pedal all the way, whereas the owner of the seafood store was a positively technical driver. Zhang Heng had found old videos of Takeda Tetsuya's racing days, and came to learn that this guy was cunning when it came to competitions. His style was to draft, always tailing other cars closely and then only punching it to full-speed in the final two laps.A line he often repeated was, 'Racing is a tactical game. It's not just a competition of skills, but it is also a battle of the mind. An average driver only sees the road ahead, but a great driver must never be fettered by the limitation of the eyes but look at the bigger picture.But every time after he said this, he would add insultingly, \"Sigh, but a green boy like you will never understand this world! You better stick to delivering the seafood first. Thanks to you, business has been pretty good lately. The orders have increased by another 20%! The same rule applies\u2014you will pay me back for whatever you fail to deliver!\"Zhang Heng had already gotten his driver's license but eventually found out that it was pointless because he had to rush back to school for class before Tokyo was awake anyway. To add, the L300 that Takeda Tetsuya had apparently dug up from the rubbish pile was not insured and nor inspected. To top it all off, the number plate was a fake!It now made sense why Takeda Tetsuya had turned a blind eye when Zhang Heng broke traffic rules in the earlier days. The police would not be able to catch them anyway, so it did not matter how badly Zhang Heng was driving. Of course, if they were stopped by the police, they would be seriously screwed\u2014they could be thrown into jail.Owing to that, Zhang Heng could only continue to keep a fast driving pace and lay low whenever he was on the road.Having said that, he found the notes and tutorial videos provided by the racecar workshop's founder to be very enlightening\u2014his approach towards racing was the exact opposite of what Zhang Heng had been learning from the seafood store owner.Eventually, only after three arduous months, did Takeda Tetsuya impart his car tuning knowledge to Zhang Heng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This guy was really sticking to their agreement\u2014not saying another word as he pushed the door open and exited the van.He took two steps forward and then halted abruptly. He turned around and said, \"Come earlier this Sunday.\"Zhang Heng stared after the man quizzically for a moment, and then it dawned on him\u2014he might have triggered a new storyline as he just received a new update 4 seconds ago that his driving skills had gone from level 0 to level 1. At the same time, after a month of learning, he even attained another skill\u2014car tuning and maintenance (level 0).So, on the third night, after his taking a stroll around Shinjuku with Ameko, Zhang Heng took the bus to the seafood store, three hours earlier than usual. When Takeda Tetsuya saw him coming, he turned around and locked the door behind him and then tossed the key to Zhang Heng. \"The shop's having a day off today.\"\"Where are we going?\"\"The beach. Starting from today, I will be teaching you how to drift.\"Zhang Heng was a little taken aback by this short announcement.Even though Takeda Tetsuya had been instructing him on how to race, and had taught him quite a few techniques, he had never once revealed his best secrets. Zhang Heng had asked a few times before, but he was always dismissed with 'You're not qualified yet!', which was a clear and direct way of telling him that he needed to meet a certain standard.Under normal circumstances, this would have been unattainable for an inexperienced fledgling with zero foundation like Zhang Heng. He had been learning how to drive for four months now, which was already way past the deadline. He managed to fulfill the criteria only yesterday.It went without saying that Zhang Heng was not going to let this precious opportunity slip away. Who knew why Takeda Tetsuya, the scrooge, suddenly had a change of mind? If it were not because he had been the champion of D1 Grand Prix tsuisou format in Tokyo or the man who nearly bagged the Drift King title, Zhang Heng would already have looked for someone else to consult, like that racer workshop senior.Not only did he have the right attitude, but to benefit the next generation, and to pave the way for those who desire to become a racing driver like him, he shared his views and experience generously with the members of his group.Zhang Heng believed that if he continued to work hard, he might be able to set himself to the path of success. After all, compared to Takeda Tetsuya, the seafood store owner, this senior guy was the more authentic racing driver. After much deliberation, Zhang Heng decided to give up that plan.The GT300 was a sanctioned racing competition. The race track and the driving skills requirements are very different from underground drift racing. As the name GT300 implies, the maximum horsepower output is capped at 300ps. On the other end of the spectrum, the only rules in underground racing were that there were no rules. No one cared what kind of cars you drove, or what type of technique you used. Whoever crossed the finishing line first was the winner. In fact, if you were ballsy enough, you could even use nitrous oxide.Zhang Heng had already read through all the workshop guy's notes and videos more than once. His vigorous and hawkish driving style was more suited to professional track facing. In a complicated environment, he would be no match for Takeda Tetsuya, the former champion of D1 Grand Prix.The seafood store owner brought Zhang Heng to a private pier that was close to being abandoned and created a drift course with tires and cardboard boxes lined as the apexes.\"Drifting is a driving technique by deliberately oversteering the car, forcing it to slide sideways through a turn. Young people nowadays love to show off their skills by drifting, but in reality, drifting on the normal road would only slow the car down and wear out the tires. This technique was designed to cope with complex road conditions.\"Zhang Heng looked at the massive pile of tightly packed boxes and tires. \"Isn't\u2026 a little too complex?\"\"As long as someone can do it, it's not complex!\" Takeda Tetsuya retorted imposingly.Zhang Heng thought after that uttering such heroic statements; the guy would at least give him some sort of live demonstration. To his disappointment, however, Tetsuya only showed him a video, and from the looks of which looked like a really old one. After that, the guy removed a folding stool and a fishing rod from the back of the van.\"\u2026\"\"Don't look at me. I swore that I would never touch another steering wheel in this life. But, don't you worry. The obstacles I've set up for you is not impossible to complete.\" said Takeda Tetsuya as he baited the hook. Zhang Heng skimmed through the video and quickly realized that he had misjudged the guy. He was probably trying to make up for the fact that he could not show Zhang Heng the technique himself, but instead, with the surprisingly de4tailed tutorial. Except for the demonstration at the beginning, the rest of the video contained new materials that Takeda Tetsuya had recorded.Zhang Heng played the video over and over again nearly seven times. In between, he even played the video in slow motion twice.Once he was satisfied, he tucked his phone away into his pocket and began his practice.The result\u2026 as expected, was a tragic sight. The ear-piercing screeching sounds of tires scraping the ground echoed on the pier. The cardboard boxes and tires were strewn about and had all been knocked over! Zhang Heng initially thought his driving skills had improved so much that he even thought about acquiring a car and completing the primary mission.But this new training felt like someone had just poured ice-cold water on him. Even though Takeda Tetsuya had not been very reliable all this while, he would not lie to him about such a trivial matter. Since he said that completing the training was attainable, it meant that Zhang Heng was the problem.On that account, the boy wrestled with the heap of tires and boxes until the next morning until the sun had started peering out from the horizon. The seafood store owner packed his fishing rod, stretched his body and then looked at Zhang Heng. \"You'll continue to deliver the goods after today. When you have free time, you can come here to practice drifting. So, how soon you complete your training is up entirely up to you. You can start modifying the L300.

A group of street racers in punk clothing with their provocatively dressed arm candies were rambling away as they waited for someone.Five minutes later, the person in question appeared.A blue Subaru Impreza WRX stopped in front of the dumpster. The driver swung the door open and got down off the car, walking towards the group.The group immediately stopped in their tracks as if they were startled. None of them dared look at him straight in the eye! Half a minute later, someone finally shouted, \"The f*ck! It\u014d Ken! What the hell is with the high-beam?!\"\"Sorry! Sorry!\" The one called It\u014d Ken apologized as he turned back to his car and turned off the headlights so that everyone could see the face of this newcomer.The guy had a head full of unruly green hair and a glacial expression. Out of all the people in front of him, his eyes fixed on only one person. \"Kentaro Inoue! Why the hell did you ask me to come at this hour? It's real late!\"\"Oh, nothing urgent, except the title Kosoku Ryusei has a new master,\" said the guy in a jacket while lying on the roof of a car with his eyes closed. A girl next to him seductively fed him grapes.\"Whatever! You're just the guy I defeated.\" It\u014d Ken scoffed.\"Asshole! Who are you to look down at me?! I'm not the same person I used to be!\" The jacketed guy opened his eyes like a tiger who had just awakened, angry, confrontational. \"This time, I bet on all the dignity of men that I will not lose to you again!\"As if he sensed the sentiment the other guy was imparting, It\u014d Ken's coolness thawed a little. He was silent for a little while and then said, \"I understand, Inoue-kun. Then let's talk with our speed.\"At that, both guys entered their cars. The girl who was with Kentaro Inoue walked to the front of the vehicles, and as the crowd cheered and whistled, pulled out her bra and threw it into the air.When the brassiere touched the ground, both vehicles charged forward simultaneously.It\u014d Ken and Kentaro Inoue were old rivals. Both of them were from pretty good families\u2014their fathers had business dealings with each other, with both the boys were best friends who grew up playing together since childhood. As a matter of fact, it was Kentaro Inoue who had pulled It\u014d Ken into this circle. As It\u014d Ken's skills continued to grow, he soon surpassed his close friend, Kentaro Inoue, making him feel as if his reputation was threatened.To cut the long story short, their friendship did not survive this test, and they gradually drifted apart.Throughout the years, Kentaro Inoue had challenged It\u014d Ken but had lost more races than he had won. It\u014d Ken had never once looked down on his friend as Kentaro Inoue would frequently come up with improvements, whether in racing or technique. This posed a threat to him.For these reasons, It\u014d Ken had to stay on edge and give 100% of his effort.\"Come on. Let me see what you have learned this time!\"It\u014d Ken thought to himself as he stepped on the gas pedal.Both cars alternatively overtook each other, gaining the lead.All of a sudden, his eyes widened! Out of nowhere, a mustard van appeared at the crossroad in front like a ghost in the dark!Shit! Why was there a car at this hour of the morning?!It\u014d Ken could feel cold sweat beading on his forehead. It was too close, too fast for him to react! At once, he realized that this was going to end tragically in a fatal crash and that the Kentaro Inoue driving next to him must be just as shocked and devastated.But what he witnessed next was something that he would remember his entire life. The crappy van did not seem to want to slow down, but charged towards him like an angry bull!The cars were less than 500 meters apart when he L300 suddenly pulled a strange drift. The van did a sideways slide at the inertia!Their doors were less than 1 cm from bushing each other!The hairs on It\u014d Ken's entire body raised on its ends. But from the corner of his eyes, he could see the L300 driver piloting the vehicle with only one hand on the steering; the other one busy fumbling for something.As they passed each other, It\u014d Ken was able to get a better view of what the driver was holding.Chewing gum?!He felt his mind went blank.\"What the hell?!\" It\u014d Ken cried out involuntarily.How could he be rummaging for a piece of chewing gum at a time like this? But what happened next was more unbelievable, as the L300 accelerated and shot part his WRX! They had almost run out of road, but the run-down van did not look like it was going to turn around!Instead, the L300 tunneled and disappeared into a narrow valley about the width of the van, leaving the two cars in the dust! The cars slowed down until they finally stopped. It\u014d Ken and Kentaro Inoue got down from their cars and looked at each other in dismay.\"Do you still want to continue?\" It\u014d Ken asked after a while.\"We can't even beat a delivery van. What's the point of continuing?\" said a defeated Kentaro Inoue. \"Keep the Kosoku Ryusei 1 title. I'm planning to quit this group, go back, and carry on the family's business.\"\"\u2026 Actually, I was also getting ready to study in Europe after I'm done with this race,\" It\u014d Ken confessed.\"Really?\" Kentaro Inoue had not seen this coming and immediately felt embarrassed. \"Speaking of which, it's been a while since we've talked about things like that.\"The boys shared a look before asking each other in unison, \"Do you want to go get a drink?\"Unbeknownst to him, Zhang Heng had caused a man to let go of his car racing dreams, nor was he aware that because of him, two friends rekindled their friendship.To him, it was just a repetition of the daily routine of delivering goods. Tokyo was reputed as the capital of drifting, with the most significant number of car tuning enthusiasts in the world. And like the game's background introduction said, these guys are mostly active at night! Whenever Zhang Heng went out on his rounds, he would often encounter these street racers.Most of them, like It\u014d Ken and Kentaro Inoue, were hobbyists always looking for an excuse to participate in some 'manly showdown.' Zhang Heng did not have time to snap at their heels. He only overtook them because he was in a rush.This was already the ninth month since he started learning to drive. He had only just completed the drifting practice that Takeda Tetsuya had set up a month ago. His driving skills had advanced from level 1 to level 2. Besides that, his car tuning and maintenance skills had progressed to level 1. This car was completely different from when he first drove it. The core configuration inside had been completely revamped. Only the shell of the L300 remained untouched.Unlike the other drivers who were so afraid that no one would know that their cars had been modified, Zhang Heng did not paint the exterior of his vehicle in bright, glaring colors. For all intents and purposes, it was also because of his limited funds.To buy accessories alone, he had to take up a second job. Takeda Tetsuya introduced him to a small junkyard owner, where he purchased all the parts he needed for cheap. But even then, it took him four months to get the L300 to what it was now.The Zhang Heng today was not the same as he was nine months ago. He was now able to deliver all the goods one hour in advance.He was returning to Kurahara Seafood when he spotted thick tolls of smoke from across the street.Realizing that something had happened, he stopped the car by the road and called the fire department as he picked up the recurve bow he kept with him for self-defense.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why else would he had given up when he was so close to gaining the Drift King title? Why was he divorced? Why swear that he would never touch another steering wheel? And why contact his daughter again after so many years?The gambling addiction excuse might have fooled Ameko, his unworldly daughter. Still, having spent so many sleepless nights with the seafood trader, Zhang Heng somehow knew that this seemingly weak-willed man was stronger than anyone else deep inside. Even though he betted on horses, it was purely recreational.Every time he placed bets, he would always stop, no matter if he won or lost. A real gambling addict would not have been so reasonable.Indeed, not everyone who left their mark on the world stage lived the rest of their lives aimlessly.Talent and hard work are indispensable to distinguish yourself from the masses of gifted people. There was no way someone with no self-control would be able to become a top racing driver.Even so, Zhang Heng never asked Takeda Tetsuya to tell his story, not because he did not care, but because he was worried he might not be influential enough to meddle with this matter.At that time, his driving skills were just average; he was still absorbing knowledge like a sponge, still unable to complete Takeda Tetsuya's hellish drifting practices. Then, Zhang Heng came up with a simple idea to play the single-player game Formula Drag.He relied on his exceedingly long time in the game\u2014avoiding from triggering the plot, and then burying himself in practice\u2014finally brushing his driving skills up to level two and complete the modification of the L300.In fact, he had already made plans to talk to Takeda Tetsuya even if tonight didn't happen. Although they did not identify themselves as master and apprentice, they were, in fact, master and apprentice. The seafood store owner was too proud, always saying one thing but meant another.Zhang Heng found it suspicious that this guy would have so many orders, not to mention each location always more remote than the one before.He secretly opened a foam box once and found out that the box labeled 'lobsters' was actually filled with pebbles.So, it turned out the supposed increase in orders was Takeda Tetsuya's way of increasing pressure in accordance with Zhang Heng's improvement.\u2026 Hopefully, it was not too late.With the bow slung on his arm, Zhang Heng ran to the front of the shop and spotted Ameko, who was supposed to be asleep at this hour. What was she doing here?She had taken a taxi here, arriving only minutes before Zhang Heng. Before the car even came to a stop, she had already jumped down the vehicle. Dropping to the ground wearily, she watched the fire devour her father's shop.Zhang Heng was about to approach her when two tattooed men wearing black gloves and shades jumped down a dark blue Toyota Voxy parked nearby and dragged Ameko from the floor into the car!The girl screamed and struggled. When the concerned taxi driver saw this, he got down his vehicle to help the poor girl but found a muzzle pointed at his head instead.The taxi diver's bravery evaporated immediately; he ran back to his car and fled as far and as fast as he could.The person who had come down the Toyota Voxy did not have to worry about the driver calling the police because he only needed two minutes to take his target away.Unfortunately, things did not always turn out the way we wanted them to, and in a split second, something pierced the dark skies!The person holding the gun heard a swishing sound before a sudden stabbing pain shot up his right arm, forcing him to release the weapon!An arrow that came out of nowhere had pierced his palm.His staggered partner was about to release Ameko and run for his life, but Zhang Heng, who had taken shelter behind the bus did not give him a chance! Zhang Heng narrowed his eyes and released the taut bowstring! The second arrow hit the guy in the calf.But their other partner in the Toyota Voxy, who was able to pinpoint Zhang Heng's location from the first two arrows, acted quickly, blocking Zhang Heng with the car.At that very moment, Zhang Heng knew that he needed to seize the opportunity! He pulled his hoodie over and then jumped out from behind the advertisement board, shooting continuously at the window of the car. To avoid the enemy's shots, he quickly searched for a safe route back to the car.Doing this, however, put a distance between him and the Toyota Voxy. By the time he was half-turned, the two injured men had already knocked Ameko unconscious and were struggling to drag her up the car.Zhang Heng's last arrow flew into the car past the driver's seat before finally planting itself on the dashboard. The driver froze for a second, and the door was quickly shut!The Voxy made a move, racing towards the main road.Zhang Heng was strangely calm. He moved in this direction to not only get on the other side of the Voxy but to also get near to the L300 he had parked by the road.When he saw the kidnappers making a run for it, he put his bow and arrows away and jumped into his delivery van! He had left the door unlocked and keys in the ignition in case of unexpected events.It was this attention to detail that saved him precious time.Before he fired up the L300, he looked up at the rearview mirror and saw that the Voxy had disappeared.Most people would have given up a situation like this, but not Zhang Heng. For the past nine months, he had been delivering goods all over the city for the harsh store owner - he now knew the area like the back of his hand. It was as vivid as a 3D map that was right inside his head.He knew precisely that about 300meters in the direction that the Voxy was headed to was a fork. Two seconds later, he heard the sound of tires screeching through his open window. He knew exactly which direction they were headed to.So, without wasting any time, he started the van, turned his car around, and in less than 4 seconds, accelerated to 100km/h! He arrived at the intersection in a literal blink of an eye. Without slowing down, he did a lift-off oversteer! The L300's tail drew a stunning arc that completely mismatched its boxy body, changing its direction. Zhang Heng then stepped on the gas all the way to the floor!The motor transplanted from a racecar let out a low growl.It took Zhang Heng only 45 seconds to reach the second intersection, but there was still no sign of the Voxy. Zhang Heng changed direction again without a second thought.This was the most challenging part. Being a minute and a half behind the Voxy, he had to rely on his judgment for the first part of the chase. One wrong turn and he would lose Ameko completely.But Zhang Heng did not have any other choice. He had to trust himself, trust the old friend chugging beneath him! Ahead of him was a 3 km long, straight road. Unless the Voxy was unbelievably fast, there was no reason he couldn't spot its taillamp. So, Zhang Heng decided to switch directions. He did a second drift; then, from the corner of his eyes, he caught a glance of the Voxy, which was making another turn.Got you!This time, Zhang Heng did not continue to pursue the minivan. He took the L300 500 meters forward before abruptly turning towards a closed coffee shop. The quick turn resulted in him breaking through the glass door, toppling over two tables, before charging out the back door and barraging directly into a shopping mall!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Heng turned on the wiper, swiping away the two greeting cards that had found their way on to his windshield! The tail of the L300 whipped past a shelf filled with expensive skincare products, the rush of wind causing the Shiseido bottles to totter.\u2026The driver of the Toyota Voxy was very sly and abruptly turned at every intersection. After making a big round, he was going to sneak back to the road, but the glass door of the mall to his right suddenly shattered! A yellow minivan with Christmas decorations dangling from it burst through the entrance!What the hell?! Did Santa come early this year? And since when did he exchange his sleigh for a car?The startled Voxy driver had been continually monitoring his rearview mirror. He did not see anyone tailing them - so where did this guy come from? And what a dramatic entrance that was!They were now only 6 to 7 meters apart. That got the Voxy driver's dander up; he stepped down on the gas pedal, trying to shake off the tailing car with his speed.But to his surprise, the beat-up L300 was actually catching up to the Voxy!Both drivers stepped on it, drawing closer to each other. Zhang Heng used the front bumper to clip the left rear end of the Voxy. The Toyota began to lose control, and in a panic, its driver tightened his grip around the steering. No matter how fast he drove, though, he could not seem to shake off the tailing van.Seeing that they were on the verge of turning-turtle, the Voxy was forced to slow down. Then as if choreographed, the L300 behind also decelerated! Zhang Heng could have knocked the other van on its side but decided to go gentle when he remembered that Ameko was inside the vehicle. In the end, both cars stopped by the roadside.Realizing that he could not escape the other van with his skills, the Voxy driver opened the car door and tossed an unconscious Ameko out! Zhang Heng watched the dark blue Toyota disappear into the night before loosening his grip on the bow and arrow.He did not continue the pursuit because one, he could not just leave Ameko on the side of the road, and two, the kidnappers had guns. Even if they had refrained from shooting the weapons earlier, who knew what they would do if they were backed into a corner.Hence, this brief skirmish between the two ended with both sides stepping down.In a way, the appearance of those kidnappers put Zhang Heng at ease. When he first saw the fire at the shop, his shared Ameko's assumption that Takeda Tetsuya had been murdered and his killer had burned the corpse to get rid of the evidence. But when the emergence of the Voxy told him otherwise - the seafood store owner was still alive!Otherwise, they would not have tricked Ameko to the ship and kidnapped her. The girl lived a very ordinary life, no different from most Japanese university students. Those goons probably took her intending to blackmail Takeda Tetsuya.But who the hell were those people in the Voxy? Causing trouble and starting fires. They even had guns! In a country with such strict regulations on weapons, getting their hands on firearms meant that they worked for someone influential.Zhang Heng shot the tattooed man in the calf intending to keep him for questioning, but their other associate appeared so unexpectedly. Thank goodness they did not manage to get away with Ameko.Zhang Heng carried his friend into the van and did a quick assessment of her condition. Other than a few scratches on her elbow and calf, the different parts of her body were completely unharmed.That was a relief.Shortly after, the loud wailing of firetrucks filled the air. The firefighters renowned for their efficiency came pretty quickly. Judging by the severity of the situation, they responded immediately and only took a couple of minutes to arrive at the scene.Zhang Heng took off his jacket and placed it on Ameko. She had invited him over to her little rented apartment a few times for hotpot, so he knew where she lived. But it did not seem like a good idea to send her back right now. She was clearly involved in some kind of problem here. If whoever it was could trick her once, they would surely trick her the second time.It was imperative that he figured out exactly what was happening before coming up with countermeasures.The Voxy people might have escaped, but Zhang Heng knew that there was one person who could give him the answers.Everything that had happened tonight was because of Takeda Tetsuya or Yosuke Tsuchiya. It was time for the guy to tell his story.But before that, Zhang Heng had to find him first.That was not too difficult a thing to figure out. Zhang Heng drove to Takeda Tetsuya's favorite f\u016bzoku 1, a karaoke cum izakaya, but eventually found him in the abandoned port where they had trained.The sun was coming up by then. The seafood store owner was wearing a large floppy hat that covered his face, fishing with a group of elderly fishing hobbyists.When Tetsuya heard the sound of tires squealing, he immediately knew who it was. Getting up, he saw Ameko in the passenger seat and froze!\"Why is she here?\"\"That question is for you to answer.\" Zhang Heng jumped down the van. \"I found her at your shop. A bunch of guys were going to kidnap her, but don't worry; she was just knocked unconscious. Nothing big.\"\"Someone kidnapped her?! What do they look like?\" Takeda Tetsuya looked nervous, which was uncommon.\"There were three of them. They were well disguised with sunglasses and masks, though, I don't know why they didn't bother to cover up the tattoos on their necks.\"\"What are the tattoos like?\" Takeda Tetsuya appeared to be only interested in that little detail.Zhang Heng thought for a minute and then said, \"He was too far. I can't be completely sure, but I think it was an eye.\"Takeda Tetsuya's pupils contracted, allowing himself to drop to the ground as if he was completely drained of energy, muttering to himself, \"So, they've come?\"\"Who has come?\"\"It's nothing to do with the both of you. They only want my life!\" Takeda Tetsuya smiled distressingly. \"I thought that changing my name and laying low could help me escape them. I didn't think they would still hold on to me. But never mind, I will go confront them! The both of you won't be in danger anymore.\"This was not what Zhang Heng had imagined would happen. The seafood shop owner was not interested in discussing his past.While Zhang Heng was pummeling his brains on how to make him talk, a voice from behind him said, \"So, is this the reason why you divorced mum?\"No one knew when Ameko had woken up and gotten off the car, but she had obviously heard the conversation between Zhang Heng and her father.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was sumptuous tamagoyaki 1, rice, grilled fish, and miso soup.But none of them picked up their chopsticks. Takeda Tetsuya heaved a heavy sigh under Ameko's resolute gaze.He lit a cigarette and said, \"What for? You'll be going to China in two months! Why would you involve yourself in all of this?\"\"I want to know the truth about what happened back then. A part of you that still loves mum, right?\"\"Feelings are not that important anymore at our age,\" Takeda Tetsuya answered hesitantly while taking a drag. \"When I was young, I also thought that I could love a woman forever. But the truth is, after so many years, I've almost completely forgotten what she looks like.\"There was a pause before he continued, \"But whatever it is. I owe the both of you. How is Nanako? Is she well?\"\"Mum is doing great, but she still hasn't forgotten what happened back then. But she told me before that she doesn't hate you anymore. You just\u2026 owe us the truth.\"Takeda Tetsuya grew quiet. He obviously did not want to revisit his past, but he also knew that he couldn't keep avoiding him forever.An awkward pause ensued, and just as the cigarette was about to burn his fingers, Takeda Tetsuya finally spoke. \"This is all because of a mistake. A mistake that I have regretted, and will regret the rest of my entire life.\"He went on to tell the story he had kept a secret for so many years.In the 70s and 80s, Japan's economy was booming. It was in that period that Yosuke Tsuchiya was born into a happy family. Like most people back then, Yosuke Tsuchiya was full of youthful vigor, proud, and opinionated. When the Plaza Accord was signed, the American dollar depreciated against the Japanese yen, and Japanese spending power reached its peak. However, that was followed by a devastating blow to the export industry, propagating Japan's 'Lost Decade.' This massive change sent that generation of people down a very different path.The immense pressure of being in debt overwhelmed Yosuke Tsuchiya's parents. After the bank seized their home, the Yosuke couple, in their desperation, decided to end their own life. They suffocated to death by burning charcoal. Soon after receiving the news of their children's death, Tsuchiya's grandparents too died of illness. However, these life-changing events did not undo Yosuke Tsuchiya; instead, they forged his fearless character, and in the words of the team manager who later discovered him - was born a fighter.The word 'afraid' was never in his vocabulary.\"Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger.\"Yosuke Tsuchiya welcomed his prime in his twenties, reaping repeated success in European competition, winning second place in the FIA GT Grand Prix in New York. He, however, was sent home after a fallout with his racing team. Not long after, he won first place in the Tokyo D1 Grand Prix. He was a legend in Japan's drifting world.At that time, he was already at the top of his game but was never satisfied, always looking out for new challenges. Eventually, he decided to take on the Drift King title, taking him less than a year to unseat the top street racers from 22 wards. This included all special wards in Tokyo except for one: Nerima.\"Nerima's strongest racer was a guy named Asano Naoto. That guy's crazy! He invented a death-racing format - he would choose a section of a highway, destroy the guardrails and set up the exit and entrance. At the agreed time, the competing racers would drive against the traffic on the other side of the highway lane. Whoever reaches the finishing line first, and alive, is the winner. Sometimes, to make the competition more exciting, he would even involve the police in the game!\"\"That\u2026 That's basically suicide!\" Ameko was utterly gobsmacked.\"Asano Naoto believed that only the bravest racer is worthy of victory, and whoever challenges him must accept all of his rules. Even though it seems stupid now, I was young back then - I was only one race away from winning the Drift King title. I was not about to give it up.\"Takeda Tetsuya lit up another cigarette, took in a deep breath, and continued, \"We agreed on a time - apart from the two of us, my best friend also joined the competition. He was the best racing driver in Shinjuku - and we chose the course together, 40 kilometers long, three lanes wide. On normal days, there's moderate traffic. No one would have thought that it would suddenly be covered in fog.\"\"Kobayashi suggested we give up the race and choose another time. I could tell that Asano Naoto was going to agree to it. After all, he was just a ruffian who loved to live on the edge. Despite all that, he didn't really plan to die. Considering the road conditions, the level of danger was way out of his comfort zone. But that asshole didn't want to give up the chance to taunt us. He knew that I would agree too, so he decided to cast the opposing vote by calling us cowards.\"\"I was a very spirited young man. So, in my anger, I voted against delaying the race too. In the end, it was two against one, which meant the competition would go on as planned. I could see Asano Naoto's face change, but I took no pleasure in that retaliation because the three of us were already up in the gum tree.\"\"Everything that happened after that only confirmed how stupid my decision was. That day, the visibility on the highway was only 4-5 meters. We were forced to drive slower than usual, but even then, we were shrouded by the shadow of death. This was no longer a competition about skills anymore, luck seemed to be of the essence.\"We drove like that for 10 minutes, constantly fearing for our lives. On a normal day, we would have already completed the course by then, but we were only a third of the way. I kept honking all the way! Fortunately, the highway was closed off, and there were not a lot of cars coming towards us. Even then, I had to swerve madly to avoid running into oncoming cars a couple of times, not seeing them till the very last second! It felt like I was rubbing shoulders with the grim reaper!\"When the seafood store owner recalled that dangerous time in his life, it was apparent the lingering terror of those moments still haunted him.\"In situations like this, even the most tenacious mind would not be able to keep going. So, Kobayashi and I took turns leading, giving each other time to rest. Asano Naoto, on the other hand, was already out of the game - the supposedly bravest racer in all of Tokyo's willpower had been completely destroyed, and he was shivering behind us. But then, suddenly, an accident that no one expected took place!\"As we were approaching the halfway point of the course, I heard the sound of a truck's horn blaring from the road ahead. I was about to change lanes when Asano Naoto's GT-R suddenly overtook me, forcing me to stay on the left lane. I tried to increase speed, but he kept staying on my right! I could sort of guess what he was thinking at that time - his performance today was horrible; if he loses this race, all that reputation he had built for himself throughout the years would be destroyed, so he had an evil thought\u2026Asano Naoto was determined to get me killed. He left me with very little time, and I was devastated! I thought that my time was over. Kobayashi rammed his Lexus hard into Asano Naoto's GT-R! I didn't see it coming. The next moment, both their cars lost control, and Asano Naoto's GT-R went under the truck's chassis, ramming the truck sideways! It then fell on Kobayashi's Lexus! It was the most gruesome\u2026 I didn't dare look at it. The top of the Lexus had caved in completely, and there was black smoke billowing out the front of the car.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wanted to\u2026 get down the car to check on him, but I heard police sirens coming from the opposite. I was scared, so I didn't stay. I turned the car around and left the highway.\"\"What happened to the two of them?\" Ameko asked, disturbed.\"I only found out about what happened to them in the news. The reporter said that two juvenile delinquents were racing against the traffic on the highway and hit an oncoming truck. One died, and the other was injured. The wounded driver was receiving first aid in the emergency room\u2026 but he passed away three days later.\"\"Was the wounded person Kobayashi or\u2026\"\"It was Asano Naoto. Other than being known for being the best racing driver Nerima, he also had another identity\u2014his uncle was the vice president of Tokyo's largest yakuza clan, Oni Hitomi 1.\"\"Oh, no wonder! Is that why you quit the racing world and changed your name?\"\"Yes. That was not a public race. No one else other than the three of us knew about it. Even though there were other eye-witnesses on that highway, the visibility was abysmal, and we were driving against traffic. With all that fuzzy testimonies, the police were unable to determine if there was a third vehicle. Afraid that I would be imprisoned and that Oni Hitomi would take revenge, I\u2026 chose to keep quiet again.\"There was no joy in my heart to escape punishment. Every day after that day, I have been living in guilt for Kobayashi. If I hadn't let my emotions affect my decision, and stick to my decision that the race that should never have started in the first place, all these would not have happened! I was the one who had one foot in the grave! But the irony is that the first person to die among the three of us was the only person who voted against having the race\u2026 I went to his home secretly after that. His father passed away when he was younger, and he only had his mother and a sister. After what happened, they moved away from Tokyo.\"\"You met mum after that, right? If that's the case, why didn't you stay?\" Ameko asked.\"I was always anxious after that accident; I couldn't even sleep at all, and I also kept a suicide note by my pillow. But as time passed, when I realized that neither the police nor the Oni Hitomi found me, I thought that it was all over. So, I resumed my healthy life. It was then that I met the woman I loved. We were like every other happy couple\u2014we became a family. A year and a half later, we had you. I swore that I would never drive again and opened a seafood shop.\"After initial struggles, the shop did pretty well. At first, it seemed like I was heading on the right path; it had been 6 years since the incident, enough time to forget many things. I never thought that one day, that year, my nightmare would find me again.\"\"What do you mean?\" Ameko asked.\"One night, while I was sorting out the orders alone in the shop, a stone suddenly flew in through the window, shattering the glass! I thought it was some prankster, but when I ran out to chase him away, I didn't see anyone. When I returned to the shop after that, I realized that the stone was wrapped in old newspapers. The front-page article was about the highway accident that year. Next to the headline, there were words written in blood\u2014Did you really think you could escape?\"Takeda Tetsuya flicked off the ashes on his cigarette. \"No one else other than the three of us knew what actually happened that day. Kobayashi\u2026 died at the scene that day. Asano Naoto was in the ICU for three days. His injuries were severe. The papers said that he was unconscious, but that did not eliminate the possibility that he might have woken up for some time\u2026 Anyway, from the moment the newspaper article appeared, my life was over.\"\"So, you weren't actually addicted to gambling\u2014you just wanted to make mum divorce you?\"\"I made a mistake 6 years ago, involving Kobayashi in the race. I will not make the same mistake again.\" Takeda Tetsuya said quietly. \"I'm not afraid of death\u2014it's the ending that I deserve! The real Yosuke Tsuchiya died with Kobayashi on that road. The Takeda Tetsuya that lived on was just his guilt and weakness.\"\"I'm actually more curious about how you were able to escape Oni Hitomi again and again,\" said Zhang Heng.\"If you were asking about that time many years ago, maybe they were hoping to see me miserable, or perhaps they wanted to prolong my torment. The thing was, they did not come looking for me until nine months ago when I received a mysterious phone call saying that the Oni Hitomi would be coming for me soon. He told me to get ready, also telling me about what happened last night.\" Takeda Tetsuya paused. \"Alright. I've finished telling my story. As I've said, this has nothing to do with any of you! That tragedy happened because of me, so it's only right that I end it myself.\"\"You don't even believe that,\" Zhang Heng noted. \"Or else, you wouldn't have pretended to be a gambler again and force Ameko to cut off everything with you.\"Takeda Tetsuya kept quiet. Then after a moment, he smiled, \"I have to, at the very least, try. I can't just do nothing, right?\"The seafood shop owner looked like he had already made up his mind. Ameko began to panic. She opened her mouth to say something but blushed instead.Zhang Heng got up and picked up the coat next to him. \"You were the one who taught me how to drive. No matter what kind of person you were, at least let me send you off.\"Takeda Tetsuya thought about it, not refusing the offer. Instead, he looked at Zhang Heng in the eye and said, \"Take good care of Ameko for me.\"The three left the eatery with Takeda Tetsuya walking in front. He had just opened the door to the minivan when his eyes suddenly rolled to the back of his head, and he collapsed into the carriage.Zhang Heng retracted the soup bowl he was holding and told the dumbstruck Ameko, \"His guilt over what happened in the past is overshadowing his judgment. He's not thinking of managing the situation. He only has a deathwish. I'm sorry. This is the only way to keep him calm for a while.\"\"Ah? Ah\u2026Oh.\" It took Ameko a minute to come to her senses. She was puzzled about why Zhang Heng had pinched her hand so flippantly when she was just about to speak. Apparently, she had misunderstood him.But the strange thing was\u2026 Ameko came to the realization that she wasn't repulsed by these things. Not as she initially imagined.Ameko was still deep in her thoughts when she heard Zhang Heng saying, \"This car does not have insurance and has not been inspected. We better leave this place first.\"\"Mm.\" She climbed into the van and shut the door.Zhang Heng started the car, then deliberately took the same route twice to make sure no one was following them. Fifteen minutes later, he parked the L300 in the parking lot of a supermarket. He opened the door and stretched out his right hand.\"There're a few problems with Takeda\u2026 your father's story.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She thanked Zhang Heng and jumped down.\"You're saying that he was lying?\"\"No. I just think that there are some parts of his story that need deliberating.\" Zhang Heng locked the car doors and then took the lift up to the supermarket. \"The thing I find most curious the Oni Hitomi's attitude towards him. If it's really as he said, and Asano Naoto did wake up in the hospital and told his own uncle about the race, it made no sense that the Oni Hitomi did not go looking for him. The need for revenge is the strongest when there's been a recent death in the family.\"\"Hmm, maybe they couldn't find him? Didn't he live incognito right after that accident?\"\"If that is the case, then how do you explain the stone that was thrown into his window six years later?\" Zhang Heng said. \"Especially that warning written in blood\u2014forgive me for being frank, but that did not sound like language that a strict organization like the gokudo 1would use.\"Ameko pondered on what her friend was saying. \"It does sound like you're right, but I'm sure that the people who burned the shop and kidnapped me were the Oni Hitomi.\"Zhang Heng shook his head. \"Again, the timing of their appearance is just weird. It's been over 20 years since that accident on the highway. Why would they suddenly choose to take revenge now? And who was that mystery guy who called him? Someone from Oni Hitomi? Why help your father? Your father's not stupid. He should be able to notice these problems, but his brain is refusing to think! That's why we need to investigate this.\"\"But we don't have any connection with those people from back then,\" Ameko anxiously said.\"No, right now we're close to a breakthrough. If Asano Naoto woke up from his coma, the attending nurses and doctors who attended would know who visited him. We just need to track down the team that rescued him to find out who he came into contact with during that period.\" Zhang Heng pushed the shopping cart to the rack displaying tapes. \"But before we do that, we need to keep your father quiet.\"\u2026They bought 10 rolls of black tape and 2 bundles of climbing rope. Taking them back to the minivan, they bound Takeda Takashi. Under Ameko's instructions, Zhang Heng drove the L300 to an apartment.\"This is my cousin's place. She's an air stewardess. International flights. She's rarely ever home. She gave me the keys so I could help water her plants on the terrace whenever I'm free. No one would find this place,\" said Ameko as she pushed the door open.The apartment was small but well-equipped and furnished, tidy, and well-kept.Zhang Heng dragged the Takeda Tetsuya, who was wrapped in the blanket onto the bed. The buffer they had since the soup bowl was now over. The man was now half-awake to the apartment, eyes wide open, and gagging through the tape trying to speak.\"Even if you're really going to seek your death, you need to give us some time. At least don't just die so dubiously, or else Kobayashi's sacrifice would have been for nothing.\"Zhang Heng did not care if the seafood store owner heeded his advice or not. As long as he was still wrapped up like a dumpling, there was nothing he could do even if he disagreed.Ameko apologized to her father and, with Zhang Heng's help, used the remaining rope to secure Takeda Tetsuya onto the bed so that he would not roll-off. When they were done, they drove to the Tokyo Metropolitan Library, a public library located in Minami-Azabu of Minato City. Constructed in 1973 with a total holding of approximately 1.8 million volumes, it was free and open to the public.Zhang Heng and Ameko had come to look up newspaper articles about the accident on the highway racing that caused the death of two young men, a brutal incident at any given time.Practically all major newspapers covered that accident. So, they just needed to find the exact date to locate the corresponding articles.Ameko was only on the second paper when she found Kurobe Saburo, the doctor in charge of treating Asano Naoto. Asahi Shimbun 1 had conducted an interview with him.Zhang Heng looked up the name on the internet and found that Dr. Kurobe Saburo had left his position in the public hospital to become the vice president of a private hospital\u2014this was going to be a bit of a problem. People at this level were very busy and vigilant, not exactly approachable.Ameko looked through another dozen of newspapers with the same date and even found scanned articles in the library's system. Eventually, she came across a new finding from a local tabloid that had already been discontinued. \"Zhang-san, do you think this is useful?\"She stepped aside to let her companion look at the screen. These past nine months, Zhang Heng had not only honed his driving skills but had also worked on his language. Other than attending classes, he also spent every free minute strengthening his vocabulary. His hard work was finally paying off. He could now communicate in Japanese, and as long as the words the newspapers used were not too technical, he was able to understand most of it.\"Hayami Rinko. Is she the nurse?\" Zhang Heng was drawn to a stern-looking elderly lady.\"Yes. She has been working in the hospital for 32 years. It said that Asano Naoto was in a critical condition when he was admitted. Since she was the most experienced nurse in the hospital, she was assigned to his case, not sleeping for 2 days and 2 nights. Unfortunately, in the end, they were unable to save him. If we look at her age\u2026 She's probably retired by now.\"\"Let's find Dr. Kurobe Saburo first. If not, we'll have to find Hayami Rinko.\" Zhang Heng decided.As they had expected, it was not easy getting Kurobe Saburo. As an expert surgeon in Tokyo, his many different numbers were published online, but the person answering the phone was his female assistant.Even though the person on the other end was polite, she was firm and unyielding about not being able to set up an appointment for them. President Kurobe Saburo's timetable was fully booked until the end of the month. Zhang Heng and Ameko decided to wait for the doctor in front of the hospital building he was working in. After two hours of waiting, they finally spotted him.Meeting him for only a few minutes, Kurobe Saburo claimed that he did not remember much about what happened that year. After one or two questions, he already appeared irritated. Opening the door to his black Mercedes, he snapped, \"If there's anything else, you can look for my assistant. I have an appointment with a few friends from the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.\"Zhang Heng did not press the man for more information. Kurobe Saburo was not a small potato, the likes of Takeda Tetsuya. If he were to go missing or be forced into confession, it would draw a lot of attention. Also, this guy might genuinely not recall the incident. A specialist like him sometimes would have to perform more than a dozen operations in a day. After leaving the operating table, he would be so tired that he might even forget his name.Ameko watched the Mercedes leave and then turned to Zhang Heng. \"So, what now?\"Let's try Hayami Rinko. She worked for the hospital for decades. Someone must surely know where she went after her retirement.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She and Zhang Heng found a place to have a quick lunch, then hurried to the public hospital that Asano Naoto was sent to.After making an inquiry at the visitor registration counter, they received confirmation that Hiromi Rinko no longer worked there. But when a passing nurse heard the name, she stopped to tell them, \"She used to work here, but she has retired. When I first came here, I was not doing well. She encouraged me and gave me guidance! Why are you looking for her?\"Zhang Heng lifted the fruit basket in his hand and said, \"My father was involved in a horrific car accident a long time ago\u2014it was Hiromi Rinko's aunt who helped him recover. We just want to thank her.\"This was quite common in hospitals around here. A large number of patients and their family members would continuously return to thank the doctors and nurses. There was no reason for the head nurse to suspect these two young people.She tore a piece of paper and scribbled an address on it. \"Thank goodness we met. Rinko senpai 1 lives here now.\"\"Taihaku Nursing Home?\" Ameko read the address on the paper.\"Yes\u2026 Senpai never got married and didn't have any children. Ever since she retired, she volunteered to do charity work there. She wanted to keep making contributions in her sunset years, and also find herself a resting place for the future,\" the nurse said, brimming with admiration.Zhang Heng gratefully thanked her and took the subway with Ameko to the nursing home in the suburb. With the help of caretakers there, they were able to quickly locate Hiromi Rinko.The former nurse was teaching an elderly who had lost most of his hearing how to arrange flowers. When she saw the two young people approaching her, there was a hint of suspicion in her eyes, but she still nodded at them.Five minutes later, Hiromi Rinko helped the elderly man settle down before walking over to Ameko and Zhang Heng. \"Who are you?\"Perhaps it was the nature of her occupation; the Hiromi Rinko in the picture carried a stern appearance, with a military rigidness about her. Zhang Heng was worried that she would not be easy to communicate with, but upon meeting her in person, he realized that she was much more easygoing than he had imagined her to be.Zhang Heng passed the fruit basket to her as they seated themselves on the sofa.\"We're here to find out about something. Do you still remember that horrible accident 22 years ago? Two young men were racing cars against traffic when one of them ran into a truck. One died instantly, and the other was severely wounded. His name was\u2026\"\"Asano Naoto,\" Hiromi Rinko cut in. \"I remember that. But not because it was all over the news, but because that boy was so young. He was battling the Shinigami, and you could see that he really did not want to leave this world! Unfortunately, I couldn't help him.\"Zhang Heng and Ameko shared a look between them. \"We heard that you were with him the whole time. We\u2026 we are his family. We just want to know if anyone visited him or if he asked to see anyone when he was awake.\"No, you're not his family.\" Hiromi Rinko shook her head. It was as if she could see through them.Ameko's face grew hot under the old nurse's steely gaze.Zhang Heng, on the other hand, was calm. \"Distant family.\"Hiromi Rinko smiled and did not question them anymore about this question. \"If you were asking about other people, without their consent or the family's consent, I'm not at liberty to tell you. But he\u2026 people other apart from the media are rarely concerned about him.\"\"What do you mean?\"\"Asano Naoto, that's a very lonely child. In the three days he spent in the hospital, his grandfather only came to see him once. I heard that his parents had already cut off all relations with him by then\u2026 oh, and uhh\u2026 I think he had an uncle who sent two men to guard the door. He never actually went in.\"\"So, no one cared at all?\" Zhang Heng and Ameko were a little taken aback by the nurse's answer.Hiromi Rinko sighed. \"In our line of work, it's normal to see deaths. But it was a real heartbreak to see such a young boy leave this world in such a lonely way. In the end, he lost all the will to recover. I don't know if you can call that lucky.\"______Ameko left Taihaku Nursing Home with a blank look on her face. Not a single part of it had been like what she'd imagined. After seeing Hiromi Rinko, everything became even murkier instead of clearing, as if a thick fog had emerged in front of them.Apparently, Asano Naoto's uncle did not care that much for his nephew. He did not even bother to take time out to visit his dying family\u2014now why would he suddenly think about avenging him after so many years?If it wasn't Oni Hitomi who set the seafood shop on fire, then who was it? Why would they come after Takeda Tetsuya, who had long since disappeared from the racing scene? Why pretend to be Oni Hitomi?\"No, this does not make sense at all,\" Zhang Heng said. \"From the looks of things, this person is trying to push your father into Oni Hitomi's snare! But if he knew about that, he could have just informed the Oni Hitomi and let them confront your father instead.\"They were now at a dead end. At the moment, they did not have any other leads. It was getting late, and the both of them were walking around on an empty stomach, considering they missed lunch. Ameko bought two family buckets from KFC, and then they returned to her cousin's cramped apartment.Once they got off the elevator, Ameko fumbled for the keys in her bag, but the expression on Zhang Heng's face caused her to look up.The door was ajar! It was only a small opening, but Zhang Heng remembered very clearly that they made sure to lock the door before leaving. Ameko might have normally been a little absent-minded, but she would never make a mistake like this.Ameko began to panic a little. She was worried that her father had been snatched into the jaws of Oni Hitomi. While Asano Naoto's uncle may not have been too upset about his nephew's death, but if the murderer did show up, he would never let him off the hook to save his own face as the organization's leader.Ameko was getting ready to barge into the room when Zhang Heng grabbed her by the arm!There was a siren going off in his mind. In the condition they left him in, there was no way Takeda Tetsuya could have freed himself from the ropes. He must have had help. Moreover, it was bizarre that the door had been left ajar as if inviting outsiders to come in and take a look.Before examining the situation in detail, Zhang Heng decided to take Ameko away from this place. The people inside the house, however, had heard their footsteps. In the next moment, someone burst through the door! From his clothes, it was apparent that he was an associate of the guys in the dark blue Voxy back at the seafood store.Zhang Heng never learned taekwondo before, but had been training in the gym and was much stronger than the average person. By the time the guy reached into his pockets, Zhang Heng was already standing in front of Ameko, throwing a punch at the man's face! The guy staggered and stumbled backward into the house, disoriented.Ever since he graduated from elementary school, Zhang Heng had never hit anyone. So, he too was stunned by the punch he had just thrown. This, however, was not the time to think about how strong he'd become. It was imperative that he exploited this temporary win and find out if the perpetrator was carrying a gun. He was about to pounce on the man and continued to fight him when suddenly, the cold and unmistakable nozzle of a gun pressed against the back of his head!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When someone finally peeled the blindfold off his eyes, he saw that they had brought him to an abandoned factory.Zhang Heng's head was still a little foggy. After subdued outside the apartment, he was forced into a vehicle and then blindfolded. He could not tell what was happening around him except by the amount of time it took for them to travel in the car, they were still in Tokyo, but probably somewhere in the suburbs.He was careless, he knew that. In reality, no matter how calm and how watchful he was, this was the first time he was involved in something like this and was bound to make mistakes. The person who took them clearly pulled some dirty tricks to find the apartment.As if he read Zhang Heng's mind, a guy with a crew cut pulled out a black tracking device the size of a bubble-gum from Ameko's bag.They probably put that in there when they kidnapped her with the blue Toyota. As Ameko was unconscious then, she would not have known what they did. On top of that, the tracking device was well hidden. Unless she had searched every inch of her bag, it would have been difficult to notice.Zhang Heng cocked his brows. \"Where is Ameko?\"The people who took them split them up at the apartment. They were probably transported in different cars too. Zhang Heng had not seen her since then.\"Think about your own plight first!\" The crew cut gut snarled, giving Zhang Heng the stink eye.Zhang Heng recognized the guy.It was the guy he punched at the door\u2014no wonder he was showing Zhang Heng the attitude.\"Heh, now we can settle our account!\" The crew cut guy put down the tracking device and rolled up his sleeves eagerly.Just then, a deep, sonorous voice said from behind, \"Alright! That's enough for now. Let me talk to him.\"\"Yes, Boss.\" The crew cut guy's demeanor quickly changed. He bowed to the man who had just walked in and promptly disappeared.A short man stepped in front of Zhang Heng, grabbed the nearest stool and plopped himself down. \"It was never our organization's idea to involve you and Ms. Ameko in this. I apologize on behalf of our organization.\"Zhang Heng simply kept quiet.\"22 years ago, our Executive Vice President, he\u2026 and Tsuchiya Yosuke, er, which is also Mr. Takeda Tetsuya, had a little grudge. He sent me here to take care of things. The plan was to throw Tsuchiya Yosuke into the sea and feed him to the sharks, but Mr. Executive vice president had a sudden change of mind and decided to give him a chance. The executive v.p's exact words were 'The grievances between racing drivers should be resolved in the ways of a racing driver,\" the squat man said.\"So, I've painstakingly set up a stage for Tsuchiya Yosuke. I'll still need one more person to play the supporting role, though. It was giving a headache because Mr. Tsuchiya Yosuke is not exactly everybody's favorite, and even after so many years, he didn't make any friends at all. I heard that for nearly half a year, you have been delivering goods for him. So? Are you interested in joining the fun?\"\"Are there any other options apart from me?\" Zhang Heng asked calmly. Even though the guy looked gentler than his associate, Zhang Heng understood that the man did not really want to know his opinion.\"I like talking to smart people\u2014it saves me a lot of time.\" The man took out a dagger, walked behind Zhang Heng and cut off the rope binding his hands. \"The game is simple. Whichever one of you wins this competition, I will let the three of you go. But if you lose\u2026 trust me, you don't want to know what happens.\"Zhang Heng stretched his arms. He considered attacking the man, grabbing the knife, and make him a hostage, but when he spotted the two towering men guarding the door, he gave up the idea. There was no way out of this situation.\"How many will be racing? Where is it? What are the rules?\"\"Don't worry, you'll know when the time comes. First, relax, and choose your car!\" The man said, clapping loudly.The guards at the door walked to the center of the factory to a covered mound. The men removed the covering and revealed the cars underneath. There were 5 in total: a red Nissan 180SX, a silver BMW M5, a gray Mercedes AMG GT, a yellow Dodge Viper, and a blue Ford F-150 Raptor.\"These cars have been modified with some performance enhancements. You can choose to drive the one you like best. If you're not happy with it, you can retune it yourself. We can provide you with the parts. The competition is tonight at midnight. So, do any of these cars catch your eye?\" The man asked. He did not leave right after, though, as if curious about what decision Zhang Heng was going to make.To his surprise, the boy took only one look at the cars and then looked away. \"I'm sorry, can I drive my own car?\"\"Your own car? What is it? Porsche 911? Aston Martin? Ferrari?\"\"A 1982 second-generation Mitsubishi L300,\" Zhang Heng answered. \"It's parked just downstairs of the apartment where your men took me.\"\"A civilian van?!\" The man's eyes widened.Zhang Heng nodded. After the substantial modification he had done to the L300, the van was completely unrecognizable. Sure its performance had soared, but it was in no way comparable to a racecar. The man was not only generous\u2014the five cars that he offered Zhang Heng were undoubtedly good. In fact, he was even willing to allow Zhang Heng to tune it up to his liking to prove that he did not sabotage them.Zhang Heng knew that no matter how good the cars were, the best car for him was the car he was most familiar with.\"That's a reasonable request that I can fulfill, but are you sure?\" The man asked again.Zhang Heng nodded.The short man signaled to his men, and a few more walked in to bring the cars away. Then he looked Zhang Heng in the eye and said, \"We shall see each other tonight, then.\"This time, Zhang Heng was left alone in the abandoned factory. There was water and food on the table, probably for replenishing his energy. Other than that, there was a gaming console in the corner of the room for him to pass the time. This was too good a treatment for a kidnap victim, and because of that, Zhang Heng was increasingly convinced that this race was not an impromptu, last-minute attempt.This guy had clearly planned all of this for a very long time now. Those associates of his probably did not have any professional training, but because they came in numbers, it would be an unrealistic proposition even if the seafood store owner and Ameko were to force their way out. Moreover, his phone had been taken away, and he had no way of contacting the world outside.For now, all he could do now was just eat a little something and wait for the competition to start.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Heng also saw Ameko in the blue Toyota Voxy, her wrists and legs bound and her mouth sealed with tape. When she saw him, she began to struggle but the doors were quickly slammed shut!\"Mr. Yosuke, I've allowed you to see your daughter as you have requested. We can start now, can we?\" The short man asked.Yosuke Tsuchiya said nothing as he entered the Dodge Viper.The short man broke into a smile at this. After that, he came up to Zhang Heng and said, \"You asked me how many people will be joining the race tonight, where it's held and what the rules are\u2014I'll tell you now\u2014tonight, the three of us will be racing here on this highway! Death racing rules! Considering you may be unfamiliar with what happened 22 years ago, I will give you a brief explanation. The three of us will be driving against traffic on this highway. The person who reaches the finishing point first wins. Of course, it would be boring if it was just that, so I've decided to add a small restriction. The windshields on all three cars have been frosted, and the windows cannot be wound down.\"The short man took out a wrench and smashed the front of the Nissan 180SX!\"I've always thought that the lights on cars are useless. Better just get rid of it!\" As soon as he said that, his men broke the lights on the L300 and the Viper as well. Then, the short man opened the car door and grinned at Zhang Heng. \"One last thing\u2026 if you want to use the toilet, you better go now. The doors will be welded shut, and it'll only be opened when you reach the destination.\"Zhang Heng had already figured out back in the factory, that something like that was going to happen. Now that it was in front of him, he could not help but think that the man had lost his mind\u2014especially when he sat in the driver's seat of the L300 and saw the blurry windshield in front of him. He could not even make out a silhouette from 2 meters away.Outside, people were already working on welding the car doors shut, even on the Nissan 180SX that the short man was driving. His voice spoke from the intercom in front of the passenger seat. \"So? Does it bring back happy memories, Mr. Yosuke?\"Yosuke Tsuchiya did not answer. But from the sound of his breathing, Zhang Heng could tell that he was not as calm as he appeared to be. After a while, Takeda Tetsuya spoke, \"Follow closely behind me.\"Zhang Heng knew that that was meant for him. In a situation like this, the person driving in front was at the highest risk. On top of that, the set-up now was even scarier than it was 22 years ago. Takeda Tetsuya had not touched the steering wheel for over 20 years\u2014he was not in the best shape.In fact, at only 3 minutes into the race, Takeda Tetsuya nearly ran into an oncoming Buick! Good thing he had a firm handle on the steering wheel, which kept the Viper from toppling over. Less than half a minute later, however, he nearly hit the divider at a curve!The short man's laughter crackled over the intercom. \"What is it, Mr. Yosuke? That's the best you can do? We're not even a tenth of the way into the race yet!\"Takeda Tetsuya kept quiet. Right now, he could barely even talk. Beads of sweat were dripping down the tip of his nose onto his jeans.The visibility was abysmal, to say the least. It was in the middle of the night, their cars had no headlights, and the view through the frosted windows was all but a murky blur. Owing to this, they could only use the lights from oncoming cars to determine their position. It was extremely exhausting, and his eyes and mind were already stretched to their limit.Takeda Tetsuya did not know how much longer he could keep this up. Just as his breathing became more frenzied, the L300 that was behind him suddenly accelerated and overtook him.Zhang Heng's voice came from the intercom, \"My turn to take the lead! You rest for a little while. We'll swap places after 4 minutes.\"Takeda Tetsuya wanted to refuse the offer, but he was already overexerting himself, and Zhang Heng's calm voice sounded particularly trustworthy in this loony race.The boy was not trying to show off by stepping up. Such a race tested observational skills and the ability to react appropriately. A younger person, undoubtedly, had the edge in this regard.More importantly, luck should be on his side tonight.Zhang Heng took out the lucky rabbit's foot from his pocket and hung it on the rear-view mirror.He may be the least skilled driver among the three, but with the mechanics of the race today, luck was the decisive factor that actually had the absolute power.For a whole two minutes, Zhang Heng did not come across a single car.Then the short man spoke again, \"That year during the race\u2014did Mr. Yosuke hide behind his team members like this?\"A look of embarrassment flashed across Takeda Tetsuya's face. Zhang Heng could see from his rear-view mirror that the yellow Dodge was beginning to sway, which meant that Takeda Tetsuya was getting unnerved.The seafood store owner smiled sadly. \"If you want to avenge Asano Naoto, you should just settle it with me! Why did you have to drag other people into this?!\"The short man sniffed. \"Wasn't your enmity with Asano Naoto embroiled because of someone else?\"Zhang Heng's eyes widened. His suspicions were finally confirmed!\"You\u2026 You're not taking revenge for Asano Naoto, but Kobayashi?\"There was a heavy silence on the other end of the intercom.A minute later, the short man said, \"Not bad! You were able to guess my intention.\"\"You pretended to be Oni Hitomi to kidnap Ameko so you could force him to join this race! It was not just the three people who knew about that competition\u2014Kobayashi told this to his mother? No, that's impossible! No one would ever tell things like that to their mothers. So\u2026 his sister\u2026 what's your relationship with his sister?\"The three modified vehicles sped across the highway~Precisely 2 minutes and 42 seconds later, Zhang Heng spotted the first oncoming car! He flicked the steering, letting loose the tail of the van with the L300 narrowly drifting past!Even then, Zhang Heng was unusually composed. He suddenly thought about something completely absurd. \"Wait a minute\u2014you're\u2026 Kobayashi's sister?\"When he first met the man, Zhang Heng had noticed that his movement was a little awkward. Other than the fact that his height and dimensions were closer to a woman's, he was also the only one who did not reveal his tattoos. This 'guy' spent so much effort pretending to be Oni Hitomi. But unlike the other guys, this short man never showed off his tattoo\u2014maybe because he feared people would notice the absence of Adam's apple.To disguise his voice, on the other hand, was simple. Every one of them wore masks, so it was only a matter of using a voice changer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/48 Hours a Day48 Hours a Day Chapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50: Tokyo Drift XX\"There were three people in that race, but only you survived. I examined the remains\u2026 of my brother's car. I noticed not only was the roof that was caved in, but there were also marks on the body of the car from the impact. Its tires were severely damaged. But even until his final moment, he was gripping the steering wheel firmly, trying to steer his car. With his skills, except for external interference, there's no way he could've lost control that way,\" the short 'man' hissed. \"You were his best friend, one of the three people involved in the race! Then you disappeared! How dare you say that day had nothing to do with you at all?\"There was a pained look in Takeda Tetsuya's eyes as he said, \"You're right. Your brother died all because of me. It was my fault.\"\"That being the case, tonight, you'll pay for his life!\" The short 'man' announced before cutting off the walkie talkie.Zhang Heng kept quiet.He pointed out the 'man's' identity so that both of them could communicate and resolve their dissent. From a third party's view, Takeda Tetsuya did share part of the blame. Kobayashi, however, had also decided to save his friend, which eventually led to his death.Blaming his death entirely on Takeda Tetsuya was just ludicrous. Even blaming everything on Asano Naoto was not wholly fair either, because the person he was attacking was actually Takeda Tetsuya. Perhaps unpleasant to hear, but the thing that killed Kobayashi was loyalty to his friend.Zhang Heng did not wish for Takeda Tetsuya to make up some moving touching story\u2014he simply needed to tell the whole truth. At least, that could have removed a portion of misunderstanding between them. Zhang Heng underestimated how much that accident affected the seafood store owner. Kobayashi's death was his greatest regret.All these years, Tetsuya had been like a prisoner to his past, waiting for this long-overdue judgment day. To add, from the way he saw it, Kobayashi's sister was a punishment by the gods. If it were not for saving his daughter, he would have given up long ago.Even so, Zhang Heng could sense that Takeda Tetusya's fighting spirit was steadily declining at a rate visible to the naked eye.In contrast, the short 'man' at the back who had been following quietly behind them was burning with spite after that last conversation.The red Nissan 180SX picked up speed and was head to head with the Dodge Viper!\u2014history always had a way of repeating itself.The short 'man' forced Takeda Tetsuya to the far-right lane on the highway. Even though she had never seen the race that took place 22 years ago, she was making the exact same decision as Asano Naoto.Coincidentally, a car was also coming towards them, but it was on the third lane, so it merely went past the three cars.Zhang Heng knew that they could not go on like this. Right now, they were almost a third of the way. Takeda Tetsuya was not getting any luckier, and his mental state was deteriorating. Sooner or later, he was going to make a mistake. So, Zhang Heng switched lanes and deliberately slowed down.The short 'man' did not pay much attention to the third car's maneuver\u2014Tonight was about settling her grudge against Takeda Tetsuya, and Zhang Heng was only a supporting actor in the grand scheme of things.But when the supposedly braking L300 suddenly accelerated and occupied the lane on her left, her attention was roused!In a sense, boxing-out was also a very dangerous move.Whether it was the Asano Naoto 22 years ago or the short 'man' today, using their cars to block Takeda Tetsuya also put them at risk of running into an oncoming vehicle. Compared to Takeda Tetsuya, who could neither move to the left nor the right, they had at least one vacant side.If there was any approaching danger, the short 'man' could swerve to the left lane, but since Zhang Heng had gotten involved, the situation was even more chaotic!\u2014the three of them were all stuck on their respective paths.In other words, it meant that if a car were to approach, one of them would inevitably be involved in the collision.Zhang Heng had intended to use this strategy to force the short 'man' to give up. As long as she kept decelerating and accelerating, Takeda Tetsuya would not lean in on her. Alas, the short 'man' was even more stubborn than Zhang Heng expected her to be.Even in a situation like this, she was still determined to drive the Viper into the corner as if to pressure Zhang Heng to give up first.This move might have worked on other people, but not Zhang Heng with his lucky rabbit's foot. Out of three people, his chances of crashing into another car was very low.Then as if to prove this point, a bright light flashed from the middle lane! Takeda Tetsuya took this opportunity to slow his car down to giving Nissan 180SX space to dodge the incoming vehicle. However, all this only caused the short 'man' to hesitate for a while.She had orchestrated all of this to take revenge on Takeda Tetsuya. But instead, if she were to be saved by him, how could she bring justice to what happened 22 years ago?As she weighed her options, the car coming from the opposite direction was already in front of her! Takeda Tetsuya did not have much time to think. Kobayashi died saving him, so no matter what, he could not let anything happen, his best friend's only sister!Takeda Tetsuya seemed to have awakened from his languid, enervate state; his eyes shone brightly, and in a fleeting 2 seconds, transformed back into that D1 champion who took over the European racing scene!Read the next chapter on our vipnovel.comThe Dodge driver quickly dropped gears, picked up speed, and leaned resolutely towards the Nissan 180SX's tail!Takeda Tetsuya used just the right amount of force to push the 180SX out of the way so that it missed the oncoming heavy-duty truck by a hair!The short 'man' proved to be an excellent driver as well. She immediately took control of her car, and while the body of the car grazed the divider creating bright sparks, the vehicle did not flip onto its side, even managing to avoid the heavy-duty truck!Takeda Tetsuya, on the other hand, was not as lucky. By forcing the Nissan to the side, the Viper took over the middle lane and was heading towards the truck in place of the short 'man'!The next moment, however, a beat-up L300 appeared suddenly like a ghost, tumbling into the Dodge!In the minivan, Zhang Heng took a deep breath and pulled the handbrake.At that split second, it felt as if time was standing still.With the front of the heavy-duty truck as the center, both the Viper and the L300 sliced a beautiful arc from the inertia! The L300 drifted from the right to the left lane, while Takeda's Dodge Viper went under the heavy-duty truck on its side!Was this the end?The short 'man' looked startled! Watching the retribution that she had planned for over 20 years unfolding before her eyes, she neither felt relieved nor gratified.She was still replaying the scene in her mind when the Viper struck the back of her car.Suddenly, she understood why her brother had died in that race that never should have taken place. The same guilt that Takeda Tetsuya experienced back then now filled her.If she could, she would exchange everything she had to go back to the time before everything happened!\u2026As if in response to her wish, the Dodge Viper miraculously scuttled from under the heavy-duty truck. Except for scratches on the roof, it was mostly unscathed!\"You're welcome!\" Zhang Heng's voice sounded over the intercom.\"I didn't plan to thank you!\" Takeda Tetsuya snapped! \"You got your angles all wrong. If I hadn't corrected the speed, I would have ended up under the wheel!\"The short 'man' opened her mouth to say something but caught herself when Zhang Heng said over the intercom, \"No matter how much the both of you have to talk about, let's finish this race first. I really need to pee!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though he had been training in Tokyo for 9 months, his driving skills were still nowhere nearly as excellent as the professional racing driver Takeda Tetsuya, the man who was only one race away from the Drift King title.This became even more apparent during the second half of the journey when Takeda Tetsuya had gotten the hang of the mechanics of the car and began to rediscover the form he was in back in the day.Putting his life on the line for Kobayashi's little sister did not cancel out the guilt he felt over his best friend's death. After that near-death experience, he had, at least, redeemed himself, and redressed a good portion of his self-condemnation.Zhang Heng would not be able to triumph over Takeda Tetsuya, who was in this state.On top of that, there was Kobayashi's sister, who had been planning this for 22 years, and whose driving skills were just as competent as her brother's. Not only did she possess that meticulous quality a woman possessed, but she also inherited Kobayashi's intrepidity.However, someone once said, 'Having a good opponent would bring out the best in you.'Encouraged by his two competitors, Zhang Heng gave 150% of his ability. The L300 turned into a mustard phantom zipping in the darkness.In the end, however, he was still one step behind.But when they were drawing near the finishing line, the Nissan 180SX and the Viper suddenly slowed down and as if on cue, giving each other deference. Zhang Heng did not care about any of that, so the minivan zoomed past Takeda Tetsuya and Kobayashi Yu, taking first place.When he reached the finish, a series of notification rang in his ears.[You have won an underground street race!\u2014Mission complete!][To return after 134 days][Successfully defeated a professional racecar driver: +15 game points. You may refer to the character panel to view the corresponding information][Successfully defeated the best racing driver in this edition, Yosuke Tsuchiya: +25 game points. You may refer to the character panel to view the corresponding information][Successfully completed one death racing mode: +10 game points. You may refer to the character panel to view the corresponding information]\u2026Yosuke Tsuchiya was the best driver in the Tokyo Drift edition. That came as no surprise to Zhang Heng. The fact that Kobayashi Yu was a professional racing driver, on the other hand, bewildered him as female professional racing drivers were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.It was no wonder, though, that she dared take on a one-versus-two challenge. Her skills may have been slightly weaker than Takeda Tetsuya's. Considering how disheartened the latter was before the near-accident, and if Zhang Heng was out of the picture, it would have been had to say which one would win.In reality, when compared side-to-side according to their skills, it would be out of the question for Zang Heng to win. But after everything that had happened along the way, the atmosphere of hostility was extinguished. There was a silver lining amidst all the complications, helping Zhang Heng to complete his primary mission.The rewards that came along with it were so much more generous than he had expected. The race alone earned him 50 game points. Combined with the 6 points he gained throughout the game, a total of 56 game points had now been collected.Kobayashi Yu and Takeda Tetsuya talked to each other through the night. No one knew what they were talking about, but on the second day, the two of them visited Kobayashi Ryo's grave to pay their respects.Two days after, Kobayashi Yu and her racing friends who had helped her left Tokyo.Two months later, Ameko's exchange student application was approved.Zhang Heng had driven her to the airport himself. She was about to embark on a one-year learning trip in China.There was still some time before departure, so Ameko requested for coffee. Zhang Heng bought two cups of coffee from the Starbucks nearby. As he was handing it over to the girl, something soft nudged his lips.Ameko was clearly very nervous. This was her first time doing something like this, so she was a little clumsy and timid; their lips only touching for a brief second.\"Come find me when you get back to China,\" Ameko whispered softly.That kiss had spent all of her courage, so instead of waiting for Zhang Heng to reply, she picked up her luggage and quickly made her way to the check-in counter.Zhang Heng watched the girl disappear into the crowd, suddenly feeling that having the extra hours might not be a good thing\u2014the initially subtle feelings, with the passing of time, had slowly blossomed\u2026This was destined to be a promise that could never be fulfilled.Zhang Heng sat on one of the seats in the airport alone, deep in thought, and finished the two cups of coffee quietly.In whatever country, airports and train stations were always places brimming with a sea of emotions.The wobbling elderly grandmother sending off her grandchild who was studying abroad, fussing over his backpack; the four-year-old holding onto his mother's hand, waving goodbye to his father going overseas for work, not knowing that the next time they would meet again would be the following year; the girl who had just stepped down the plane running to her boyfriend's embrace in her heels.Then, at the same time, there were people rushing home, while the others leaving somewhere far away.After swallowing last drops of the warm coffee, Zhang Heng got up, pulled up the zip on his jacket, and stepped outside into the snow.\u2026After that race, Zhang Heng had basically stepped into leisure mode. He was getting pretty good at Japanese and even scored full marks for his first monthly exam, which earned him 3 game points. BHis most significant achievement, though, was that woodcarving, the second game item he found a month before.The one thing that had been bothering him was other than the racer workshop, it was common for societies to recruit new members every two months\u2014especially the two related to cars. The 4WD club and the auto show model photography club, which, like their names suggested, were a gathering of a group of ch\u016bniby\u014d 1 and gentries.Zhang Heng had joined, patiently remaining in the clubs for two months only to learn how to scream 'Shooting Star and Cannonball' at his own 4WD, and to determine by eye the model of a car from a picture, deduce bra sizes, and many other random strange skills.But Zhang Heng was still reluctant to give up because, according to his first game, whenever a cycle took place, he should have more than one valid option. After that, he decided to alter his thinking pattern, to stop focusing on organizations related to cars, but to broaden his search instead. So, he began paying attention to some of the more unusual groups.He thought about the altar that he had come across on the island and opted to join a club that studied mysterious happenings, and another that researched popular paranormal activity. Eventually, he discovered that his membership in the latter really did pleasantly surprise him.The woodcarving was a collection that belonged to the vice president of the club, who had claimed to have found it in Rakuten for only 500 Japanese Yen. There was nothing special about the carving\u2014it did not even have a face. But just like the rabbit's foot, when Zhang Heng picked it up, he heard the same announcement in his head: [Found a game item].He decided to buy it from the vice president, who was so happy that she presented it to Zhang Heng immediately, mainly because there were only three members in the club and the vice president valuing new members a lot. The woodcarving was not worth much anyway, so she was more than happy to give it away.So, that was how Zhang Heng got his hands on another game item, without having put in much effort.Although it was not difficult to get the game item, it was buried deep within the game. For other gamers who did have as much leisure time in the game like him, it would be tough for them to find hidden items like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He moved out of the dormitory of the International Exchange Hall and rented a small apartment outside the university.Takeda Tetsuya also taught him nearly everything he knew. Now, to improve his skills and technique, there was only continuous practice and relying on his talent. Improving his driving skills from level 2 to level 3 in a short period was quite impossible, so Zhang Heng did not invest too much effort into it.He participated in a couple of underground drifting competitions with his L300, earning him quite a bit of money. He even won an 80%-new Mazda. Unfortunately, no game points were credited for that.The money he made was enough to sustain him for the rest of his time in Tokyo, and since he would not be able to take it away with him, it was kind of pointless making more, so Zhang Heng did not continue racing. That mysterious mustard color van that appeared and vanished so suddenly eventually became a legend in the Tokyo underground racing world\u2026But that was a story for another day.Now that he no longer had to work or attend classes, Zhang Heng found himself with plenty of time. One day, while he was out traveling, he came across a gym, and he suddenly remembered that karate originated from Japan, derived from the combination of Japan's indigenous martial arts and Tang Shou Dao.Last time, when he fought the men who worked for Kobayashi Yu, he was able to confirm the effectiveness of his training in the gym. But the person he had fought was only a commoner. While Zhang Heng had the advantage of speed and strength, he was simply throwing punches without any proper technique. It dawned on him that he could use this opportunity to learn a little bit of karate.So, Zhang Heng spent the final two months achieving Level 0 in Karate skills.On the 420th day, he stood on the Sky Tower overlooking Tokyo, enjoying the night view for one last time. Then that familiar voice rung:[Return deadline arrived. Mission completed.][Tokyo Drift edition cleared! The second round has ended. Returning to reality\u2026]\u2026When Zhang Heng opened his eyes, he found himself back in the lounge booth. This time, the Tokyo Drift mission did not send him into some challenging situation isolated and far away from civilization. Still, after spending 14 months as an exchange student in another country, Zhang Heng found himself feeling an indescribable comfort and warmth hearing the language he was accustomed to.\"A glass of lemon water\u2014no\u2014give me something more flavorful,\" Zhang Heng walked up to the bar and had a brief flashback of the Tokyo girl with the snaggletooth smile.\"Congratulations on making it through the second round!\" The bartender lady masterfully mixed a glass of cocktail and pushed it in front of Zhang Heng. \"It looks like you've just completed a very unusual journey!\"\"Mm. Hey, I'd like you to help me identify something.\" Zhang Heng took out the woodcarving. After his first experience with the rabbit's foot, he made sure to come prepared with a pair of gloves to handle the woodcarving, be it inside or outside the game.The bartender's eyebrows rose at the sight of the game item. \"Another one? Aren't you a little too lucky?\"She picked up the woodcarving carefully and placed it inside a tulewood box, not forgetting to take 5 points from Zhang Heng.Zhang Heng sat at the bar as he finished his drink. When he was about to leave, the bartender called out to him, \"Do you still remember the year-end auction I told you about?\"\"Mmhmm?\"\"As usual, it will be held on the last day of the year. If you plan to participate in the auction, you better prepare in advance. Remember not to set the third game on that day,\" she reminded him.Zhang Heng thanked her and then left the lounge.\u2026The next day, Zhang Heng skipped English class in the morning. The second game had ended a little too late that by the time he left Sex and The City, already 4.30 am by then. He needed to make up for all the sleep he had lost.Then in the afternoon, as he was having lunch, Ma Wei and Chen Huadong gave him the same sympathetic look.\"You're screwed. Today, Old Zhang gave a random test in class. When he found out that 5 papers were missing from the stack, he threw a fit! The College English Test (CET) 1is only two weeks away\u2014he said that those who don't know what hard work is cannot be saved. The people who didn't take the test won't get any marks for their continuous assessment.\"In most universities, exams were usually separated into two parts: continuous assessment and a final exam. The latter made up 70% of the final score, while the former made up the other 30%. These two combined, made up the final grade.This 30% shouldn't be underestimated. It regularly determined if someone passed or failed a subject, either saving the person from failing or dooming a supposed pass to failure. Of course, the latter scenario was relatively rare. After all, there were no ongoing grudges between lecturers and students, so crackdowns on the students during the continuous assessments were uncommon.But if a person did not have any continuous assessment marks at all, it would be a severe problem. A student would have to score 86 out of 100 to get a credit, and English was a slightly more special subject, whereby the final results were graded based on the CET-4 and CET-6.\"710 is the full marks\u2014which means that to get a credit, you will need to score 609 points in the final exam.\" Ma Wei frowned. The passing mark for the CET-6 is 425 marks. For a non-English major, 600 points and above was usually considered a high score. Even a nerd like him did not have the full confidence to be able to achieve that, especially not English, which was a subject that Ma Wei was slightly struggling with.Zhang Heng was speechless. If he had known about it, he would have fought his sleepiness and gone to class. But it was too late for him now. He simply had to find a way to get a score of 609 and above. In fact, if he was previously presented with this problem, he would have thought that it was impossible. But having learned English from Bell back on the island, Zhang Heng felt that the situation was salvageable.It was about 20 days away from the College English Test. To him, that amounted to 40 days. When it came to his listening skills, there was nothing to worry about. The essay and grammar portions, though, still required some reinforcement.Zhang Heng did not expect to have to tackle English right after having to grapple with Japanese in Tokyo. Perhaps, taking up a job as a simultaneous translator after graduation was a good idea.\u2026Later that afternoon, Zhang Heng ran to the library to borrow some books to get cracking on English when he suddenly ran into Shen Xixi.Without Cheng Cheng harassing her all the time, peace had been restored to her life. Although they had exchanged numbers after the camping incident, neither of them made the first move to contact each other.They would often meet on campus, and Shen Xixi would greet him liberally, but they were only friends. On the contrary, Chen Huadong and Xu Jing quickly became close friends after that day. Even though there was still no confirmation that they romantically involved, but they had been hanging out together a lot lately, and it looked like success was on the horizon.Nowadays, Chen Huadong had forgone his games and no longer attended his anime club. Instead, he would spend his days shopping and walking around the streets with Xu Jing, betraying his club, Tiger Shark\u2014some loyal members even thought of burning him at stake\u2026Since they were both there by chance, Zhang Heng figured that he might as well go up to her and say hi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The warm sun rays lit up a side of her face, making her glow to the point that some guys sitting nearby were unable to focus on what they were doing.Zhang Heng forcefully quickened his pace, hoping Shen Xixi would look up to see him waving at her.Seeing him, Shen Xixi put down the book in her hand and smiled. Since they were in the library, they had to be quiet. As they were not allowed to talk, they did not say anything else to each other.Zhang Heng found the book that he wanted, so he waved at her to say goodbye, but before he walked out of the library, his eyes fell on the half-opened book in Shen Xixi's hand, catching a glimpse of the title, 'The Criminal Personality.'Of course, as someone who had read 'Bill of Quantitates for Water Drainage, Heating, and Gas Engineering,' he was not qualified to question others' personal reading preferences.But Zhang Heng had to admit that this girl's hobby was somewhat unique, especially with her incredible observational skills and reasoning skills. Did she plan to work in the criminal investigation field? But then again, she was studying public relations.He had simply acquainted with Shen Xixi and was not about to interfere with others' life choices, so Zhang Heng went to another floor to study. He was simply surprised to discover Shen Xixi's interest in topics of criminal investigation.In between, he dropped by the canteen to have dinner, then in the library until its closing. Since he was going to return in an hour, he did not take the grammar book with him but left it on the shelf.Done with the washing up and brushing teeth, Zhang Heng checked his inbox and found an email from the photography society informing him that his work was shortlisted for the 'urban impression theme' competition, which would be entered into the judge selection section. He would know the results in about a week.He had been so busy recently that he had nearly forgotten all about this\u2014joining the competition to see how much he had discovered. Making it through the intermediary contest was already meeting his expectations. As for getting the price money and rewards, it would be great if he got them, but even if he did not, he would have no problem with it.Zhang Heng browsed forums and posts on his phone to pass the time. Midnight came quickly, and silence filled the whole town. He got dressed and was about to continue his revision in the library when he noticed that someone had sent him a text.It was an arbitrary message from an unfamiliar number:'I need your help! Meet me at the place we first met.'This was the first text message he had ever received in still time. For countless nights, he had been the only one who could roam around the sleeping city while everyone froze in time. Right away, a figure in a Tang suit and fedora popped into Zhang Heng's mind. Everything supernatural that had happened to him so far had to do with the strange old man. If there was someone who could enter this world, it would be that guy. From the looks of the message, it seemed that he was in some sort of trouble as well.Zhang Heng changed into his sports attire and went to retrieve his sf recurve bow from the archery range, then bought a small knife from the outdoor sporting goods store next door and strapped it to his waist. After he was done, he jumped on a yellow public bike and cycled to the maid's caf\u00e9.The door into the mall was uncharacteristically unlocked and half-open, a light coming from within. Zhang Heng unstrapped his bow and armed it with an arrow, treading as carefully and quietly as he could.\"I really liked that milk tea shop on the second floor, but there's always a long line! It's seldom empty like it is now, but then again, at least there's one to make a cup of milk tea for me. Perhaps this is life\u2014it's difficult to find the best of both worlds.\" The old man in the Tang suit sighed. Sitting on the handle of the stationary escalator, he was dressed in the same way as they first met two months ago. This time, however, he wore a baseball cap instead of that formal hat. Other than that, everything else was nondescript.The old man was holding a bag of M&Ms, which he tore open before emptying half of its content into his mouth.Zhang Heng put down his bow and said, \"Forgive me for being indiscreet, but you don't look like you need any help.\"\"Trust me, I care more for your privacy compared to all the employers you'll find out there. I wouldn't come to you unless something dire happened,\" said the old man as he chewed on the M&Ms.\"Serious?\"\"We'll talk about it on the way. We don't have much time.\" The old man poured the rest of the chocolate-coated candies into his mouth and then got up. \"Let me as you a question: you've probably played two rounds of the game now, what kind of skills have you acquired?\"\"Wilderness survival skills, archery skills, and driving skills,\" Zhang Heng listed all of his level 2 skills.\"That a pretty good start. You'll be able to use them soon. Right now, find us a mount first\u2014oh, sorry, old habits die hard\u2014go get the car.\" The old man tossed a set of car keys to Zhang Heng. \"Black Audi A6. Carpark B34, one level down. I promise I'll tell you everything in the car.\"Zhang Heng took the elevator down to the parking lot and was able to locate the car pretty quickly. When he opened the glove compartment, however, he spotted a driver's license belonging to a heavily-set guy called Wang Jianguo. It was obviously not the old man's. The guy in the picture looked at least 20 years younger.The old man was waiting for Zhang Heng at the mall's front entrance carrying a piece of broken luggage looking like he had just escaped from a nursing home. Zhang Heng drove to the front, where the old man climbed into the back seat.\"Don't mind these small little details. You have probably done some things in the game that you would never have in the real world, right? Considering the enemy we're going to face, you wouldn't make me sit in the front on our way to battle.\"\"What enemy?\" Zhang Heng asked.\"There's a tribe called Alkiz in Papua New Guinea. Their ancestors traveled to that place early in the days and fought a few battles with the island's overlord Huli tribe. Both sides won and lost. Even though the Alkiz soldiers were very mighty and brave, each of them as powerful as ten men combined, an underpopulation problem developed as the war continued. FOr every Alkiz, there was twenty Huli. If they continued to deplete in numbers, they would soon be wiped out. In desperation, the Alkiz offered prayers to a monster called Moresby.\"They offered the old, weak and lame, as sacrifices to Moresby. In return, the monster aged the Alkiz babies into able-bodied young men in the span of a few months so that they could have one batch of soldiers after another. Thankfully, in the end, the tribe was snuffed out by the Huli tribe. Everything related to the Moresby, it's totems, the altars all destroyed. In most circumstances, this meant that the monster was also exterminated.\"But, by the way\u2014I really hate this phrase\u2014but\u2026 Moresby is a monster with time attributes, making it very difficult to completely eradicate it. In the last moment, it somehow found a way to seal itself into a small stretch of time, escaping death. Of course, in a way, you can say that it's dead, trapped inside for over 20,000 years, dragging out its feeble existence until\u2026 err, the equilibrium was broken.\" The old man suddenly became really quiet as his gaze fell on Zhang Heng.Zhang Heng was suddenly filled with a sense of foreboding. \"You're kidding, right?!\"The old man sighed again. \"Unfortunately, when I gave you the gift, I accidentally broke the time balance and released the creature.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It would seem his mouth would just not stop. \"But don't worry, after losing the Alkiz's worship, it's in the weakest it has ever been. In my heyday, dealing with this kind of low-life pest is just a matter of snapping my fingers.\"\"What about now?\"\"Now\u2026 I just found someone to help me, didn't I?\"Zhang Heng turned to a street per the old man's instruction. \"\u2026that sounds very reassuring.\"\"Relax. Even though my strength has depleted quite a bit, there are two of us and one of them. In terms of numbers, we are at an advantage.\" The old man said encouragingly, as he wolfed down the candies in his hand. At the rate he ate, it would be a miracle if he survived diabetes.\"I still don't understand why a Papua New Guinean monster come all the way here?\"\"Its original believers, the Alkiz, are all dead. If we compare it to an economy, while it has escaped from the prison of time, the Papua New Guinean market has now split up. Unable to mingle inside but desperate to recover its strength, it needed to find new believers. And so it was forced to leave and eventually followed a couple to China.\"I was in Shanghai's Hongqiao International Airport when I came across the monster. That dumbass had been locked up for too long and was completely out of touch with society. Thinking that since there were so many people there, he would try his luck. But 99% of the people who went to the airport never stayed long, and while it may have been able to fool the indigenous 20,000 years ago, it wouldn't work now. The monster spent half a month there, managing to convince two cleaners - they were elderly women, where one of them offered the remainder of her time to the monster as a sacrifice. The other one remained undecided. Then, when it saw me, it ran away!\"The old man shifted in his seat, settling in a more comfortable position. \"Ever since we last met, I have been busy taking care of this matter. I've been going after it for nearly two months now. Tonight, with your help, we can probably solve this problem. Otherwise, I'm afraid sooner or later, this guy will find you.\"\"Why?\"\"Because the 'Time Anomaly' you have on you poses a fatal attraction to it, and because you are my representative. We had friendly relations for these past two months. I'm 100% sure that that thing wants to get even with me.\" The old man answered. \"Turn left at the intersection in front, take the side road, but don't take the overpass.\"Zhang Heng was quiet as he tried to process the old man's words. After a while, he said, \"Did this world go crazy after you found me, or has it always been this insane?\"The old man gave his driver a meaningful smile. \"You are a smart guy. You already know what the answer is. You just need to continue to play the game to find the answer. There are some things in this world that unless you see them with them your own eyes, it would be very hard to believe\u2026 Stop the car over there, I can feel it nearby.\"Zhang Heng stepped on the brake and the Audi A6 slowed down until it came to a halt in a damp looking tunnel.About 2.8 km long, it was located in the center of the city. The construction site had been sealed off to reduce noise to its surrounding areas. There were few cars in the tunnel at this hour, and Zhang Heng had not spotted anything suspicious so far. He was just about to speak when he saw the old man placing a finger on his lips.Zhang Heng turned off the engine, and the whole world was once again immersed in complete stillness. After about half a minute, loud clattering footsteps came from the roof of the tunnel. It was getting closer and closer, then stopped abruptly!Just like that, 5 minutes had passed. The two people in the car were composed and silent. Just when Zhang Heng thought that the thing had disappeared, something hefty suddenly landed on the roof of the car! There were dents in the steel the shape of two footprints above Zhang Heng's head.And then, the next minute, a strange face peeped down from the windshield!It was a creature that looked very much like a monkey, but with unusually large eyes that took up nearly a third of its face. Like the primate, its face was hairless, covered only in wrinkles like an old man.Zhang Heng could see the greed in its yellow pupils. But when the creature noticed someone else sitting at the back of the car, it quickly turned around and scrambled towards the other end of the tunnel!\"Go after it!\" The old man in the Tang suit finally broke the silence.Since there was no time for questions, Zhang Heng got the car running and floored the gas pedal. The metal beast roared as it barreled forward.Zhang Heng turned on the high beam, and under the luminosity, he could see that Moresby creature running on the wall of the tunnel. Its movement was swift, as if completely unaffected by gravity.If he had not seen it with his own two eyes, he really would not have believed that such a being existed on earth, and at least now he knew why the old man had been chasing this creature for two months and had yet to succeed.With his level 2 driving skills, he was barely able to tread on the creature's heels, and that too was thanks to his car's light that flooded the tunnel. Once they were outside of the area sealed in both directions, it would be able to burrow its way into a building nearby with this creature's agility.If that were to happen, even if Zhang Heng's driving skills were 10 times better, he would never be able to catch up to it.Fortunately, the old man in the backseat finally made a move. He opened the broken luggage he had been hugging to his chest, and took out a metal piece speckled with rust and assembled them into a rusty spear.From its appearance, it did not look like a weapon but a cultural relic that had just been unearthed.\"I borrowed this thing from a friend of mine,\" the old man explained as he opened the window and stood up on the seat with the spear in hand.He was not very tall, but at that very moment, he appeared like an imposing god as if becoming one with heaven and earth.Zhang Heng did his best to keep the Audi stable, keeping the car from swaying side to side as the old man threw the spear without even aiming.When the spear left his hand, it exploded into a burst of light, flitting across the sky like a bolt of lightning!As it sensed the incoming danger, the Moresby creature gathered even more speed, and began to jump frantically! But no matter how hard it tried to avoid it, the spear remained firmly locked onto it as if it was equipped with a tracking device.Finally, the creature pushed itself to its limits, and just when it was about to escape the tunnel, the spear punctured it from the back into its heart and out through its chest!Moresby dropped as if he had been drained of all strength and fell motionless onto the asphalt road.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As the small-ish was falling mid-air, he decelerated and stopped right at the tunnel opening!The old man in the Tang suit stepped out of the vehicle, bent down, and checked the creature's breathing.\"Is it over?\" Zhang Heng pulled the handbrake and exited the vehicle.\"I wish I could say yes, that it's over and that the both of us could go wherever we want, do whatever we want, but something seems off about this. The whole was just too easy.\" The old frowned. \"I've been going after the creature for 2 months. If it were this easy to kill, it wouldn't have lasted until today.\"\"From your understanding of this creature, think it still has some tricks up its sleeve?\" Zhang Heng stepped closer. The thing had appeared on the windshield, but he did not get a good look at the creature. Now, he could finally see it upfront and personal.The creature was slightly bigger than a monkey, about the size of a six or seven-year-old child with small, short limbs. Other than its hairless face, its body was covered in gold hair, which was why Zhang Heng's first impression of it was that it resembled a monkey. But the one thing that caught his eye most was the reproductive organ in between the creature's legs\u2014it was three times the size of a grown man's.Zhang Heng was sure that this thing did not belong to any known species on earth.\"Reproduction worship. Many of the indigenous people have similar preferences. Also, you seemed to have misunderstood something. I may look old, but I'm not as old as you think I am. Moresby is a 20,000-year-old monster. Like you, I don't know anything about it. So, thanks to Google and Wikipedia, I was able to find some information about it on the internet.\" The old man pushed himself off the ground and pulled out the spear from the corpse. \"We\u2026\"He was about to say something when he suddenly froze. There was a transparent, sticky substance dripping from the spear.\"This is great!\" The old man exclaimed.But then, a silhouette jumped down from above!Who would have thought that there was another Moresby?!It was fast, pouncing on the old man so hard he fell to the ground. Then, it opened its mouth to bite the old man's neck, only to be stopped by something.The old man was in terrible condition. His baseball cap had fallen off his head, and his hair and clothes were disheveled, desperately holding onto the spear to defend himself.The old man was not as strong as the Moresby creature. The horizontal spear was getting closer to his chest by the momentZhang Heng thought that the old man would use that trick he used back in the maid's caf\u00e9, but he did not realize that the old man's strength had weakened to this extent, or maybe he just could not rewind time when in still time\u2014whatever it was, he looked like he was in deep trouble.Zhang Heng knew what he had to do. So, he ran back to the car as fast as he could and grabbed his sf recurve bow and arrows, tightly aiming at the creature.There was no way he could miss at such a short distance.Thwack!!!The arrow pierced the skin of the creature as expected but did not penetrate any further.Zhang Heng was taken aback. He had just witnessed that rusted spear puncture the Moresby's chest effortlessly. He thought that the creature was not that strong, but now, it looked like the creature's muscles were so robust it was akin to a small tree.The Moresby turned around to glare at its attacker, but it did not do anything else. It could obviously tell who was a bigger threat to it and decided to get rid of the old man first, then taking care of Zhang Heng.Zhang Heng shot it twice again, and when he realized that it was useless, he tossed his bow and arrow aside and ran to the back!The old man thought Zhang Heng was going to take the car and leave. That would be extremely stupid because if the old man died, he would not be able to outrun the Moresby alone.But 7 seconds later, the old man could see that the black Audi had not left but was coming towards him at full speed! The glaring highbeam blinded his eyes and also affected the creature's vision!Wham!!!The creature was knocked over, and the Audi's hood caved in! In the last second, Zhang Heng slammed on the brakes, its impact violently throwing his head forward into the inflated airbag.The tire of the car was less than 1cm away from the old man's left arm! This was the deadliest attack Zhang Heng could think of. With the hardness of the monster's body, only a 2-ton block of metal could do any damage to it.But that made the Moresby really angry. After it was knocked by the car, it stumbled once, then sprang back onto its feet again! Its eyes were fixed on Zhang Heng in the driver seat the whole time. It then squatted its tiny legs, getting ready to leap.The next moment, a bolt of lightning flashed from under the Audi and pierced its bald forehead and out through the back, pinning the Moresby onto the wall of the tunnel!The creature twitched twice before going into a limp like a piece of cured meat.The old man in the Tang suit crawled out from under the Audi, face covered in dust and dirt, and stumbled towards the wall, cursing. After making real sure that the thing was dead as a doornail, he turned around and gave Zhang Heng a big thumbs-up. \"Beautifully done!\"Zhang Heng unbuckled his seat belt and leaned back onto the seat. After that almost too-close-to-call brush with death, he was mentally exhausted. Slightly anyway. \"Didn't you say that it's two against one tonight? What was that just now?\"\"It is supposed to be two against one tonight. I did not know that it would have two bodies.\" The old man shrugged innocently. \"Previously, when I was hunting it down, it did not show this side! I think it was planning to use it against me. Thank goodness I have had help tonight!\"\"Alright, stop being so upset. I was not going to make you help me for free.\" The old man pulled out the spear from the wall, disassembled it before returning it into the luggage. Rolling up his sleeves, he plunged his hand into the Moresby's pierced head. He dug around for a bit, and finally pulled out a piece of bone covered in greyish-white brain matter and tossed it to Zhang Heng.\"Your reward.\"Zhang Heng let the thing fall to the ground, not intending to pick it up.\"Don't be fooled by its appearance! This is the game's equivalent of a C-grade item! You can use it yourself or sell it at the year-end auction. But as you already have the gift I gave you, this ain't going to be that useful.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I better go return the weapon and see a few of my old friends. I will be out of the country, so we won't be seeing each other for a while - we were not supposed to meet so soon anyway. Thank goodness this is during still time, so it's not that big of a problem. Finally, I wish you success in the upcoming CET-6 exam!\"The old man climbed into the driver's seat and cut away the deflated airbag with a small knife. Just as he was about to start the car, Zhang Heng called out and asked the question that concerned him the most, \"Wait! Are there many types of these\u2026 monsters here on earth?\"The old man chuckled. \"A very long long long time ago, there were actually quite a few of them. But now\u2026\" He pointed at the lucky rabbit's foot hanging from Zhang Heng's keys, and then the bloody bone wrapped in tissue. \"I'm very sure that most of them are very safe.\"\"You mean that all of those game items that we found are their remains?\"The old man clammed up. \"I've already said too many things I shouldn't have. This meeting never happened! You should get back to school and continue to the next game. You're already one step closer to the truth!\"Zhang Heng watched the black Audi disappear from the tunnel's exit. Discounting the hole in the wall, the road of the tunnel, and also the small missing parts on the car, it was as if nothing had happened.\u2026That night left a deep impression on Zhang Heng. After that incident, he looked up Moresby and Alkiz, and he found several records. Clicking onto one of the research articles on Alkiz culture, he was immediately drawn to a picture of a recently exhumed stone relic with a carving of a creature. It looked exactly like the Moresby creature from the tunnel!Other than that, there was also a picture of the spear the old man in the Tang suit had used. The more Zhang Heng thought about the fight that night, the more he realized that the spear was very similar to one he heard in a story when he was still a child.Zhang Heng suddenly discovered that he was not as unfamiliar with this world as he thought he was.Alas, no matter how much he searched, he could not find any other evidence to support his theory and had to leave that night on the back burner as time passed.After a week, his work 'Late night fried pancake stall and night bus' had won second place in the urban impression themed photography competition. The comment the judges gave was, 'Although its technical skills were a little crude, the details were outstanding! The picture is full of emotion!'Owing to this, Zhang Heng went to the society to collect his 3,000 yuan prize money. A tripod and a camera bag were also included. After taking a picture of him with the other winners and their prizes, it was posted in an article on the school website that afternoon.\"That's not real! You've only just started learning!\" Wei Jiangyang said when he saw the names on the list of winners, popping a hard-boiled egg whole into his gaping mouth.On the other side of the room, Chen Huadong had grown rather numb to all these surprises. Last time, his friend had only started practicing archery and could already 'accidentally' scare the trespasser away. This time, he had only just bought the camera for two months and was already winning prizes.On the other hand, Chen Huadong had been working double shifts trying to promote the development of his Anime, Comic, and Games (ACG) career, looking up resources for everyone for free. Despite that, he had yet to receive a single consolation prize.\"Sigh, life is getting more stressful thanks to those Europeans who are everywhere.\"\"Let me treat all of you to dinner!\" Zhang Heng volunteered as he placed the tripod and the camera bag on his table. He had missed his three dorm mates ever so often during the one year he spent in Japan. This was the perfect opportunity for a gathering.\"Sure. Sure!\" The expression on Chen Huadong's face changed instantly as he broke into a smile. \"Europeans may be hateful but they are not all that bad\u2026\"Wei Jiangyang informed Ma Wei, who was still studying in the library, and when it was time to eat, the four of them gathered in front of the campus gate and headed straight for the food street nearby that they usually frequented.Lined with popular stalls and restaurants, it was always packed with students from universities and schools nearby enjoying their meals or having supper - not only because the food there was particularly good or affordable, but it was a great spot to gaze at pretty girls from other schools as you ate.Zhang Heng ordered 50 skewers of lamb, 1 grilled fish, 8 oysters, some goat liver, vegetables, and baked bread slices.When the food was served, Chen Huadong picked up the beer bottle from the table and said, \"May Africans never be servants 1!\"His friends all dissolved into laughter as they clinked their bottles together!After a few skewers of meat, even the usually quiet Ma Wei was yakking away. When boys chatted, they either talked about sports or girls. After hovering over several subjects, the topic finally came to relationships.Wei Jiangyang asked Chen Huadong, \"How are you and Xu Jing? Have you decided on your relationship yet?\"The latter shook his head. \"We've gone out a few times, but each time, she would ask for us to go AA 1. I don't really understand what it means. Was it the same when you were wooing your girlfriend?\"Wei Jiangyang was quiet for a moment, then answered cheekily, \"I'm sorry. Xiao Xiao was the one who pursued me!\"\"Tsk! Tsk!\" Everyone gave him the middle finger.Ma Wei, the honest guy, commented, \"Old Wei, you are you lying to? Whenever you're next to Han Xiaoxiao, you become more docile than an Angora rabbit!\"\"I don't know how, but it just happened. It's true, she was the one who saw me playing ball and asked for my WeChat.\" Wei Jiangyang grinned.As they were talking, there was a sudden commotion not far away from where they were.Two black men were tugging aggressively at a petite girl. The latter looked alarmed, the rims of her eyes red, and she was repeating something over and over again. The men looked on with amused smiles on their faces.This had caught quite a few people's attention, and eyes were drawn to the spectacle.One of the black men addressed the onlookers and said in broken mandarin, \"My friend and his girlfriend have a disagreement! I'm really sorry for the disruption!\"The crowd looked uncertain. The two men looked like exchange students from one of the universities nearby. When someone asked the girl if she needed help, she said nothing and kept shaking her head.That seemed to confirm the black man's statement.Was this just a false alarm?When they realized that it was simply a misunderstanding, the crowd gradually dispersed. Despite that, the girl's face grew redder. She looked extremely troubled. A few times, she made attempts to grab the black man's shirt, but the guy evaded her effortlessly.Just when she was about to give up, a voice spoke from behind her!\"D\u014dshitandesuka 1?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The girl's eyes lit up at that as if he had just thrown her the lifesaver, quickly explaining to him in fleeting Japanese that she was in trouble!Her name was Hayase Asuka, an exchange student at a university nearby who had only just arrived in China and was curious about everything here. So, before she could even learn enough Mandarin, she snuck out and wandered around on her own.She did not know who the two other black men were. While she was out that night, taking pictures, they grabbed her phone! No matter how much she begged them, they refused to return it to her, and she panicked. Her Mandarin was terrible, and she could not understand what the people around were saying. If she went to the police for help, she was afraid that by then, the men would have been long gone with her phone.Worse still, she had a profound sense of direction. Without her phone, she did not even know how to get back to school.Zhang Heng felt that this girl must have been too humble when she said her Mandarin was awful\u2014she had been here for almost three months already, yet she still did not know how to ask for help. She clearly paid no attention in class at all.But as he had come to know about the situation, he felt that he could still be managed.Zhang Heng turned to the two black men and said, \"Give her phone back to her.\"Both of the men played dumb, shaking their heads like rattle drums, repeating, 'I don't know' over and over again. Hayase Asuka was so mad, she wanted to lunge at them only to be held back by Zhang Heng! Yet, he patiently repeated what he said earlier in English.More and more eyes were drawn to the commotion, and the black men were starting to get ticked off while hissing at Zhang Heng, \"Mind your own business, chink!\"\"There will always be idiots who won't remember until they've been taught a lesson, right?\" Zhang Heng muttered to himself. He had heard that derogative word the black man uttered, but instead of arguing with them, he threw a punch right at the man's face!He held nothing back, letting his fist break the man's nose, which also sent a slight, sharp pain up his knuckles!When the other guy saw his friend getting attacked, he was furious. His angry eyes and muscular physique looked menacing in the dark of the night.Hayase Asuka took two steps backward, but Zhang Heng remained where he was.The black guy raised a curled first, but before he could even swing it, all the customers sitting at the tables nearby got up.The food street was mostly populated with university students, generally hot-blooded and unafraid, unlike the old and the middle-aged, who were more concerned about international relations. Most of the guys were already agitated when they saw Hayase Asuka's eyes redden, and after hearing the conversation between Zhang Heng and the black men, especially that vilifying term the black men had used, they were even more outraged.Ma Wei and the others got up from their seats to support Zhang Heng. They did think that their actions would lead to a chain reaction\u2014when the other students saw that someone had taken the lead, they followed suit and stood up as well.The outburst was so big that it drew even more people's attention. It had everyone jabbering, trying to find out what was happening. More and more people joined in until the entire half of the alley was standing up!Having never seen such a show of force before, the black exchange students were beside themselves.The pressure of standing in the middle, surrounded by a mass of people, was unimaginable. Tonight, even if it were Tyson who was in this situation, he would have been terror-stricken too. The black man finally realized what a big mistake he and his friend had made.Many of these exchange students were not exactly model citizens in their own countries. Only when they were no longer welcome there, did they escaped to this ancient, Eastern country, choosing whichever school they wanted, free accommodation, and could even apply for subsidies! With their pride and glory being part of the face-saving culture, whenever they had any sort of conflict with other students, the school would always stand by them for the sake of the bigger picture. So, eventually, after a while in this foreign country, they began to lose their bearings and became conceited.Tonight, the both of them were out looking for fun, and when they spotted the Japanese girl, they thought of a heinous idea\u2014grabbing the girl's phone was not their real motive; what they really wanted to do was to use the phone to trick her into getting a room with them! They never expected there to be any impending problems, at least not running into Zhang Heng, who spoke fluent Japanese.In their anger, they used an expression they often used back in their country.Outraged by their slur, Zhang Heng had taken the first move and knocked one of them down. He could easily take down the other one even if they had to fight mano y mano.He did not expect his roommates to get up from their seats and also the rest of the people who were eating along the streets to join in as well. Coming completely as a surprise, it was the first time he had seen something like this! He could only presume that because these assholes had been kept unchecked for too long, many people were wary of them.In the end, Zhang Heng said to the other black man who was now petrified, \"Welcome to China!\"The culprit then quickly returned the phone to Hayase Asuka, then ran away from the scene with his bloody-nosed friend.Someone started to cheer, and the rest of the street followed.Wei Jiangyang ran to his roommate, exhilarated. \"That was incredible! We will be bragging about tonight ten years down the road! Did you see how, when everyone stood up together, that black men nearly wet his pants?!\"Ma Wei stuck out a thumb and said, \"Virtuous macho men!\"The ecstatic one was Chen Huadong. He fumbled excitedly, \"Since when did you learn how to speak Japanese? When did you learn Japanese?!! My god! Is that even natural? Is that even natural?! Is there anything you don't know? Damn! That punch to his face was really cool! You have to teach me how to do it!\"Hayase Asuka did not understand a word of it, but she caught on to the atmosphere and was grinning ear to ear.Zhang Heng said to her, \"You better go back while it's still early, and don't come out alone late at night. But if you have to, at least learn some Mandarin.\"Hayase Asuka's face flushed red as she answered in a small voice, \"I have a few classmates from Japan. Their Mandarin is pretty good, and we usually hang out together. Are you an exchange student from Japan as well? Your Mandarin is so good, and you even know how to speak English as well.\"When Zhang Heng realized that she was mistaken, she shook his head, \"I'm Chinese, but I've spent some time in Tokyo before.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For the most part, having been in China for so long, this was the first time she had come across a Chinese who was so fluent in Japanese, one who even spoke with an authentic Tokyo accent, which she had found very comforting.Perhaps this poor child had been ignored for too long, not leaving the moment she got her phone back, but stayed by Zhang Heng instead, bombarding him with questions.Chen Huadong nudged Wei Jiangyang on the shoulder and gave him a look.The latter understood immediately and quickly said, \"Xiaoxiao needs my help with something urgent. I have to go first!\"Chen Huadong chimed in, \"I'll come with you. I should be chatting on QQ 1with Xujing too.\"Ma Wei was the only one a little clueless, still caught up in that moment of furor. Based on his understanding, this was the moment to order two more large bottles of beer! Why did everyone have to leave suddenly?Wei Jiangyang coughed twice and said, \"Hey, Old Ma, you haven't memorized the TOEFL words yet, right?\"Only then did Ma Wei suddenly get the message. They were all so focused on the two black exchange students that they did not pay much attention to Hayase Asuka. Now that they did, he realized that this girl was quite a looker with an exotic appeal so dissimilar to the likes of Chinese girls with a small face, delicate features, and short chestnut hair.Brothers needed to create opportunities for each other!Ma Wei nodded, \"Yes, yes! I have to go back and memorize all the words. CET-6 is coming soon.\"After that, the three boys vanished without so much as a goodbye, leaving in such a hurry that the owner of the food stall thought they were trying to avoid paying for the meal!\u2026Zhang Heng paid for the food, then sent Hayase Asuka back to her school. Coincidentally, the foreign university she was studying in was right next to Zhang Heng's campus.Hayase Asuka looked rather happy as they stood outside of the student dorm. \"Can I come hang out with you for fun next time?\"Zhang Heng found this request hard to refuse, and so, the both of them exchanged phone numbers before saying goodbye. When he returned to his dorm, the atmosphere in the room seemed a little strange. All three of his housemates were there. Chen Huadong even borrowed a mahjong table from next door and set it in the center of the room with a 30,000 yuan banknote on the table. \"The Court is in session! Someone! Bring me the suspect!\"\"\u2026\"\"Come, Childe Zhang. You either take the initiative to confess first, or we can do it for you!\" Chen Huadong wore this jealous look on his face. \"Oh, how wicked of you! I've always asked why you never date, and it turns out you've been learning Japanese secretly so that you could woo Japanese girls, huh? So, has she given herself to you? Where do the both of you plan to stay in the future? China or Japan? Do you want to have a son or a daughter?\"Wei Jiangyang was also very keen. \"Are all Japanese girls very gentle?\"\"You guys are overthinking! We were just making friends,\" Zhang Heng said.\"Ask your conscience! You think what you did is worthy of Shen Xixi waiting for you for years?\" asked Chen Huadong.When Shen Xixi's name was mentioned, Wei Jiangyang suddenly had this strange expression on his face. He thought about it before deciding to ask Zhang Heng, \"Have you been in contact with Shen Xixi recently?\"Zhang Heng raised an eyebrow at that question. \"Why?\"\"There's been a not-so-good rumor about her recently \u2026\" Wei Jiangyang answered hesitantly. \"Apparently, some time ago, someone saw her get into a black Mercedes after curfew.\"\"No way. She doesn't look like that kind of person. She comes from a pretty good family and probably shouldn't be short on money to spend.\" Gossip really was the most irresistible. Chen Huadong's attention quickly turned away from Zhang Heng and his new Japanese friend. \"Wasn't she very cool towards Chen Cheng?\"Ma Wei turned around from his books to say, \"I heard about that too! Some people say she was just pretending, playing hard to get.\" Although he always focused on his studies, he was not a lone wolf like Zhang Heng. Shen Xixi was the prettiest girl in the Public Relations department, the dream lover of many boys, so naturally, rumors about her would spread really quickly.\"It's probably a relative or friend.\" Zhang Heng did not know Shen Xixi that well and was not in the position to comment. But ever since that camping trip, she left quite an impression on him\u2014she was a brilliant girl. He did not quite believe this rumor.\"Who knows?\" When Chen Huadong saw that he was not going to squeeze any valuable information out of Zhang Heng, he returned the mahjong table to their neighbor and returned to playing games on his computer, sulking. The others also returned to their respective areas in the room.Zhang Heng decided to take shower. When he opened his closet, a wooden carving sitting in the corner caught his eye. This thing was returned to him 4 days ago, also sent by post.[Name: Shadow Moment][Grade: D][Usage: Could place the user in shadow form, lasting for 3 minutes. Can only be used under conditions where shadows can be manifested. Number of uses: 3]This was the second supernatural item that Zhang Heng had found. In reality, it could only be used 2 more times. He had no choice, at least needing to try it out once.Unlike the lucky rabbit's foot, the Shadow Moment was the kind of item that needed to be first activated. He had to carve his name at the bottom of the statue and focus his mind on visualizing a crow for the thing to take effect. According to Zhang Heng's experiment, this transition into shadow form actually made the person's physical body disappear, leaving only a shadow.As for the conditions stated at the end, it merely meant that it could only be used when he had a shadow.The way to get out of shadow form was also very simple. He just needed to turn off the lights, and he would reappear again. Or, he could also install spotlights on all four corners of the room to stop the effect.Even though there were a lot of restrictions, its effects were also pretty pronounced. In shadow form, it would be difficult for anyone to inflict damage on him. Characteristically, shadows could reach places that were not usually easily accessible and could be used to avoid notice.So, Zhang Heng decided to keep it for himself. Other than that, he also had a piece of Moresby bone. Unable to reveal its source, he could not ask the bartender lady to identify it for the time being.Mid-December came quickly. Zhang Heng thought that he had done pretty well in his CET-6. The listening test at this level was pretty easy for him, also completing the reading, understanding, and translation part pretty quickly. The only part he needed to spend a little more time and effort was filling in the blanks and composition\u2014these were also the areas in which he focused on these two weeks.After he penned down the last word, he looked at the time. There was still an hour left. Not wanting to make such a dramatic exit or adding too much pressure to his fellow comrades in the battlefield of exams, he remained in his seat for another half an hour and checked his paper twice.Even so, when he got up from his seat, the frustrated Xujing, who was sitting behind him inhaled nervously.She had only just shaded in the answer sheets, not even writing a single word for the essay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The auction's main appeal was that he had been playing the game on his own and had only superficial knowledge about the rules. Since he did not know what old players felt about newbies, Zhang Heng did not approach others in the lounge before and after the first two games. Now that a rare opportunity had presented itself, he did not want to miss it.So, upon receiving the main mission, Zhang Heng went to register with the bartender lady at once. Filing in the necessary personal information, he had to pay an entrance fee of 1 game point.While there were still 2 weeks until the end of the month, Zhang Heng decided he did not want to make another trip to the bar, immediately settling down in a booth the moment he was done with the registration. Deftly, he set the alarm at 23.55 with the intention of completing the third round of game ahead of time.He was slowly becoming accustomed to the game's format and would move his sleeping hours forward to the day. Furthermore, he would make sure to warm up before getting to the bar in order to keep his body and mind in tip-top condition. With the many skills and game items he had banked in the last two rounds of games, Zhang Heng was confident in the face of upcoming challenges.Having said that, he would seem to have once again underestimated the challenges he was about to encounter.23:55.Once again, that familiar vertigo engulfed him. But because he was prepared this time, it was not as awful as it was the first two.[Verifying player's identity\u2026][Identity confirmed.

Players, please get ready!\u2026The moment the countdown ended, the first thing that Zhang Heng felt was frigid cold! He opened his eyes and saw that he was standing in a snow-covered forest. Whenever exhaling, his breath would quickly condense into ice crystals! This was the first time he had ever experienced a situation like this\u2014the game did not provide any backstory at the beginning of the game, instructing him to explore it himself instead.From the mission objective, he could confirm that he was in Finland. The Nordic pine trees all around him verified that fact as well. Zhang Heng's knowledge of Finland was that it was a country with little human interference. Lush green forests took up 75% percent of the land area, and a third of its territory lay within the Arctic Circle.But this country\u2026 Zhang Heng had never really heard of any perils within it. Why was this mission's objective to survive like the first game?Despite the fact that he was once again faced with a communication problem (Finland's primary languages are Finnish and Swedish) which would make it impossible for Zhang Heng to be employed, he could simply roam around the forest and quickly make it through 20 days with his Level 2 wilderness survival skills.Even so, Zhang Heng was not careless. The timing of the game this time was very anomalous\u2014the exchange ratio between the real world and the game world was very low, and the overall gaming period was also the shortest out of the three so far, an indication of the degree of danger in this game. Other than that, the title of this edition 'Mannerheim Line Welcomes You' sounded very familiar. But he could not, for the life of him, remember where he had heard it.Routinely, Zhang Heng checked his current status.Name: Zhang HengGender: MaleAge: 19Player ID: 07958Rounds of game played: 2Current game points: 77Item in possession: Lucky rabbit's foot (E), Shadow Moment (D\uff09Skills:Piano: Level 1Language proficiency: Level 1 (three languages at general communication's level)Car tuning and repairing skills: Level 1Archery skills: Level 2Wilderness survival skills: Level 2driving skills: Level 2.Assessment: The player has slightly better luck than the average person. Shielded by shadow, he has some wilderness survival skills and archery skills. If lucky, he will be able to survive six rounds of the game.After two rounds, Zhang Heng had managed to accumulate 77 game points. However, other than identifying game items, he had no idea what other uses they had\u2014yet to receive the detailed service statement that the bartender lady had promised to send. However, it no longer mattered anymore as he could just ask the other players during the auction.In terms of skills, the report was not too far from his projections. The one thing that he did not foresee was that his language skills level did not increase even though he had mastered Japanese. But considering that there were over 5,000 languages in the world, it was an acceptably fair verdict. The other one was the addition of the Shadow Moment's protection in the assessment section, which raised his survival expectancy to six rounds.After inspecting his character profile, he checked the belongings he carried. Perhaps due to an absence of background introduction, he was actually wearing his own clothes this time, which consisted of his Asics autumn-winter runners, a black Lee down jacket, and jeans.Even though he was also wearing a set of thermal underwear underneath, one should know that winters in Finland could reach a toe-biting -20 degrees Celsius, which meant he was still feeling really, really cold.His first priority would be to locate a store and procure warmer clothing.Zhang Heng rubbed his hands together to keep them from freezing. He had his wallet and phone with him, but there was not much of a signal out here. The electronic compass could still be used, but without GPS, he had no idea where he was. The only thing he could do was trust his instincts and pick a direction.After walking for around half an hour, Zhang Heng spotted something in the snowy pasture. He picked it up and found that it was a metal helmet. The style was a little strange with a big hat and outward protective ear covering and a raised metal ridge sitting on top. Evident by the bullet hole and the bloodstains on the inside, it now seemed that this object failed to protect its owner's life.Looking down at the object in his hand, Zhang Heng was filled with uneasiness. But before he could even examine this premonition, he heard a series of gunshots!He instinctively ducked to the ground, but after a while, he could ascertain that shots were not fired in his direction. They were a distance away, probably two people firing at each other, where one was in pursuit of another.As they were not heading toward his hiding place, Zhang Heng waited patiently for the gunshots to move further away before standing up and emerging from behind the tree.Although he could still be in danger, Zhang Heng decided to explore the location where the shots were fired, needing to verify some things before deciding his next move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Combined with the 'Mannerheim Line Welcomes You' title, Zhang Heng's premonition radar hit its peak.He was in Finland for sure\u2014not modern-day Finland, but Finland during the Winter War.His cumulative reading proved to be very useful this round\u2014being able to retrieve information from his memory about the Winter War.On the fringes of World War II, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the infamous German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact in Moscow, delimiting both parties' sphere of influence in Europe. In August, Germany invaded Poland. Unwilling to be outdone, the Soviets occupied three Baltic States, then proceeded to set its sights on Finland, who had just proclaimed independence.In order to safeguard its capital Leningrad, only 32 kilometers from the Finnish border from potential German attack, the Soviet Union proposed a very harsh treaty that involved the Finish ceding their land, leasing their ports, and removing their lines of defense. After Finland's rejection of the proposal, the doctored November 30th artillery bombardment of Mainila ignited a war. Considering the military strengths of both parties, the general global opinion at the time was that the war would end in two weeks.But in reality, this battle lasted until February of the following year when the Soviets finally broke through the Mannerheim defense line. In March, due to the artillery and massive ammunition shortages, Finland signed the Moscow Peace Treaty with the Soviet Union, in which they were forced to surrender 10% of their national territory including Karelia, Finland's second-largest city Vyborg, one-fifth of their industrial output, and 30% of their pre-war economic assets. Some 220,000 occupants were repatriated, where only a handful chose to stay and join the Soviet Union. As it turned out, this war also laid the groundwork to Finland joining the Axis.\u2026Zhang Heng did not care much about who was standing on the side of justice in this war\u2014after all, world war two had already ended more than 70 years ago, and this was merely a game. He only needed to figure out how to survive and live through this ruthless war.Because of his additional 24 hours, the game was extended to 140 days, which made it extremely disadvantageous for him. There was nothing he could do about it\u2014being unable to predict what the next game was, nor did he know how long the duration of each would be.Since he had enjoyed the additional benefit of an extended period, it was only reasonable that he would have to bear an equal amount of risk involved.Fortunately, the Winter War only lasted for 105 days. From the looks of it, they were probably at war for some time now. So, strictly speaking, not all of his 140 days here would involve battle.Now, logically, whenever there were two opposing camps in a game, the player would have to choose one side. Based on the denouement of the actual war, the winners were decidedly the Soviets. Whether in terms of equipment superiority, number of troops, tanks, and fighters, Finland was at an absolute disadvantage. From the moment the war was waged, the brutal epilogue had already been decided.Regrettably, though, this 'reaping the fruits of the winner's labor' gameplay was not suitable for this peculiar Finnish Winter War.Zhang Heng knew precisely how brilliant the Soviet commander's performance was during this war: The Soviets invested nearly 1 million troops and dispatched more than 6,000 tanks to fight the Finns, who only had 32,000 standing armies and 32 tanks. The Soviets, who had dominance over the airspace fought the Finnish guerillas. The results were a shocking 30 to 1 in terms of losses; the latter having only lost 900 soldiers against the Soviets who lost over 27,000 men.On the battlefield, the Soviets did not gain any advantage over their enemy. The Soviet body count was piling up in the Mainila defense line, exhausting Finland's ammunition with their own flesh and blood. The total Finnish casualties from the war were 70,000 people, while the Soviet Union's total death count went up to a tragic 600,000.Even though the Soviets won the war in the end, they actually gained nothing from their victory. On the contrary, it exposed their weaknesses to the West, and this pyrrhic victory procured at such a great cost encouraged Little Mustache 1 to attack them later on.Read the next chapter on our vipnovel.comFrom this perspective, Zhang Heng might as well join the vanquished Finns.Still and all, reality was harsh\u2014Zhang Heng could neither speak Russian nor understand Finnish; his yellow skin and modern clothes making him stand out like a sore thumb in this war. He would not be able to explain why he was there, and even if he was willing to surrender himself to either side, no one would be willing to take the risk of accepting him.The best idea Zhang Heng could come up with so far was to allow himself to be captured as a prisoner of war, but he was more likely to end up being shot by some mentally traumatized soldier that way.\u2026Zhang Heng smiled bitterly. While able very quickly to make sense of the environment he was in, he had already forgotten the many details about the Winter War. Even if he did remember them, it was still useless. He was neither familiar with Finland, nor was he the commander of a troop. All that information would have been useless anyway.Right now, he would just have to take it one step at a time.Not knowing when the Soviets would come to collect the remains of their fallen comrades, Zhang Heng peeled a coat off a corpse and put it on himself as quickly as he could. That khaki uniform clearly had not been washed for a long time. It was stained with stale blood and sweat that gave it a putrid stench.For the sake of keeping warm, though, Zhang Heng could not afford to be picky. There was also a pistol and what looked like a machine gun on the ground. The latter looked strange to him with a giant mosquito coil at the top. Zhang Heng could not tell which model that thing was since he had little knowledge much about guns. Especially not World War II firearms.But whatever it was, it looked like it had much better firepower than the pistol lying next to it.In the end, however, after much deliberation, Zhang Heng chose to go with the pistol\u2014largely because the machine gun was too heavy. He tried carrying it and felt it was at least 10 kilograms. The gunfire he heard earlier had already stopped. It was evident that both sides had stopped engaging, and chances were the Soviets would come back. Upon discovering that their comrades' body had been moved, it was very likely they would begin searching the area.Zhang Heng was worried that he might not be able to get away fast enough if he carried that hefty thing. Other than the pistol, he also lugged around a canteen and a bag pack. He did not have time to look at the contents of the bag, for he could hear footsteps approaching.In his haste, Zhang Heng had not taken into account that those guys might have split up. The place where the firing had only just stopped was still a distance away, and already, someone was returning.It was impossible for him to set an ambush. Although the Soviets' performance in the Winter War had been lambasted by various military forums every once in a while, they were still trained professionals and were a collective. Zhang Heng was on his own, and this was his first time handling a firearm.In times like this, a head-on confrontation would be a real bovine move.There was no need for him to dilly-dally, so he carried his loot and ran for his life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhang Heng had to wait for the gunshots to stop before returning to where the first gunshot was fired. Doing that lowered his risk of getting killed significantly.Unfortunately, something unexpected happened. The first batch of Soviet conscripts had returned, a lot earlier than he initially expected!It was pointless to complain and wallow in regret right now, and all he could do was to crouch as low as possible and run for his life. There was no time to wait. He bolted!At the sign of the slightest movement, the soldiers quickly spotted him! It was in times like these that one had to appreciate the perks of the Soviet army. Considering they had all been given bright khaki uniforms, hence, standing out like golden scarecrows on the snow-covered land. Having large targets painted on their bodies by default, it was hard for enemies not to notice them. Hence, the fatality rate of the Soviets was alarmingly high.With his back turned, Zhang Heng somehow knew that the troops had their guns loaded. Luckily, the rigorous marathon training finally paid off, where he managed to keep a good distance between him and the soldiers while he ran. There were also tall trees all around him. Though he could hear guns being fired at him, the shots missed him, mostly going astray and landing far away.Still, Zhang Heng would not dare to let his guard down. He kept running until his stamina was almost depleted. Having to lean on a tree to catch some breath, he knew that by now, he should be safe. The soldiers wouldn't have any stamina left after the long fights they had been through before this. If they wanted to see another day before dying of fatigue, they would be smart not to pursue him for this period.Immediately, Zhang Heng took the opportunity to check out the canvas backpack that he just acquired. There were personal hygiene items, a spare foot wrap, utensils, and a few packs of MRE. Foot wraps were unique to the Soviet army, regularly used to keep the soldier warm and reduce friction on the feet. As for the MRE, it seemed like their staple was black bread. Thankfully for him, dehydrated sausage and a packet of red tea came inserted as well.He then came across two cans of beef, and a lighter, a delightful discovery as these items were a rarity in the USSR. Their industry infamously prowess lagged far behind other more developed nations. When Zhang Heng thought of the two dead bodies that he saw earlier, he remembered that they both wore different attire.One of the dead Soviets lacked the distinct five red stars on his sleeve, which could mean this canvas backpack should have belonged to an officer. Unfortunately, bullets discriminated against no soul on the battlefield. Even more so, the high-ranking officers, usually becoming the primary target of enemies. There were at least three to four bullet holes riddling the officer's face. It seemed that someone wanted to make damn sure that he was truly dead. As Zhang Heng frisked him, he tried his best not to stare directly at the officer's bloody face.Despite his close brush with death, he was rather pleased with his yield today. At least, he could now protect himself from the brutal cold of the Siberian tundra and keep his stomach filled.His attention soon turned to the pistol in his hand. China's notoriously draconian gun control laws had enabled only a few from elite professions to set their hands on a real firearm. Most of the regular public only got their ideas of guns from the movies. Zhang Heng was no exception, having no idea what model of gun he was holding. All he knew was this gun was a revolver, and there were seven chambers in a revolving barrel. It had been shot two times, still containing five bullets.It was at that time that Zhang Heng realized that he left too quickly earlier. He had taken the gun but had wholly forgotten the extra ammo. However, having five bullets was definitely better than none. The movies clearly showed the actors pulling triggers and coolly reloading their rounds, but never once their inner workings. Of course, the real deal here was way more complicated than a prop peshooter. After fumbling with it for a while, he still could not figure out how to remove the two spent shells from the chamber. He had to put it away for now.After taking in a few sips of water, his stamina recovered, and he was refreshed. Having regained some strength, he quickly left the place, worried that the spirits of the dead soldiers would come back to haunt him.He continued walking into the deeper parts of the forest, only stopping after the sky had turned dark. At the very least, he knew that he was no longer in danger.Vision at night was a challenge; it was almost impossible to make anything out clearly. Since the forest was unfamiliar to the Soviets, it was almost certain now that they wouldn't continue their pursuit of him. Besides, they risked getting ambushed by Finnish guerillas who had overrun the surrounding borders. With his mind put at ease, Zhang Heng finally stopped moving forward and decided that it was time to fix his hunger.He opened up his backpack, and out came the black bread. Having its origins in Germany, the recipe was then spread on to Eastern Europe and subsequently to Russia. For name's sake only, the bread itself was actually not black, it's color caused by the overbaking process unique to it.Never underestimate the prowess of such basic food. During the height of the Second World War, German and Soviet troops primarily relied on it for survival. According to war records, this humble meal saved at least 4 million people from starvation in the USSR and had kept the war going for at least 10 million German troops. As for its taste, it had a unique touch to it.Zhang Heng used his knife to cut a slice, trying it out. Immediately, a light saltiness with a tinge of sour hit his tongue. It came with a rough texture, much like burnt toast making it really hard for Zhang Heng to swallow. Thankfully, Zhang Heng had experienced extreme hunger before while he was venturing on the lone island. With war taken out of the equation, his current circumstance was actually a lot better than last time.Only one thing troubled him, though. He was unable to build a campfire to warm himself up. Not that he did not know how to do it, for even without the lighter in his backpack, he had the capability of building a campfire with only the things around him. His concern mainly focussed on attracting any enemies, knowing that the fire would burn far and bright into the dark of night. Unfamiliar with his surroundings, he knew nothing of where the Soviet and Finnish troops were placed and wanted to take no chances.Zhang Heng had no idea where his enemies might come from. He also didn't know where the skirmishes constantly broke out between those troops, only hanging on the hope that he wouldn't end up in the crossfire. It was at that moment that he realized how cruel reality could be. Struggling to stay alive, all alone in the forest and in a time of war, was no easy feat.Luckily, he still had his trump card, and that was his Shadow Moment. Turning into shadow-form for three minutes could save his life during a life-threatening moment. Unfortunately, he could only use it two times, which was why he was sparing in its usage.Unable to bear the cold, he attempted to look for a spot that could shield him from the freezing winds. Covered by the military jacket, he tried to sleep. Throughout the entire night, he was rudely awakened by the chill at least three times. The winter of 1939 in Finland was brutal, ranked among the top 10 harshest winters the entire human history had seen. Without fire, saying that it would be a challenge to stay alive was an understatement.If it were not for the Soviet goatskin military jacket, Zhang Heng knew that the extreme blizzard would eventually freeze him to death. After a long, frigid night, Zhang Heng finally saw the sun rising. With his frostbitten hands trembling, he picked a few twigs and used the lighter, fumbling around a few times before he got a flame. His hands were stiff and unresponsive. He had left half a kettle of water in front of him before he slept. Now, the water was completely frozen.Zhang Heng had no choice but to place the kettle as close as possible, the fire to melt the ice. In the meantime, he took the sausage from his backpack and roasted it over the flames. Ten minutes later, everything that he set out to do had been done. He then stood up and used the ice around him to extinguish the flames, making sure to stub out all the cinders.Putting a fire out in these places was surely more straightforward than starting it up. At the same time, he ate the sausage that was just ready. It didn't taste as bad as he initially expected, probably because he paired it with the black bread. Who knew what it was made of. One thing for sure, it was meat but wasn't pork, beef, or lamb. Still, it was edible.As he ate, Zhang Heng wasted no time and planned his next move though, after long and hard deliberation, he was still unable to come up with anything to make his current circumstance better.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That was it. Putting on the backpack, Zhang Heng randomly chose a direction and headed towards it. From where he lived, numerous war enthusiasts were extremely knowledgeable about World War II. They had an in-depth understanding of various war and deployment tactics and regularly debated the multiple strategies of famed generals.As for Zhang Heng, he had zero knowledge about warfare. Unless the spirit of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim or Kliment Voroshilov himself possessed him, there wasn't much he could do to improve his current predicament.There are eventually no heroes in war, said an inconvenient truth. Whether it was a person who achieved great feats or a soldier with masterful shooting skills, a stray could take away their lives within a matter of seconds. To increase his chances of survival, Zhang Heng set a principle for himself, and that was to stay as far away as possible from any crossfire. Places like Vyborg, Summa Village, and Kael were a no-no, and he had to refrain from going there. As for the replica Ouvrage Schoenenbourg - Mannerheim, that would be the last place on earth that Zhang Heng would go.His biggest problem was that he didn't know where the hell he was right now. Though he wanted to make sure to stay far away from the heat of battle, he had no idea where the safe zone was either. After traveling on foot for about half a day, Zhang Heng came across a platoon of Soviet soldiers. Thankfully, he spotted them first and quickly went into hiding. It seemed like the soldiers were in a rush, huffing their way while dragging a couple of cannons behind them. Amid the confusion, none of them realized Zhang Heng's presence, although he was right under their noses. It was so close a call, a deep chill ran up his spine.The trees in the forest were the perfect spot to conceal himself from the enemy. Protection, on the one hand, the trees also blocked him from seeing what was in front of him. Being in a situation out of his control made him extremely uncomfortable. After all, no one in this world was always lucky. It would be impossible that Zhang Heng would spot his enemies first before they spotted him every single time.In all honesty, he was on the disadvantageous side during this quest. There were few skills he possessed that could help him to survive in the wild. Playing the piano, modifying cars, and racing was basically useless in these circumstances.As for his Level 2 archery skills, it turned out to be more practical than the gun that he was holding right now. Sadly though, he had still not found the right bark to carve out his bowstring. Besides, using cold, passive weapons against hot firearms was definitely a bad idea.After experiencing the frosty winter in Finland, Zhang Heng started to doubt if he might even wake from his sleep the next time. It had only been three days since his arrival, with a grueling 137 days to go.Zhang Heng felt despair sinking in, and it hit him hard.He knew that he wouldn't survive much longer if he kept this up. He could choose to side with Finland's troops or the Soviet Union's troops, but he had no idea what they would do to him. In the end, Zhang Heng still could not make up his mind. Until the morning of the fourth day, Zhang Heng heard gunshots once again. And this time, the thunderous sound of cannons resounded in the forest as well. Sensing imminent danger, Zhang Heng decided that he would head in a different direction.It seemed as if he had used up the last bits of his luck this time. After paying so much attention to the sound of gunfire, he completely forgot to notice t what was in front of him. This time, he encountered a scout team! There were only 11 well-equipped soldiers in the group and should be returning to the base since they heard the gunfire. The encounter with Zhang Heng was totally a coincidence to them. Clearly, nobody expected this to happen.Unfortunately, Zhang Heng did not have his Shadow Moment at hand, as he wanted to avoid triggering it while he traveled. He also did not expect to encounter enemies from such a close distance. He initially thought he would have a little time to search for the statue that was located in the pocket of his coat. The scout team stood by with their guns loaded. If they wanted to, they could open fire at Zhang Heng anytime now.In the end, Zhang Heng owed his life to the military coat. Obviously, they would never shoot somebody wearing their own colors. However, they soon realized that Zhang Heng's attire was way different as compared to what they were wearing. They also noticed that he was of Asian descent.The soldier that stood in front was swinging his machine gun as he shouted at the same time. Unfortunately, Zhang Heng was not familiar with Russian, thus, unable to understand what they were talking about. For now, he had to give up the idea of getting Shadow Moment out of his pocket. Left with no other options, Zhang Heng was forced to put both hands up.Seemingly, his continued silence had annoyed the soldier. The Soviet soldier's looked more and more ferocious by the second as he repeated the same words to Zhang Heng with his finger placed on the trigger, each time with greater intensity.This was probably the most perilous moment Zhang Heng had ever encountered. In a situation like this, he did know what he could do anymore. This was war. Killing and being killed were extremely common in an era like this. With every passing second, multitudes of civilians, enemies, and even allies died on the battlefield. The war had put everyone on edge most of the time, and no one would have qualms killing an unknown foreigner. Even Zhang Heng himself expected that the soldier would surely pull the trigger on him.Suddenly, the soldier that was pointing his gun fell to the ground with a loud thud!A bullet that came from nowhere penetrated his cranium. Blood splattered everywhere; his ferocious looks now plastered on his face forever.Sniper!!!Immediately, the scout team realized they were being ambushed by the Finnish guerillas. In a panic, they ignored Zhang Heng, pointed their machine guns at the direction the bullet came from, and shouted frantically to take cover. This one soldier put his life on the line to pick up a machine gun on the road. Unfortunately, the shell traveled faster than him. The moment his hands landed on the machine gun, he too was shot dead. He collapsed and joined his dead ally.The second shot allowed the others to have a more unobstructed view of where the bullet came from. Without thinking twice, they started opening fire with full force at the sniper! Zhang Heng wasted no time and took the opportunity to run to a fallen tree that had been struck by lightning.The sniper who had hidden in the dark managed to kill another two soldiers that failed to look for a safe spot to hide. After that, the gunshots abruptly stopped.Was the sniper hit?The Soviets were extraordinarily jumpy and nervous, pulling the trigger and firing another barrage of bullets into the dark!Half a minute later, someone cautiously lifted his head to check his surroundings. There were no more gunshots. The remaining soldiers arched backward, bearing the weight of their machine guns while slowly approaching the sniper's location. At the same time, two soldiers walked towards Zhang Heng.Zhang Heng was already holding his Shadow Moment in his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, as luck would have it, something unexpected happened again. The deafening bang of the sniper rifle firing could be heard loud and clear. The first soldier that walked towards sniper was hit, subsequently dropping to the ground, dead. Seconds later, the second soldier was also greeted with the same fate. Immediately, the remaining five soldiers lay on the ground and started blindly shooting in all directions! The two soldiers who had walked towards Zhang Heng quickly turned around and joined their allies in support.Unfortunately, their retaliation did not stop death from harvesting their lives. The sniper hiding in the dark had already switched his nest. In other words, the Soviets were shooting at a ghost! Subsequently, another three soldiers were hit. The remaining two soldiers could not handle the pressure of suspense any longer, throwing their weapons to the ground and ran into the forest for their lives while the sniper was reloading his gun.One of them ran for a bit when a deafening gunshot rang through the air. Apparently, 150 meters was not nearly enough to save his life from a long-range rifle. The soldier slipped on his tracks and fell down, very dead indeed. Blood gushed from the back of his head, painting the white snow around him in an ominous pool of red.In about four minutes, a total of 11 Soviet soldiers were killed mercilessly in this cold, alien land. The sniper that hid in the dark did not even waste a single bullet. For the shooter, it was all about the one shot-one skill thing.Immediately, Zhang Fan poured out everything from his backpack and picked up a tree branch beside him. He attempted to raise the twig with the bag to signal the sniper that he was willing to surrender. Just as he was about to wave the white flag, the backpack was hit by the bullet! This was a clear sign that the sniper had no intention to let anyone leave the forest alive.Zhang Heng presumed the coat he had put on caused the sniper to mistake him for a Soviet soldier. Unfortunately, Zhang Heng did not speak their language, making it impossible to explain himself. It became evident that the sniper didn't shoot the Soviets to save him. As the soldiers were focussed on Zhang Heng, it made them easy targets for the sniper!This particular sniper was brazenly confident and scary at the same time. From the way he eliminated his enemies, he had made sure to first kill the soldier that posed the biggest threat. After that, he shot the one attempting to pick up the machine gun on the ground. His success in the killings had managed to instill great fear in the remaining soldiers, confusing them and lowering morale.After that, all he needed to do was to change his shooting spot and kill the rest of the Soviets.Though the remaining two soldiers had lost their will to fight, the sniper was no less determined that he was going to kill each and every enemy that appeared through his scope. Instead of choosing the nearest target, he chose to kill the target furthest away from him. Then, it was all textbook, as the shooter just needed to tackle the poor sod that was running at the back.As for Zhang Heng, the sniper decided that he posed no threat. Hence, he had decided to kill him last. While he was shooting down his enemies, he had presented with deadly accuracy, his accomplished shooting skills and how he stayed calm while being meticulous all at once.It was at that moment that Zhang Heng realized his situation was no better than before. He was still being pushed to the edge of a cliff. The only thing that had changed was the enemy. It changed not for the better but from the Soviet soldiers to Finnish guerilla fighters. The 11 dead bodies on the ground had proven that Finland was way better at their craft than good ol' Soviet Union.The longer he waited, the more dangerous the situation would become. It became apparent that the sniper was extremely familiar with this forest. That would mean he could walk up and shoot Zhang Heng right behind him before he realized it. Hence, Zhang Heng made a quick resolve to do something about it. He held the wooden statue in one hand and held the revolver in the other. In his mind's eye, he was thinking about the crow.Seconds later, the crow in the dark slowly opened its eyes, and Zhang Heng stared right into them. He could feel his soul gradually being absorbed into an endless dark vortex, free-falling in a black void that was formless. The magical part about it was his body getting lighter, almost like a feather floating in the wind. When he landed, he opened his eyes, and he saw the white birch and snow above him. Though he had experienced all of this before, he would never get used to this strange, out of body experience. He became disorientated and unhinged as he entered Shadow Moment form.Zhang Heng's body was now completely disappeared. All that was left was his shadow on the ground. In this form, he would not be able to use his senses, neither would he be able to talk or listen to sounds around him. His vision was limited to a patch of sky above him. He had, however, discovered a solution to overcome this problem. All he needed to do was attach his shadow to a tree, and he would able to scan his surroundings.His speed was greatly reduced when he entered shadow form, but he felt more energetic than ever. Fatigue was a thing of the past. The good thing here was that he did not need to worry about the barrier that blocked his way. With all things considered, his movement speed was not bad at all.He took 50 seconds to travel to the location where the last gunshot came from and used another 20 seconds to look for the shooting point. The ground had a slight elevation to it and had two giant rocks to protect the sniper. Clear marks on the ground signified that someone lay there only a moment ago.Clearly, the sniper had abandoned the hideout and shifted to another location. This time, a series of footprints marked the ground. Zhang Heng was now the hunter instead of the hunted. Half a minute went by, and Zhang Heng saw a being shuffling slowly on the snow-covered ground. It was near impossible to spot it if one did not pay attention.The sniper was wearing a white ghillie suit with a mask on him. His entire body was fully covered except for his eyes, a perfect blend with the whited-out forest. One of his hands clutched the sniper, and another held a snowboard.It was just as Zhang Heng had guessed! The sniper was planning to sneak him up and kill him from behind. He would never have guessed that his target was the one actually standing right behind him.All these guerilla techniques had given the Soviets an endless nightmare, continually messing around with the worn-out Slavs. They relied heavily on their effective camouflage and the knowledge of the area to choose a perfect spot to take out their enemies. This time, their expertise was about to be challenged by Zhang Heng.In shadow form, Zhang Heng could tail the sniper without making any noise. Long, overbearing shadows of the huge trees around him also added an extra layer of cover. Zhang Heng lifted up the revolver and aimed at the sniper's head.There were only ten seconds left before the shadow form expired. Once the time was up, he would be able to pull the trigger and kill the sniper. As this was his first time killing a person, he naturally hesitated for a bit. Unfortunately, there was no other way around it if he wanted to live to see another day. The sniper's shooting prowess and innate knowledge of the terrain would make it impossible for Zhang Heng to get away even if he had a three-minute head start!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, the sniper which lay on the ground waiting for his victim to pop his head was definitely a cut above Zhang Heng. He had read before that most of the guerillas in Finland were once hunter-gatherers. They knew these grounds they stepped on with their very souls, spending their entire childhood in a forest like this to hunt down small animals. Even though their targets had since changed from animals to humans, it was no doubt that the same methods still applied. This made them very, very good at what they did.Unfortunately, this was no fair game. When the crow appeared in the dark again, everything would come to an end. Zhang Heng had his finger placed steadily on the trigger as he prepared himself mentally to vanquish the target in front of him.Suddenly, the sniper rolled to his side! Zhang Heng was taken aback in a jump-scare, knowing there was no noise from his surroundings. Finish! His worst fears had come to pass! Alas, his shadow form had been found out by the sniper.It was then that he saw the bullet landing on the snow-caked ground. With his lightning-fast reflexes, the sniper managed to dodge the first round of attack!Immediately, he pointed his weapon in a different direction and pulled the trigger. Zhang Heng then realized another weakness of the shadow form. The sunlight shining from a particular side would mean Zhang Heng's shadow was also fixed in a certain direction. Though he could attach his shadow on a tree to observe his surroundings, he could only look to the right, left, and front. There was, however, no way that he could look at his back. Even if he turned around, he would only see the tree bark.The only thing he knew right now was that the deafening gunshot would have undoubtedly drawn the attention of Soviet soldiers nearby. However, he had no idea what their strength was and how far they were. The thing that troubled him the most was that his shadow form was about to expire. He had around ten seconds left before he would be ultimately revealed!Right now, Zhang Heng wasn't bothered to kill the sniper anymore. The only thing on his mind was making sure that he wouldn't be caught between the impending exchange of fire. Without wasting any time, he swiftly left the trees and bolted away from the sniper as fast as possible! Then, he attached his shadow to another tree.Zhang Heng wished that he could run further away from the snipe,r but his time was running out. He knew for a fact that if the Soviets won the fight, he would still be spared the chance to get away safely. However, if the sniper won the fight, this would be the last day he breathed on this earth.Rather than be killed like helpless prey, Zhang Heng resolved that he would fight for his life. The place that he chose to hide was only a meter away from the sniper. At such close proximity, it would be hard for the sharp-shooter to kill effectively. Besides, there was a high chance that Zhang Heng would not miss his target when shooting at point-blank even though he was still new to guns.In about four seconds, he would reappear again. Nevertheless, the battle on the other side heated up pretty fast. A hailstorm of bullets landed on the tree that Zhang Heng was attached to, and he clearly saw shards of wood flying all over! Clearly, the soldiers that had just arrived were more ferocious than the scout team, which seemed docile at this point.Having seen what the sniper was capable of doing, Zhang Heng believed that he wouldn't allow the soldiers shooting so wildly at him to live too long. Judging by the sound of continuous gunfire from the machine gun, the number of soldiers that came to kill the sniper was hell lot more than he expected. Once the soldiers on the frontline were killed by the sniper, they would simply send another batch of conscripts to attack him.However, it seemed like the sniper had found a perfect nest to return fire. He waited for a short while before firing. The miraculous part about all of it was that he was about to kill an enemy each time he fired his gun.In the meantime, Zhang Heng had to control his breathing, not making a single move to avoid being detected. After a round of violent shooting, the Soviet side seemed weakened\u2014the constant staccato of guns firing reduced to intermittent bursts. In contrast, the sniper still had the upper hand. From the start to the end, he was like a killing machine, mauling every living being in front of him without any mercy.Suddenly, the 'killing machine' fell silent. Zhang Heng knew that he was running out of bullets. This sniper had just been through two fierce battles and had probably been assigned a different target before he got here. Logically, he should be running out of ammunition by now.This had complicated the whole situation. Of course, he had never hoped for such a terrifying sniper to roam the forests, looking for someone to kill. Initially, he thought that there were only two outcomes from this standoff. If the sniper was killed by the Soviets, he would run as fast as possible to get away from them. If the sniper managed to kill all those soldiers, then he would sneak behind the sniper and pull the trigger on him.The only outcome that he did not think of was the depletion of ammunition. Since the sniper had run out of bullets, the soldiers would know this and attempt to approach the sniper.The place that Zhang Heng was hiding at was really close to the sniper. When they shot at each other, they would definitely not notice his presence. However, once the fight was over, either the soldiers or the sniper would definitely see something escaping.\u2026\u2026The sniper leaned on a large rock. He must have realized how improbable it would be to get out of this alive. He took out the dagger strapped to his waist and prepared to fight for his life. Suddenly, a stone rolled by his feet! In an instant, he spotted a Soviet soldier creeping up from behind the tree prompting the sniper to pick up his weapon unconsciously!To his surprise, the soldier signaled him to stay quiet. Half a minute ago, Zhang Heng assumed that this could be a golden opportunity for him to save himself. After spending four days all alone in the forest, he quickly realized it would be impossible for him to live here for hundreds of days. Be it the Finnish or the Soviets, Zhang Heng had no quarrel with them, really.Based on experience, these people would never give him the chance to explain himself. They would usually point their guns at him before he could say anything. And the worst part was, Zhang Heng did not know how to speak their language. Now that the sniper had run out of ammunition, Zhang Heng felt that this was the perfect moment to make a move!He first pointed at the red stars on his coat, then at himself, then waved his hands. He was trying to tell the sniper that he had nothing to do with the Soviets. Unfortunately, the gestures did not promt a response from the sniper. Zhang Heng then took off the coat to show him his black turtleneck and jeans. In the end, the sniper's attention was caught by the revolver that Zhang Heng had with him.Zhang Heng knew that there was no time for this kind of back and forth with the shooter. He could hear that the boots of the Soviets approaching them. Clearly, there was more than one of them. He couldn't possibly deal with them alone. In a critical moment such as this, a leap of faith was a necessity.Once again, Zhang Heng clutched the wooden statue in his hand to prepare for any unforeseen circumstances. He then drew the revolver and tossed it to the sniper. This time, the shooter actually responded by picking the weapon! He pointed at Zhang Heng aggressively, threatening to let out a shot.After a second, he lowered the pistol.Zhang Heng let out a massive sigh of relief. It seemed that his leap of faith had finally borne fruit! He removed his phone from his pocket. For the past few days, he had tried his best to conserve battery, only using it sparingly to get his bearings. Otherwise, he would turn it off. Right now, it was the best time for him to use it to distract his enemies. He set a quick alarm and tossed it far away from him.Like a grenade, three seconds later, the cellphone blared on the snowy ground, instantly drawing the soldiers' attention! The sniper then popped half of his head out, aiming for the Soviets!The first shot was a blank. Zhang Heng had to prioritize his own safety. He had to consider the possibility of the sniper killing him when he gave him his gun. That was why he swapped the first bullet with a blank. Not about to take any more chances, he would instantly change into shadow form if the sniper did pull the trigger on him.Shocked by the blank shot, he immediately fired the second shot, bursting a soldier's head open with a splatter of bright blood!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, he squatted behind a tree and waited for it to be all over. The skirmish ended faster than expected. Once the skilled sniper had a gun in his hand, he killed three Soviet soldiers within a swift 40 seconds.Once the barrage of gunshots were over, Zhang Heng stealthily emerged from his hiding spot. The sniper still clutched the revolver in his hand tightly, albeit, seemingly a little more relaxed now as he did not aim the gun at Zhang Heng.When Zhang Heng walked towards the sniper, he noticed that there was blood on his shirt. It was apparent now that in the heat of the shootout, he didn't manage to dodge all the bullets. Zhang Heng came to realize that indeed, it was not easy for him to meet someone without hostile intentions. He had to figure out a way to bring him back to his base, no matter what. All his effort would have gone to waste if he let him die here.Zhang Heng picked up his cellphone and turned off the alarm, noticing a sea of empty shells strewn all over the ground. Remarkably, and thankfully so, his cellphone was perfectly fine. He then proceeded to collect the backpacks of the dead soldiers. As his current supplies were almost depleted, he had to stock up well to stay alive in this inhospitable land. He had his eyes fixed on the sniper, who nodded his head at him. He was staring at the bullet case that was strapped to the dead soldier's waist.Immediately, Zhang Heng grabbed two magazines and passed it to him. Without a second thought, he reloaded his machine gun. Putting pressure on his wound with one hand, he mustered all his strength to stand up with the other. Two fierce battles had just taken place here, and the sound of continuous gunshots had probably attracted more enemies. They had to leave this place as soon as possible, or this time, they would surely die.Zhang Heng picked a backpack and brought it with him. He, too didn't let up on the chance to pick up a machine gun. Seeing that the sniper was having a hard time walking, Zhang Heng instinctively walked over in an attempt to assist him. However, it seemed like he wanted no help, shaking his head and pushing away Zhang Heng's hand.Zhang Heng was displeased by the response, knowing well enough it wasn't the best time to play Rambo. Zhang Heng needed him to point him in the right direction if they wanted to survive this forest. Also, without Zhang Heng's help, it would be tough for the severely wounded sniper to walk out of the woods alive. Both of them were in a tight spot now and had no choice but to rely on each other to get through this.After a while, the sniper started to understand Zhang Heng's intention. This time, he allowed Zhang Heng to prop him up. With an arm supporting his body, they both took the slow walk towards the direction that the sniper pointed to.On the way, Zhang Heng saw countless bodies of Soviet troops. An armored personnel carrier lay in pieces beside the road, still burning with fury. There were also bodies of a few Finnish guerillas with their winter camouflage thrown all over on the ground as well. One could only see how much hatred the Soviets must have harbored toward the Finnish guerillas. Zhang Heng needed a change of coat, but sadly, most of the ones on the bodies were riddled with bullet holes. Some even had powder burns on them, leaving huge, smoldering holes.Anybody passing them now would have found it extremely peculiar to see a duo made up of an Asian and a Finnish. To make matters worse, they looked completely out of place, like they didn't belong to his forest.For the forthcoming days, they would constantly see dead bodies on the ground and incessant gunfire from afar. This time the gunfire did not last long. Again, it didn't look too safe anymore. The gunfire could have been a signal for the Soviets to help their allies. Then, in turn, the Finnish guerilla snipers would use the opportunity to clear all their enemies.Their snowboards had allowed them to move effectively in the forest, and they were not about to stop unless absolutely necessary. As they cruised through the snow-caked forest, they saw large numbers of Soviet soldiers killed in many different ways. However realistic an award-winning film would shamefully fade in comparison to the unimaginable horrors that lay before them.Zhang Heng had mentally prepared himself to witness all the dead. Despite that, he felt awfully unwell after witnessing so much death in one go. The horrifying scene was a violent assault on one's senses, where war represented the worst of humanity. It also represented what would become of the frail-minded human after civilization had been so carelessly tossed away. Soldiers had regressed to their carnal instincts, to kill and protect in its most basic of forms. Looking at the sniper beside him, Zhang Heng instantly knew that the purgatory around them had almost no effect on him. He was simply used to it.As they traveled on, they came across two Soviet troops. They managed to evade them, only lucky that they were not spotted first. They even encountered a Soviet soldier that moved alone. His allies were most likely killed in action and he was lucky to flee the battlefield alive. His spirit seemed broken, his face emotionless, lifeless even from all he had gone through. Having no weapons and trudging barefooted, there was a high chance he would end up dead in this forest if his allies failed to find him.Zhang Heng saw that he was getting further and further away from him, hence deciding to just let him be. Seconds later, he heard a gunshot! The sniper's hand was on the trigger of the machine gun and was no longer covering the wound! He had shot the soldier in cold blood.When the sound of gunfire reverberating in the air, the Soviet soldier slowly stopped moving and collapsed beside a pine tree. Zhang Heng then looked the sniper in the eyes, searching for answers. He did the same as well, not batting an eyelid. His eyes were dead, with not an ounce of emotion left in them.\"\u2026\u2026..\"Zhang Heng was left speechless. If he was a soldier during the invasion of Japan, he would have shot any Japanese soldier if he ever encountered one. All these Finnish guerillas only had one goal in mind,, and that was to protect their people and country. For these reasons, Zhang Heng felt he had no right to criticize him.The gunshot, however, would have again attracted more enemies to them, the last thing Zhang Heng wanted. It wasn't time to play the blame game here. Besides, the sniper wouldn't understand a word even if he scolded him. It would be more beneficial for them to figure out a way to get out of this sticky situation.Zhang Heng landed his eyes on the snowboard behind the sniper's back. Voila!Five minutes later, they tied all their goods on the snowboard, and Zhang Heng tied a rope at the end of it for the sniper to pull on it later. He then squatted down in front of him. Strangely, it seemed as if the sniper understood what he was trying to do. Immediately, he jumped on Zhang Heng's back and let him carry him.When Zhang Heng stood up, he was surprised that the sniper was a lot lighter than he'd expected, probably weighing a tiny 100 pounds. They could finally move faster now. The only downside about this idea was that Zhang Heng's stamina, and strength depleted a lot more quickly than he hoped it would. He could only do this for around 20 minutes.Thank goodness they were out of the danger zone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was well-rested, having caught quite a few naps throughout the entire journey. The good news was he did not encounter any Soviets while they traveled. It seemed he had finally escaped the warzone.After some time, the sniper tapped his shoulder, signifying him to stop. So, he stopped walking, looked for a clean stone, and carefully set the wounded man down. Though he could not see his face, Zhang Heng knew that he was in great pain just by looking at his saddened eyes. The patch of blood on his stomach was getting bigger by the minute. Although he had no problems moving around when Zhang Heng carried him earlier, the bumpy ride had aggravated his condition. And here he was, again, choosing to say nothing about it.Suddenly, Zhang Heng had a bad feeling!Immediately, he took a look at his surroundings and realized that they were still in the middle of nowhere. Initially, he thought the sniper would lead them back to his base. They should have at least came across one of his allies, but judging by his current condition, he could die bleeding out any second now if he did not get any medical help.If he died here right now, it would be useless for Zhang Heng to locate the guerilla base. They would definitely shoot him on sight if they saw him alone. This wasn't the time to worry about what might happen next. Right now, he needed to make sure the sniper was kept alive.Realizing the gravity of the situation the sniper was in, he wasted no time and looked for fallen branches hoping to start a campfire. It would help ensure the cold wouldn't get to the wounded man. Luckily, twigs were aplenty, and the fire was started, much to the relief of the freezing men. Zhang Heng melted some snow in a canteen, quenching their badly scorched throats.They soon settled down, under the warmth of the flames. The sniper groaned in pain but looked slightly more comfortable. Phew! After a short moment of doubt, the sniper had finally decided that it was safe to take off his white face mask, which he had worn all the while.What Zhang Heng saw left him startled in shock. The sniper was actually a girl with a golden lock of hair. Judging by her appearance, it seemed she had only just reached adulthood! It was mind-boggling for Zhang Heng to imagine such a young-looking girl was capable of so efficiently harvesting the lives of battle-hardened soldiers, reaping away every soul she wished dead!Suddenly, he remembered that during the winter war, Finland had conscripted three million of their people to fight off the Soviet Union. The number of soldiers that were willing to fight and protect their county was more than that of Japan and Germany combined, ready to do whatever it took to chase out the invaders from their country.Of the many definitions of bravery one could find in a book, this, in my opinion, was its highest form. Zhang Heng stared at the sniper as she slowly sipped the warm water in her hands. Without saying a word, he then took out two sausages from his bag and placed it over the fire. However, the sniper simply shook her head, indicating that she d. It was an awkward moment for them.Right now, Zhang Heng was left in a dilemma. It was now virtually impossible for the sniper to continue the journey. This was no action movie, but rather cruel reality. In the movies, soldiers would usually extract the bullet from their wounds after they were shot. On a real battlefield, on the other hand, no one would attempt such a dangerous feat. Festering wounds and infections were a major concern. The biggest problem that one could encounter while attempting a bullet extraction from an open wound was the bleeding problem. Seeing that she had lost a huge amount of blood on the way here, it was definitely not the brightest idea to extract the bullet out of her right now.Zhang Heng had to re-assess the current situation. Should he stay here to take care of her or leave her alone? Right now, was both of them were like different species, unable to communicate with each other. All they could do was use simple sign language to tell each other their intentions. Right now, he had no idea how far still the guerilla base camp was, not even knowing whether they were heading in the right direction.Despite her grave wounds, the female sniper looked really calm. Zhang Heng guessed that she must have come up with a solution to overcome this problem or she was prepared to die here. Of course, he secretly hoped that she had an idea to get them out of this sticky situation. However, judging by the way things were turning out, it was more likely that she was ready to die here.\u2026\u2026..The night was arriving, as the sun shone its last light. Zhang Heng chose not to leave her side in the end. After dinner, he went picking more tree branches to keep the campfire burning through the night. He then poured out half of his backpack out and placed it under the female sniper's head to act as a pillow.After all that was done, Zhang Heng took out his machine gun, attempting to study it. He tried to reload it and aim for a couple of inanimate objects lying around.To be honest, Zhang Heng was never a fan of killing. Unfortunately, he needed to learn how to protect himself in such an environment. Although he knew he would probably be unable to pull the trigger even fo he encountered the Soviets, this wasn't enough of an excuse to simply just give up.At the same time, the female sniper eyed him intently. At times, Zhang Heng felt that this could not have been a person but a log. This was because only a log could forever keep its calm. She had been through a whole lot but had never once unveiled a single ounce of emotion.Under the twinkling night sky, the flames of the campfire danced with the wind. After playing with his machine gun for a bit, he suddenly noticed something amiss about the sniper. Her skin had grown much paler, and all her lips were white, devoid of color. Her forehead was wet with beads of cold sweat, and her body was shaking nonstop. Zhang Heng instantly felt her feet and hands, discovering that they were like pieces of frozen meat. Her body was losing temperature, descending into hypothermia.Bloodloss had caused most of the heat in her body to slip away, especially her red blood cells. Hemoglobin's main function was the vehicle transferring oxygen to the entire body. Once their count had dropped drastically, one's body would fail to function normally. If such a situation were to occur, no amount of warm clothes could keep her alive.Surely, she could be saved if she was admitted to a hospital right now, getting a crucial blood transfusion. Unfortunately, they were now in the depths of a forest. There was nothing Zhang Heng could do to save her. Left with no other options, Zhang Heng removed his clothes and hugged her, hoping to share body heat and revitalize the dying girl.The female sniper simply looked at him, not knowing what to think or how to react. She didn't push him away, though. Perhaps she knew her time was near and was the verge of dying. As for Zhang Heng, he did not harbor any sexual desires towards her. After all, the both of them had not showered for several days. The body odor and the stench of blood were enough to put off the strongest of libidinous innuendo. Besides, a piece of cloth wrapped around her chest.Their skin rubbed on each other, sharing no distance and seemingly more intimate than certain rambunctious lovers. Despite all that, they did now know each other's names. Due to the language barrier, the two of them could still not communicate with each other using words. All they could do was to remain silent.\u2026\u2026.Zhang Heng had managed to maintain her body temperature but could not give her back the lost blood. As time passed, the female sniper's condition worsened. Her shallow breathing became rapid, and her pulse was erratic. Zhang Heng knew deep down that she might not be able to survive the night.Then, all of a sudden, he heard a crunch!Bell had taught Zhang Heng to scatter some dried tree branches around him as an alarm when it was night time. It seemed like someone had stepped on the loose twigs. He instantly jumped up and wanted to grab his machine gun. To his surprise, the person was already squatting down beside the campfire, pointing a machine gun at him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Game points: +5. For more information, check out the character panel\u2026]Zhang Heng had only heard the sound of the notification when he spotted the little wooden cottages in the forest. Before he could take a good look at it, someone had already pointed a gun at his back!Zhang Heng was pretty sure that whoever it was, the trigger would be inevitably pulled this time. Just before he could, however, the sniper shouted at him! Startled, the shooter flinched, preventing the killing from happening. However, he did not take him sights off Zhang Heng.The calvary finally had finally arrived!It was the Finnish, allies of the sniper! Soon after that, a few more came over to help her. One of them stayed back to look after her while the rest proceeded to chop some wood to make a simple stretcher to carry her back to the base.The man with the machine gun picked up the Soviet clothes on the floor and tossed them to Zhang Heng. However, the soldier had taken away the inner coat, only leaving him the outer jacket made out of goatskin. Zhang Heng said nothing and simply put it on.He could see that the members of the guerilla resistance did not trust him at all. If it were not for the female sniper, they would have killed him without even thinking twice. Fortunately for Zhang Heng, they took care of their own first, realizing the sniper needed immediate medical attention. Knowing that there was no time to waste, they carried her back to their camp right away, even with Zhang Heng, the stranger, following behind.After walking through thick snow and ice for an hour and a half, they finally arrived at base camp. Two fighters carried the stretcher and entered the small wooden house on the left. As for Zhang Heng, he was being locked inside another cottage. As Zhang Heng's eyes adjusted to the dark confinement space, he saw the entire place filled with lumber. He realized he must be in a wood storage house.His captors locked the room right away after they made him go inside. They even frisked him and confiscated everything they deemed a threat. His inner coat, machine gun, backpack, cellphone, and wallet were all taken from him. Through the cracks of the wooden walls, Zhang Heng saw that few of the fighters were checking out his Huawei cellphone.In this era, cellphones had not been invented yet. After curiously playing with it for a long time, none of them could figure out how to turn the curious device on. One of them even hit it on a tree. Compared to the somewhat unpopular cellphone, everyone wanted to own the wallet.Even the most ordinary of wallets from the modern era would be considered a masterpiece in 1944. Besides, Zhang Heng's wallet cost a few hundred Yuan. And for the inner coat, the soldier that pointed the machine gun at Zhang Heng was already wearing it. His burly and muscular body turned the tiny garment into a skin-tight shirt.The weirdest part was, no one laid their hands on the analog watch. Logically, watches like that should worth quite a bit in this era. As if invisible, it seemed like none of them noticed it.Zhang Heng soon learned that this was a rather large base camp. Originally a lumber mill, the guerillas had converted it into their base of operations. Hidden deep within the secluded forest, they became almost undetectable by their enemies. Through the tiny gap, Zhang Heng saw that there were seven of them. It was late at night, and most of them were asleep in the other cottages.The guerillas were infamously most active at night. They would launch surprise attacks at their Soviet counterparts while they were fast asleep. Zhang Heng once watched a documentary, where an ex-guerrilla shared his experiences. They claimed that the Soviets would lose their will to fight once the guerillas hit them in the dark. The few Soviet soldiers sitting around the campfire watched their allies being killed right before their eyes and did nothing about it.Judging by the size of this camp, there were at least 40 to 50 souls living here. In order to prevent another gross misunderstanding, Zhang Heng decided that he should stop peeking at them. He then looked for a corner, lay on the ground, and closed his eyes.Around 20 minutes later, two guerillas opened the door and entered the storage. This time, they weren't pointing their guns at Zhang Heng. After what seemed like an instruction to him in Finnish, they moved him to another unit. Of course, Zhang Heng would not be so dumb as to incriminate himself, so, he simply did what they asked him to do.The wooden house that he entered this time was different than the storage unit. This cottage looked more like a real living space, equipped with a wooden bed, chairs, tables, and a cozy looking fireplace. A man with thick mustache sat behind the table.He put away the map on the table as he saw Zhang Heng entering the room. He then used his hand as a signal for him to sit down.Zhang Heng guessed that this man probably was the commander of the guerilla armies. There was also another person standing at the window and smoking. Zhang Heng could not clearly see who this person was since the back was turned. All he knew was that the person was a woman in her thirties or forties.Once Zhang Heng sat down, the mustached man demanded him to talk.\"I must apologize. I don't know how to speak in your language.\"For good measure, Zhang Heng repeated the sentence in Mandarin, English, and Japanese. Still, the man could not understand what he was trying to say. After some time, he grew impatient. Suddenly, the woman that was smoking broke her silence.\"Are you a spy from the Soviet Union?\" asked the woman in English.She was the first person that could communicate with him ever since he took this quest! He finally could let out a sigh of relief. The thing that worried him the most was the communication barrier he had suffered since apparating here. Without efficient communication, he would be unable to take control of his current situation. At least, he could now defend himself.\"Kliment Voroshilov might be stupid, but I don't think he is dumb enough to send us a Chinese spy that doesn't speak Finnish.\"\"I'm not too sure about that. After all, some people can't even differentiate between a loaf of bread and a bomb,\" said the woman as she stubbed out the cigarette.This time, she turned around and looked at Zhang Feng. This woman must have been incredibly gorgeous when she was younger. Or, should I say, still rather dazzling for her age. Some simply had the power to defy the physics of the chronometer. After that, she looked at the man with the mustache. The man only smiled and left the house after.\"Ah Ji is not a bad person. This is a very critical period. He's responsible for all those under him.\"\"I can understand that,\" said Zhang Heng.\"No. You can't, and I can't either. His country is being invaded by enemies right now. To protect his motherland, he is willing to do whatever it takes, even if it means going to hell itself. What you see is what you get, 'guv. I'm a volunteer from England. I should inform you that I am different from these people. I don't wish to see bloodshed. For me to help you, I will need you to tell me the truth,\" said the woman while drawing another stick of Craven A.As she bent down, Zhang Heng took a glimpse at her cleavage. He had to say; this woman was really something. If he was indeed a spy of the Soviet Union, he would have definitely spilled all the beans. Unfortunately, the truth was concealed within the most ridiculous of answers. In this war, Zhang Heng was indeed an outsider who had nothing to do with it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Questions liked why he was here, was there someone else with him, was he a communist\u2026 Zhang Heng answered all her questions honestly. For the past few days, he did not just loiter in the forest. While traveling, he had been carefully planning how he could handle a situation like this if he ever got into one.Hence, the woman could not fault him. Throughout the conversation, Zhang Heng managed to acquire some information about her as well. Her name was Maji, a surgeon. After the feminist movement, women's status in society greatly improved. Despite all that, it was a rarity for a woman to become a surgeon in this era. After graduation, Maji had to leave her motherland for Switzerland, spending some time there before moving back to Finland to work in a hospital.When the war broke out, she did not leave Finland, instead, choosing to stay behind as a volunteer. She was the only doctor for the entire base camp. And the man with the mustache, Ah Ji, was the second lieutenant in this camp. His job was to command the guerilla troops.As she was finished with her questioning, Maji squinted and stared hard at Zhang Heng.\"I know what you want now. However, I can't make the decision right now. Go back to where you come from. I will relay everything that you told me to Ah Ji.\"\"How is she doing?\" asked Zhang Heng before leaving the cottage.\"About her\u2026 real lucky she was.. brought back in the nick of time. The surgery was a huge success. I have given her a good few pints of blood. Two days ago, we received a batch of anti-inflammatories from Switzerland. She should be fine. I think she should regain consciousness by tomorrow morning,\" Maji replied while staring blankly.Zhang Heng could sense that her mind was elsewhere when she answered his question. She might have been thinking about personal business or about the guerillas. Whatever it was, he knew that this was not the right time to ask. Simply nodding his head, he headed back to the storeroom.This time, he waited for a long time before someone knocked at his door. When dawn had broken, a guerilla fighter came into the storeroom and delivered the first meal of the day. His breakfast included a bowl of venison soup, half a loaf of bread, and blueberry jam.The food they served here was way better than the Soviet rations he was forced to live on. This was the advantage of fighting as Finland's warriors. Though the guerillas had to continually hide deep in the mountains, they would constantly receive supplies from the villages nearby them. These villagers were unyielding, often informing them of the Soviet's positions in the forest.For the past few days, Zhang Heng had been hiding here and there. It had been a long time since he had a proper meal. As he had done everything he was capable of, it was useless to worry about things he couldn't control. He might as well sit down and enjoy the great food in front of him.It wasn't until the afternoon before Maji visited again.\"I'm really sorry we can't send you to the back of the battle line. This is a pivotal moment for the war right now. We don't have enough people to escort you to the back of the line.\"\"Just point me in the right direction and give me some supplies. I think I can travel there by myself.\"Maji simply smiled.It then dawned on Zhang Heng, as he finally knew the reason behind it.\"Your identity is suspicious and we don't even know where you come from. Though we can't fault anything that you've told us, it is basically impossible for us to verify your information as well. Besides, now you know where the guerilla base came is, there's no way that we will let you go just like that,\" said the doctor.Zhang Heng was speechless.\"Ah Ji is the kind of person that dislikes trouble and it might not be fair to you. Since we have no way to rule out that you are not a Soviet spy, killing you would be the easiest solution for us. There are dead bodies everywhere around here. All we need to do is kill you and toss your body at an obscure spot on the battlefield. No one would ever know that we were the ones who killed you!\"Maji then paused her speech, seeming as if she was hoping to see fear ooze out from Zhang Heng's face. Unfortunately, the way he acted left her in disappointment. He knew that if they wanted to kill him, they would not have sent the doctor all the way here and spend all this time talking to him. It was totally pointless for a bunch of mercenaries to put on such an elaborate show.\"Good news is, the sniper that you rescued is returning the favor. From the first day I've known her until now, I have never seen her talk so much in one day! Since she can vouch for you, Ah Ji is willing to give you an opportunity to prove if you are a friend or an enemy of Finland.\"\"Well. What do you mean by that?\"\"Congratulations! You've passed the test and are one of us now. That female sniper is lacking a partner. Both of you will go on a mission together once she has fully recovered!\"Zhang Heng realized that this was the best offer he could get for now. Though a lot different from what he expected, he knew that he had no right to reject the offer. Rejecting the proposal would mean certain death for him.This could be either a good or bad change to Zhang Heng's current situation. The good, was that he could take his mind off the supply problem since the logistics from the guerilla base camp would have that covered. He also had a powerful partner with him right now, where Zhang Heng had witnessed first hand the exceptional marksmanship of the sniper. He would never need to worry that she would miss her target.Then there was the bad part. Zhang Heng was now forced into a war he never intended to fight. He had been switched from an observer to a solider. Everything he would face from now on was going to be a risk to his life. He had never received any military training before and was very sure that the man with mustache knew all about it. Despite knowing the boy couldn't fight, he had put forward such a proposal.\"I have not shot out of a firearm before. Can you at least allow me to get some training first?\"\"Of course! That is a perfectly reasonable request. Before that kid recovers, you can do whatever you want as long as you don't leave this place.\"Maji was shocked to see Zhang Heng acting so calmly, despite being thrown around and coerced into a war. She suddenly realized that she could not read this young man. His level of maturity did not match his current age at all. It was rare for a such a young man to maintain his composure in the situation he was forced into. Zhang Heng had managed to pique her interest.\"What kind of weapon do you wish to use? M28 machine gun? Suomi KP submachine gun? Hmm\u2026 that one might be hard for you to get your hands on. We also have the Degtyaryov machine gun that we confiscated from the Soviets in our armory\u2026\"\"If possible, I want to train on a machine gun and a handgun first.\"Zhang Heng would prioritize protecting himself over anything else. Though machine guns and submachine guns were really powerful, they were also very, very loud. That meant the enemy would instantly pinpoint the shooter's position. It was best for him not to attract the attention of the enemies. Kill counts were pointless to him. He already knew how this war would end.\"Shooting aside, I think you should train your snowboarding skills as well. The snow is thick here. It would be more effective for you to slide around with a snowboard rather than walking your way through the ice. It might even come in handy one day, saving your life and all that,\" said Maji while lighting up a fag.For once, a practical suggestion. The snowboard was the signature item of the Finnish guerilla forces, allowing them to move around freely at a ridiculous speed. They were the infamous ghosts of the war, whizzing their invisible way through the darkness. They were legends, never to be surrounded by their enemies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was an old hunter with a pronounced limp. At the same time, he doubled as the resident chef for the base camp as well. The breakfast that Zhang Heng had earlier? Yeah, that was him too.Maji gave the old man a quick hug and spoke in Finnish, telling him about the newcomer. As they talked, Maji passed him half a pack of cigarettes. The older man then stared at Zhang Heng and nodded his head, albeit somewhat unwillingly. He flipped his remuneration into his pocket, turned around, and entered the house behind him.\"Oher will show you later how to use the machine gun. He's one of the most accomplished hunters over here. His tens of years of experience are more than good enough to teach you everything you need to know about a machine gun. Don't worry about the language barrier. I'll be your translator. If you have any questions, feel free to voice it out,\" said Maji.Zhang Heng was surprised at how Maji was so helpful all of a sudden. She did not seem like the kind of person to stick her nose in the business of others.\"The girl requested me to help you. My hands are tied. She's the reason why I can still continue to smoke. So, it's hard for me to say no to her. I consider this favor as repaying her back.\"It was apparent that Maji was in no intention to hide the truth. She then paused and stared at Zhang Heng in a suspiciously.\"Sebor told me that you and the female sniper were\u2026\"\"\u2026..\"Zhang Heng blushed, not knowing what to answer. During that perilous time, Zhang Heng was left with no other option if he was to keep her alive. Considering the nature of how it 'happened' though, it would be hard for anybody to believe him even if he was telling the truth.Luckily, good old Oher saved the day, coming out from the house in the nick of time right after Maji asked the question. He then handed a machine gun to Zhang Heng.\"This machine gun that you are holding is an M28. It is an improved version of the M1891 Mosin-Nagant and is way more accurate when it fires. Weapons are scarce here. You better not lose it!\"Maji translated everything to Zhang Heng, and he was thankful he could finally find common ground with these people.\"Besides the gun, Oher has given you 70 rounds as well. You need to know that these bullets are not just for shooting practice. You will need them when you go on your first mission. I would advise you to use 'em wisely.\"Maji paused for a while before continuing, \"Now\u2026 you can claim 40 rounds here before you go on a mission. If you run out of ammo, you can get it from the dead Soviets that you killed. Alternatively, you can exchange something valuable for bullets. I'll give you an example. Guns and medicines are precious at the base camp. Bring home some if you can. And if you manage to get your hands on a T26 tank and drive it back to the base camp, you will have my heartiest congratulations. That is because it will grant you full access to your arsenal!\"While Maji was talking, a few guerrillas brought over a Maxim Heavy Machine Gun, looking like they had just got back to the base camp not too long ago. And they had won the battle. Some of them were even bold enough to whistle at Maji when they saw her. Seeing the colossal cannon-like weapon rolling by, Zhang Heng jumped aside and let them move the lumbering gun into the armory. Then, Oher jotted something down on his notebook.Only after did the excited guerrillas leave the armory did Oher finally started explaining how a machine gun was used. Zhang Heng made sure as well to pay proper attention to every single word he said. After all, Maji would not be there every single time to translate for him. Not like she would be in such an elegant mood every single day anyway.The next day, Maji brought Zhang Heng to visit a guerrilla that was really good at snowboarding. The small favor she asked had cost her half a pack of cigarettes, buying Zhang Heng one snowboarding lesson for half a day. Zhang Heng had gone snowboarding a couple of times back home. With the added guidance, he managed to perform a lot better than yesterday.After two days, Maji finally grew impatient and left Zhang Heng to do whatever he wanted to do. Luckily, Zhang Heng had learned everything that he needed to learn to keep himself alive while he was out on a mission.So, he searched for a secluded place and started practicing everything he learned for the past two days. Snowboarding shouldn't be too tall of an order for Zhang Heng since he had done it before. Shooting, on the other hand, was a totally different story. When it came to the theory, he knew almost everything about weapons. All he needed to do right now was to familiarize himself with it.He needed to make sure that his fingers would become accustomed to pulling the trigger at living enemies. Right now, he had only 70 bullets with him, and though he tried to spare as many as possible, he still spent 40 bullets in two days. If he was shooting in real life, going through 40 bullets would take him a mere two minutes.After the shooting practice, Zhang Heng was flabbergasted, realizing that his shooting skills barely scraped the level of zero. And Zhang Heng did not know what to do anymore. He now had to conserve the bullets for his next mission. To survive in his upcoming mission, he expected that he would need to have 30 rounds with him. At most, he could only afford to spend another 10 bullets. Any more than that and he would turn into a corpse on the battlefield.Quite frankly, ten bullets wouldn't make much of a difference.There was nothing Zhang Heng could do about it, and since he could not leave base camp to look for more ammo, he could only exchange for them with Oher. Unfortunately, his valuables had been confiscated by the other guerillas. On top of that, Zhang Heng had no intention to get it back from them because he knew that it was pointless. Those weren't the types to return something they came into possession of. Finders keepers.With that being said, his shooting practice had come to an end.On the third day, Zhang Heng went back to where he first practiced shooting. To his pleasant surprise, he found three boxes of bullets under the white birch, a total of 45 rounds! Now, who could it be? Zhang Heng was the one who picked the location for the shooting practice, and no one else knew about it.This was located some distance away from the base camp. Until now, he still had no idea why the gunner that he met in the forest was still acted hostile towards him, suspecting that the others might have felt uncomfortable as well. He realized he was now stuck here for some time. In the interest of avoiding prying eyes and to stay out of trouble, he thought it best to look for a more covert spot.He was delighted, never expecting to find so many bullets here. Admittedly, that solved the huge problem of the lack of ammunition. He wondered who had the generosity to leave him such handsome bounty.In truth, it was not that difficult to figure out who left it here. There was only one person in the base camp fond of Zhang Heng.As it had been left there, finders keepers, he thought and used all of it for the shooting practice.The next day, three boxes of rounds were being left under the trees again. This time, his cellphone, wallet, wooden sculpture, and Rabbit's Foot were laid beside as well. Except for his inner coat, all of his personal belongings had returned to him!Instead of carrying on with his shooting practice, he knocked on the Maji's door.\"What's going on?\" groaned Maji with a yawn. Her sleepy voice proof that she had just woken up.\"Good morning, Ms. Maji. I'm here to look for someone.\"Zhang Heng knew that the female sniper stayed together with Maji in the same wooden cottage.\"Oy! Your bloke's here to look for you! Should I tell him that you are here?\"Chilly winds were starting to close in, causing a shivering Maji to tighten the neckline of her nightgown.\"\u2026\u2026.\"Half a minute later, Maji stood aside and allowed Zhang Heng to enter. The sniper was lying on the bed and had her back facing the entrance with a blanket wrapped like a burrito around her. Zhang Heng could only make out half her head. It seemed like she was still sleeping.Maji then walked over to her bed and pulled the blanket away. The neatly-dressed blond-haired sniper was presented before Zhang Heng.\"Simone! You can't avoid your partner forever, right?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So, she reluctantly got up and sat on her bed. After getting a good couple of days' rest, she definitely looked a lot better than before. However, Zhang Heng realized that she did not dare look him in the eye.\"Can you please translate for us again?\" Zhang Heng politely asked Maji.\"Just say what you want to say.\"Maji took out another cigarette in anticipation as she smiled at Zhang Heng.\"Thank you for much for vouching for me. I came here once to visit you before, but Dr. Maji said that you needed more rest. So, I did not get to see you.\"Simone looked at him and blinked. Despite attempting to put on her best poker face, Zhang Heng could see a pang of deep-seated guilt hidden behind those dreamy blue eyes. Not knowing if it was the wrong thing to say, Zhang Heng omitted the part about getting back his personal belongings and the extra bullets under the tree.\"My home is in a land far away. Due to some reason, I'm stranded here. Once the war is over, I will return to the place I came from,\" said Zhang Heng.Simone seemed disappointed after hearing what Zhang Heng had to say.Zhang Heng knew that she had grown fond of him after what happened to them in the woods. From what he saw, it seemed like Simone was a high ranking guerilla in this base camp. He could have easily taken advantage of her fondness toward him and have a better life right here. If he did that, however, he would definitely bring great sorrow to Simone when the day to leave finally arrived.Sometimes, Zhang Heng had doubts if this was really just a game. His entire experience so far had proven too realistic for him to handle. Everything was so real it became hard to consider those around him like a bunch of programmed NPC. Zhang Heng also wondered what would happen to this virtual world once he left. What would happen to the 'people' around here?Would the tale soldier on without him?Despite it all, he knew that it was hard to lie to the only girl fond of him in the entire camp. Eventually, Zhang Heng decided that he would tell her the plain old truth. It might seem unwise in the current climate, but he was willing to risk it and stick on to his principles.Simone looked lost after the conversation. She was just sat mum on the bed, unable to utter a single word.\u2026..Noticing tension in the atmosphere, Maji closed the door behind her and talked to Zhang Heng.\"I thought you looked smart for a man. You really should never say such cruel words to a girl! However, I think I kinda like you right now. Simone might be a masterful marksman, but she is extremely innocent. She has never been in a relationship in her entire life. Before the war, she lived with her great-grandfather deep in the forest, and all she did growing up was hunting. Ah Ji and I initially thought that you harbored ill intentions towards her. It seems that I have misunderstood you.Maji then paused, lighting up another cigarette.I have come across many men in this life. Most of the ones I know have a dick in place of their brains. Although they would instantly fall for women who showed fondness towards them, the ending is usually the same. Waking up in the morning, feeling an empty space beside you, finding out that you have been left all alone in the bedroom. Such is the nature of men, right?\"\"So, you guys have finally agreed to send me to the back of the battlefield?\" asked Zhang Heng as he ignored her rambling.\"About that\u2026 I must apologize. It's simply not possible. I didn't exactly lie about everything the last time we talked. Compared to the Soviet military, we severely lack skilled fighters. Since you are all dandy and healthy, you turn up as a perfect add-on to the force!\"\"\u2026.\"\"Don't worry,\" Maji assured him. \"I will help you solve your gun problem. Later on, I will see who has remained at the base camp. Weller and his team just came back yesterday, so I don't think they are heading out today. They should have plenty of time to give you a few shooting lessons later. However, I feel they don't like you too much. How about Mike? I wonder if he's here right now.\"Suddenly, the door was pushed open. Simone was barged in and whispered something in Finnish to Maji, leaving her startled. She then turned around, relaying to Zhang Heng what Simone just told her.\"Simone told me that she wants to be the one that teaches you how to shoot better!\" Maji whispered while smiling slyly.This amazed him. Considering how he had just let his tongue slip, her heart would have been broken, much less willing to teach him anything.\"Is she even okay?\"\"Are you doubting my medical skills? This is the fifth day. She'll be fine as long as she does not overexert herself,\" grumbled Maji with one of her eyebrows twitched.Of course, Zhang Heng would not reject the offer. He knew that it was challenging to find someone good to teach him. Earlier, all Oher did was summarize the entire course of shooting better. When he was practicing, he encountered a new problem. He did not approach Oher to ask about it, though.And this was not the 21st century. He couldn't just simply get on Baidu or watch a bunch of online tutorials to help to shoot better.It was undeniably that Simone shot as good as she looked. Zhang Heng personally witnessed her exterminating two Soviet scout teams on her own, never once needing a second bullet to kill her target. It was all a one shot one kill business. It was hard to believe that she acquired such great skills, even at such a young age. Zhang Heng grew more and more curious about the girl's origins, of how she got so bloody good at what she did.Simone was the kind of girl that took her own sweet time. Since she happened to be dressed and he had a rifle with him, they all proceeded to his secret shooting range.\"Both of you. Spare my life, please. I haven't even had my breakfast yet,\" lamented Maji.\u2026Zhang Heng was shocked to see Oher giving Simone bullets every single time she asked for it. She must have contributed a great deal to the war effort. Simone was known to continually empty the already limited armory of ammo. Poor Oher had to hide someplace whenever she came asking for more.Unfortunately, the base camp was more like small confinement. Oher had to cook for everyone every day, so it wasn't hard for Simone to find him. In the end, due to the shortage, he had to increase its price. Right now, ammunition had turned into the most valuable loot for all the guerilla members.This week alone, Zhang Heng had lost count of how many bullets he had fired. This was the first time he experienced the joy of unlimited rounds.Right now, he was lying low on the snow-covered ground as he controlled his breathing. He had his rifle loaded and aimed for the target 30 meters away from him.Without hesitation, he pulled the trigger! Seconds later, there was a loud thunk as the metal cup on the wooden block was sent flying. Zhang Heng then heard a notification.[Acquired new skill - shooting: LV 0]This was the very first time he managed to learn an entirely new skill set in such a short period of time. All in all, it had only taken him the better half of a week. However, it seemed like Simone was displeased with his progress. She took out her rifle, cocked it, and pulled the trigger. The bullet landed on the tiny matchbox located 120 meters away from them! The best part, it took her only two seconds to hit her target.\"\u2026.\"Zhang Heng was left tongue-tied. There was still a gaping gap between them. Without a scope, it was hard for Zhang Heng to land a shot on his target. He had no idea how Simone managed to land an accurate shot that was so far away from them.Her dexterity and speed were simply too impressive. When a sniper went against another sniper, speed was the factor that decided who lived or died. If Simone was his enemy, Zhang Heng knew that she would have killed him before he even picked up his gun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/48 Hours a Day48 Hours a Day Chapter 71 - The Mannerheim Line Welcomes You XIIIPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: The Mannerheim Line Welcomes You XIIIThough Zhang Heng spent most of his time brushing up his shooting, he made sure that he would not neglect snowboarding as well. Unfortunately, training on the snowboard didn't go as smoothly as the shooting practice. Simone's snowboarding skill was decent, but it didn't come close to her shooting skills. Besides, as she was still recovering from her injuries, it was a terrible idea for her to do such vigorous exercise. Hence, she sat it out most of the time and watched Zhang Heng practice instead.Maji stayed with them for only two days. After that, she grew impatient and bored with the translator job. Before they even realized it, Maji had already made a quick escape, running to deal with other more pressing matters.Luckily, Zhang Heng and Simone only needed to communicate with each other during training. Though they did not share a common language, hand signals were sufficient for Zhang Heng to understand most of her instructions. Most of the time, there was an awkward silence between them.Simone would watch Zhang Heng from the side when he practiced shooting. It was almost always freezing, up here in the north. As a snowflake landed on her nose tip, she could not help but sneeze.\u2026..Along with that, Zhang Heng found out that Simone had started to learn English from Maji. Ironically, the first sentence that she learned was, 'can you kiss me?'.So, the next morning, as Zhang Heng was brushing his teeth, he suddenly heard Simone's first English words.Shocked and taken aback, he almost swallowed the toothpaste in his mouth when he heard Simone asking him to kiss her! Later on, he discovered that Simone actually intended to say 'good morning' to him. Undoubtedly, only Maji could fool around with her in such a silly way.Zhang Heng himself wanted to learn Finnish as well. After all, it was never a bad idea to learn a new language. Besides, he could communicate with the people around him.However, there were very few consonants in Finnish. Instead, it had long words, rich vowels, and very complicated grammar, little wonder why it was considered as one of the hardest languages to master. With all things considered, this seemed to be the wrong time to learn a new language, a very hard one at that. In order to survive the war, he first had to improve his shooting and snowboarding prowess.Of course, it wasn't impossible for him to learn if he put his heart into it. He soon realized that there were some crucial words that had to be acquired instantly. Words like 'open fire, ceasefire, retreat, and, cover' were critical on the battlefield.So here he was, trying to learn some words that were frequently used daily. Although such a short time would prove impossible for him to come up with full sentences, a single word would surely help a lot to express what he was trying to say. Maji naturally became the busiest person in the base camp, having to teach Simone English and Zhang Heng Finnish at the same time while being the doctor as well.The good thing here was that Zhang Heng was very productive by nature. He transformed from a man who had never held a gun in his life to a lethal mercenary that could shoot accurately. At the same time, he snowboarded well now, swiftly sliding through the icy lands like a white phantom.He had undoubtedly improved by leaps and bounds during this period. Though he still couldn't be compared to a full-blown Finnish guerilla, most members, including Maji, were secretly impressed by his rapid improvement.Simone's good teaching contributed most to his improvement. As Zhang Heng had previously spent a great deal of time honing his archery skills, he had a good grasp of the basics of aiming. Regretfully, his goal of getting his shooting and snowboarding to Level 1 seemed impossible to achieve.On his 13th day here, something that was bound to happen finally took place.Simone had almost fully recovered from her wounds. If it was not for Zhang Heng, she would have left the base camp three days ago. In order to make sure he received the best training, she elected to stay behind for a few more days.Today was the day that the guerilla troops received a message from the villagers nearby, informing them that a platoon of Soviet soldiers rushing somewhere had been spotted. Immediately, Ah Ji summoned all the available guerillas to discuss taking out the troops. Predictably, every single one of them concurred. Simone, too, had asked for approval to join this mission.Zhang Heng did not attend the meeting but sensed that the guerilla members were filled with excitement. All of them were cleaning their weapons, checking their backpacks, and discussing strategies. Clearly, the atmosphere at the base camp had changed. Even lunch was a lot better than the usual.Simone then told Zhang Heng in English that they were about to go on a mission. In turn, Zhang Heng replied to her in Finnish. Both of them looked for Oher, managing to claim four days' worth of ammunition and supplies. As a bonus, Zhang Heng was presented with a set of camouflaged attire as well. He no longer needed to wear that rather unsightly khaki-colored Soviet uniform.It would be a lie to say that Zhang Heng was not nervous. After all, he was about to enter an active warzone.He was different from all those guerillas, having nothing against the Soviets. Whether he wanted it or not, though, he would soon be dipping his hands into a lake filled with Soviet blood. Wars were merciless. Everyone involved in such brutal acts against each other would eventually be forced to do something they never intended to.Zhang Heng stuffed the toiletries and a roll of bandage into his backpack. These items were separated from the dried meat and vegetables. Simone was worried about his mental state. While packing, she kept peeping at him, worried that the rookie would somehow break down and desert the for.However, it seemed that Zhang Heng was strangely serene; his mood no different from going for a training session. Her worries slowly subsided.\u2026..This place was no cozy study room.This place was not a quiet library that was flooded with sunlight.Zhang Heng wished he could comfortably sprawl on a sofa in some quiet place to prepare his mind for the rigors of war. Unless he shared the same fate with Desmond Doss, most people would only get one of two endings on a battlefield.To kill or be killed.This had nothing to do with moral codes. Survival was the priority here.Zhang Heng slung his snowboard and the M28 at his back. Simone was waiting at the entrance when he opened the door. As she saw him, she hesitated before mustering enough courage to give him a one-second hug.\"Don't worry. I will protect you,\" said Simone.A strange sensation overwhelmed Zhang Heng, this being the first time a girl had said such a thing to him. And the weirdest part was, he found it really hard to refuse her. In the end, he nodded his head and replied, 'me too.'Both of them did not leave for the mission when the other guerillas did. This was only because Simone was used to acting alone. In her younger days, she was trained to hunt by herself. Even after joining the guerillas, she never wanted to partner with others as well. To ensure Zhang Heng would survive till the end of this war, she broke her lone-shooter chastity for the first time and requested him as her partner.Still, she was not used to being with someone else. While they were on the road, Simone walked briskly and was ahead of Zhang Heng. Soon, a one-meter distance drew between the two of them.Night had fallen, and the temperature had fallen by tens of degrees.Before long, Zhang Heng notified Simone that it was time for dinner. After living desolated on an island for a year and a half, Zhang Heng's cooking had improved a lot. When it came to the simple ingredients that they had, he could transform them into something delicious. Hence, he volunteered to start the fire to cook for the two of them.As she stared at the hynotizing flames, Simone zoned out. Suddenly, she thought of something and her face turned red. Initially, she had just sat there quietly, but right now, she found it really hard to sit still. Fumbling, she showed Zhang Heng a hand signal, indicating that she should check out their surroundings first.Clearly, it didn't seem like a valid excuse as they had just left the base camp not too long ago. There was still some distance between them and the Soviets. Other than trees and deer around them, there were no other living beings along a ten-mile radius. Perhaps this strange silence was the reason Simone felt so uneasy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seemed like they just passed here yesterday. According to the prints, there should be around 100 to 200 people. There were also tracks all over the ground left behind by wheels of some kind. It was a high possibility that they dragged along heavy machine guns with them..After snowboarding for the entire afternoon, they finally got close to their targets just before sundown. It seemed that the Soviets moved at a snail's pace. Considering that the snow on the ground was half a meter thick, it was extremely hard for soldiers and horses to move around as they pleased.When the terrain got too tough, the soldiers would be forced to free the stuck carts, heaving and pushing with whatever little strength they had left. The combination of poor weather and bad news from the frontlines took a big hit on the soldiers' morale. They were supposed to carry out the attack in 16 days, but had failed miserably in doing so. If Zhang Heng remembered correctly, most of the Soviet troops would be eventually eliminated by the Finnish guerillas.Every single frontline soldier sent to Finland by the Soviets had been overwhelmed by fear. Typically, soldiers that left their homeland to fight a war abroad would be left with very low morale . Despite the Soviets' best attempts to boost their spirits, the results turned out a lot worse than expected. After the purge, some experienced mid and high-ranking officers were either executed on the spot or sent to Siberian gulags.Most of the young officers that were promoted had just graduated from military college. Their loyalty toward their homeland was unquestionable. Like brainwashed zombies, they had only one purpose, and that was to follow orders. These were perfect for battles that required cannon fodder, or ones that required little thinking but rather, a mass horde of killing machines. Right now, they were facing problems from all directions, with their young officers not knowing how to handle their dejected subordinates.After checking the soldiers out with a pair of binoculars, Simone passed it to Zhang Heng. What she saw was a classic Soviet military formation. There were around 150 people in total, where the frontline was made up of three rows of foot soldiers equipped with 12 light machine guns, two heavy machine guns, and then, some grenade dischargers that looked like spades. Most were using the M1891 Mosin-Nagant. For a long time, this rifle was a signature weapon of the Soviets.In terms of firepower, it was rather potent, especially the Maxim heavy machine gun. In theory, it could shoot up to 600 rounds per minute, powerful enough to shoot down flying airplanes.Zhang Heng was worried that the reflection of the binoculars might give away their location, only taking short glances in between. Both him and the sniper decided it was best to retreat for now, only returning later that night. Simone had already started to bury herself with the snow around her. She then signaled him with her hand asking him to retreat first.For the past week, they had been training together, and he thought that he knew how excellent her shooting skills were. He could not help but take a deep breath when he found out about her intentions. Seven hundred meters lay between them and the targets. If one used the sight bead to aim at a target three hundred meters away, the red dot in the scope would be larger than the target. Five hundred meters was considered the maximum distance a shooter could accurately discern it. It was practically impossible to take out a person that was 700 meters away! Zhang Heng had no idea what kind of sniper could achieve such a great feat.The one thing he knew was that he had to trust his partner with everything he had, come what may. As he mulled over those thoughts in amazement, Zhang Heng carried both of their snowboards one mile from where Simone hid.He heard a gunshot the moment he lay down. Right after that, loud chaos broke out among the Soviets! Although he could not see what had happened from his distance, he could imagine how terrifying a situation they must be in.The first thing they would do was to lie flat on the ground and attempt to locate the sniper. Unfortunately, no one would have expected that shot actually came from 700 meters away! After a short back and forth of crossfire, the Soviets had enough. They loaded their Maxim heavy machine guns and grenade launchers at the same time. As the powerful cannon started its assault, the sound of the M28 was utterly drowned out. They would never be able to locate where Simone was.This kind of battle had a significant impact on a soldier's morale. Simone could only kill one person each time she fired, and the overpowered Soviets were enough to destroy the entire Milky Way. Despite having the big guns, despair eventually subjugated them. Their firepower was deemed useless when they faced an invisible sniper that was a good 700 meters away from them.Like a rampant plague, fear had started to spread among the ranks of the Soviets.The shooting finally came to a stop five minutes later. Some soldiers were still holding up their rifles, cautiously scanning their surroundings. The fear of dying at any moment began to fester in them. From the beginning till the end, they had not located the lone sniper. However, some stray bullets still landed at Simone's hideout. Zhang Heng was incredibly worried that she might have been shot.Thankfully, he soon saw Simone approaching him and was filled with relief.Nothing had changed on Simone, except for her rapid breathing. She then spat out some snow from her mouth and drew the number '12' in the air with her finger. In total, Simone used 30 bullets, and she managed to kill one with every three shots. The kill count might not be impressive, but if one considered the fact that she killed enemies that were 700 meters away from her, it was nothing less than a miraculous feat. Her main target were the ones on the heavy machine guns, killing almost 7 out of the 14 gunners. She even managed to kill an officer right before he threw a grenade at her!While the Soviets were blinded by chaos, Zhang Heng and Simone managed to increase the distance between them. And this was how Zhang Heng's shootout ended. Throughout the entire stint, he did not fire a single bullet. He was just an observer, witnessing his partner killing their enemies. Simone, on the other hand, did not look too excited about her recent achievement.\u2026\u2026\u2026.There was still half an hour left before the sky turned dark. Simone had no plans to waste any second, so they quickly switched to another spot. She then carried on with the unfinished business, ticking off the rest of the enemies one after another. There was nothing the Soviets could do about her. They had the numbers, but if they deployed all 100 soldiers to search the forest, it would only be easier for Simone to pick them off one by one. Only a sniper could kill a sniper. A heavy machine gun was basically useless right now.This was the problem that the Soviet commanders could never solve throughout the duration of the winter war. Unfortunately, they did not realize how valuable a sniper would be during that period. Thus, they paid the hefty price of hundreds of thousands of souls before they established their own sniper brigade.Many years later, though, the Soviet Union would eventually become the country with the most snipers. In the battle with the Nazis, they had snipers deployed at every single, crevasse, rooftop, and ruin in the city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, this was not the end of it. Their nightmare was officially set to begin that night. During the nighttime, visibility had significantly reduced, making it a lot harder for the troops to spot the guerilla members hiding in the forest. Without a visible target, they would not know where to fire.After an entire day of traveling on foot, most of the soldiers were famished and fatigued. Usually, during this hour, they would start to prepare and cook their dinner. Nothing was usual about this time as there was a sharp-shooting reaper hiding in the dark - getting ready to harvest their souls, one bullet at a time. There were many dead bodies lying beside them, courtesy of the sniper, discouraging them from starting a fire to cook.Moments like these displayed the weakness of the young and inexperienced commanding officer. He did not know if he should fortify the place in anticipation of backup, or simply take off and never look back. Sadly for them, another force of guerillas soon arrived, surrounding them. Then, with a merciless blow, launched the second wave of attacks on this unlucky Soviet brigade.The guerillas with their submachine guns snowboarded their way in the dark forest right to the heart of the enemy base camp. The moment they saw the Soviets, they started to open fire! Though there were only 20 of them, their courage and blitz attack had caught the Soviets off-guard. Besides, Simone had taken care of two teams of their machine gunners. It was soon apparent that the reaction of the rest of the soldiers was a lot slower. In their mess and confusion, the guerillas had already finished shooting. By that time, the guerillas had left with their snowboards and turned to other locations to strike other brigades.Still, two guerillas got hit, where one of them was shot in the head, falling off from his snowboard. Another one was shot in the shoulder, but he managed to escape in the end. As for Simone, she had her rifle locked and loaded. Usually, she would start opening fire at single targets when the other guerillas launched their attacks. Once the surprise attack was over, she had killed another eight enemies. The combination of an invisible super-shooter and the Baltic ferociousness of the Finnish had managed to completely devastate the morale among the Soviet ranks.Within three minutes, another 20 dead bodies piled up on the ground, and 30 soldiers were severely wounded. Amongst these, seven were critical, choking, and bleeding out. It seemed they would not pull through the night. As for the rest, there was no way they would make their way to any battlefield without receiving medical attention. However, they would best forget their intentions, considering the agonized wails and screams of the decapitated conscripts.The Soviets were already in extreme distress when the guerilla attacked earlier. In order to save ammo and avoid friendly fire, they retreated, for now, halting the attack and hiding out in the forest to wait for the perfect moment to strike again.They were like predators stalking their prey from agar. Though the Soviets greatly outnumbered and had a lot more firepower than the guerillas, it did little to affect them. To them, the Soviets were simply dead mean on the chopping board. Since Finland was located far up north near the Artic, they had very long nights and only a few hours of daylight. They were accustomed to the dark, having honed their skills in the nights. This proved a great advantage to them when overpowering the uninitiated Slavs.Zhang Heng and Simone too retreated to a safe place. They even found a little time to have dinner. Of course, in order to stay hidden, there was no fire. Perhaps the food was undercooked, hence its rather unsavory nature.\u00a0After a short while, they saw someone gliding towards them on a snowboard. The man passed, creating a cloud trail of snow and frost behind him.Zhang Heng recognized the man. He was the same one who had brought him back to base camp with a submachine gun pointed at him. After spending some time at the base camp, Zhang Heng got to know his name as well. He was called Weller and was the one most hostile towards Zhang Heng.He must have followed the signs Simone had left on the path when she moved here. Zhang Heng could roughly guess that he was here to discuss the time for the next round of attacks. The splash of snow and ice was an attempt to show off his skills to Zhang Heng, raising his eyebrows in intimidation, as if courting a challenge. He even cocked his machine gun, swung it around, and tauntingly glared at Zhang Heng.Just as Zhang Heng was about to react to that, Simone quickly stood up with her M28. She seemed akin to a lioness protecting her cub, which was Zhang Heng. Naturally, Zhang Heng was not pleased by her response. He muttered a few words and left with his snowboard.\"\u2026\u2026\u2026..\"Zhang Heng felt that there was something terribly wrong about all this. The longer he stayed with Simone, the stronger this bad feeling got. Actually, it was not that hard to deal with a simple-minded brute like Weller. He was the same kind as Cheng Cheng - a man-child.Though Weller had a strong dislike towards Zhang Heng, he had not done anything overboard so far. At most, he would laugh at him with his friends when Zhang Heng passed him by. Sometimes, he would even wear Zhang Heng's undercoat and deliberately walk in front of him. He had repeatedly done this, hoping to encourage a response. From time to time, he would glare at Zhang Heng with hatred, even spitting on the ground as a sign of disgust. With Zhang Heng looking away, he would often chuckle in satisfaction.After that, Zhang Heng got to know that Weller was married with two kids. His affection for Simone was more of admiration, an infatuation. He was green with jealousy when his crush hung out with Zhang Heng all the time. The best way to deal with these types was to do nothing at all about it. As time passed, he would have to accept that this was something that he could not change.The way Simone glared at him just now would definitely trigger his rebellious personality.Of course, Zhang Heng did not blame her for that. After all, nobody forced her, and she did it all out of good intentions. As long as she could remember, she had been staying with her great grandfather. Undoubtedly, more straightforward than Weller. As for a woman like Maji, Zhang Heng could never know what went through her mind. She had a natural flair for stage plays. Sometimes, she even acted so well that Zhang Heng could not help but believe whatever she said. She was a true femme fatale, and that was why Zhang Heng still did not trust her wholeheartedly.\u2026\u202640 minutes later, the guerillas launched their third wave of attacks.This time, the employed different tactics, not striking at them directly. Instead, they had two snipers picking them off from afar. This allowed them to draw fire away from the rest of the guerillas. While the Soviets were busy shooting at the sniper, the other guerilla members would appear out of nowhere and strike the distracted soldiers.Simone had her priority on the heavy machine gunners. At the same time, Zhang Heng had also let off a couple of shots as well. These targets were a lot further away than the ones in his training sessions. He did not know if he had made any kills before suddenly\u2026A notification![Successfully killed an enemy. Game Points: +5.

Some of them surrendered their weapons and begged for their lives, and some tried to run away. The guerillas left a couple of fighters around to keep an eye on the deserters, while some others went into the forest to look for the runaways.Zhang Heng was not interested in these things that spilled blood. However, he knew that his first fight was the only time to prove his loyalty to the guerilla force. The way he acted upon the Soviets today would determine how the Finnish would treat him tomorrow. So, Zhang Heng followed right behind them and shot those who were on the run. It looked like good target practice as well, trying to strike moving runners and all.A gun-powdery half an hour later, the fight was finally over. All in all, a total of seven soldiers managed to escape. As for the rest of them, they were either captured or killed. This meant that an entire Soviet brigade had been eliminated. As for the guerillas, there were a total of two dead. One suffered substantial injuries, and four had flesh wounds, but nothing too serious.As for the fallen Finnish, one got shot directly in the head during the first wave of attack, and the second was killed while in pursuit of the enemy. Though the guerillas eventually killed their killers in revenge, it was impossible to bring their dead allies back to life.After that, Weller led a few of his people to scout the battlefield and make an inventory of the spoils the had looted from the Soviets. A few of the guerilla even looked excited, as if kids on a demented treasure hunt, looking ever excited at their new possessions. To the captured Soviets, each second that passed was hell, growing more anxious and panic-stricken. They had no idea what was going to happen to them.The Geneva Convention saw a way to treat prisoners of war with humanity. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets wanted no part of it in World War II. With that being said, Zhang Heng had never seen prisoners of war back at the base camp. It was simply not economically viable for guerillas to keep them alive, not to mention not having the numbers to control a riot if a huge fight broke out.This time, they captured a total of 40 prisoners, and at least four to five guerillas would be needed to escort them back to the base. Considering that they needed to deal with those that were injured, the possibility of crossing paths with other Soviets, and the possibility of the prisoners escaping, it still seemed unwise to bring them home.In an attempt to exert superiority, some of the guerillas had brought over two Maxim Heavy Machine Guns and pointed them at the prisoners, leaving them writhing and trembling. Some even wet their pants and started to cry in fear. All their weapons had been confiscated, and it seemed all but too late for these unfortunate souls.Zhang Heng had no intention to witness all the killing, not forgetting to leave the confiscated guns and valuable items as well. All he did was pick up ammunition. After filling his backpack, he left the place with Simone.As they were leaving, the loud rattle of heavy machine guns filled the air. Horrible screams of men doomed to their fate echoed painfully, leaving the forests engulfed in a veil of death and blood. It didn't last too long, though, as before long, silence embraced the dark woods once again.\u2026\u2026..Before meeting Simone, Zhang Heng had experienced two fights. Hence, this was not his first time seeing bodies and parts scattered all around the floor. His calm reaction had left many befuddled. Throughout the entire battle, Zhang Heng did not drag anyone's feet and made no mistakes as well.This had caused many guerillas to change the way they looked at him, their impressions greatly improving. They no longer treated him like he was invisible. A lot of them remembered that they, too, performed poorly in their early days of battle. Except for Weller and gang of best friends, the rest of the guerilla members had gradually accepted Zhang Heng as one of their own.With only two casualties, the guerillas had managed to decimate an entire brigade of Soviets. It was to be considered a stunning victory. At the same time, the spoils of battle this time was a lot better than expected. In total, they had raked in a dozen light machine guns, two heavy machine guns, significant numbers of rifles, and together with them, the all-too-precious bullets.With all the new injection of weapons, Oher's problem was partially solved.Morale in the base camp ran high. Weller was locked in a noisy arm-wrestling battle with a few young men, no surprise there for the brutish Finn. There was a carnival atmosphere of sorts, with many drinking heartily and wagering bets on card games at the same time.When Zhang Heng entered the storeroom, he saw a new wooden bed, with a handsome pile of daily supplies beside it.\"Aren't you going to join them?\"Maji suddenly materialized at the door like a specter. She leaned her curvy hips on the wooden door as she lit up a cigarette. She had just stitched up a 5-inch gash in the leg of a wounded guerilla, leaving her collar with the cliche bloodstains of a war doctor.\"No,\" answered Zhang Heng politely.\"Do you think that they will all die on the battlefield soon?\" she asked, looking at him with soulful but emotionless eyes.\"\u2026\"Zhang Heng did not know how to answer her. He knew he had to be cautious when she talked to the crafty Maji. She could read him like an open children's book.\"What is it that you're afraid of? Doesn't the entire Europe think the same bloody way? Even an idiot will know who the winner of this war will be. But that's all in the future anyway. Right now, enjoy each day as if it's your last!\"Zhang Heng did not say anything else after that, probably because he was the only one that knew that ending of this war. Having the knowledge of how a movie ended was like a spoiler, and this one didn't have the best of endings. He knew how this one ended. After all, a man out of time like him didn't share those deep-set goas, which defined the cause of the guerillas. He just wanted to survive in this cruel environment.\"Anyway, Ah Ji wants to tell you something. He said you did a good job. We treat our own well, and since you are part of us now, we will not allow you to suffer. Initially, we wanted to house you with the others, but it seems you prefer to be alone.\"\"This place is good enough. No need for any changes.\"For him, it was pointless staying with the others as he could not speak in Finnish. Silence would suit him better for now. Besides, as a rookie, he needed to wake up early to catch up with what the others new. Shooting near a horde of sleeping Finns didn't sound like the brightest idea.Sighing, Maji nodded her head, encouraged him, and left after that.Zhang Heng placed his snowboard at the corner of the wall before opening up his backpack. The loot of bullets fell to the ground as he unzipped the bag. In total, he had received 513 rounds from the fight, enough for many many sessions of shooting practice. After witnessing Simone's incredible aiming,Zhang Heng was filled with a strong desire to improve himself. To a sniper, distance meant safety.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was holding his M28 and had its stock resting on his shoulder. The weather today was so cold that his fingers were frozen. Though he managed to stay calm, throughout most of the bad days here, he started to doubt if he could complete today's training.This was this 79th day in this world. The mission's dateline had passed, but the extra 24 hours he had each day graciously extended his mission to a total of 140 days. The good news was that the war was about to end soon.Basically, the winter war between the Soviet Union and Finland had two different phases. The first phase began on the 30th of November, 1939. The Soviets were divided into four teams and attacked Finland from all four directions. Undeniably, the attack ended badly for the Soviet Union, for after a long and hard battle, they only managed to conquer the northern tip of Finland. As for the other three directions, they suffered high losses. In the end, they were forced to retreat, returning to their homeland to conscript new soldiers.It was during that time that Finland had managed to devastate the great Soviet Union. This was notably evident at the battle at Karelian Isthmus, where the Soviets failed to break through the Mannerheim Line that Finland had maintained for a couple of decades. No matter how hard they tried, the Soviets were unable to figure out the foxy defense of Finnish. After paying the terrible price of thousands of lives, they only managed to penetrate 20km into their defensive line.That January, things started to get a lot worse. The Red Army came up with the Northwestern Front, a Soviet military formation at Karelian Isthmus, assigning a Marshall called Semyon Timoshenko as the commander. In total, there were field armies made up of the 21st infantry division and six tank brigades. The entire force was ordered to focus their fire on the Mannerheim Line. During that time, Finland's military was sorely lacking, having shortages of personnel, heavy weapons, and ammunition. Soon, these problems were exposed.Recently, the frontline sent a large number of emergency reports to the guerilla base camp. For now, they had nothing to do with Zhang Heng. He had been through around 20 battles throughout his time here. Every single day, he had to put his life on the line.The battles gradually got harder as compared to his first mission. There were a few times he almost got himself killed even though trying his best to be extra cautious of his surroundings. The closest call he had was when a grenade landed right in front of him! One wouldn't doubt the luck a Rabbit Foot could grant, as, in the end, the grenade did not explode, and Zhang Heng got to live to see another day.Many surprises and unforeseen circumstances occurred on a battlefield. Being extra careful did not guarantee that you got to keep your life. The tremendous stress that he was put under recently had driven him to improve his snowboarding and shooting skills faster than he could have before this.This was especially true for the latter. Within a month, Zhang Heng's shooting skill had climbed, and he was now at LV 1. If he kept going at this rate, he might just be able to scrape LV 2 next month. Right now, he had an 80% chance to land a critical shot at a target 200 meters away from him. And shooting distance was not his only improvement.All the while, Simone had been trying to help Zhang Heng improve the quality of his snipership on the whole and a heightened warzone awareness that he had to have. Indeed, he was getting a lot better with each passing day, thanks to her dedication and perseverance.At the moment, Simone was attempting to sharpen Zhang Heng's observation skills. Earlier, she had deployed traps and managed to capture five weasels. After that, Simone made a mark on them before releasing them back to the wild. Zhang Heng was supposed to capture three out of five to complete the task.Sporting white fur, they were extremely difficult to spot on the snow-covered ground. To make things worse, the rodents were usually cautious of their surroundings. After searching for a continuous half an hour, Zhang Heng finally found one and put a bullet in it! There were still four to go, with Zhang Heng having a hunch that they had probably escaped by now.Ten minutes later, he spotted another weasel on a ridge. However, Zhang Heng was quite some distance away from his target, but he knew that if he waited any longer, he would surely lose the elusive animal. Immediately, he pulled the trigger! Unfortunately, the freezing cold had diminished his accuracy. Instead of hitting it, he simply scared it away.Zhang Heng shook his head and put away his rifle in frustration, feeling like giving up. He then saw Simone sitting beside the fire, deep in thought. For the entire week, the guerillas were all on a sabbatical, having no war to fight. They had to wait until the Karelian Isthmus war ended before they resumed what they usually did. To be precise, Finland had to wait it out until other nations came to their rescue.England and France had promised that they would send their forces to help Finland defends against the Soviets. As for Switzerland and Norway, they had made it clear that they wouldn't be involved. Germany, too, mentioned that they had no intention to get involved in this war. Judging the current circumstances, they wouldn't be able to hold on until help arrived.At the same time, Finish foreign affairs had been engaging with the Soviets. Unfortunately, Soviet demands were often unreasonable and outrageous, often making small ransoms for an even lower request.February soon arrived. The longer the war dragged, the worse the weather became. As Zhang Heng wasn't involved in the war, and as an outsider, he had no concern about the outcome. To Simone, however, her country was about to be conquered. He could feel how down she must have gotten, knowing that a foreign force was about to colonize the homeland she knew all her life. Things would never be the same again.Sadly, even if he became as good a sniper as Simone, there was no way Zhang Heng could change the results of the war.The only thing that he could do right now was to cheer her up, perhaps offer a shoulder or two. It was the best he could offer.SPLAT!A snowball suddenly landed on Simone's back. Immediately, she turned around to see what was going on. At the same time, the second snowball landed on her arm! Playfully, she rolled up her snowball in retaliation!A perfectly round snowball landed perfectly on Zhang Heng's chest. Such was the deadly accuracy of a masterful sniper. Zhang Heng then tossed two snowballs at Simone, who managed to dodge one with the other landing on her neck. She could not help but shiver as the snow fell under her clothes. This snowball fight had triggered the gods of rivalry within her!Snowballs flew everywhere, with hints of laughter, bringing Simone a much-needed reprieve from the bitter horrors of human war. Everyone, no matter who won or lost, was a casualty.\u2026\u2026It wasn't before the night that the two of them returned to base camp. As Zhang Heng was about to boil some water to shower, he saw Maji when he walked towards his cottage.\"The two of you came back quite late today,\" she teased.\"Is there something I can help you with?\"\"Things are getting really bad at Karelian Isthmus. The Soviets managed to break through the first line of defense. Rumor is that the higher authorities are about to fulfill the demands of the Soviet Union! The war will be coming to an end soon.

When he opened the door, Ah Ji was sitting on the table with a small knife while trimming the tip of a cigar.\"Welcome! Friend of Finland! Freedom fighter! My yellow-skinned friend!\" he exclaimed with his arms open.Zhang Heng was invited to sit in front of Ah Ji. He had little contact with the guerilla commander for the past two months. The last time he walked into this cottage was during his first arrival. He still remembered that the commander left after speaking a few sentences, and Maji was the one who talked to him after that. Zhang Heng had no idea why the commander would want to talk to him now.Ah Ji put his cigar aside and produced a bottle of vodka under his table. It had been confiscated from one of the Soviet troops with only half a bottle left. Maji then took out three glasses and filled them up.\"Actually, I want to thank you for what you have done for us. Thank you for everything that you have done for the past two months. During our darkest, most harrowing moments, you have graciously picked up arms, and fought by our side. I want you to know that you have helped us protect our country. It's just too bad you're not Finnish, or our country would have decorated you with medals.\"Zhang Heng simply nodded as he bottomed up the cup of vodka, allowing the commander to finish.\"You should know that the war is coming to an end soon. What do you plan to do when the war is over?\"Zhang Heng calculated that he had about a month left before the war ended. Right until now, he had accumulated a total of 23 points. These were all the result of spotting a guerilla base camp, killing an enemy, using a Molotov cocktail to destroy a tank, successfully killing a commander, and acquiring ten bullet-shaped lighters. Indeed, some of these milestones were a bit on the weird side.Based on his primary mission, all he needed to do was to survive Finland for 20 days. Technically speaking, he wasn't required to stay here any longer. If possible, Zhang Heng wanted to travel to England or America. These two countries were considered some of the safest countries to be in during World War II.Although they did send throngs of troops to fight in other countries, their homelands were free from attacks. For Zhang Heng to be travel to these two countries, the guerilla commander had to first release him. Besides, the war was coming to an end. It was pointless keeping a foreigner here.Zhang Heng had been telling everyone how much he wanted to return to his hometown but had never told anyone about his intentions of going to England or America.The commander and Maji looked at each other, placing down their glasses at the same time.\"We pointed our guns at the same enemy. I'm going to be honest with you here. We will always believe in you no matter what happens since you are one of us. However, some of them do not think in the same way.\"\"What do you mean by that?\"\"You were spotted by the soldier that provides our ammunition. They are worried you might leak out information about us to others.\"\"For example?\"\"For example, the way we deal with our war prisoners. You know\u2026 we do what we have to do. However, when such matters spread, I'm afraid it might affect us in a bad way. Considering that foreign affairs are negotiating with the Soviet Union, this is a very sensitive time. Such information must be top-secret, by hook or by crook,\" answered Maji while taking over the cigar handed by the commander.In a surprising turn of events, the commander then drew a pistol from his pocket and pointed at Zhang Heng!Immediately, the atmosphere in the room tensed. After a short while, the commander put down the gun on the table.\"Good news is we know what kind of person you are. For me, I know in my heart that you will not leak such intel to others. What we are about to do next is going to be very simple. We just need to figure out a way to change the minds of those who distrust you.\"\"What do you guys want me to do, huh? Assassinate Semyon Timoshenko?\"Zhang Heng's steady control of his emotions managed to impress Maji and Ah Ji. Considering that a gun had just been pointed to him point-blank, they expected him to have an outburst by now.He had contributed a lot to the guerilla base camp with Simone, undeniably presenting impeccable performance through the trenches of war. Right now, the commander had just turned on him, and Zhang Heng could still control his anger. His character was truly impressive.In actual fact, Zhang Heng wasn't as calm as he looked. He just realized that he had made a huge mistake.It was not as simple as a video game. The moment he chose to become part of the guerilla force, he knew that no one would fully trust him, mainly because of his ethnicity and their inability to check his background. The guerilla team had simply made use of him to deal with the Soviets. However, during that critical period, he was forced to join a side to survive the war. Technically speaking, both sides were taking advantage of each other.As the circumstances changed, the relationship between him and the guerilla troops changed as well. At first, he was needed by the base camp to defeat their enemies. Now, they had turned around and made him a threat. Deep inside his heart, he knew that they would not let him off the hook so easily even though helped in eliminating tons of enemies, also spending some good, quality time with them.It seemed like everything had reached a moot point.\"Don't worry. We are all reasonable folks. We will not send you to do a suicide mission. What I want you to do is fairly simple. Once you complete it, all debt between us will be no more. When that time comes, you are free to go wherever you want,\" said Ah Ji.Maji blew out a smoke circle; her eyes gave out a certain hesitation in her. After some time, Maji barged in.\"Did you know that the girl wasn't originally called Simone?\"Zhang Heng frowned, having no idea why she would bring out Simone all of a sudden.\"The country is not in a critical state, but we will need a hero to unite everyone. We can wait for the hero to appear, or we can create on!.\"Maji's expression was slightly weird. She looked like she was taunting him, but with respect.\"The real Simone came from a small town called Rautjarvi. No one cared about that place, and no one cares what he did there as well. All we know is that he's just a farmer, and he would hunt occasionally. He is the most ordinary bloke that you will ever meet. That means you can alter his past to your liking!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There's one Simone right here. Why do we need to create another one? With her shooting skills, she is more than qualified enough to become a national hero. Why do you want to turn some random hunter into a national hero?\"\"Not one,\" replied the doctor, cigar in mouth.\"What?\"\"There is more than one Simone. In total, we have four Simones. All are professional fighters. Three of them are snipers, and another one is a natural on the submachine gun. All four have their faces covered when they go on a mission, so their identities are secure. Together, they become the best sniper the entire human history has known - the legendary Simone!Basically, Simone is everywhere. He is a phantom on the battlefield, your most reliable ally, the white death to the Soviet soldiers, and an undefeatable legend on the battlefield. The Simones have managed to boost morale for all Finnish countrymen and our soldiers greatly. To be more precise, there are only three Simones left. One was tragically killed when the Soviets started the war. We don't even have much information on him.\"\"How about the real Simone? Does he know about this?\" Zhang Heng asked, hoping for a straight answer for onceThat is not important. The real Simone joined the army last October, and during training, he protected one of his allies from an exploding grenade. If that incident did not happen, this project would not have even been born. But then again\u2026 the war is coming to an end soon, and there are two Simones left in this world,\" said Maji while spinning the lighter in her hand impatiently.\"The person that started this project did not expect this outcome, right?\"\"Yes. Initially, a fair chance was to be given to all Simones that survived the war. At least\u2026 they could use the gun in their hands to decide their final fate. Unfortunately, an unforeseen circumstance has emerged.\"\"What kind of unforeseen circumstances?\"\"The two Simones that survived was the female sniper and the man with the submachine gun. The latter one was hit by a stray bullet during one of the raids a few days ago. Miraculously, he survived after surgery. Then, someone must have leaked the news to the media. Reporters from different countries rushed to him, and it was during that time that he revealed his identity. Actually, I can understand why he would do something like this. That kid with the submachine gun is the strongest Simone when compared to the other three. Considering he is now severely injured, there is no way can defeat the sniper in a gunfight.\"\"What now? Are you guys planning to abandon her?\" asked Zhang Heng as he stared into their eyes.\"We don't have many options left. We have to play his game, and we need to make up stories for him as well.\"Zhang Heng was unable to speak. He stared right into Maji's eyes for half a minute, not knowing what they were thinking.\"If you want me to believe you, you have to tell me how an English volunteer has her hands in so many top-secrets?\" he continued.\"I lied. The truth is, I did grow up in England, but my father is from Finland, and he is a powerful man in the Finnish military. I'm the one who proposed the Simone plan and personally recruited all the Simones. I simply want my father to witness the birth of a legend. That is why I'm here right now. Ah Ji was sent by the military to protect me.\"Maji looked very troubled. She stood in front of the window with both arms crossed in the exact same way when she and Zhang Heng first met. Suddenly, it dawned on him, as he knew what was troubling her.She realized that it was almost impossible for her to treat all four Simones fairly since she spent most of her time with the current Simone living in this base camp. Due to that, she could not maintain objectivity when it came to picking out the best of the lot.\"After all, we are all humans, and I care about the girl a lot. Before this, I had a thought amid the war, to get an assassin to kill the rest of Simones and let her live. I had no idea if she was tough enough to survive the war. With my position, I simply couldn't risk killing all the other Simones. So, the moment I heard that the second Simone was dead, I knew that the chances she would live after the war had just increased exponentially. What's happening right now came totally unexpected.\"\"So, now you found out that you can't beat her, and you want me to take care of your problem? Why don't you just let her go? You know her well enough! She doesn't mind not being a national hero whatsoever!\" snapped Zhang Heng while staring at the gun on the table.\"I'm the one who proposed the project, not the one in charge of executing it. I have some rights in this project, but not all of it. My job is technically over once all four Simones have been recruited.Whatever I did after that is all my own doing. The military and higher authorities have nothing to do with them. I can't change what had happened, and I can't change the mind of the top brass as well.That kid\u00a0Simone trusts you fully, and that is why I'm telling you all this stuff. Asking you to send her to the end of the road is the kindest thing I can do. I heard that there is a beautiful lake northwest of here. Perhaps we can fish there when everything is over.\"Finally, Maji was done with everything she wanted to say.\"I don't get a choice either, right?\"Looking down and without hesitation, Zhang Heng grabbed the gun on the table.\u2026\u2026..Maji had her back facing him and did not say a single word. Zhang Heng left the wooden house as well since he had asked all that he wanted. He then walked towards Simone's cottage. For all it was worth, he made sure to thank Maji before he left.The guerilla base camp was extra quiet tonight. Usually, Oher would lean at the door and gaze to the sky, looking for shooting stars. Not tonight, though. The entire base camp was flooded with light, with a kerosene lamp illuminating the doors of each cottage of the base camp.Zhang Heng did not turn around to look at the jungle. He put the gun into his pocket and used another hand to knock on the door. Since Maji did not like to bring her key around, Simone was unsurprised when someone knocked on her door at this hour. However, she was startled when she saw Zhang Heng standing outside the door.The moment he caught sight of her, he grabbed her collar and pushed her to the ground! Surprisingly, Simone did not retaliate. All she did was lie on the floor and stare at Zhang Heng. Her face was flushing. Just like what Maji told him, Simone trusted Zhang Heng with all her heart, no matter the situation.Zhang Heng sighed. All he needed to right now was to take out the gun from his pocket and end it all. Looking into her eyes, he saw that they were heartbroken, confused, but submissive. He hesitated.In the end, he couldn't make himself do it. Instead, he tried his best to look through the Finnish dictionary in his mind, saying, \"Trust me.\"After that, Zhang Heng started to look around to check out the room. With Maji's wittiness, Zhang Heng was confident that she had made preparations well before she signaled him earlier. He then looked at Maji's bed. That and the cabinet were the only places where Maji could hide her stuff.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There wore plain winter camouflage with no insignia bearing their unit or identity.Little did they know that Zhang Heng was about to welcome them with a Maxim Heavy Machine Gun. Good thing Maji was crazier than he expected, a trait that proved useful in time like this. With a bit of patience, Zhang Heng waited until all the unknown assailants were close to the cottage before opening fire at full force!Shells flew out from the chamber in a continuous stream like an angry fire-spitting dragon.Clearly, those five men had prepared to deal with surprises like this. However, they had not accounted for Zhang Heng to use a Maxim Heavy Machine Gun to go against them. The gun's destructive firepower had crushed any possibility of retaliation. Before they could do anything, their bodies were shredded into pieces, their flesh exploding into tiny bits as the bullets ravaged through without mercy. Though the gun was potent, it consumed ammo at an obscene speed as well.In that short skirmish, Zhang Heng had consumed all the ammunition prepared by Maji. Due to the gun's weight, it was not possible for him to carry it around. After killing the first wave of enemies, he abandoned the cumbersome machine and took out his handgun to shoot the kerosene lamp that was still alit.The moment the flames went out, the second wave of enemies arrived! In senseless insanity, thousands of bullets started spraying out of the forest toward the base camp. It was so powerful it shredded the thin wooden walls of the cottage!Luckily, Simone had pushed over the bed, serving as a barrier. Still, she could not figure out why enemies would appear in the base camp all of a sudden. Knowing that the two of them were in a life-threatening situation, she quickly picked up Zhang Heng's M28 and loaded the weapon.After three minutes of continuous shooting, the firing came to a stop. Bullets had wholly decimated the wooden house; plates and bowls on the table had been shattered into pieces. They were only alive thanks to the bed. Otherwise, they would have been instantly killed by the merciless rain of fire.Zhang Heng could see that these masked men were determined to eliminate Simone. They had come well prepared.Three people attempted to approach the cottage from the forest but were greeted in kind by three bullets. Simone had managed to kill them. Zhang Heng did fire twice as well. Unfortunately, he was not used to using a handgun and missed.Then, the shooting started up again. Gunshots rang out from all directions, and shells began to flood the house like there was no tomorrow!Judging by the intensity of the ambush, they should be about 20 or 30 people shooting at the same time. Sooner or later, the bed would surely give in to the onslaught. Unfortunately, there was nothing they could do right now. It seemed practically impossible to bring Simone out of the snare they were cornered into.In a crude manner of speech, Zhang Heng had indeed been fooled by Maji. Out of kindness, Maji wasnt completely honest about Simone with him. Surrounded by continuous fire, Maji knew that it was improbable they would survive. She believed that with Zhang Heng's cunning, he would surely figure out the consequences of knowing top-secrets. Even if he chose to kill Simone, there was no way that she would let him leave the base camp alive. Zhang Heng had said earlier that he had no options when it came to this. It turned out he was right.Still, Zhang Heng was grateful for Maji because he knew that it would hard for him to stay away and out of it. He knew that he would never leave Simone and ran away alone. Besides, he still had his trump card with him. The wooden sculpture was lying there quietly inside his pocket. He could transform himself into a shadow and flee the demolished cottage in an instant. However, the night was moonless, meaning he was limited to only moving where the kerosene lamps were. This was a big problem, and it was going to be really difficult for him to enter the forest behind the line of heavily armed soldiers.If you like reading comics please visit Webnovel.liveUnfortunately, he knew he had to do it if the situation got any worse.\u00a0Just when Zhang Heng wanted to reach into his pocket to grab the wooden sculpture, he heard there were more gunshots. This time, however, the gunshots did not come from the forest but from the base camp!Zhang Heng saw a single Weller shooting at the forest with his light machine gun. At the same time, the limping Oher kicked down a table, placed his rifle on top of it, and started to shoot at the forest like a madman! All hell had broken loose, and the other guerillas quickly followed suit as well.Of course, Zhang Heng would not let this golden opportunity slip away from him. Immediately, he kicked down the tattered wall behind him and dragged Simone out of the wooden house. Suddenly, he heard someone whistling as they were running. From afar, a guerilla tossed a submachine gun to him and signaled him to join the battle!From the beginning of the war until now, the guerillas had decreased from over 40 members to only about a dozen left. More than half had been killed in action. This reduction in number made them more united than before, and although they were ordered not to leave their rooms tonight, all of them chose to go against the order when they saw Simone's cottage being shot at. Such unexpected results surprised those on both sides of the divide.The truth was, enemies greatly outnumbered them. However, the guerilla's strong teamwork had managed to hold back the enemies. But soon, the enemies started to reorganize and started another retaliation. Until now, the enemies had been hiding out in the forest, giving the guerillas the upper hand during the first wave of attack. On the second wave of attack, the enemies started to work together, and the guerillas were beginning to sustain injuries during the shootout.Simone wanted to head back to help her friends but Zhang Heng knew that they were targeting her. The longer she stayed there, the more dangerous it was going to be for the others. Zhang Heng tapped on her shoulder.Gunshots were everywhere around the base camp, and amid the confusion, nobody knew where to head to. However, this was not a problem for Zhang Heng.Maji had actually signaled Zhang Heng secretly when they were talking in the commander's cottage. Northwest was where they should head to if they wanted to live to see tomorrow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was as dark as a cave, with only the stars to light the way. All they could see was a silhouette from far. Zhang Heng and Simone were about 70 meters away from the forest that was located northwest of them. However, they were only 40 meters away from the west, and there was a storeroom along their path. That made Zhang Heng was keener to first head west before running northwest to enter the forest.The only thing that he needed to do right now was to eliminate the gunner that was hiding west. Rifle in hand, Zhang Heng tossed away the handgun that he was holding earlier. Then, they both lay on the snow-covered ground on the their left and right.Just as expected, the enemy that had remained hidden for some time could not bear the boredom anymore. He drew out his gun and started shooting at Weller! The moment he fired, he fatally exposed his current position.Instantly, Zhang Heng and Simone took the opportunity to land a critical shot on him!Along with the loud gunshots, one of the enemies fell to the ground lifelessly. Simone did not stop there, using her excellent photographic memory and sharp observation skills to fire at another. Unfortunately, Weller got shot. It seemed like the enemies in the forest had no intention to kill, only shooting him in the leg. Zhang Heng knew that he could not afford to wait any longer. Immediately, he dragged Simone into the storeroom. One of the enemies noticed them and quickly sprayed some bullets their way in an attempt to block them off.At that very moment, Simone signaled to Zhang Heng that she would draw away the enemies to let Zhang Heng flee from the trapped position. Without thinking twice, Zhang Heng shook his head, rejecting her proposal. He knew that all those people were actually here to kill Simone, and there was no way he was about to leave her here to the wolves and vultures. Rather than being sitting ducks, Zhang Heng decided to return fire.That was the last resort anyway. The chance of them winning seemed slim. Even if they could both eliminate all the enemies, most guerillas would die in vain. Seeing that the two of them were trapped, Weller mustered up his strength and courage and stood up, battling the pain in his shot leg. He did not retreat to a safe spot but instead, pulled one of the corpses on the ground and used the body to shield him from the incoming bullets. With one hand, he picked up the submachine gun and started to shoot at the enemies!Having the covering fire, Zhang Heng and Simone ran into the forest as fast as their legs could carry them. The enemies gave chase, opening fire at the same time! Those three seconds that they experienced were like three centuries to them, as they gouged out every last bit of strength and ran without looking back.Right before they entered the forest, something unexpected happened. They remembered there were only three people shooting at them from the west side of the forest. Nobody would have expected that the forth enemy awaited them in the woods. A lot of had happened out there, and his mates had all scattered, but he was determined to stay hidden to wait for Zhang Heng's and Simone's arrival.At such proximity, it was almost impossible for the enemy to miss his shot. The man in the mask lifted the submachine gun in his hand. Not to be outdone, Simone had her rifle held in her hands as well. She had no time to aim, adjust her breath, or stabilize her shooting position. All she could do was run and shoot at the same time.The shot was fired. Seconds later, the masked man's pupils contracted. He froze, then collapsed to the ground with a sickening thud! Simone had managed to kill him without aiming. Unfortunately, there was no time to catch a breath. Soon after that, more people started coming after them.Zhang Heng swiftly picked up the submachine gun and a few boxes of ammunition before he started to run again. If Maji was telling the truth, then northwest should be the most vulnerable spot for the enemies. That did not mean that once they were there, they would be completely safe. There could be an ambush lurking for them in the dark. After what they experienced earlier, they were much more cautious this time.Read more chapter on vipnovel.comIt was easy for one to hide in the forest, but at the same time, it was also easy to be ambushed. Until now, Simone had no idea what was going on. She was left stunned when she saw that the man who ambushed them was actually one of the guerillas.Suddenly, Zhang Heng felt that it wasn't too bad a thing they had this language barrier. He was unable to tell Simone that her own country had betrayed her even if he wanted to do so. The two of them did not stay at the same place for too long, and after collecting some weapons and picked most of the ammunition, they continued to run towards the forest.While they were running, they encountered a few enemies. Fortunately, these were either alone or walked in pairs. Simone's had superior hearing ability and vision when compared to most of her counterparts. In most cases, she was able to spot enemies first before they spotted her. That was why most of her battles ended really fast.The deeper they went, the fewer enemies they encountered. It turned out Maji wasn't lying to them. Soon, they would be able to break through the defense line.As they walked on, they suddenly heard someone shouting in the forest. Zhang Heng couldn't understand what they were talking about but sensed that Simone's emotions had drastically changed. She just stood there frozen and had stopped moving.Zhang Heng guessed that they were pulling some dirty tricks to draw her out. They must be telling her that their target was actually Zhang Heng and wanted her to help them to capture him. This situation was the double-cross of crosses. Her country had already betrayed her, but here, they were still lying to her, taking advantage of her loyalty. If he could ever speak in Finnish, Zhang Heng would definitely tell her the whole truth. It seemed that the enemies knew that he could not converse in Finnish.Alright. Zhang Heng did know how to speak in Finnish if only a couple of words. He could try to squeeze out something to explain himself. However, knowing that his broken Finnish was going to make him seem more suspicious, he decided to stay mum. He had said everything that he needed to say back at the cottage. Right now, it was all up to Simone. The longer they stayed here, the more dangerous the situation was going to be. Still, Zhang Heng did not rush her.Both of them just stood in the dark until someone approached them. Simone lifted up her head and looked at Zhang Heng, looking as serene as usual. Right now, Zhang Heng was at a massive disadvantage. If Simone started to fall for their lies, he would have to drag her away by force. To his surprise, she lifted up her rifle and pulled the trigger! A man standing beside the tree was hit.Simone had just used actions to say what she had to say. Rather than trusting the words of some strangers, she chose to put her faith in those who had genuinely spent time with her.Sometimes, women trusted their hunches more than theories. And this soon proved to be true.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Two hours later, it was all but complete silence. Zhang Heng deduced that they must have successfully broken through the enemies' defensive lines.Both of them had now reached the lake that Maji mentioned earlier, finding a boat tied to its banks. With that tiny rowboat, they would be able to shake off all the enemies that were chasing them, no longer having to worry about their scent being tracked down by hounds.Just as Zhang Heng was about to get on the boat, Simone collapsed suddenly! A muzzle flash came from the darkness followed by a speeding bullet whizzing by. The round lodged itself in her shoulder and was embedded deep in her flesh.There was an active shooter nearby!Simone didn't wait and reacted with lightning-fast reflexes. After going through several battles with Zhang Heng, both of them knew what to do by now. Instinctively, she rolled over to the side, quickly looking for a nearby tree nearby and took cover behind it. The second shot whizzed by Zhang Heng's ear. This time, it was so close it left him paralyzed in shock!Without a doubt, they had encountered a pro this time. The earlier battles might have looked dangerous as the enemies had the upper hand since they outnumbered them. However, both of them had the advantage when it came to fighting with a small group. It seemed like these new enemies had pretty good teamwork and strict discipline. They were, however, vulnerable when they were alone.It was safe to say that although they were as skillful as the guerillas, they could never be as good as Simone.However, the sniper that they just encountered was on a different level altogether. Judging by the accuracy of his shots, he must at least be as good as Simone. This guy would prove a painful headache to deal with. With such skills, he could easily be the poster boy of every task force that he joined.If this were to be a normal situation, of course, they would have figured out a solution. Unfortunately, the enemy managed to land a shot on the shoulder that she used to hold her gun. Though she trained to shoot with her left hand, its speed and accuracy could never compare to her right. Frankly, this seemed the moment the grim reaper had finally arrived. They could seriously lose their lives at any moment now.Zhang Heng realized that they were in a life-threatening situation. The visibility in the forest was so poor that he could not use his ace in the hole \u2013 Shadow Moment. The enemy might even call for backup if they continued to linger.To their greatest surprise, the enemy who hid in the dark did not do so. After the two gunshots, silence once again embraced the forest. It was as if nothing happened. The wind passed them by, and the wooden boat still bobbed gently on the lakeside. Zhang Heng then saw blood dripping from her fingertips. Simone frowned but did not say a single word about it. She was unable to feel it, her arm becoming paralyzed in some way by the gunshot wound.Zhang Heng drew in a deep breath and used his hand to signal Simone to relax. Usually, she would be the one protecting him in a situation like this. This time, Zhang Heng knew he needed to be the one that protected Simone. He then took out the wooden sculpture from his pocket and extended his arm with it. Seconds later, the sniper fired squarely at it without doubts! Zhang Heng held on to it as tightly he could to avoid it from flying out of his hand.After that, he studied the wooden sculpture. By judging how deep the bullet had penetrated the wooden statue, Zhang Heng could calculate how far the sniper was. If Simone was not wounded, she could have surely returned fire. However, even without her assistance, Zhang Heng could still estimate where the sniper was. It would prove impossible for him to defeat the sniper if he charged out right now.The sniper's shooting skills clearly bettered Zhang Heng's. The only way for him to win this fight was to pinpoint the sniper's exact location. So, Zhang Heng took out the bullet-shaped lighter that he acquired earlier and used the same way to check out the sniper's position. He struck the flint, and just as expected, the sniper landed a shot on the lighter. This time, the lighter was sent flying away from Zhang Heng's hand.Calmly, he took out the third item. This time, the sniper was smart enough to know Zhang Heng's intention. No matter what Zhang Heng did, he stopped firing at the item that he saw. Two minutes later, Zhang Heng took out his cellphone. Ever since he joined the guerillas, he had stopped using it. Initially, its battery was at 50%. After putting it to sleep for two months, it was now left with a lethargic 10%. It was just enough to help him to gain the upper hand.No one in this era had seen a cellphone before. The two items that Zhang Heng sent out were just decoys. As the third item that he sent out was his cell, he used it to record his surroundings for two minutes. Lastly, he turned on his flash function to illuminate he place a total of four times.And that was how Zhang Heng located where the sniper was. The sniper was well prepared, wearing a ghillie suit of sorts. Not only was he equipped with camouflage, but he enhanced it with snow, mud, and branches. He was now one with his surroundings, almost invisible if one did not look hard enough.Unfortunately, he could not escape the sharpness of a modern 12-megapixel camera. The real danger had only begun.Zhang Heng's advantage was that he came in a pair. Therefore, it was impossible for the sniper to know who was going to attack first. In other words, he had to split his attention between two different persons, continually shifting from side to side. When Zhang Heng enlarged the photo that he took, he saw that the sniper expression, an excited, gleeful sneer across his face. He was beaming with some sort of glorious purpose in his eyes.Was he relishing the joys of hunting?Zhang Heng finally understood why the sniper didn't call for his allies. This was his hunting grounds and would never allow anyone to encroach his territory. Zhang Heng knew that ultimately, he wasn't the target.His target was the girl known as the White Death \u2013 Simone.It seemed like the reason why he fired the shot earlier was to eliminate Zhang Heng. With that, he would be able to have a head-to-head face-off with Simone.Zhang Heng signaled Simone to relax her injured shoulder and hold the rifle in her other hand. Though he could not see what was going on, he could guess that the sniper must be really nervous right now.The final showdown was nigh!Seconds later, a black shadow charged from the back of a tree! The sniper cowering behind the trees had an adrenalin rush the moment he saw something flashig in front of him.Prey?!No. It couldn't be.It was a trap!The astute sniper took a swift 0.01 seconds to deduce that the black shadow was simply a jacket! Though he had his rifle aimed at it, he managed to stop himself from pulling the trigger. At the same time, he got even more excited. Simone must have been ready to return fire since she pulled a trick like this.Seconds later, his heart skipped a beat. That was because it wasn't Simone that had appeared from the tree, but instead, Zhang Heng was the one who had emerged from another direction!It was at that moment that the sniper realized he had made a fatal mistake.He expected that Simone would come out to take the shot. The jacket and Zhang Heng were just illusions and distractions! Hence, he did not shift his aim.Besides, he was initially confident enough that they were unable to pinpoint the exact spot he was hiding in such a short amount of time. That was why he hesitated. At the same time, Zhang Heng lifted up his rifle as fast as possible. Utilizing the shortest amount of time, he took aim and fixed his posture fo the shot.Zhang Heng now knew exactly where he was hiding.He knelt on the ground and prepared to pull his trigger at the sniper. However, the enemy soon realized that someone was aiming at him from another direction and immediately changed his aim. Zhang Heng heard something but in his deep concentration, he couldn't identify the sound.Both of them then pulled the trigger at the same time.One bullet grazed someone's face. The other had penetrated someone's skull.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He moved all the chopped wood back to the storeroom and arranged them neatly among the piles. A loaf of fresh bread and some fish soup was on the table when Zhang Heng entered the house.The owner of this farm was a 67-year-old lady called Greta. Her husband and only son were tragically killed on the battlefield. She had a daughter as well but had since been married off to a man in the United States. A month ago, she took in Zhang Heng and Simone out of kindness, besides needing help with the farm work as well. Hence, the two of them decided they would put up here for some time.When anyone asked about the two newcomers, Greta would tell them they were the relatives of her daughter's husband. Zhang Heng's fluent English was enough proof. As for Simone, she was a quiet girl and disliked socializing. As time passed, people around started to accept who she was. For good measure, both tossed away their weapons on their way here. Simone's gunshot wound was treated by a doctor who lived in a small town. The sad truth was, Simone had no family left in this world, with her great-grandfather passing away two years ago. In other words, there was nothing to hold her back and tie her down in this world.Once the battle at the lake was over, Zhang Heng initially wanted to settle down in America with Simone only to realize later on that his plan was less than ideal. First, America was located too far away from Finland. Traveling all the way there would take a long time. Secondly, Simone's English wasn't the best. She would have a hard time communicating with the locals if she stayed there.In the end, Zhang Heng thought it best to stay at the border between Finland and Switzerland. Finland was one of the dukedoms of Switzerland, which was why most Finnish could also speak Swedish. As for the people who stayed in the villages near the border, it was common that they would converse in two languages, Greta being one of them. At least Simone could freely communicate with the people here.Through the window, Zhang Heng could see that Simone was returning from hunting. She had her sniper slung at her back and had a rabbit and a fox with her. As she entered the house, she placed today's catch in the kitchen, stored her hunting rifle in the attic, and washed her hands before settling in the dining room to have her meal.Grandma Greta scooped a bowlful of fish soup for everyone with Zhang Heng thanking her in Finnish. This was an ordinary night for them, peaceful and joyful. After dinner, they bid each other their goodnights before retreating to their respective rooms.Greta was already up in the early hours of the morning, preparing Zhang Heng and Simone's breakfast. She then put it in a basket Today, Simone wasn't wearing the hunting outfit that she'd put on each morning. Instead, she had put on a dress with a floral design. Since this was a dress that had been made initially for Greta's daughter, it seemed a little too small for Simone, looking slightly uncomfortable and squirmy.\u201cHave fun today,\u201d said Greta while passing the food basket to them.\u201cBye, Greta!\u201d Zhang Heng replied as he gave Greta a hug.\u201cGoodbye, children!\u201dGreta waved at them from afar. They sure looked very much like a couple going for an outing. Zhang Heng hopped on a bicycle, and Simone sat on the back. They soon passed the paddy field, and then a square in a small town, where their tiny hospital was plastered with blood donation posters. They enjoyed the serenity of the atmosphere as they passed all of it.The war in Finland had ended, but the war in Europe had only just begun. Switzerland was considered a neutral nation. Hence, they did not need to suffer the pains that came along with war, making it a paradise during the era of the Second World War.Shortly after that, Zhang Heng parked his bicycle on a grass field located on the outskirts of the hamlet. As they alighted the bike, they both carried the food basket down, seeing a field of flowers around them. Zhang Heng had no idea what species they were, but he heard that the national flower of Finland was called lily-of-the-valley. Unfortunately, this was not the right time to watch them fully bloom.This was his last day of the quest. Earlier, Zhang Heng had told Simone that this day would arrive, to which she had said nothing. All she wanted was to spend time and have fun with him during his last day in Finland.After taking a pleasant walk along the streets of the town, they fished at a pond and even managed to play some poker. In the end, they settled on a small hill to enjoy the fish sandwiches prepared by Greta. Still, they spoke little to each other.Their silence did not mean they were awkward, but rather, this was simply their way of spending time with each other. Simone's hair and dress fluttered in the wind. At last, she lay her head on Zhang Heng's lap, and she closed her eyes. Zhang Heng then took a look at his watch, took off his jacket, and covered Simone with it. Her eyebrows twitched while she was asleep. Seconds later, he heard a familiar voice.[Time to return. Quest completed\u2026][You have completed \u2018The Mannerheim Line Welcomes You' quest. The game's third round has been completed. You will now be sent back to the real world\u2026]\u2026\u2026.Zhang Heng opened his eyes, finding himself sitting on a chair. It was unreal. Amongst the three quests that he'd completed, this was the shortest. However, he was always on edge throughout the entire mission, having to face the possibility of being killed by enemies every single day. Thrown all the way from World War II back into the current world, Zhang Heng felt that he had just traveled through time. The one single thing that he could rely on was no longer there.\u2026\u2026..This time, Zhang Heng sat dazed for half an hour before he finally stood up. Something fell out of his pocket, and when he saw it, he was shocked. It was a necklace with a pendant made of an animal bone, the necklace that Simone had worn all the while! The bone used here was smaller than the ones given by the old man in Chinese attire. This one was as tiny as a fingernail.What seemed to be a tall red pine with thick branches and a complicated root system was engraved on it. Zhang Heng hadn't the slightest of when Simone slipped it into his pocket. Since he could carry it back, that meant it was a game item. After spending 140 days, Zhang Heng thought that he would not acquire a game item in this round. To his surprise, the necklace had actually been with him for a long time.He did not look for the bartender lady to identify the item, knowing that it shouldn't carry any side effects as Simone had been wearing it for a long time.Right now, another item needed to be identified urgently. It was the Moresby bone. Zhang Heng had taken the old man's advice, trying his best to not let others know about their relationship. So, he had to wait until the quest ended before allowing the bartender to identify the item.\u201cI know that you possess a Lucky Rabbit Foot. Another game item?! Three rounds of quests, and you acquired three game items? Are you the son of the Lucky Goddess?\u201d asked the bartender while staring at him with gaping eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only a few people were still partying in the bar downstairs when Zhang Heng stepped out of the lounge.Instead of summarizing his experience right away as he did in the past, he returned to the university, showered, and went straight to bed. Right now, all he wanted was to clear his mind of any thoughts. He genuinely did not want to think about anything.In the middle of his slumber, the door suddenly creaked open, rousing him from his sleep. Zhang Heng instantly rolled off his bed and reached for a gun, but obviously, there was nothing for him to grab.Wei Jiangyang who had just walked into the room was startled at his friend's reaction. He stood at the door, too stunned to react for a moment before muttering, \u201cBro\u2026 brother, are you alright?\u201dZhang Heng cringed at the slightly awkward situation. Even though his body was physically the same, that two month war experience had scarred him in a whole different way.Compared to before, he was a much lighter sleeper \u2013 even the slightest of movements would wake him. This was his body's self-defense mechanism kicking into high gear, in response to the complex and harsh environment he had been put into. Now and then, whenever he was walking down the street, he would subconsciously look around, keeping an eye out for bunkers.Zhang Heng knew very well about a mental condition called PTSD, which stood for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It was common among veterans who had fought in wars. Mostly, symptoms varied from a complete reeenaction of the battle experience, reclusiveness, and hypervigilance.Currently, Zhang Heng was more prone to the third symptom. Although able to recover from most of the war's trauma in his final month in Sweden, it was going to be really difficult for him to return to the mental state he was in prior to the war.Since he was already awake, Zhang Heng decided to not continue sleeping. He found himself something to eat in the cafeteria, then proceeded to the library with his laptop.After spending an entire afternoon completing the game's summary, Zhang Heng found himself thinking about the necklace in his pocket, so he looked up Finnish folklores on the internet.Finnish and Ugrian folklore were around even before the 10th Century and were very similar to those of the Samoyedic people and the Altai tribe. As time passed, the neighboring tribes had slowly influenced their lore.Iranian myths, Turkic myths, and Baltic myths had, in their own way, been incorporated into Finnish folklore. Later on, influence of Islamic and Christian cultures was apparent as well. It was a very complicated subject, involving numerous deities. Considering these tales were not the most popular, only few records were left of them.Zhang Heng had no choice but to breach the Great Firewall of China to access Google for the information he wanted. He had been combing through the web until 10 pm that night when he finally found a picture of a necklace that looked identical to the one he had.Zhang Heng's drowsiness suddenly vanished! He clicked onto the webpage and found the deity in the picture\u2013Tapio, the god of the forest. He was an ancient Finnish God, depicted as a fir tree. It was said that he could help in making hunts more fruitful for those who worshiped him.\u00a0Religious reformist leader Mikael Agricola had preserved precious genealogical materials in a 'list of gods' which he had written in 1551. This included Tapio.Simone was born into a family of hunters and had grown up in the mountains with her grandfather. So, it was no surprise that she too worshipped Tapio.Except for the wood carving he obtained from Tokyo Drift, which he still found no information about, the Lucky Rabbit's Foot, Moresby, and the necklace from this round all had their connections to folklore. This was especially true for Moresby's appearance in the real world. Zhang Heng realized that things might not be as simple as they seemed.Unfortunately, the old man in the Tang suit had already left for Europe, and Zhang Heng had no one else he could ask about these things . Apparently, it was because of some old covenant that he could not reveal too much information to him. At least that was what the old man said before he left.Zhang Heng closed his laptop and remained seated for a while as he tried to piece the puzzle in his mind. However, not long after that, he heard the sounds of people giggling.Three girls had occupied the table to his left. Two hours ago, Zhang Heng noticed that one of them, a lanky girl with glasses, had been stealing glances at him. He thought that there was something on his face. Now, there were another two girls giggling too as they peeked at him in secrecy.When they saw that Zhang Heng was looking over to them, the two girls nudged the lanky girl. The latter got up from her seat and walked towards Zhang Heng, eyes on the ground.\u00a0She stuttered, \u201cFri\u2026 friend\u2026 Can I ask you a question?\u201dZhang Heng was a little surprised, but he knew why she had approached him. Even then, he still took the Advanced Mathematics workbook from her. Then, he very patiently wrote down a derivation process in great detail. After that, he looked at his mobile phone and told her, \u201cI'm sorry. My girlfriend is looking for me.\u201dA flash of disappointment flickered in the girl's eyes. She forced a smile, fumbled a thank you, before plodding back to her seat, crestfallen.Now that he had sown the seed, he had to see this lie he fabricated out of kindness to the end. Zhang Heng packed up his things and left.To his greatest surprise, however, it turned out that he really did receive a message on his phone. It was the bartender lady.Zhang Heng opened the pdf file she sent him as he walked towards the elevator with his bag. It turned out to be the long-overdue game-points service form that he had asked her ages ago.He briefly scanned the document. In addition to an identification service, there was also a list of items for sale \u2013 these were not game items, but a collection of bizarre things. When compared to these items, the tulewood box that contained them would easily be considered as ordinary.These peculiar objects included blood from a cow's first birth and the 45th feather of a crow, a bunch of things that made no sense. Amongst these were other normal items but seemed unusual because of their inclusion in the list.Zhang Heng texted the bartender lady just to be sure.[Penguin?]She replied after a moment.[Why? Are you trying to hit on me?]Zhang Heng continued,[No, I'm not talking about QQ. I just saw that 'penguin' is on the list of things for sale!]Business must have been slow because the bartender lady replied to him almost instantly.[Oh, why? Do you plan on buying one? They're relatively cheap. One game point for two. You'll even get a freezer for free!][No need for that. Thanks.]Zhang Heng just wanted confirmation. There was no point in keeping two penguins in the dorm, having no knowledge whatsoever about the creatures. Besides, the school had refused to install air conditioners for the dorms even after everyone had repeatedly demanded for them. The dorms were like furnaces during the summer. Not everyone could take the stifling heat, let alone the poor penguins.He continued to scroll down the list before something caught his eye.[What does 'extra game' mean?][It means precisely what it says it is, but you'll need to have 500 game points, and you can only choose from the previous game script. Its duration is also fixed at 60 days.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unlike Zhang Heng, not everyone would spend a year and a half in the game. Most would simply use that time to pick up new skills as their ranks were still not that high. So, the extra game was a good opportunity for them to continue improving their skills.But then again, 500 game points were simply too costly. Zhang Heng had gone through three rounds of games, yet he had only just broken through the hundred points ceiling. That meant that it would take him at least ten rounds to gather that many. If there was no other way to acquire those game points, very few people would be able to afford this product.However, that wasn't even the most expensive thing on the list. Zhang Heng kept scrolling and spotted an item that cost 800 game points - a Mission Failure Exemption Card.As its name suggested, this little card allowed its holder to escape punishment if they failed a mission.Presently, Zhang Heng had successfully passed all three games. The first and third game's main mission was survival. If he failed, he would die - a mission failure exemption card would be useless in such a situation. But for games like Tokyo Drift, Zhang Heng had no clue as to what kind of punishment the players would receive if they did not complete the mission.If he had enough points, getting one of those cards sounded like a good idea.Zhang Heng also saw something called the 'No.137 Permanent Game Point Membership Card' at the bottom of the page. This one was priced at an eye-watering 999 game points, an item that seemed particularly suspicious.According to the bartender lady, players with the membership card could enjoy a 20% discount when they spent their game points at checkpoints. Whether this was a good bargain or not, was all up to the players themselves to determine.Zhang Heng did not see a single game item in this long list. Other than the Extra Game and Mission Failure Exemption Card, the items on the list were real tangible things that existed in the physical world. The penguins, for example, were hard to acquire for most people living on earth. It required only one game point and even included free shipping, which was frankly a fantastic bargain.Of course, whether anyone would actually buy them in the first place was another question altogether.\u2026A week passed in a blink of an eye, and the end of the term was drawing near. The whole school was filled with students who only studied at the last minute. Hence, the library had recently become a hive of activity, brimming with students every day. The queue to the library had now extended to the entrance of the canteen, and this forced Zhang Heng to alter his routine.He would go to the gym and the archery range during the day, then wait it out until midnight. When the world had come to a halt, only would he make himself a cup of coffee and study in the empty library.Zhang Heng rarely skipped classes. Except for that time when he missed roll call for English class, he was mostly a diligent student, putting him out of danger of failing his subjects. However, since he had spent such a long time in the game, he had forgotten many things and it was necessary for him to review them.In the eyes of others, however, his behavior seemed a bit odd. Everyone was bustling around, trying to cram as much as possible in what little time they had to prepare for the term's final examination. Zhang Heng was the only one wandering around indifferently. Even his roommate, Chen Huadong, had managed to drag himself out of bed early every morning to study. With his head buried in books, Chen Huadong could not help but roll his eyes whenever Zhang Heng left the room with his bow.Worse still, Zhang Heng would always return very late in the night - almost always just before lights-out. Chen Huadong wondered how his friend would be able to find any time to prepare for the exam.\u2026Zhang Heng felt great today, successfully hitting a moving target 50 meters away. All ten arrows hit the bullseye. He ignored the coach's resentful looks and took a drink of water. Since he had just completed the third game, there was still plenty of time before the fourth and did not pack his schedule with all the training. After his practice, he headed to the park to feed the pigeons there instead of going to the gym. When night fell, he spectated a game of football in the stadium.It was ten by the time the match ended. Rather than taking the train, Zhang Heng opted to jog back to school. As he jogged, he passed by an alley and quickly noticed two drifters searching for food in a dumpster.They appeared to be a bedraggled grandparent and her grandchild, both wearing tattered and soiled clothing. The older one fished out a piece of half-eaten fried chicken and two packets of takeaways. She called her grandson to her and they crouched by the wall to eat. When she looked up, she saw Zhang Heng suddenly racing toward them!The pair had probably been bullied by other homeless for the moment they saw Zhang Heng coming towards them; they looked extremely terrified. The old lady dropped the plastic bag in her hand and reached to pull her grandchild closer.Suddenly, something fell on her shoulder. From his angle, Zhang Heng was able to see everything. The brick wall behind the old lady melted like hot cheese, and some sort of black liquid crawled onto her shoulder. When her grandson, about seven years old, saw this happening, he froze in his tracks.Zhang Heng ran quickly towards the elderly lady and grabbed her hand, but the black liquid was a hell lot stronger than he thought. That thing seemed to be able to shift between a liquid and solid form. Zhang Heng's pulling did nothing to free the old lady of its shackles.Although he was conservative on strength, it would have been useless even if he used all of it. If he exerted too much force, the old lady's body might be unable to take it. As Zhang Heng was racking his brain for a solution, the black liquid had already engulfed half of the elderly woman's body.Then as, if having a mind of its own, it crawled onto the old lady's arm towards Zhang Heng as if not satisfied with the prey that it already had.Zhang Heng reacted quickly, withdrawing his hand at the very last second! Then, he grabbed the motionless child - the sudden movement shook him from his daze, and in panic, he started struggling. He wanted to save his grandmother but the black liquid moved so quickly that, in less than a minute, it had completely engulfed the woman. It then slowly pulled her into the back.Half a minute later, Zhang Heng and the little vagrant were the only ones left in the alley.A sharp pain shot up Zhang Heng's right arm. The kid had bitten him and struggled himself free. He rushed to the wall and fell, knees to the ground. No matter how hard he thumped and punched the wall, the bricks remained unchanged, as if everything that had just happened was a bad dream.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think she was devoured by the wall . \u201d\u201cWhat? Is that a metaphor? Did the wall collapse and buried her alive?\u201d\u201cNo . Literally .

She might have just pulled an all-nighter at the station . Obviously, no one spending a night at the station would be too joyous after listening to Zhang Heng's ludicrous statement . However, being a matter of life and death, Zhang Heng had no reason to make up a story and mislead the police officer .\u201cMaybe I saw it wrongly as it was a really dark place . From my angle, all I saw was the woman disappearing into the wall . \u201dDownload our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?The officer frowned once again, albeit, this time, she managed to control her anger a little better . When she stared at Zhang Heng, she noticed that he did not flinch, with him gazing at her calmly . Judging from the way he behaved, she concluded that he wasn't fooling around . Zhang Heng had also mentioned that the place was too dark, and he failed to see anything clearly . So, she decided that she would not dwell on this question . Instead, she turned to asking questions about the relationship between him and the woman that disappeared .The police officer took a total of 20 minutes to record Zhang Heng's statement . Throughout the entire process, he was very cooperative . After the small commotion, the female police officer turned out to be very polite as well .\u201cSo\u2026 there is no sign of infringement . You didn't exactly provide us with reliable evidence, and that kid refuses to talk as well . I can't form a basis for a case from what you told me . Anyway, I would like to offer my thanks for reporting a homeless kid to us . We will try to identify him as soon as possible and contact his parents to come and pick him up . \u201dFor now, Zhang Heng had done everything he could do . This ended precisely as he'd expected . He was sad, but that matter was out of his control, knowing that it was impossible to save the woman . There were many people like her in a busy city . Usually, the busy pedestrians that walked the streets would simply pass them by . Whatever that slimy thing was, Zhang Heng knew that it was extremely cunning . It knew that such a target would not draw any attention even if it were brazen enough to devour her on the street . If Zhang Heng did not pass by the alley, no one would have noticed the disappearance of two homeless people in this city .Zhang Heng stood up and shook hands with the police officer . He then stole a glance at the kid that sat on the bench . He was still holding the fried chicken that he picked up from the bin, and seemed to be in great shock .Taking pity on the child, Zhang Heng took out 300 yuan from his wallet and handed it to the police officer .\u201cCan you buy some food for him?

Now that he is at our station, we will buy him some food later . \u201dZhang Heng was still rather upset after leaving the police station . The creature that he encountered this evening was definitely supernatural, and he had no idea who would do something like this . It could have been a monster like Moresby or even other players who possessed game items like him .Whatever the answer was, this was definitely not a good thing . According to the old man, 'things' like that had existed in this world for hundreds of thousands of years, peacefully co-existing alongside the humans . Clearly, the mysterious game had destroyed the balance .Suddenly, Zhang Heng realized that Moresby would appear at Hongqiao International Airport . The old man told Zhang Heng that it had chosen the two Chinese tourists randomly . Zhang Heng, however, did not agree . There must be a better reason why it had appeared on this foreign soil .The most troublesome part was the existence of other players . If those they survived the game, they must have acquired game items as well . Zhang Heng could not figure out the system that the game's creator used to select players . Not everyone had the intention to lay low like him . When someone came into possession of such great power, they would start to think of how to utilize their newfound abilities fully . Death in the game was the one factor that pushed everyone to take extreme measures . However, Zhang Heng had no intention to become a hero, nor did he want others to make a mess of where he lived .It was almost twelve when Zhang Heng arrived back at the university . He did not go through the main entrance, choosing instead to enter from the side door located west . This door was further away from the MRT station, and few elected to use this entrance . At times, some teachers would still use it because it was nearer to their residence .Download our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?As Zhang Heng came up upon the entrance, he saw a shiny black Mercedes-Benz parked on his right-hand side . Shen Xixi quickly shuffled off the car! An awkward situation emerged between them when she laid her eyes on Zhang Heng .Suddenly, Zhang Heng remembered a rumor that he had heard earlier . Unfortunately, the black Mercedes had already left, and he was unable to take a good look at the driver . Shen Xixi quickly put the black pouch into her bag as she attempted to make herself look as calm as possible .\u201cIt seems like we always meet at the wrong time,\u201d lamented Shen Xixi with a bitter smile .\u201cYou don't have to explain anything to me,\u201d Zhang Heng replied .Both of them were nothing more than friends . No matter what Shen Xixi did, she had no obligation to tell him about it . Besides, Zhang Heng did not believe in the rumors he heard . He knew she was smart enough to stop the Mercedes away from the front entrance, lest the things said about her would become truth . The only question he had was why Shen Xixi did not defend herself when the allegations were thrown at her .\u201cWe'll talk soon . My dorm will be locked in a bit . I have to hurry!\u201d said Shen Xixi after glancing at the time .The female dorm was further away from the western entrance, and the dormitories would be locked in five minutes .

After that, he did not come across any cases involving the unknown . Earlier, he was surprised when he received a message from Hayase Asuka . She wanted to invite him to an amusement park on Christmas Eve, where a few of her friends would tag along as well . This was not the first time she asked Zhang Heng out . She was the kind of that could not stay indoors for too long, heading out whenever the opportunity presented itself .The one thing that surprised Zhang Heng the most was her academic results . Although she always hung out, she still managed to pass her exams with flying colors, never having failed any subjects before . He even saw her fooling around on the eve of the finals .The way she behaved was actually very similar to someone Zhang Heng knew . Someone he had previously rejected a few times . He had never expected Hayase Asuka to be the persistent kind of girl . This time, he felt terrible that he had always dismissed her invitations, and so, went ahead and asked his friends to join him if they had nothing better to do . Ma Wei was passionate about doing well in his studies . As for Wei Jiangyang and Chen Huadong, they had been attempting to memorize everything that they studied so far . Both of them were dying for some entertainment outside the confines of the dorm room .\u201cAre you talking about the Japanese girl that you saved at Food Street? The thing is, we don't speak Japanese . \u201d\u201cErm\u2026 she'll be there with a few of her friends . It seems they are from China, Japan, and one of them is actually from Ukraine,\u201d replied Zhang Heng while reading Hayase Asuka's text .Download our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?\u201cNever mind . I don't think I will join you . \u201dThough Wei Jiangyang was interested in being friends with girls from different countries, he still thought that his life was his priority . He was not bold enough to abandon his girlfriend and instead have fun with others . As for Chen Huadong, he was devastated that his latest attempt in wooing Xu Jing had once again failed miserably . It would be a nice change for him to go out and distract himself from all the sorrow . Hence, he volunteered to go with Zhang Heng . Lastly, Ma Wei, the genius, was done with studying . He, too, decided to tag along with Zhang Heng .After that, Zhang Heng told Hayase Asuka that he would bring a couple of friends with him . It was all in good faith, and she was totally fine with it . Both sides had agreed that they would meet at the entrance of the amusement park . Seeing that there was still some time left before they headed there, Zhang Heng played a few rounds of basketball with Chen Huadong on his computer .After the game, they proceeded to the cafeteria for some food before departing . As the three of them had arrived ten minutes early, they purchased the entrance tickets first . When they came out, they spotted Hayase Asuke and her group of friends walking towards them .On her head was a beanie with two fur balls hanging from it . They swung around as she ran towards them . She quickly waved her hands at Zhang Heng the moment she saw him . Two boys and five girls were here with her . The handsome blonde bloke should be the exchange student from Ukraine . He might have looked all imposing and cool from the outside, but once they had gotten to know him, he turned out to be actually somewhat timid .Download our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?All of them did a simple introduction about themselves . Hayase Asuka even spelled out her name in Chinese . They got to know how good the exchange students' mandarin was the moment they started the introductions . Amongst them, the guy from Ukraine had the highest proficiency in Mandarin, his great grandmother being from China . So, he named himself Zhang Wei .As for the rest of the Japanese girls, only one of them could speak good Mandarin . That being said, they could all communicate with each other without problems . The only thing was that they had to say the words slowly, considering it wasn't their native language . The last Japanese girl had already started using some of the more complex Chinese phrases . Amongst them, Hayase Asuka had the lowest proficiency in Mandarin . Right after she introduced herself, she instantly reverted to Japanese again when she talked with the two girls . Apart from those two, the other two who could understand her were Zhang Heng and another boy that was currently taking Japanese classes .Seeing that everyone was here, Zhang Heng distributed the entrance tickets to each of them . The amusement park was packed with crowds of thousands because it was Christmas Eve, with most of the visitors being couples . There were even a few Santa Clausus standing at the entrance to give presents to those that were about to enter the amusement park, giving out gifts to the entering visitors .The group got their presents too, and when they opened theirs, they found out that they had all received different items . Zhang Heng got a nail clipper, and Ma Wei found a key chain . However, Chen Huadong was the luckiest amongst them, receiving a complimentary pass from the amusement park's management . The moment Hayase Asuke opened her present, her face immediately turned red! She quickly hid it in her bag before anyone saw it . Read comics on our webnovel . liveOne of the guys persuaded her to show everyone what she got, though, Zhang Heng could roughly guess the item that she received . Immediately, he looked for a topic to distract everyone . At his quick thinking, Hayase Asuka looked at Zhang Heng gratefully . To be honest, the amusement park wasn't as entertaining during the night . For safety reasons, rides like rollercoasters and other thrills were shut down . Fortunately, the park made up for it with spectacular live performances .Download our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?Zhang Heng and his friends queued up to try some of the games offered at the booths nearby . Seeing that the live show was about to start, some of the girls suggested that they should watch it first .\u201cYou guys go ahead . I will keep her company,\u201d said Zhang Heng when he saw that Hayase Asuka was more interested in the games she was playing .\u201cI will keep her company as well,\u201d said the other guy that spoke Japanese .Zhang Heng did not brush him off, noticing that was trying to woo Hayase Asuka . In the direction of giving them more alone time, Zhang Heng volunteered to help hold on to their personal belongings . Hayase Asuka was so excited that she did not suspect anything was amiss . Secretly though, the guy was extremely grateful for what Zhang Heng did .Download our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?While Hayase and the guy visited the haunted house, Zhang Heng settled on a bench to answer a call . The call came from Ireland and was his parents . They both wished him a happy Christmas . At the same time, they kept teasing him and asking him to take a picture of the girl that was close to him . Zhang Heng then took a picture of the couple on his left .\u201cThat's pathetic\u2026\u201dNow, his parents were nagging him, lamenting about their life in university . Judging from the background noise, Zhang Heng deduced that his parents were probably standing in front of a theater or stadium of some sort . As they were running out of time because the event they were about to attend was about to start, they had to come back to a more serious topic . They informed Zhang Heng that they would return to celebrate the new year with him . They even prepared a surprise for him as well .Zhang Heng did not entirely trust everything they said . It had been two years that his parents had not celebrated the new year with him . Last year, they were both on holiday but had chosen to travel to Africa instead of celebrating Chinese New Year with their son . Initially, Zhang Heng wanted to ask them about Moresby, Tapio, and the crows that appeared in his mind when he used the wooden sculpture .Though they most probably wouldn't qualify as parents of the year, they were still experts in all these mystical stuff . Considering they were coming back in about a month, Zhang Heng decided that he would only ask when they came home . Talking about matters like these on the phone might just turn out to be more confusing .After hanging up the call, Zhang Heng sat on the bench for a little longer . Suddenly, he saw someone familiar in the crowd . He frowned, when he looked again, the person had disappeared .Note : Please download the sponsor's game to support us!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just when he stood up from the bench and wanted to investigate, Hayase Asuka and the guy had come out from the haunted house .\u201cI was so scared! A face appeared out of nowhere when I was walking around just now . The creature even stuck out its tongue to scare me! My only thought after that was to get out of this haunted house as fast as possible . I should have just listened to you about not getting in . You are the smartest one here!\u201dZhang Heng then glanced at the guy beside her . He simply shrugged, looking somewhat disappointed . Visiting the haunted house was actually a good idea for a guy where usually, a girl would typically stay closer to him when she got scared . Hayase Asuka, however, was no ordinary girl, running as fast as her legs could take her when she was spooked . In the end, the guy had to go after her, and there was nothing very romantic about it .Zhang Heng gave up the idea of going after the mysterious person after the two of them interrupted him . The good thing was, he did not dwell on it . There were a lot of people that looked similar to each other in this world . After getting only a quick glance, the person he saw could have been anyone .\u201cWhat are we going to play next?\u201d asked Zhang Heng .\u201cDo I get to pick?!\u201d asked Hayase Asuka while pointing at the big teddy bear not far away from her .\u201cCan I have that teddy bear?\u201dDownload our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?Offering various types of games, these were a bunch of arcade booths managed by the amusement park itself . Soon, the three approached one of the staff in a Santa suit . The employee told them that the teddy bear was the prize for the mini-games .\u201cLet me give it a try then,\u201d said the guy .Since he was interested in Hayase Asuka, he aspired to prove himself in front of her . He then turned around and took a look at his options . In the end, he landed his attention on a shooting game . It was common for most guys to play FPS games . Shooting was a subject that they were definitely familiar with .After observing others play and reading the rules, he decided to give it a go . The guy tossed a token into the machine and picked up the laser gun . He then took a deep breath before pushing the 'start' button .The game itself was pretty simple, where all he needed to do was to hit as many balloons on the screen as possible . Different colors carried different scores . The player was given two minutes to collect as many points as possible . In the beginning, it was relatively simple, where the guy landed all his shots on the balloons that carried the most points . He even had the time to shoot the red and yellow balloons that carried lesser points . Soon, his score accumulated really fast . At the rate he was going, he would be able to claim the teddy bear in less than two minutes .As time passed, the balloons fell faster and faster, and black balloons started to pop up as well . The scores would be deducted if the player shot black balloons . The game was getting harder by the second . When the time was almost over, he started to panic and inadvertently hit another black balloon right before the time ended . In the end, his only reward was a sticker saying Merry Christmas .This pathetic result had deeply embarrassed him . So, he decided to go for another round . Perhaps it was due to his nervousness or his desperation for better results, he fared worse in this second round . This time, he accidentally hit a total of four black balloons . The people behind him were literally laughing at him . Judging by their buff physique and attire, they were most likely students from a university nearby here . Though the guy was very unhappy that they were laughing at him, there was nothing he could do about it .Download our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?A fight almost broke out when one of them called him a 'weak-ass . ' Though the person simply muttered it out, it was clear enough for the people around him to hear everything . In the end, they laughed at him even harder . Hayase Asuka could not understand the conversation, but she could sense that something was not right . So, she quickly told the guy that she did not want the teddy bear anymore . It was better for them to look for fun elsewhere .Zhang Heng was fine with that . When the guy saw that the group of boys who laughed at him were strong and muscular and that there were only three of them, he knew that things could take a worse turn for them if he decided to confront them . None the wiser, he decided to swallow all the frustration that was burning within him .The three of them ignored the rowdy gang and proceeded to the dart-throwing booth next door . On the other hand, the group of guys that laughed at him tried the shooting game . Hayase Asuka was overloaded with luck tonight .Although she had never undergone professional training, she still managed to hit the bullseye thrice! Though her last dart missed the target, she still managed to get the fourth prize . The attendee then handed her a mug, which instantly lightened up her mood . Her admirer standing beside her was clearly distracted . He still had his attention focussed on the group of guys that laughed at him earlier . After playing two rounds, they only managed to win a consolation prize .\u201cI thought you guys are supposed to be really good,\u201d the guy jeered at the group sarcastically .One of the boys that looked like a basketball player overheard what he said . He turned around and looked at him with a smile .Download our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?\u201cHey! It's you guys again . Why are you still here? Come play one round with me then . \u201dHe did not expect his soft whisper to be heard by them . Nevertheless, the was forced to accept the challenge knowing that this was the worst time for him to act like a coward .\u201cWhat do you want to play?\u201d\u201cLet's all play a round of the shooting game then since we all look down on each other . I'm not going to make your life difficult, don't worry . All you need to do is call yourself a weak-ass if you lose . \u201dThe guy was furious when he heard the degrading slur again . As he looked at their score, he felt that he should be able to beat his opponent if he played carefully this time .\u201cFine! Let's do it then!\u201dDownload our sponsor's game and get 30$ reward!!!Remove Ads?The group guys were clearly excited when he accepted their challenge . All of them started to look at him as if he was a clown that was ready to perform in front of them .\u201cWang Bin, you are so mean! Why are you bullying a retard?\u201d asked one of the group members while blowing a whistle .\u201cI have to do it . He is calling us weak . He wants to teach us a lesson and brag in front of his girlfriend,\u201d said Wang Bin with both hands wide open .\u201cYou first or us first?\u201d asked the guy who spoke Japanese .Suddenly, he felt that something was not right . Their shooting was not as good, but they acted really confident in front of him . Was that simply mind games?Although he knew in his heart that it probably was, he still couldn't muster up enough courage to face them confidently . He even started to regret accepting the challenge .Truth be told, Hayase Asuka did not actually understand the word 'weak-ass', and he was the one who was feeling embarrassed . In one way or another, Wang Bin was right about him . Without a doubt, he did have the intention to show-off in front of Hayase Asuka .Note : Please download the sponsor's game to support us!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he performed well, he could exert tremendous pressure on his opponent, putting him under a lot of stress. At the same time, that would also mean his trump card would be revealed. The guy speaking fluent Japanese hesitated for a while before choosing to go after his opponent, suspecting that his nemesis was playing tricks on him.After they made their choices, everyone from the opposing team had their eyes on a plump guy standing amongst them. When compared to others of the same age, he looked like an ordinary, unassuming guy that no one would notice. The outdated Bosideng down jacket that he wore would surely pass unperceived. Earlier,\u00a0when his friends were playing the shooting game, he just stood there silently without saying a word.\u201cWhy did you guys bring me trouble again?\u201d he asked, then smiled when he realized that everyone was looking at him.\u201cWe are all just hanging out since its Christmas Eve. I will buy everyone supper when this is over,\u201d Wang Bin proclaimed while handing the laser gun to the plump guy.\u201cThis will be the last time I'll be doing something like this. Teacher Guo advised us to stay out of trouble while we are here.\u201dThe moment he picked up the gun, his temperament switched entirely, as if transforming into another person. One could instantly tell that he was no amateur from the way he held the laser gun. Immediately, the guy fluent in Japanese could feel that something was not right. Still, he was left with a tiny bit of hope that he could beat the plump guy.The moment the game started, the plump guy's performance completely annihilated whatever little hope he had. He might have looked ordinary, but his shooting skills were definitely something out of this world. At the early stages of the game, his superb skills weren't apparent as the game was still easy. When the balloons started appearing faster and faster on the screen, he could still land his shots on the balloons that carried the most points.His scores were rising steadily. Left in shock, the guy who spoke fluent Japanese realized that his opponent had surpassed his best score, and he still had half a minute left to complete the game.\u00a0Right until the end, the balloons appearing on the screen became so fast that it almost faded into a blur. It was at that moment that the plump guy started to miss.It was no longer relevant, however, as his score was high enough for the top prize. Upon seeing the win, the attendant of the arcade carried the giant teddy bear and approached him.\u201cI don't need this giant teddy bear,\u201d said the plump guy while putting down the laser gun.\u201cWhat now? Do you still want to compete with us?\u201d asked Wang Bin while tapping on the shoulder of the guy who spoke fluent Japanese.At that very moment, he realized that he had walked into a trap. The plump guy was no ordinary man. There was a reason why he was in the same school as Wang Bin. His forte was clearly not physical sports. From the way he performed just now, everyone realized that he must be a professional Esports competitor.\u201cYou should honor the bet you made since you've lost the game.\u201dWang Bin then took out his cellphone from his pocket and turned on the camera, switching it to record. The guy speaking fluent Japanese was deeply embarrassed in front of everyone. He knew that Wang Bin had intended all the while to make him look like a fool in public. What he did not expect was his opponent recording anything on video. His reputation would be eternally tainted if the clip were uploaded to the internet.The worst thing here was that his impulsive decision had also dragged Hayase Asuka and Zhang Heng in with him. Despite all that, however, he did not hear Wang Bin saying anything about the loser having to do whatever he was asked to do.He was so distracted that he did not realize the two persons beside him were gone. The plump guy harrumphed and saw that a crowd had started to gather around the arcade machine. He pinned the\u00a0Eastern Tree Leaf drink he was holding under his armpit and picked up the laser gun.\u201cCan I borrow two tokens from you?\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Heng voiced out, asking Wang Bin for the coins.\u201cNot about to give up, huh? Fine.\u201dWang Bin then took two tokens from his pocket and tossed it to Zhang Heng, who inserted one of them into the machine and placed the other under the screen.\u201cThis token is for you to challenge my score later,\u201d Zhang Heng told the plump guy.Immediately, the crowd fell into a hushed silence. Even the guy fluent in Japanese thought that Zhang Heng had gone insane. Everyone saw that the plump guy dominated the shooting game. According to the arcade's employee, the giant teddy bear had been sitting there for two months, with nobody managing to claim it as their own. This was the first time that someone had won it fair and square.The plump guy was surprised that Zhang Heng wanted to challenge him. The crowd had started booing, but Zhang Heng chose to ignore them, starting the game instead. Somehow, he held the gun in a rather amateurish way. There was nothing particularly skillful about that.Then, the tables started turning.The moment he started firing a few shots, the plump guy quickly suspected that Zhang Heng might actually be better than him.Outsiders were just there to watch them compete, but a real pro like the plump guy could instantly tell that Zhang Heng was a truly skilled marksman. In the game's early stages, most players gained points at a predictable rate. Although the balloons had gradually appeared faster and faster on the screen, the plump guy observed that Zhang Heng still maintained his calm, and his performance had remained steady.Zhang Heng played the game differently from the plump guy. Zhang Heng's score increased bits by bits. After all the in-game battle-hardened training he got, his observational skills had grown better than most. Unlike the others, he did not impulsively focus only on the highest-scoring balloons while missing out on the rest.After observing for a while, the plump guy noticed that Zhang Heng would arrange the balloons on the screen based on their value in the shortest time possible. He would not necessarily always shoot the ones with the highest value. Instead, he made sure to take out the rest of the valuable balloons before they left the screen as well. That meant Zhang Heng had to continually change his shooting sequence.The plump guy had no idea how Zhang Heng managed such an incredible, striking great fear in him. Two minutes soon passed.When Zhang Heng finally put down the laser gun, he realized that half of the crowd from the arcade center was watching him. Finally, his points on the screen stopped increasing. His final score was 2,765, 636 points higher than the plump guy's. Hayase Asuka was filled with excitement when she compared the scores.This time, the group that bullied them was left speechless. Wang Bin quickly turned around and looked at the plump guy hoping that he would start another challenge. The plump guy, however, could only gaze at the coin on the machine with a bitter smile.\u201cI don't think I can surpass his final score.\u201dWang Bin and the rest of them became deeply embarrassed. Never in their minds did they imagine that he would lose to Zhang Heng. They were at a loss, not knowing what they should do now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although it was true that Zhang Heng surpassed the score required for the first prize, no one would have expected that two players would be good enough to claim first prize. It was definitely a rare situation. The arcade's management, too, had no idea what to do next. As the victors were already present, going to get a second giant teddy bear now was out of the question.In an attempt to ease the predicament, the employee suggested that they could choose other prizes in exchange for the bear.Zhang Heng turned around to look at the group that bullied them earlier. It seemed this Wang Bin guy was the leader of the group. He appeared somewhat happy with the outcome and chose to stick to the bet.\u201cWe have lost, and we will call ourselves weakasses.\u201dZhang Heng was taken aback hearing that they would stick to their promise. Since they came in bigger numbers, they could actually leave the place without honoring the deal. It would be embarrassing if they did so, but still, it was better than calling themselves weakasses. As for Asuka's admirer, Zhang Heng was truly disappointed in him. Although having knowledge that he lost the bet and had even dragged both of his friends into his trouble, he didn't even have the courtesy to tell his opponent that he would bear all responsibility.\u201cYou don't have to call yourself that in public. I know you guys don't really want the giant teddy bear. Why not just give it to us? Then, we can put this matter to rest,\u201d Zhang Heng offered.Wang Bin was taken aback by the methods Zhang Heng had used to deal with this matter. A few seconds ago, he saw the guy who spoke fluent Japanese taking out his cellphone and was prepared to put them on the record. They thought that they would surely be humiliated to death by the three of them.Now, they were pleasantly surprised when they heard Zhang Heng's suggestion to call this off peacefully. Everyone initially thought that he was extremely arrogant when he left the coin under the screen if the plump guy asked for a rematch. His prior actions contrasted greatly with the merciful decision that he just made.Zhang Heng and Wang Bin were no enemies, having simply undergone a small conflict. Earlier, Wang Bin was bullying the guy that spoke fluent Japanese because he knew that he had the plump guy behind him, which was why Zhang Heng used the same method to let him taste his own medicine.The token just sat there under the screen, but none of them dared to touch it. This tiny gesture trumped over whatever word that would come out from one's mouth.Since they had learned their lesson, Zhang Heng had no intention to humiliate them in front of everyone. Immediately, the plump guy handed the giant teddy bear to Hayase Asuka.\u201cThis is great! True men like us should not play with teddy bears anyway. It's a good thing you guys want it from us.\u201dThe other members of the group laughed and smiled, seeking to make the whole affair a little less awkward. Before this incident, they had always go around and mess with other people solely in the name of proving that they would be the winner. This was their first time tasting the bitterness of what it was like to lose. Seeing that Zhang Heng was willing to let them off the hook, they were all relieved. Having no intention of lingering around any longer, they left the arcade the moment everything was settled.Wang Bin was the last to leave. Zhang Heng frowned when he saw him walking towards them. He believed that he was a sore loser and wanted to come back for revenge.\u201cI owe you a favor this time. Save my number on your cellphone. You can call me anytime you need my help. Let me be frank. We are not going to get ourselves in any sort of fights. Our school is really strict about these things.\u201dZhang Heng was astonished that Wang Bin did not throw a tantrum in front of them. In return, he nodded and took down his number.\u2026\u2026\u2026Hayase Asuka hugged the teddy bear tightly as they walked away. She felt as if she was living in a dream.\u201cWoah! I didn't know you're such a good shooter! Were you a secret agent or something?!\u201dHayase Asuka was so happy that she jumped around and pretended to shoot with her finger.Zhang Heng could only think of the first excuse that came to his mind.\u201cI play a lot of shooting games,\u201d he said.Since Hayase Asuka had never played an FPS game before, she did not suspect anything wrong with Zhang Heng's statement. All she knew was that he was really good at video games.On the other hand, the guy who spoke fluent Japanese was now embarrassed by what he did earlier. He knew that he would never be able to get Hayase Asuka to like him. Besides, Zhang Heng had overshot him by miles after successfully handling the matter. In the end, he made up an excuse for himself before hurriedly retreating to his dorm.Zhang Heng wanted to convince him to stay, but he was determined to leave. That meant only two of them were left. After that, they both decided to try out the bumper cars while waiting for the live performance to be over. Soon, they met up with the rest of them at the Ferris wheel.It was late, and the exam was at hand. So, they eventually decided it was time to head back to the hostel.Of course, if someone could win an award for the most fruitful trip, it had to be Hayase Asuka. She hugged the giant teddy bear with one hand, and her other held the mug, becoming the envy of many girls. While chatting with the other two Japanese girls on the MRT, she told them she had singlehandedly won those two items by herself!Of course, Zhang Heng had no intention to expose her. To be honest, if Wang Bin and his group of friends did not bully them in the first place, Zhang Heng would have never showcased his marksmanship.If Chen Huadong and Ma Wei were there with him, they would never believe that he improved his shooting skills all by playing FPS games. A month ago, Zhang Heng played CS:GO with Chen Huadong and Jiang Weiyang. Zhang Heng's shooting skills only slightly bettered Chen Huadong. He would never accept Zhang Heng's reason.All the skills he possessed right now were better than most of his counterparts. Considering that he was still really young, few people got to experience what he went through in the game.As his skills would only improve the longer he spent playing the game, it would surely be harder for him to explain the things that he could do when the time came. Simply put, Hayase Asuka had actually saved him a lot of trouble by claiming all the credit.\u2026\u2026.It was Christmas today and the last day to join the auction as well. Two days ago, Zhang Heng received an invitation from the gaming committee.He had been invited to join an auction for game items.Zhang Heng took a look at the auction's date and time written at the bottom left of the invitation and saw that is was to be held tomorrow night. He was always curious about how other players looked like, so naturally, he would not miss this opportunity. Of course, the main attraction was obtaining items that could assist him in-game.Shadow Moment had played a significant role in Zhang Heng completing the third round of the game. Without it, Simone would have definitely killed him in the game's early stage. Though he could not see it, the Lucky Rabbit's Foot helped him a lot as well.The chance of discovering these miraculous items were the reason why Zhang Heng looked forward to the auction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was wearing a black tuxedo perfectly tailored to his body, and there was a tag hanging in front of his chest. His player ID and place of registration were printed on it.Zhang Heng then glanced at his watch and realized that it was ten at night. That would mean the auction would end at eleven. This time, he did not need to worry about the bug created by the extra time he had.This round of the game was different from all the other quests that Zhang Heng completed. It was safe to say that he would not encounter any danger in this one, finally being able to relax.After checking out his surroundings, he discovered that this place was similar to checkpoints that he had to go through before entering any game. He could see other players around him, but their faces had been blurred out.One could not deny that the game's developers did an excellent job of protecting everyone's privacy. However, that did not mean that the players were always at peace with each other.\u201cIs this your first time attending an auction?\u201dSuddenly, Zhang Heng heard a voice from behind. Turning around, he saw a rather short man who immediately handed him his business card. His name was Ding Si, but Zhang Heng knew that it was fake.\u201cThe world is not as safe as we thought it is! Some lunatics don't know how to stick to the rules. We all have to be careful,\u201d blurted the short man while shrugging.\u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d\u201cYou should be a new player, right? Before this, every player knew how to treat others with respect. Everyone was willing to help each other out whenever the going got tough. Unfortunately, some of the psychotic players came across the identities of others. They then hunted them down in cold blood! Most players are now in fear after the incident. That's why everyone cares so much about their privacy nowadays. According to what I know, the number of people attending this auction is way lesser than last year.\u201d\u201cHunted?\u201dZhang Heng looked at the card again and saw the words \u2018North China Fu Lou Chamber of Commerce' along with the person's contact number.\u201cYes. A large number of players are being hunted down. One of them found out that killing other players would allow them to rob them of their game items and game points. After that, this whole killing business went out of hand, turning into a full-blown catastrophe to all other players.\u201d\u201cAre the developers going to do something about it?\u201d\u201cAs long as the players don't reveal any information about the game to other players, they would not stick their noses in the business of other players. It seems like they have something more important to deal with\u2026.\u201dDing Si had no intention to complete his sentence. Clearly, he did not want to dwell on it.\u201cYou attended this auction to purchase some game items for yourself, right? Let me know if you don't have enough game points, eh? Perhaps you can consider accepting our assistance.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Your chamber of commerce is selling game points?\u201d\u201cYou sure are a newbie, just as I expected. Not only the Fu Lou\u2026 many other chambers of commerce provide similar services as well. You can always purchase game points from us, though I wouldn't recommend it. The exchange rate is really high right now. You will need 4.2 million yuan to exchange for 1 game point. Usually, you would only need 3.7 million. The best thing for you to do right now is to pawn your game items to us. Once we have appraised it, we will instantly transfer the game points to you.\u201d\u201cThank you so much. I will think about it.\u201dDing Si was a professional salesperson. He knew the secrets of successfully closing a deal, patiently holding back and not pushing Zhang Heng into taking it.\u201cThe auction only begins in an hour and a half. You can go explore, walk around the place a little. There are some interesting spots on this cruise. The first deck has a casino, cinema, and a game room. The second deck houses a theater for live performances and a place for you to relax. The third deck is a public space for people to socialize. I'd advise you to check out the first deck before you proceed\u2026 if you want to.\u201dZhang Heng thanked Ding Si. This was his first time entering a social circle that was filled with players. In order to prevent more killings, Ding Si had told Zhang Heng that most of the players' real identities were strictly protected.This was the only time Zhang Heng could see so many players all at once in the same place. Other than bidding for game items, they would also seize the opportunity to enjoy the pleasantly entertaining facilities offered here.A good example was the Fu Lou Chamber of Commerce, where they provided the players with different services. Among these included bartering items for game points and providing loans. Otherwise, they would also help with the sale of game items and customize certain items according to the players' wishes. Custom-made items were usually cheaper than the regular by 20% to 30%. It was apparent that they were taking advantage of the auction to promote their services.Amongst the three, Zhang Heng was most interested in the third deck. However, he did not go there right away. Instead, he took Ding Si's advice and visited the lower deck first, managing to collect a few more business cards from different chambers of commerce. The services they provided slightly differed from each other, but they mostly charged similar prices. The one thing that they shared in common was that their game points were cheap. Of course, a particular risk presented itself when trading with them.Compared to all the other chambers, Fu Lou had the best reputation as it had been around since the very beginning.After that, Zhang Heng tucked all the business cards away into his pocket and rode the elevator to the third deck. This was the most crowded place on the entire ship. Someone was giving a briefing on a podium about the most effective way to accumulate game points. Zhang Heng then looked for a seat and listened to what he had to say. Soon though, he felt that the person would always change topics the moment he reached the key point of his speech.\u201cHe is telling us useless stuff! The formula for acquiring game points is the top secret of the chambers. No one would simply let it out. He's just trying to recruit others to join him.\u201dThe middle-aged man extended his hand while talking to Zhang Heng.\u201cYou can call me professor. I hope you don't misunderstand. This is just my nickname. I think it's rude to address someone by a number. You either get a fake name or a nickname for others to address you.\u201d\u201cYou can call me Simone.\u201dZhang Heng shook his hand.\u201cWelcome to the game, Simone. Where are your teammates?\u201d\u201cTeammates?\u201d\u201cI think you should be a newbie, huh. The invitation said that every quest has its specific challenges. It is recommended for the players to form a team first before entering the quest!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We all come from different circumstances, and we have different forte as well. Some people love using their fists to solve their problems. Some prefer to use their brains to overcome their difficulties. Forming a team with others would allow you to overcome your weaknesses! After all, we are not superhumans. Your character panel should remind you of this as well. The previous quests that you have completed were probably designed to be completed alone. However, you will be in deep trouble if you come across a quest that cannot be completed alone!Of course, solo-quests have their benefits. The yield for each quest is fixed, and you get everything that you earned. Being in a team, however, would mean that you'll have to distribute your loot equally. Usually, people would only go solo after they have become stronger. Still, the risk of failure is very high. You can make all kinds of mistakes when you go solo on a quest.\u201dZhang Heng was dumbfounded. The old man with the Chinese attire was the one who had invited him to join this quest. It seemed that the other players entered the game differently. He did not receive the invitation that the professor mentioned earlier. Until now, he had also not met other players at the game stop. It was no wonder that he was still playing the game alone.Technically speaking, the old man did not actually put his life in danger. The extra 24 hours that he had was for him to solo the quest. This bonus time he had substantially lowered the risks of all the quests that he played.\u201cUnfortunately, my team is full now. Otherwise, I would have given you a test before allowing you to join my team. My advice is to go to the city that you live in and look for a team to join. This is going to be a long game. Your mental and physical state will undergo great stress, and you will eventually need someone to share it with. After all, we can never share these things with our friends and family. Your team members will be your pillar of support.\u201dZhang Heng knew that the professor was right about everything. Unfortunately, he also knew that he was meant to keep those secrets to himself and not share it with others. Considering that he spent two years alone marooned on a desolated island, he had no problems with staying and playing alone.\u201cI heard someone mentioning something about a guild. What is that?\u201d\u201cGuilds and chambers of commerce are formed by players, with both providing different services. Though you are still a newbie, I'm pretty sure that you've heard that the real world is actually not as safe as we thought it is. That is why certain players band together and form a guild to look after each other's backs. Some of them even volunteered to deal with the supernatural stuff that happens around them.\u201d\u201cSounds good to me. Why are you so against the idea of joining a guild?\u201dEarlier, the professor had criticized the guild member that speaking on the stage. Zhang Heng could sense hostility between his words.\u201cGuilds are supposed to exist to serve the greater good. As time passed, the definition of \u2018guild' changed. In a guild, everyone was supposed to take care of each other. Sadly, when certain members become more and more powerful, they wanted more than just taking care of each other. Due to this, some guilds have become unstable, the contributors to the chaos right now. We all have different opinions about guilds. Right now, I'm happy with my own team, and I have no interest in joining any other guilds.\u201dAfter chatting for a while, the professor descended to the first deck for a round of cards, and Zhang Heng stayed on the third to listen to speeches from different guilds. An hour and a half later, everyone stopped what they were doing and gathered at the ballroom.Zhang Heng came up with a rough estimate that there were around 4000 to 5000 people here. There were more than 500 items to be auctioned off today. Among these were 12 valuable items that required the bidder to raise their number if they wanted to bid for the item. As for the rest of the 488 items, players could only bid for them online. The system would then determine the highest bidder.While walking around, Zhang Heng crossed paths with Ding Si once again. It seemed like he had just closed in on a deal as he was smiling from ear-to-ear. He even greeted Zhang Heng first.He whispered, \u201cAccording to a rumor I heard just now, I was told that a B-grade game item would on auction later. And there are a few unique C-grade game items as well.\u201d\u201cAre B-grade game items rare?\u201d\u201cOf course! There are less than 200 B-grade game items within the entire circle of players right now. Most of the players I know would never sell these off. If I'm not mistaken, it was a B-grade item that left everyone in shock last year!\u201dDing Si was really excited as he described the game item. As a businessman, he was always infatuated by objects that carried extreme value.\u201cDreamland of Death! It's an item that can be used to curse others,\u201d Ding Si exclaimed. \u201dEveryone was afraid of this thing a few months ago. It can kill someone in their sleep when they are dreaming. The way to trigger this item is unknown. How the curse is lifted is unknown as well. A few elites in the player base have been cursed. The guild leader of Silver Wing was the owner of an grade game item and managed to survive the curse. In the end, a few guilds had to work together to eliminate the previous owner of the item. Since there's only one, it has been decided that they would auction it off.\u201d\u201cIt's basically impossible for anybody to bid for it. Leaders of these powerful guilds would never allow such a powerful item to land in the hands of an unknown stranger. I'm pretty sure that one of the guilds would eventually get it, and, the rest would take the game points instead. Anyway, their financial strength is unparalleled amongst all guilds and players,\u201d he continued.While they were talking, the auction finally began.The auctioneer was a 60-year-old man who looked really serious. The wrinkles on his face resembled the bark of an old tree. He had no intention to hide his face. Just like the bartender lady, he should be one of the employees of the committee as well.He waited until everyone was seated before presenting his five-minute-long welcome speech. Then, he introduced the first item to be auctioned.\u201cEscape Dagger. Grade-C. It can be used to teleport within a small area. Remaining uses: 3. You can check out its description after you bid for the item. The starting bid is 1,200 game points. Every additional bid costs 50 game points. The bidding ends when the hammer drops three times. Let's begin.\u201d\u201cDamn. That's a good item!\u201d said Ding Si.\u201cAre you going to bid for it?\u201d\u201cIt is a good item. Items that can be used to improve in-game survival are usually extremely costly! I'm here to looking for treasure for Fu Lou. It's not for myself. Items that are undervalued are my target tonight,\u201d answered an excited Ding Si while switching on his tablet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/48 Hours a Day48 Hours a Day Chapter 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91: Silent BiddingTranslator:\u00a0EndlessFantasy Translation\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0EndlessFantasy TranslationWhile everyone else started bidding for the Escape Dagger, Zhang Heng and Ding Si unlocked the tablets that were placed in front of them. This was his first time seeing so many game items all at once. There was a total of 80 pages, where a photo of each game item was displayed followed by its name, grade, and a short description.By showing all the items on tabs, the buyers would at least have some knowledge about what they were about to pay for. Of course, the auction house would not reveal every single detail. The value of Dreamland of Death, for example, would significantly drop if anyone knew the way to trigger it and killing someone with it. It was a risky business after all when one bid for items in an auction.When it came to risks, the Escape Dagger, for instance, was an item that came to scrutiny. It's description mentioned everything except for the distance it could teleport. The buyers had to make an educated guess by themselves and would have to accept that it was all fair game if eventually, the Escape Dagger did not live up to their expectations.Zhang Heng noticed that Ding Si did not look at the merchandise that was listed on the first few pages of the catalog. Instead, he went all the way to the last page. Ding Si put on a smile when he realized Zhang Heng peeking at his tab.\u201cThere are around 200 unidentified game items in this auction. Astute observation is required when checking out the stuff listed at the end of the catalog. Take a look if you're interested. These items are all set at a minimum reserve of 100 game points. However, most of them are F-grade, where only a small portion of them are of E-grade. And if you are extremely lucky, you might be able to spot a C or even B-grade item or two. Two years ago, a guy bought an unidentified game item. To his shock, it was a B-grade item when he identified it! That is what I call by a one-in-million exception! Usually, players would make a loss when purchasing unidentified items. It's all a gamble, you know. The players who have listed their items here in this category have done a lot of research themselves. They have to be very sure that the items that they sell here actually cost less than 100 game points each!\u201dZhang Heng then flipped to the last page, coming to a list of items with serial numbers written beside them. Players had put down their bidding prices beside some, but most were still available, having nobody bidding on them yet.\u201cFor some people, they have a real hard time deciding on which item to bid on. So, they would usually bid for items that others had bid for. To be honest, this is definitely an unwise move. The bidder wouldn't know when to stop since they have no prior knowledge whatsoever about the item. Say you manage to find the item you really wanted, there is still the option to wait up until the last second and bid on it right before the system closes.\u201dZhang Heng then thanked Ding Si for sharing all these tips with him. Though information like this was hardly a trade secret, it showed that Ding Si had lots of experience in maximizing profit during an auction. It was kind of him to share all those pointers with Zhang Heng, although it wasn't necessary for him to do so.\u201cDon't sweat it. Consider it as my long-term investment in you. Next time, if you wish to purchase a game item, you won't have to wait until the end of the year to do so. You can always come to Fu Lou and look for us. Our prices are always reasonable!\u201dZhang Heng did not impulsively scan through the unidentified items, instead, checking out the game items that were already identified first. He wanted to know how they priced all those items. Basically, an E-grade item would cost around 80 to 100 game points. D-grade items were around 300 to 600 game points. The gap grew wider when it came to C-grade items, usually costing thousands. Of course, prices of C-grade items varied depending on function. If it was an extremely useful item, the prices could go way beyond thousands.In the end, the Escape Dagger was sold at 2,050 game points.\u201cThat's overpriced. No doubt, the item is useful, but it definitely does not cost 2,050 game points. I think 1,500 is a more reasonable price. I suppose items that could save lives are usually in high demand. Maybe the person bidding for it needs it urgently.\u201dAfter that, the auctioneer presented the second item. He opened up a box made out of Tule wood and displayed the piece of bone inside for everyone to see.\u201cMoresby Bone. Grade: C. It can be used to cycle time. Remaining use: 2. You can get more information about it after you receive the item. The starting price is at 1,900 game points. Every bid increases the item's price by 50. The deal will be sealed when the hammer knocks three times. Let the bidding begin.\u201dThere was total silence, where not a single soul placed a bid for at least half a minute. The Moresby Bone was different from the Escape Dagger. Judging by the provided description, it was hard figuring out what it could be used for, and besides, a 1,900 starting price was undoubtedly a princely one.However, the starting prices of all these items sent to auction house tonight were actually determined by professional appraisers from the committee. That was why no one doubted its value. Their only concern, however, was that they would be unable to fully utilize the item after purchase. After all, these items all cost billions after a yuan conversion. To make matters worse, it was only left with two remaining uses. Even the wealthiest person here would think twice before purchasing it.\u201cThis item is actually quite interesting\u2026\u201d muttered Ding Si while rubbing his chin.\u201cYou mean?\u201d asked Zhang Heng.Amongst all present here tonight, Zhang Heng was the only one who knew how to fully utilize the bone because he was the one who had asked the bartender lady to identify it. He was also the one who entrusted her to auction it off. Although sifting through the entire catalog, he didn't see the item listed anywhere. So, he suspected that this must be of the 12 valuable items which required other players to bid on it with their paddles.\u201cTime-series items are extremely rare, though their starting prices can still be reasonable. However, the phrase \u2018cycling time' does not carry too much information.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to say that there might be no bids?\u201d\u201cNo. No. No. That is impossible. The rarity of this item itself ensures that someone will eventually bid for it. Right now, nobody is raising their number paddles because they are trying to estimate its value!\u201dRight after Ding Si finished talking, someone raised their paddle. Soon, there was a second and then, a third person bid for it. However, the atmosphere this time was was different from the Escape Dagger bid. Only a few people placed their wagers, dragging on until a few moments before the hammer came down for the third time before bidding on it.The situation gradually turned awkward as the bidding went on and on, seeming to be a never-ending process.Ten minutes later, the auctioneer frowned and made a new announcement.\u201cFrom now on, every bid costs 100 game points!\u201dAll the bidders had to think twice now. As time went on, fewer and fewer people placed their bids, though the bidding speed had increased. Notably, there were only three people bidding for it right now.It appeared that the three were determined to get their hands on this item, come what may. When the price had reached a staggering 2,600 game points, one of them decided to quit. Then, when it reached the 2,900 game point mark, another hesitated for a moment before he threw in the towel.In the end, the hammer price for the Moresby Bone was 2,900 game points.\u201cThis sure is an excellent price for a C-grade item,\u201d Ding Si exclaimed.This time, he did not give an estimated price for the Moresby Bone. Even a professional like him could not determine its value without looking at its full report. However, Zhang Heng knew that whoever bought the Moresby Bone made no losses.This item was actually an extremely handy one, being able to create a continuous 60-second time-loop. Within this 60 seconds, no matter what the user did, this 60-second time frame could be rolled back! Technically, its user could stay in a 60-second time-loop forever until somebody deliberately broke it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bartender lady identified it for him and he'd also tested it out for himself. Unlike his other game items, it was actually extremely difficult to trigger the Moresby Bone's effect. In fact, a very particular ritual needed to be performed before one could utilize it. Thankfully, it was not that hard to get the materials for this ritual. Around nine hours was needed for the entire ritual to be completed.If performed successfully, the user would enter the time loop. The realm within this loop was a world of nothingness. Not even death would happen in the realm of the time loop. This was actually the perfect place for one to master their skills. Archery would be a good example. In this realm, the user would not feel hungry, thirsty, or tired. With determination, one could actually train until their archery skills maxed out. However, no one would be able to withstand such a boring routine for too long. Zhang Heng estimated that even a person with a strong mental fortitude would not be able to stay within the time loop's realm for more than half a month.That was a place void of anything. Zhang Heng wondered how the monster called Moresby stayed inside for tens of thousands of years. Just like entering the realm of the time loop, if the user wished to exit the realm, someone would need to prepare the ritual again. This was why the Alkiz were stuck inside the realm after they exterminated Moresby.If the old man in the Chinese attire did not break the balance of time, that monster would have probably been stuck inside the time loop for eternity. Despite this, the item kept its value. The premise of being able to live forever inside the time loop itself was attractive enough for someone to bid for it.Zhang Heng let this item go because he had an extra 24 hours every day. Besides, he was new to the game, and he had just completed three quests. Sure, he could earn game points pretty quickly, but the reward was simply not good enough.After deducting the 5% processing fee, Zhang Heng received a total of 2,755 game points. With this amount, he was now officially a bidder at the auction house. As he flipped through the catalog again, something captured his attention on page four.[Paris Arrow. Grade: D. Description: Once the arrow is launched, it would automatically land on the target's weak point. Current price: 410.]The name of this arrow reminded Zhang Heng about a story he heard when he was still a kid.It went like this:During the Trojan War, Achilles was the strongest hero from Greece. Legend said that he was the son of one of the heroes from the Argonauts, namely Peleus, and the Ocean Queen, Thetis. There were many versions of his story. One of them was that his mother, Thetis, was told by the Queen of Fate that she would be killed on the battlefield. So, she soaked her son, Achilles, in the River Styx to turn him into an indestructible hero. As she was holding his heel as she dipped him, his heel later became his only weakness.When he grew up, he turned into a war hero killing countless enemies during the Trojan War. He was the one who had eliminated Hector, the most powerful warrior from Troy. After that, he was involved in a fight between Apollo, the God of the Sun. According to Gustav Schwab, the author of Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece, Achilles was killed when Apollo shot an arrow at his heel.\u00a0The name and description of this game item matched the arrow that was mentioned in the Greek epic poem, Odyssey.After knowing that players would face unknown danger in the real world, Zhang Heng wanted to arm himself well to make sure that he could protect him and others. The Paris Arrow matched perfectly with his Lv2 Archery Skill. As long as he could aim and launch the arrow at his target, it would automatically aim for the target's weak spots.This was actually a niche game item, where only players with an archery skill would be attracted by it. That would mean only a few players would fight for it. So, half an hour later, the price of the Paris Arrow had increased by only 65 game points. As compared to other game items, the Paris Arrow was evidently not as popular.Amid the auction, Ding Si's cellphone rang nonstop, seeming as if he was getting more business by the minute. Zhang Heng was not surprised, as those participating in the auction were here to look for items that could help them in the game. If what they wanted to buy was in high demand, and they lacked game points, they would frequently look toward the chamber of commerce for help. Some would even sell off game items that they possessed in exchange for more game points.In that one hour, Ding Si's fingers never left his cellphone, closing one deal after another. However, after leaving the auction house for a short while, he seemed to receive fewer messages when he returned.\u201cI just closed a big deal. I'm left with very few game points. That would mean my job for today is done,\u201d Ding Si sighed in euphoria.\u201cCongrats!\u201dThe auction was about to end soon and Zhang Heng checked on the Paris Arrow again only to find out that the price had increased to 445. So, he subsequently bid another 20 game points on it.In the end, he managed to obtain the Paris Arrow for a total of 465 game points.Other than that, a pair of earrings captured Zhang Heng's attention as well. It allowed the user to gain 100% fire resistance. However, its price had started climbing higher and higher, and in the end, he had to give the item up. As he looked at all the unidentified items in the catalog again, he noticed all kinds of items. A Samsung cellphone and Gucci handbag were listed as well. With only pictures to guide him, it was hard to determine their function.It was not necessary, though, for him to try his luck on all these items.However, just as he was about to close the catalog, a picture captured his attention. It was a key. The engraving on its end was extremely familiar to him. Suddenly, Zhang Heng remembered where he had seen the pattern. Earlier, when he activated the Shadow Moment, he stared right into the crow's eyes, and though the picture was a little blurry, he still managed to recognize the crow engraved on it.Amongst all the game items he possessed, Shadow Moment was the only item with an unknown origin. Who knows, he might just find more information about his Shadow Moment through this key. The Shadow Moment was a D-grade item. That would mean this key was probably a D-grade item as well. Right now, no one had placed bids for it. That would mean Zhang Heng would be able to acquire this item with only 100 game points.As luck would have it, he managed to obtain the key at its base price.After the final purchase, he was now left with 2,292 game points. He then closed the catalog having no further intention to purchase any more game items.The auction was coming to an end and the auctioneer announced the last valuable item.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Grade: B. Causes the target to enter a lethal dreamland. Its remaining number of uses is a secret. More details will only be revealed after the auction. The starting bid is 60,000 game points, where additional bids will cost 500 points.\u00a0After three last calls, the hammer will fall, and the sale is concluded. Get ready to place your bids.\u201dThe elderly auctioneer conducted the auction professionally, maintaining a serious expression on his bony face as he made the introduction in a calm and composed manner.Right after he had spoken, a voice called out, \u201cLet's not waste time and just start from 70,000.\u201dThe auditorium broke into an uproar. That was merely the first bid, and the price had already been raised by 10,000 points.\u00a0This opening was borderline farcical.Considering Ding Si had already completed his work for the day, he turned himself into a spectator for this bid.\u201cCurrently, there are three most powerful guilds with more than 2,000 players between them. After years of massive expansion and having made a large fortune, they are the only ones who can afford to make such an exorbitant bid. They are probably the ones performing at tonight's final round of auction.\u201dDing Si paused for a moment and then continued, \u201cNo one would feel safe knowing that this deadly weapon is in someone else's hand. The three guild leaders of Silver Wing is the prime example of this case, so this is going to be a very fierce bid.\u201dThe way the events unfolded did not surprise Ding Si at all.The 70,000 point starting price did not seem to scare away the potential competitors. In less than ten seconds, someone swiftly followed up with a bid, and then another one from the other side. Among the many bidders tonight, no more than three were qualified to raise their paddles. Needless to say, these were the representatives of their respective guilds.On their own, Grade-B game items were already very rare. On top of that, Dreamland of Death's usage outshone those of the same grade. During such times, the three major guilds would not show courtesy to each other. In a matter of ten minutes, the price had shot up to a whopping 87,500 points.At this point, all three guilds began to show a little more caution, and the rate of the bidding gradually slowed. When it reached 89,000, one of the guilds backed out notifying that they were unable to compete. The two bidders who were left, apparently rejuvenated by their competitor's exit, were in full spirits to soldier on.Very quickly, the price of the Dreamland of Death escalated, breaking through the 90,000 point barrier. The party with the lower bid suddenly grew silent.There were many ways to kill that cost far less than 90,000 points, and even if taken from a purely defensive perspective, that price was still too expensive.Just as the winner of this chess game was about to be revealed, someone sitting in a corner at the back of the auditorium suddenly raised their paddle and said, \u201c100,000 points.\u201dA furor broke out in the hall.Many were interested in the Dreamland of Death. Still, everybody knew that it would eventually fall into the hands of one of the major guilds because it required not just desire but also bottomless pockets to be able to win the bid.Despite the odds, right before the high-stakes show came to a close, a fourth person entered the picture out of thin air, raising the bid price by another 10,000 points!At this point, coughing up 100,000 points for a B-grade game item was pure madness.All eyes immediately turned to the showstopper. Due to the stipulated rules, no one was able to see the face of the person. One could only make out that it was a tall woman in black sunglasses. After calling out her bid, she kept quiet and went back to chewing her gum.Hushed waves of whispers began echoing throughout the auditorium. The players were all discussing the girl, wondering who she was, and where she came from. In the end, it was apparent that nobody knew her identity.None of the three major guilds were prepared for this unprecedented turn of events, leaving their representatives stumped.Zhang Heng noticed the strange expression on Ding Si's face and asked, \u201cWhat is it? Do you know her?\u201dDing Si shook his head. \u201cNo, I don't. But forty minutes ago, she came to me and exchanged three C-grade game items for a loan of 4,500 game points. That's basically all the credits I have.\u201dZhang Heng raised his brow. He remembered seeing how Ding Si was in a good mood, saying that he had completed his work in advance.\u201cCould it be possible that she has also loaned from other chambers of commerce before she could gather a total of 100,000 game points?\u201d\u201cTheoretically speaking, it's possible. Quite a few chambers of commerce roam the ship, all ready to do business. They probably carry around quite a few points on them. If she made contact with them, she could have gathered this amount. But in practice, it's unplausible. There's no way a person could have so many game items for collateral in the first place.\u201dDing Si frowned. \u201cThis is going to be a big problem for the three major guilds. They wouldn't have come for this auction with more than 100,000 points on them. Dreamland of Death may be great and all, but it's not worth the price. The only problem is that if this thing falls into the hands of someone with ill-intentions, all the effort they went through to get here would have been for nothing.\u201dAs he was speaking, Ding Si's phone vibrated and he picked it up.When the call ended, he looked up, astonished. \u201cThis is impossible\u2026 all the chambers of commerce have run out of game points. Is she really going to win the bid on her own? This woman is incredible!\u201dOn the other side, the three representatives of the guilds were in panic mode. For them, having the Dreamland of Death in their possession was the most secure and ideal situation. Anything less than that, and they would definitely be unable to accept the outcome. Although they were not on good terms with each other, they would still act per the rules.The worst-case scenario would be for the game item to fall into the hands of some psycho \u2013 the tragic incident involving the guild leader of Silver Wing could very well repeat itself.\u201cThe only way to solve this is for one of them to borrow from the other. Then they could defeat that woman. 100,000 points is a steep price. No one wants to be seen as an imprudent idiot,\u201d Ding Si explained. He appeared to be somewhat distracted, stroking the black briefcase on his knees as his eyes stared blankly.This was the first time Zhang Heng had ever seen him so nervous. The auctioneer had dropped the hammer for the second time and was about to proceed to the countdown.The three guilds were still negotiating and had not come to an agreement, attempting to request for the auction to be suspended, only to be ignored by the old auctioneer.The girl in the shades was chewing her gum more rapidly. Three seconds later, the hammer dropped, and the auctioneer announced the results of the auction's final round.Shortly, the steward standing at the side carried the tule box to the woman. She had just spent 100,000 points on a game item she did not even bother to inspect. She simply took the thing and tossed it into her little handbag.After that, she disappeared from her seat into the darkness.Just as she was about to leave, Ding Si jumped up from his seat and yelled, \u201cHurry! Hurry! Catch her!!!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, even he had shouted a little earlier, it would have still been pointless. In this exclusive auction transcript, players were not restricted and could leave at any time they wanted. Ding Si knew that it was useless to do that, merely reacting instinctively out of desperation.The moment the woman in sunglasses disappeared before his eyes, Ding Si grabbed his hair in frustration.He was not the only one regretting. Someone else on the other side yelled as well, and a young man fainted on his seat. Many disgruntled groans and boos from the crowd quickly ensued.As Zhang Heng was sitting right next to Ding Si, he too saw very clearly when the woman was about to leave. The high-strung Ding Si opened his black briefcase and pulled out the three tule wood boxes.To his dismay, all the game items inside were gone! Instead, in their place were three smiley faces made out of clay, mockingly grinning away as if laughing at his gullibility.After the outburst, Ding Si deflated, drained of all energy, eventually slumping onto his seat. Tonight, Fu Lou wasn't the only one deceived, for nearly all chambers of commerce who carried points with them had been swindled by that woman. One by one, tule boxes were opened, and within them, the mocking smiling piece of clay, a sight that stung the eyes of its bearer.Zhang Heng's stomach sank, and he was flummoxed. Logically, Ding Si's keen eyes and years of experience should prevented him from falling for such a cheap trick. Moreover, since they were all in the transcript, the players should be have been able to access the information of the game items on their personal screens. Nonetheless, that woman managed to fool everyone's eyes with a few pieces of cheap clay.When all was said and done, she had managed to plunder the coveted Dreamland of Death from the three major guilds without having to pay a single point.Surely, all this sounded as coming from a myth of legends, but here, it happened right before his eyes.In the entire hall, the only person unaffected by the event was probably the auctioneer on the stage. After he had sold the last item, his job was done. He gave a simple closing speech, before taking off his gloves and leaving, completely ignoring the commotion brewing among the guests.By the time they realized what had just happened, the representatives of the chambers of commerce had already left. The losses they had suffered this time had to be reported back to their respective handlers.\u00a0At the same time, they would also launch a hunt for the woman back in the real world.Ding Si disappeared without even saying goodbye. The other players, on the other hand, were either having heated discussion amongst themselves or had left with their companions. Zhang Heng collected the Paris Arrow and the unidentified key from the committee. When he saw that there was not much time left, he decided to leave.And so, he returned to the lounge.The light music had been replaced by classy jazz, and the bartender seemed to be a pretty good mood, humming along with the melody as she fussed over her new project \u2013 stirring durian pulp into rum.\u201cThis is a night worth celebrating! You should have a drink \u2013 a small self-appreciation for entering the ranks of the rich.\u201dShe was the one who sent the Moresby bones to the auction. She knew all too well of its value, of course. Zhang Heng looked at the durian flavored rum and was disheartened, politely refusing her offer of the pungent brew and handed her the unidentified key and necklace from Simone instead.\u201cPlease help me identify these items,\u201d he asked of her, then paused.\u201cAlso, hand me another membership card and a Mission Failure Exemption Card.\u201dHe had always wanted to buy the Mission Failure Exemption Card since a while ago but was a little hesitant about the membership card. But after considering the fact that he would be here for a while, and the possibility of anything going wrong at any moment, he decided it was best to purchase it as soon as possible.\u201cI admire guys who know how to splurge,\u201d the bartender commended him as she took out a calculator. \u201cThe total for this item is 1,407 points.\u201dWith the deal sealed, Zhang Heng's game points were reduced from 2,292 to 785. After he had made the payment, he thought of a question and decided to ask while she was still in a good mood. \u201cDid you know that the screen displays wrong information sometimes?\u201dThe bartender raised her brows, clearly taken aback by the question.Quickly, she blurted out something in response. \u201cThat's impossible. The information displayed on the panels is more accurate than your nightly news.\u201dHowever, having said that, she seemed to be hesitant and added, \u201cBut there's a catch. If you have a special game prop, the possibility of that happening can't be compeltely ruled out. That said, I'm afraid only grade game props can pull off such a thing. Why? Did you encounter it or something?\u201dThe incident at the auction tonight was no secret, where Zhang Heng believed that the news of the heist would have swiftly spread like wildfire within the circle of players. Having no need to hide anything, Zhang Heng directly told her, \u201cSomeone used clay to fool all the chambers of commerce present on the ship, then used that money to buy the final auction item, in turn snatching it away from the three major guilds.\u201d\u201cThis method\u2026 sounds very much like that guy's modus operandi. Tsk! He finally showed his face. Guess he couldn't stand the loneliness anymore,\u201d the bartender lady muttered, evidently not intending to provide any further explanation. \u201cFrom now onwards, you have to be very careful when dealing with other players. There have been more and more problems surfacing recently. It looks like another storm is brewing and I'm sure its coming soon.\u201dThis time, Zhang Heng left Desire City much earlier than before. It was only 23:16 when he walked out of the gate. There was still some time left before time stopped, so he decided to take a look at Paris Arrow.Although he had an arrow, he had been keeping his sf-recurve bow in school lately and so, he had to go back to retrieve it.Zhang Heng hired a yellow bicycle and rode to the nearest station. At this hour, especially here in the industrial area, the bus stops were practically empty and deserted.He parked the bicycle by the road, lowering his head and discreetly locking his ride. At that very moment, he heard a loud rustling coming from the green zone by the street. Zhang Heng immediately went into high alert. Quickly, he turned around, clutching the Paris Arrow in his hand as he took two steps backward.Both Ding Si and the professor repetedly warned him that it was never safe being in the circle of players. That shocking scam at the end of the auction was like a vivid lesson to him. As a result, he now became a lot more cautious of his surroundings.\u201cWho is it?!\u201dThe rustling stopped the moment he spoke. Whoever was behind the green zone must have been startled.After 5 seconds, a shadow emerged from the bush \u2013 it was a black stray cat, fleeing into the darkness with its tail tucked between its legs!Was it all a false alarm?Before he could investigate, the bus arrived at the station. Zhang Heng put away his Paris Arrow and glanced at the bush one last time before boarding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Anyhow, Zhang Heng attempted to shoot his Paris Arrow a few times, only to find that this arrow that cost him 465 game points was no different from any conventional arrow. Perhaps, it was something to do with his chosen target. Theoretically, boards, apples, and cups had no weak points, all being inanimate objects. Zhang Heng deduced that the Paris Arrow might only work on living organisms. Right now, however, no suitable target was available for him to test his theory.Three days later, the necklace and key were identified. Zhang Heng received an express delivery from the bartender, immediately opening it up and taking out one of the cards from it.[Name: Hunter's Blessing][Grade: F][Effect: Increases the chance of encountering certain types of prey.]This item was similar to the necklace that Simone gave him and the Lucky Rabbit Foot that he owned. It was hard to determine if increasing the chances of encountering prey was a good or bad thing. To a hunter, this item would allow them to improve their yield. However, if hunting weren't in the books, bringing this around would cause unnecessary trouble.After that, Zhang Heng placed the necklace inside the tule wood box that he bought from the bartender. Then, he looked at the identification report of the key.[Name: Shadow Key][Grade: E][Effect: Can be used to transform your target into Shadow Form. Lasts three minutes. Remaining uses: 3]The price of an E-grade item usually ranged between 80 to 100 points. Earlier, Zhang Heng had spent a total of 100 game points to purchase this item. Albeit a little bit overpriced, this was all very normal. Typically, unidentified items belonged in the F-grade category. E-grade were uncommon. D and C-grades were even rarer. As for B-grade items, it had only happened once so far.What Zhang Heng was interested in the most was the connection between the Shadow Key and Shadow Moment. Each time\u00a0Zhang Heng activated his Shadow Moment, he could sense that the crow was trying to tell him something. He had a hunch that if he managed to check out the background of the crow, he would gain a better understanding of this supernatural item.Right now, though, he had a more pressing matter to deal with.The issue in question was his final exam. The exam week would officially begin right after the New Year. From the 3rd to the 7th, he was to attend the public course exam. When that ended, it was then a professional course exam next. It was definitely an intense period where every night, there would be a power cut at Zhang Heng's hostel. Anticipating the time it would happen, he had to finish studying everything before it happened. Otherwise, he would just wring it out in the corridor and study there for the rest of the night.Even before the new year, the corridors were packed with zealous students. When Zhang Heng went out at 12 a.m, he could always see a group of students cramming hard on their books. Amongst these were Wei Jiangyang and Chen Huadong, where they stole a little time in between their busy schedule to read some manga. In this challenging time, they seemed to have found happiness amid suffering.Zhang Heng met Shen Xixi twice while he was studying in the study room, but after crossing paths with each other that night, they did not talk much after that. All they did was nod to each other when they met again. On the other hand, Xu Jing,\u00a0the Loli, had always considered Zhang Heng her best friend. Ever since he used a bow and arrow to scare away bad guys from harassing her, she started to call Zhang Heng her Ironman. And she was not afraid to tell everyone about it.There was this once when Zhang Heng met her at the canteen. He was around five meters away from her when all of a sudden, she started to shout \u2018Ironman' at him ever so passionately. Immediately, half of the students in the canteen turned around to stare at her.After some days, Zhang Heng finally finished his last paper for this term. Alas, his second year in the university was coming to an end. Chen Huadong went as far as taking out his entire pile of photocopied study material and tore them into pieces before throwing them away in the water house. While returning to them, Chen Huadong realized that he left his cup there. Naturally, he turned back to go and get it.On the other hand, Jiang Weiyang was just as happy. He spent the entire night attempting to memorize notes that were written down with Chen Huadong. Coffee was the pillar they relied on to stay awake throughout the exam. When the exam was over, though, all the sleepiness miraculously disappeared. They both suggested that everyone should go to Food Street to grab some good food and have fun. Since everyone was cool with the idea, Jiang Weiyang proceeded to call his girlfriend to join along.It seemed like Han Xiaxiao's dorm wanted to celebrate the end of the exams too. So, Wei Jiangyang had to inform them about the rendezvous point.However, the atmosphere quickly really awkward when all of them gathered at the same spot. Ma Wei was not the kind of guy that had a smooth mouth with the ladies, nor did he spend much time with them. Basically, he was here simply to eat his food and drink his beer, not intending on sharing a single word to the others. As for Chen Huadong and Xu Jing, they were usually the stimulus of the group. With the chattery duo present, they should be able to get everyone to mingle. Unfortunately, tonight had to be the night where they were both quiet.During Christmas Eve, Zhang Heng sensed something wrong between Chen Huadong and Xu Jing when he agreed to go to the amusement park with him. After the camping trip, both were always seen together as if connected by glue. Then, all of a sudden, they stopped talking. Right now, they behaved like strangers who had never met.When it came to the love matters of others, it was inappropriate for an outsider to comment about it. Amongst them, Shen Xixi had the highest EQ. She was typically the go to girl when it came to matters like this. However, it seemed that she was terribly distracted, popping out her cellphone from time to time and checking for messages.And that marked the end of the first term of the second year in university.The most awkward incident of the night happened right after the meal. When everyone walked out of the restaurant, they saw a black Mercedes parked at the entrance. This time Zhang Heng took a good look at the driver.Unlike the rumor about her hanging out with a bald old man, the driver was a young stallion. Judging by his demeanor, he should still be studying as well. Having a somewhat fit physique, it seemed that he spent a reasonable amount of time working out every day. Seeing the whole bunch walking out of the restaurant, the young man stepped down from the car and graciously opened the car door for Shen Xixi.\u201cThere's something I need to do. I'll take my leave first,\u201d said Shen Xixi.She entered the car after the. Han Xiaoxiao wanted to say something, but she stopped midway, only sighing as the car silently rolled away.\u201cI have asked her in private before. She told me that she has no intention of getting a boyfriend. She told me that she wanted to do something meaningful. I have never seen her defending herself against all those horrible rumors. Initially, I wanted to believe her. Right now, I'm not sure if I should.\u201d\u201cI will always support her no matter what,\u201d Xu Jing interrupted.\u201cThat is because you are just like her,\u201d said Chen Huadong with a smile.Seeing that the two of them had their horns locked, they quickly stopped them from doing so.\u201cBoth of you\u2026 the winter holidays are coming soon. We won't be seeing each other for a month. Can we just end this gathering peacefully? Right? Zhang Heng\u2026\u201d said Wei Jiangyang.He wanted Zhang Heng to support his notion, but he looked distracted by the fact that Shen Xixi left them. Wei Jiang's heart dropped immediately. The matter between Chen Huadong and Xu Jing was still unresolved, and he saw that something unpleasant was playing in Zhang Heng's mind. Rumor had it that Shen Xixi and Zhang Heng used to flirt with each other.But then again, that was just a rumor. He wanted to know what Zhang Heng really thought about it.When Zhang Heng realized that Wei Jiangyang was staring at him, he quickly turned around and gave everyone a quick nod.\u201cSee you guys next year.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From today until the 4th of March, the entire university would go on break. Most of the students left their hostels the very next day the exams were over. Wei Jiangyang was the first to leave from Zhang Heng's dorm.He had planned for a vacation to Qingdao with Han Xiaoxiao, his girlfriend, before heading back to his hometown. After that, Chen Huadong was the second to leave. He brought almost nothing with him except for two hard drives that had tonnes of anime in them.As for Ma Wei, he wanted to earn some money first before heading back to his hometown and planned to work till the eve of Chinese New Year. As of today, he had taken up a job as a home tutor for four families. He rested for one night before quickly reading up some high-school physics and chemistry.Zhang Heng, Chen Huadong, and Wei Jiangyang had always respected Ma Wei a lot. From the first day he enrolled in this university, he had never hidden his family's conditions from them. Though they weren't doing well, he never used it as an excuse to exploit anyone. All the while, he worked part-time while studying at to help out his family. If placed in the same situation, Zhang Heng knew that he would never be able to do better. He then gave Ma Wei an encouraging pat on the shoulder.Zhang Heng bought a train ticket and was supposed to head back to his hometown next week. There was, however, something essential for him to do before he left the place.At 23:37, Zhang Heng opened up the doors that led to the bar's lounge on the second floor. After greeting the bartender, he looked for an empty seat and set the alarm that was under it to 23:55.As he closed his eyes, a new journey began.[Verifying player's identity\u2026][Verification complete. Randomly drawing the fourth quest for player 07958][Draw completed. Your new quest is Black Sail]\u201cPirates from New Providence have threatened all trades that are carried out in this area. Every civilized country in this world considers pirates as a public enemy!\u201d[Quest goal: You are on a ship. Set anchor at Nassau and build your own force.][Quest mode: Solo][Time flow rate: 3600](1 hour in the real world is equivalent to 150 days in the game. The player will be sent back to the real world after 300 in-game days.)[Friendly reminder: The game will begin in five seconds. Please get ready.]\u2026.Just as Zhang Heng was cracking his brain to figure out where in the world this New Providence was, he heard a deafening boom right beside him!The wall of his cabin had been penetrated by a flying cannonball, crushing the table inside it as well! This was the very first time Zhang Heng experienced such an intense opening. During his last quest in Finland, he was provided with a short grace period of safety right after entering the quest. It allowed him to familiarize himself with his surroundings.As for this round of the game, he was greeted in kind by a cannonball.The worst part was, this was just the beginning of his quest. After that, he could hear multiple cannons being fired and people running around frantically along the corridor outside the cabin. Immediately, he took a good look at his surroundings. Earlier, he guessed that this quest wouldn't be set in the modern world the moment he heard the word pirate.The cabin's furnishing and the clothes he wore looked ancient. From all that, Zhang Heng could deduce that he was on a vessel in old Europe. However, he was oblivious as to what the exact date was. The rise of pirates could be traced back to the Lucan from 14th century B.C. The Ancient Egyptians recorded a fight between them in Cyprus. After that, Viking Pirates who ruled the sea from the 8th to the 11th century became extremely famous as well. Although numbering only a few, their ruthlessness at sea made the pirates an infamous menace. They were definitely not afraid of death.Back in the modern world, a gaming company even designed a class called the \u2018berserker,' inspired by the Viking Pirates. In the 17th century, Fujian and Guangdong of China were invaded by pirates as well.The golden age of piracy took place during the last stages of the Renaissance. More sea routes had been added, and colonies were constantly expanding. This had made it possible for trading at sea to get better. Merchants and traders regularly encountered pirates when they sailed the high seas. Some powerful pirates would even go up against the navy and attack colonies. After that, the navies gradually became stronger, and piracy slowly died down. In the modern world, some small-time pirates still loitered around the waters of Somalia.After reminding himself of the grim history involving pirates, Zhang Heng did not continue staying in the cabin. Judging by the direction of where the cannonball was from, he deduced he was still in the heat of a battle. Right now, the first thing he had to do was to leave this place. Who knew, a second cannonball might come crashing down on him, and he wouldn't be so lucky this time.Zhang Heng quickly opened the door, only to bump into a sailor that was holding a box of ammunition. The navy sailor was still relatively young, looking to be in his teens. Fear and anxiety were written all over his face. Immediately, he got up and ran to the deck with the box in hand, not saying a single word to Zhang Heng as he sprinted along.Then, there was a whistle from afar!Another cannonball had been launched, landing right on the sailor's chest! Zhang Heng quickly ran over to check on him. Unfortunately, his lungs had collapsed; there was no way he would survive his severe injuries. Before he took in his last breath, he held on to Zhang Heng's hand, eyes filled with a strong reluctance to leave this world.After going through the war in Finland, Zhang Heng knew precisely how to deal with a situation like this. All he could do right now was repeatedly tell the man that he was going to be fine. Half a minute later, the young navy sailor passed away, his eyes still wide open. Zhang Heng used his hand and closed them gently, then quickly ran to the deck with a box of ammunition. He needed to know what was going on right now. Right at that moment, a man from the upper deck looked down and saw Zhang Heng.The man was around 40 to 50 years old. His skin appeared tanned, and he seemed to have spent many years out at sea.\u201cI have told you guys repeatedly not to leave your cabins! This ship doesn't have enough firepower! It's impossible for us to assign personnel to protect each and every one of you,\u201d yelled the middle-aged man who appeared furious.Zhang Heng was relieved when he heard the man speaking English. He was worried that he might be on a Spanish or Portuguese vessel, and in times like these, things could get messy if he couldn't communicate with them.Turning around, he showed the middle-aged man the box of ammunition he had. The dead boy's body was not too far away from him.\u201cYour man was hit by a cannonball! I'm here to help.\u201dThe old sailor was surprised by Zhang Heng's actions. However, this was not the right time for a chat. Ammunition was running out fast!\u201cQuick! Hand me the box!\u201dImmediately, Zhang Heng climbed to the upper deck. It was then that he saw how bad the situation was. The entire place had been severely damaged by enemy fire, and bodies were strewn all around as well.He looked to his left and saw the mast of the enemy ship. Right at its top flew the flag of the Black Sail.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stood on the bridge, observing the enemies with a pair of bronze binoculars. Knowing that his ship was on the losing side, he could not help but feel nervous.\u201cFather, I think we should surrender. Our ship simply can't go as fast as them. We don't even have a third of their cannons, and we have only 15 guns on board! There's no way we can win this fight. We should surrender while we\u2026\u201d muttered the young man that stood beside the captain.The captain then glared at his son and shouted at the sailor behind him.\u201cWhere is the ammunition? I need it right now!!\u201d\u201cWe are awaiting your orders, captain,\u201d replied one of the old sailors.\u201cCannoneers! Light your fuses!\u201dThe moment he gave the order, the enemy opened fire, and a cannonball landed directly on a cannon that was currently bring reloaded. The heavy barrel fell off its base and crushed the two cannoneers behind it. Everyone could hear their agonizing screams. Then, the whole ship fell silent. It seemed that they did not survive. At the same time, the barque flying the Black Sail flag was coming full speed ahead!\u201cEveryone! Hang in there! All we need to do right now is to damage them! We need to wreak fear into the hearts of those bastards! Let's hope that they would give up attacking us and look for somebody weaker instead!!! I will reward every single man here with six pounds each when we arrive in Boston later!\u201dThe sailors' low morale was once again ignited with renewed flames of passion. When the enemies entered their shooting range, all 15 guns were fired at them at the same time. Zhang Heng could clearly see that the sailors lacked shooting practice. Most of their lead landed on the enemy vessel's gunwale. With an attack like that, it would surely be impossible to put fear into their enemies, let alone damage them. Instead, they were hammered with a vengeance following a more powerful retaliation.Soon, another nine sailors were killed, and the rest of the shipmates lost their will to fight. No amount of reward money could compel them to further risk their lives in fighting off their enemies. Just as expected, every single sailor on the ship started to drop their weapons. Thus, the captain knew that the battle was lost. There was nothing he could do now except to stare at his nemesis in despair. As he turned around to check on his people, he realized that his son was lying on the deck as well.The boy was clutching his chest, frantically trying to plug a deep gash, of which blood gushed out like a swollen river. The captain then took off his tricorne, knelt on the ground, and held his dying son to his chest. At the same time, Zhang Heng quickly ran to the captain's room. The moment he spotted the barque flying the Black Sail flag, he knew they were going to lose the battle. There was nothing he could do even if he decided to join the battle right now.The ship that he was on right now was just an ordinary merchant vessel from England. In order to make sure that they could haul as much cargo as possible, the vessel was scantily equipped with eight nine-pounder light cannons. A lack of ammunition plagued them as well. As for the enemies, they had at least 30 cannons on their ship. If their goal wasn't capturing the ship and its cargo on board, they would have destroyed them a long time ago.Instead of making the pointless move of defending the ship, Zhang Heng ran to the captain's quarters the moment chaos hit the boat. Usually, this was the most heavily guarded part on a ship. Right now, there wasn't a single soul in the room. There were some valuable decorations around, but Zhang Heng did not bother taking them. He wasn't sure if he would get to keep anything when the pirates boarded them. He then saw a wooden table on his right and quickly opened all the drawers.Then, he found what he was looking for.It was the ship's logbook, a compulsory record for every vessel to have. It was used to record dates, the direction of the wind, weather, and major incidents. The only thing that mattered to him right now, though, was to find out the era he was in and some basic information of this ship.Opening up the logbook, he started to read through its records. Three minutes later, he heard a loud boom, followed by the ship violently shaking. It was so intense that it almost caused him to fall to the ground. When it had finally calmed down, he opened the curtains and took a peek outside. The first thing he saw was a giant cannon.Immediately, he shut the curtains! He knew that he did not have much time here. With both ships getting closer to each other, that would mean a close standoff between two was about to happen soon.Judging by the merchant ship's lethargic firepower, the battle would surely end faster than expected.Luckily, Zhang Heng had scanned through most of the important information recorded in the logbook. It was the year 1712. If he remembered correctly, the 1701 war of succession in Spain had caused the entire country to fall apart. Through a series of treaties, England managed to claim several colonies that had originally belonged to the Spanish. And with that, England became the new king of the sea as time went on. At the same time, piracy saw its most active period as well.This merchant ship carrying an entire shipload of woolen goods was supposed to travel to Boston. After unloading the goods for sale, they were scheduled to ferry a shipment of tobacco back home. As bad luck would have it, they crossed paths with a band of pirates just as they were about to arrive in Boston. Knowing that they had a slim chance of escaping, the captain decided to fight and protect his ship. After all, he was an ex-navy officer.Zhang Heng could hear the sailors screaming in agony from the captain's cabin. It seemed like the captain's plan had failed miserably. Zhang Heng soon managed to locate the location of New Providence from the map on the table. It was located in the central north of the Bahamas. Nassau, one of its small towns, was located in the north of New Providence. Zhang Heng wanted to study the map in better detail, but there was no time left. The pirates could enter the captain's room anytime now. Quickly, he returned the logbook back into the drawer and left.Initially, he wanted to return to where he came from. However, he changed his mind halfway and went to the galley instead. He then took out his Lucky Rabbit Foot, Hunter's Blessing, and Paris Arrow and hid them under a plank. As he was leaving, he bumped into two men. One of them was running away from the other.The one running for his life crashed into Zhang Heng, and both of them fell on the ground! The person giving chase was clearly not a crew of the ship. He wielded a bloody ax and glared at the plump guy that was crying and crawling on the ground. He was ready to execute him. The moment he saw Zhang Heng, he became even more excited.Having no room for hesitation, Zhang Heng rushed toward him and disarmed the pirate with a hard sidekick. Immediately, the pirate extended his arm, and a fist landed on Zhang Heng. In that split second, he instinctively extended his arms to protect himself. The blow was so powerful that it temporarily paralyzed his arm. As for the pirate, he suffered no injuries. Seeing that he was unscathed, he grinned and drew his dagger from his waist.Zhang Heng instantly realized that he was in big trouble. Close-quarters combat was never his forte. Judging from the pirate's attack, Zhang Heng knew that it was impossible for him to defeat him from such a close distance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he attempted to dodge the attack, the dagger inadvertently slashed his left arm. Though it was just a flesh wound, Zhang Heng knew that he had to do something quickly before it before the pirate killed him. Another three steps back, and he would come up to a wall. As for the plump guy, he sat where he was, absolutely overcome by fear. It seemed as if he had lost his mind.In a life and death situation such as this, a gushing river of thoughts raced through Zhang Heng's mind. However, he soon regained his calm. After all, he had just gone through a vicious war in Finland. Right now, he had the Shadow Moment in his pocket, but it only had one usage left. Zhang Heng did not use it at the beginning of his quest. There was still a long journey ahead of him.Suddenly, Zhang Heng remembered the time when he went bear hunting with Simone in Sweden. He then spotted a chopping board with a small knife that was used to peel potatoes. Unfortunately, the pirate noticed Zhang Heng eyeballing the weapon.The very second Zhang Heng was about to move over to grab the knife, the pirate quickly charged at him with his dagger, causing him to move in the opposite direction where he managed to dodge the attack. Immediately, the pirate reacted and changed his course as well.He aimed his dagger directly at Zhang Heng's chest, but to his surprise, Zhang Heng managed to evade him once again. Instead of hitting its target, the dagger landed on a piece of smoked meat that hung behind him!This time, the pirate ran out of patience. An extreme frustration boiled within him as Zhang heng avoided his attack over and over again. He had enough of it. With rage clouding his mind, he pushed aside the smoked meat in an attempt to go for Zhang Heng again.However, he was greeted with a harpoon this time.Zhang Heng had long awaited this golden opportunity. Though the both of them had only gotten on the ship recently, Zhang Heng had taken time to explore the galley and look for a good spot to hide his items. Hence, he knew the place better than the pirate. When he was forced to retreat to the galley, the thought of using the harpoon to attack the pirate already lingered in his mind. He simply needed to figure out how to lure the pirate to where the spear was.Simone once told him that a smarter way to hunt bigger prey was to make them believe that they were the hunters in this hunting game. When the time was right, Zhang Heng would not hesitate to use his weapon to kill his prey.In that split second, the harpoon penetrated the pirate's neck. The strike was so blindingly fast that the pirate had no time to respond to it. He was killed on the spot instantly. The \u2018bear' had finally been skewered by the hunter's snare.With a grunt, Zhang Heng retrieved the harpoon. The pirate took a few steps backward as he staggered and fell. Then he stopped breathing.Zhang Heng slumped to the ground after he killed the pirate. At the same time, the plump guy who was paralyzed with fear snapped out of his stunned state by the loud noise from the galley. It was then that he found out that the situation turned out very differently than what he'd expected.\u201cYou\u2026 won?\u201d\u201cYou do realize that you are still sitting there asking me useless questions, right? The answer is yes. I killed him.\u201dThe plump guy realized that he had just behaved like a coward. When Zhang Heng desperately needed his assistance, he was no better than a petrified dummy.\u201cI'm really sorry. I was terrified just now. Earlier, I wanted to open the door to see what the racket was outside, but I didn't expect some pirate to come charging at me. I thought today would be the day I die. Oh right, my name is Marvin. I'm the son of a farm owner in a colony. I'm planning to go back to help my dad in the fields. I think I met you on the ship earlier. You are the Asian traveler, right? Your name is Zhang\u2026 Zhang\u2026\u201d\u201cMarvin, I don't think this is a good time for a chat. Pirates have now overrun this ship. We will be in deep shit if they find their dead brother here!\u201dInevitably, this had turned out far from the desired scenario. Being all alone, Zhang Heng was hardly powerful enough to turn the situation around. Initially, he only wanted to hide his stuff and prepare to surrender. He did not expect that he would encounter a pirate the moment he stepped out the door. To make matters worse, he was left with no other option but to eliminate a pirate.Leaving the pirate to kill the plump man in cold blood would only encourage the pirate to go after him in a worse way. However, killing the pirate had just stuck a giant bullseye on Zhang Heng's back. Now, he was in grave danger.\u201cHuh? What\u2026. what should I do now? I did not kill him\u2026 I\u2026 I did nothing to him! I just sat there and kept still.\u201dZhang Heng was clearly unhappy with what he just heard. He had not expected that the first thing Marvin would do was to exclude himself from the incident. Though Zhang Heng's primary intention was not to rescue him, it was still a fact that Marvin got to live to see tomorrow thanks to him.Before Zhang Heng could say anything, however, he heard the sound of footsteps from afar. Half a minute later, two men appeared in the galley. One of them clutched a gun while the other held a British cutlass. Judging from their ragged looks, they were definitely not the ship's crew.\u201cI found another two alive! Be good ya'll! Your captain is dead! Everything on this ship belongs to us now! Ain't no point playing the hero in front of us!\u201d barked one of the pirates while brandishing his weapon.Immediately, Marvin nodded his head like a madman. The extras on his body jiggled nonstop as he bobbed around nervously. Sweat dripped off his face like a leaky tap.\u201cWhat the hell is going on?!\u201d asked the pirate with the cutlass.At that, he quickly made a round of the galley and found nothing suspicious. Suddenly, he spotted a giant barrel behind them. The pirate shoved Marvin away and opened the barrel.All they found was a pile of smoked fish.\u201cAre you done yet? We are going to miss the celebration if you stay here any longer! Speaking of which, where is Victor? I saw him come this way earlier,\u201d asked the other pirate.\u201cHonestly, I don't wish to see him at all. He's a raving lunatic! Whenever we board a ship, he'll turn the whole place into his killing field for sure! If it was not for his bravery, he would have been kicked off the ship a bloody long time ago. Let's go! Time to go gather on the deck!\u201d replied the pirate while sliding his cutlass back into its sheath.As Zhang Heng and Marvin were escorted to the deck, they saw the other survivors. Amongst the group were the last seven sailors. All of them were shell shocked, dreading the unknown that fate would bestow upon them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That included their pockets and shoes. They wanted to make sure that they would not miss out on a single valuable item.After that, Zhang Heng and Marvin were being pushed into the crowd. Marvin fell into a state of panic when he saw the dead sailors beside him. Out of fear, his body shook uncontrollably once again. At that, the pirates started laughing at him hysterically.Zhang Heng's wallet and snuff bottle were confiscated by the pirates. However, his Shadow Key and Shadow Moment were still with him. These two items were his trump cards to protect him from life-threatening circumstances. In order to make sure that the pirates wouldn't get to them, he had to trigger the Shadow Key's effect to turn both items into shadow form.His current situation right now was different from the other quests he had completed. At the moment, he was somewhere out at sea. That meant there were only so many places he could run to even if he triggered the Shadow Moment's effects. An option was to move his shadow on the sea, but he would surely drown once its effects expire. There was a slim chance that he would be saved by passing boats. However, getting devoured by sharks or drying out in dehydration seemed like a stronger possibility.The passengers on the ship were merely ordinary folk looking forward to a new life in the colonies that they headed to. Instead of a fresh start, they had now become prisoners of the pirates.Most of them did not behave as pathetically as Marvin, though, Zhang Heng could sense that woe and despair were slowly festering amongst the crowd like a deadly virus. Then, around a minute later, loud sounds of people brawling and gunshots were heard coming from the lower deck. When the commotion died down, a man slowly strolled towards the crowd.\u201cI must apologize. Some idiots failed to do what they should have done. I needed some time to convince them. Well, the problem is solved now. Let me introduce myself. I'm the helmsman of the Sea Lion. You can call me Mr. Orff.\u201dMr. Orff appeared to be about 40 to 50 years old. Apart from a slight bald, he looked to be in remarkably good health. Unlike all the merciless pirates, he seemed to be a more reasonable man.For that matter, the helmsman was a position that required excellent communication skills. It was the second most important position on a pirate vessel. He had to continuously maintain a good relationship with the entire crew, where, for the most part, he would act as the representative of the pirates' interests, serving as an essential link to bridge the gap between crew and captain.Through the helmsman, the crew felt like they had been given a voice to question the captain if they thought they had been mistreated.Due to that, many saw a glimmer of hope when they saw the helmsman.\u201cPlease! Sir\u2026 please let us live! We are just rankless civilians. My wife and kids are still waiting for me to get home,\u201d begged one of the passengers.At that, Orff nodded his head in empathy and drew the gun from his waist. Aiming at a sailor who had given up his arms, he pulled the trigger!The lead ball penetrated the sailor's head, and he instantly collapsed. Blood splattered all over the helmsman's linen shirt. After witnessing this raw display of brutality, the prisoners were left panicked and distraught. Suddenly, they remembered that pirates would never show empathy to those they captured.These were a group of bloodthirsty monsters that would not hesitate to kill anyone they saw as unfit to live. That would mean they were capable of killing off every soul aboard this merchant vessel just because they were pissed off by someone.The gunshot was definitely not a good omen. Marvin was so terrified that he started to pee himself.\u201cI'm really sorry. I had to do it. This guy killed two of my brothers when we boarded your ship just now. I will never let a person like him off the hook. I might be old, but I don't forget. My creed in life is blood for blood. This is how we work,\u201d said an emotionless Orff while putting away his gun.Every single pirate roared into a loud cheer after he finished talking. At the same time, the captured prisoners were a little less worried. No doubt the killing was carried out so brutally, it was in one way or another acceptable if he did it out of vengeance.The passengers had forgotten, though, that the sailors were the ones who had protected them from the pirates in the first place. The remaining six sailors surrendered to the pirates earlier than most of the people. Now, to stay alive in this scenario, everyone chose to stay completely silent. Many thoughts ran through their minds. They were ashamed of their cowardice but also glad that they did not participate in the fight earlier.\u201cNow that the debt is paid, it's time to talk about what matters the most to all of you. As it stands, this ship now officially belongs to us. This includes every single item on the vessel, your wallets, and all your valuables. Now, folks, we are a reasonable bunch\u2026We will prepare a small boat for you, and you'll head back to land. Other than that, you can have two buckets of drinking water, some biscuits, and some smoked meat to keep you alive on your journey. Consider yourself lucky as we are within a trade route right now. I heard the weather should be fine for the next two days. If the gods find favor in you, some vessel might just pass along and come to your rescue.\u201dOrff's little speech did little to extend the calm. Instead, new chaos arose. One small boat, two buckets of drinking water, some biscuits, and smoked meat were definitely not enough for 30 passengers! A brief storm would definitely blow everyone to meet their maker. The chances of them dying out at sea were exponentially higher than being rescued by some random passing ship.Some passengers even started to beg the pirates for mercy. Unfortunately, Orff had made up his mind and was not about to change his decision.\u201cI know this is a huge risk for you to take, but you have to remember that we are pirates, not philanthropists! If you want to live, figure that out yourself!\u201dOnce Orff was done talking, the pirate beside him launched the small boat on the water. However, the lifeboat was literally a raft of sorts, only able to fit a maximum of 20 souls with zero extra space for food and water.Suddenly, a muscular pirate walked towards them and made an announcement.\u201cAre there any cooks or carpenters here? We need two carpenters and one cook. Join our ranks if you are interested in the positions.\u201dInstead of getting on the small boat, people figured they would have a better chance of surviving if they joined the pirates.\u201cMe! I'm the ship's carpenter. I'm willing to join you,\u201d said one of the captured sailors.\u201cIt's my first time out at sea before, but I have made furniture for the people in town. Do you think I can join you guys?\u201d asked another passenger.\u201cSure. For now, you will have to become his assistant first.\u201dSeeing the incident before them, the passengers fell into a cloud of jealousy. Many were professionals, and even the most ruthless of pirates would have respected them if they were given a chance too.\u201cOne more spot left! Don't miss out on the opportunity. Anyone else willing to come with us?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201dTo everyone's surprise, Marvin was the one who spoke up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
