    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 - Grave of Yi YunNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn this day of age, Yi Yun deeply understood the fact that life isn\u2019t easy, but never once did it occur to him that he would die in his prime..This morning, Yi Yun had gone mountain climbing with two good friends. Among them was a pretty babe, so this was naturally a splendid event.Young people tend to like thrills; Yi Yun was no exception. Being a goody two-shoes and climbing mountain paths already cleared by others was meaningless: they chose an isolated barren mountain.Reaching the halfway mark on the mountain, they discovered a cave.The babe that came with them spontaneously got excited, and insisted on entering. However, the moment they entered something unexpected happened.Yi Yun found a rectangular purple crystal in the cave; it looked like a crystal card from a science-fiction movie. As soon as he discovered, and, out of curiosity, touched the purple crystal, the walls started to rumble and the cave collapsed!It was hard to describe what emotions were going through Yi Yun as he saw several tons of rock smashing downwards. If one had to use a phrase to describe it, it\u2019d be, \u201cOnly when dying does one truly know what dying is.\u201dHe was still young, healthy and good-looking. And he was still a virgin\u2026His was supposed to have a tremendously bright life ahead of him, but it was all about to disappear.The sadness and hopelessness from knowing this was stifling.The boulders did not smash into Yi Yun, but had instead sealed off the exit.The situation of being buried alive in such a tight space in the mountains, without food, water, and with limited air made it crystal clear to Yi Yun that this place would probably be his grave.Yi Yun stared blankly at the thick mountain wall. Under his phone\u2019s flashlight illumination, that thick rock wall resembled the faces of devils. It was cold to the touch and the coldness seeped into Yi Yun\u2019s heart bit by bit, weighing it down.He didn\u2019t have the slightest clue where his climbing partners disappeared to. They were all grouped closely upon entering the cave. Yet once the cave collapsed, the two of them who should have been trapped with him, had mysteriously\u2026disappeared.It was as if they had never entered together with Yi Yun. Yi Yun still remembered clearly that half a minute before the cave collapsed, he had heard behind him the babe that was with them say how she was afraid that there would be snakes in the cave.How could two breathing people just disappear suddenly?How did a perfectly good cave just collapse?It really was a hopeless situation here in the cave. There was no signal on his phone, and the fate of his two friends was uncertain. Yi Yun didn\u2019t want to sit idly by while waiting for death. He even thought about digging a way out\u2013if the blockage was small, there would be a glimmer of hope by digging.When a person confronts Death, he can exhibit extremely strong motivation and fighting spirit; everything, even something with the tiniest sliver of hope, would be tested.Yi Yun acted immediately, but digging with his bare hands wouldn\u2019t do. He had not brought any tools, like a dagger, with him. But, at this moment, Yi Yun had a stroke of brilliance, he remembered the crystal card.It looked like a small shovel, so, although it was small, and didn\u2019t have a handle, digging with it was much better than digging with his bare hands.Turning his head to the mysterious crystal card, Yi Yun suddenly had a thought; upon careful recollection, the cave had collapsed the moment he touched that card.How could it be this coincidental?And the biggest mystery was that both his friends had vanished into thin air.A series of inexplicable phenomena combined together filled Yi Yun\u2019s head with questions, that is, could everything that happened today be due to this crystal card?He looked at the purple crystal card, it was slightly bulging. On an extremely stable piece of rock, it sat there nicely, while emitting a faint glow.Yi Yun hesitated for a moment before switching off his phone\u2019s flashlight. He realized that despite the pitch black darkness of the cave, he could still see by the purple card\u2019s faint glow.In this moment he understood that this crystal card wasn\u2019t made of amethyst because crystals do not glow. However, in the natural world, there are some minerals that were able glow due to traces of radioactive elements.But in his current situation Yi Yun couldn\u2019t care less about the possibility of radioactivity harming his body and picked up the purple crystal card to examine it. If the collapse was due to this crystal card, could it possibly be his ticket to survival?Yi Yun knew that there wasn\u2019t much hope, but at Death\u2019s door, he had to try everything as a last resort.The crystal card was cool to the touch, with a coldness that seemed to meander through the blood vessels in his arm, all the way to his heart. The card itself was purple throughout and slightly larger than an adult\u2019s hand, but no thicker than one\u2019s palm. On one side of the card, there appeared to be mysterious engravings. They seemed unnatural, as if carved by human hand..Who could have carved it? Could these engravings be some ancient symbol, or a mysterious language?Or could it be extraterrestrial, something from the stars?With such strange happenings, Yi Yun\u2019s brain started filling with questions. He was sure the cave collapse had something to do with the crystal card. There was no earthquake, how could the cave just suddenly collapse?With the crystal card in hand, Yi Yun realized that the crystal card\u2019s edges were as sharp as a blade, this ignited hope within him; he could conserve energy by digging with this.Yi Yun stopped hesitating, and with the crystal card in hand, walked towards the rock wall of unknown thickness.Gripping the edge of the crystal card with both his hands, he shoved it down with strength, and something inconceivable happened. The originally firm and stout rock was sliced apart like tofu by this palm-sized crystal card. Yi Yun, who had used too much strength on the rock that showed no resistance, hit his head onto the wall.Yi Yun was dumbfounded, he couldn\u2019t care less that he had scraped his forehead while he stared blankly at the purple crystal card in his hand. After the initial shock passed he experienced jubilation.This was pretty much a light saber from a science fiction movie.At this moment, he didn\u2019t have the mood to examine how this card could be that sharp, but focused on digging his way out.Grabbing the crystal card firmly with both hands, Yi Yun started digging a hole like a mole. The crystal card moved without resistance, and could even easily cut through granite.Yi Yun felt excited, he had picked up a treasure!If he could make it out alive, this card could change his life, and it could even have alien technology embedded within it!Yi Yun didn\u2019t know how long he had been digging, and wasn\u2019t sure if it was an illusion, but whenever he felt exhausted, the crystal card in his hands would emit a coolness, rejuvenating a tiny bit of strength within him, allowing him to continue digging without rest.It was not possible to know the time in the cave, but Yi Yun was motivated by his thirst for survival to keep moving forward without rest.His cell phone was already out of battery, and he had totally lost his sense of time, three days? Five days? Seven days?Yi Yun didn\u2019t realize that even without a single morsel of food or water, he had miraculously not died; it was as if the crystal card\u2019s energy had prolonged his life.If he were to look back at the path he had dug, Yi Yun would have discovered how long it was, but Yi Yun did not pay attention to that as his sight was already blurred.Unable to see clearly ahead, unable to see the rock, he could only feel the crystal card emitting a refreshing coolness in his hands.He was slowly losing his senses, but kept digging with perseverance and tenacity. Finally, at a certain moment, he realized a glimmer in front of his eyes, as if he had seen a light passing through a crack in the soil, illuminating his face.Just like when a pail of water was splashed on an unconscious person, Yi Yun was suddenly wide awake!Light!There\u2019s light!Yi Yun had never ever appreciated that light could be so beautiful; he couldn\u2019t control his tears as all the energy he previously lost flooded back into his body. He gritted his teeth and dug crazily.Finally!Yi Yun was blinded by the bright rays that shone down on him, as he struggled to keep his eyes open.He had managed to climb out!\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded!\u201d\u201cI survived!\u201dYi Yun wanted to shout out loud for without experiencing the darkness, or knowing how to appreciate the light or knowing what Death is about, it was hard to understand the sanguinity of life.Yi Yun laid on the ground, taking huge gasps of air, as he looked at the blue skies and white clouds, he had never felt that the blue sky was any prettier.Although his body was extremely tired, hungry and thirsty, Yi Yun didn\u2019t rest for long as he gritted his teeth and got up, trying to contact his two friends.Yi Yun may have escaped Death, but he didn\u2019t know what had happened to his friends.But\u2026his cell phone was out of battery.Yi Yun glanced around, hoping to see signs of life, but with just a glance, Yi Yun was dumbfounded.How\u2026How could this be?Yi Yun clearly remembered that while climbing a mountain, he was buried alive in a cave, and climbed out of the mountainside alone.But, Yi Yun was located in a vast expanse, and although there were mountains around, the distance to them would have ran a horse to its death; Yi Yun could not believe he had dug such a long tunnel.Surrounding him were several mounds, and a wooden stick stuck out on each mound. On the wooden sticks were gruff words of an unknown origin written using charcoal\u2026Could this be a\u2026graveyard?Yi Yun was dumbfounded, how did he appear among so many tombstones?! Having escaped Death once, Yi Yun\u2019s mental strength was now much stronger, so although he was faced with an illogical situation, he could still calm down and examine the tombstones carefully.These tombstones totally didn\u2019t look like they came from a modern cemetery. In a modern city\u2019s cemetery, all of the tombstones were either made of marble or granite and ordered neatly.But the tombstone in front of him\u2026even a rural tombstone would be much better than this.Wait\u2026Yi Yun suddenly discovered something, as he lowered his head to take a look, the \u201ctunnel\u201d he had just climbed out was still there, and was situated in front of a mound. And by the side of the mound, a wooden plank was used as a tombstone.On the wooden plank were weird words, but for some unknown reason, Yi Yun had a spark in his mind, and could read all the words.It wrote\u2013\u201dBeloved brother, Grave of Yi Yun\u201d.And on the side wrote five words\u2013\u201dElder Sister Jiang Xiaorou\u201d.Yi\u2026Yi Yun\u2019s\u2026grave!?Yi Yun was totally stupefied, he had clearly been buried alive in a cave on a barren mountain, but now he had dug his way out of a tomb, and it was even his!What sort of worldly joke is this!Also the words were not Chinese, nor were they English, how did he know all these weird words?This must be a dream, right\u2026Yes, it must be a dream. This dream sure feels real\u2026as if\u2026Yi Yun looked at his surroundings, and felt diffident, it\u2019s too real!He pinched himself hard, and the result was\u2026pain.Another pinch, it still hurt!\u201cIt\u2019s not a dream?\u201d \u201cThis shit really isn\u2019t a dream?\u201dYi Yun felt lost, could someone tell him what was happening?Yi Yun was cursing in his heart.Could he have already died when he was buried alive in the cave, and when he dug himself out, all the digging was just an illusion before his death?But\u2026the two words \u201cbeloved brother\u201d, what did it mean? He didn\u2019t have an elder sister. If a person had to be pointed out, it was someone who lived in another city whom he had infrequent interactions, nor did he meet his cousin much, why would she erect a tombstone for him!If the tombstone\u2019s \u201cYi Yun\u201d was someone else with the same first and last name as himself, it was still impossible. How could such a coincidence happen, climbing out of a grave of someone with the same first and last name \u201cYi Yun\u201d?Yi Yun felt extremely confused. At this moment, he looked on in a daze as a girl dressed in rags while carrying a basket walked towards him along a tiny village path\u2026\\nNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - Elder SisterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2: Elder SisterYi Yun had trouble describing his first impression of the girl. It was a strange sense of familiarity.She looked to be approximately fifteen years old, wearing a patched up green blouse with colored trousers that were too dark to tell the color of. The trousers legs were rolled up high, betraying her white legs. Her ankles were dotted with fresh mud splashes.With a slender body and a slim waistline, she had a radiant face with rosy red cheeks.As she walked down the village path, she was like fresh mountain dew rejuvenating Yi Yun.Who is this girl?Yi Yun exchanged glances with the young girl. She stood there, dazed for a moment before she loosened her grip on the rope holding the basket up on her shoulder.Yi Yun suddenly got a weird feeling. The girl in front of him was clearly approximately fifteen years old like a flower bud, and yet, why did she\u2026 look taller than him? She was probably taller than him by more than half a head. If they were closer, he would have to tilt his head up to look at the young girl!It must be an illusion caused by fatigue\u2026Yi Yun still did not understand, but at this moment he heard the girl\u2019s clear voice like a mountain lake.\u201cYun\u2019er!\u201dThe girl threw her basket down as she ran towards Yi Yun with her mouth agape.Her beautiful eyes already brimming with tears.\u201cWait\u2026 Wait\u2026\u201dYi Yun was in a daze, he looked around and found out that he was the only person within a mile radius, so the girl was running towards him!The Yun\u2019er she was calling\u2026 could it be himself?Yi Yun had the single character Yun as his name, but no one had ever called him Yun\u2019er. No one in modern day society would do so, so it was no surprise his reaction was slow.In actuality, he was unable to react at all as the girl rushed towards him like the wind and embraced him!The girl\u2019s fresh scent filled his nostrils as her soft body overwhelmed Yi Yun. He had no reaction as he was dumbfounded. He had been buried alive while mountain climbing and when he finally managed to dig himself out, it was from within a grave. And after he did so, with great effort, he was embraced by a little loli without him knowing who she was!Yi Yun did not anticipate that, as a young adult, he would be hugged so tightly by a loli. What\u2019s the meaning of this?\u201cYun\u2019er, you worried your sister sick. As long as you are alright, as long as you are alright\u2026\u201dThe little loli was tightly hugging Yun Yi, her sharp chin lodged into Yi Yun\u2019s shoulders while she sobbed uncontrollably. Her grip was strong, as if she was using all of her strength to merge Yi Yun\u2019s body into her own. She was afraid that this was all a dream, that the moment she released him, Yi Yun would disappear again.Yi Yun stood there, petrified like a gargoyle, with a myriad of expressions on his face as the little loli hugged him.Sister?At this moment, Yi Yun, who had been barraged with numerous baffling events, finally understood something. This little loli is the elder sister from \u201chis\u201d tombstone!The words \u201cBeloved brother, Grave of Yi Yun\u201d was clearly written by this little loli!Considering that this little loli was treating him as her younger brother, maybe she missed her brother so much that she mistook him for her brother\u2026Yi Yun tried to rationalize it, but the more he thought about it, the more something seemed off. This little loli should be attending middle school? Her younger brother is at most twelve or thirteen years old, how could she mistake an adult like himself for her younger brother?Wait a moment\u2026An adult like himself?Yi Yun suddenly realized something. He compared his height with the girl, seeing how his mouth only reached to her shoulders, he had an ominous feeling.He stretched out his arms from beneath the little loli\u2019s arms and looked at his own hands. What he saw were the soft and tender hands of a child\u2026Are these my hands?Have I become young again?I\u2026Yi Yun was utterly confused.Becoming young, suddenly having a sister, a baffling identity. This together with the ancient looking tombs, the unfamiliar plains, the foreign words and language that he could read, listen and understand\u2026Everything only pointed to one conclusion, but Yi Yun refused to believe what his gut was now telling him.The girl\u2019s body kept shivering. It could be excitement, it could be fear\u2026 Yi Yun could not recall anything about this girl, but he could appreciate the girl\u2019s feelings and warmth. It was a magical feeling.The girl wiped her tears as she held Yi Yun\u2019s hand. She went to pick up the basket, intending to head home.But this jolt made Yi Yun stagger as he felt nauseous.Yi Yun felt his stomach and all he could feel was\u2026 hunger. He was suddenly overcome with hunger.Ever since he was buried alive, he had not even had a single morsel of food or water. If it was not for that weird purple crystal card, he would have died much sooner.Naturally, it was normal for him to feel so hungry.The girl noticed Yi Yun\u2019s frailty and bent down with her back facing Yi Yun. A soft and warm back with streaks of perspiration appeared in front of Yi Yun\u2019s eyes.\u201cYun\u2019er, Sis will carry you. Let\u2019s go home, never to be separated again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYi Yun didn\u2019t know how to describe his feelings, a little loli was going to carry him!\u201cYun\u2019er, get on! Your body may have recovered but it is still weak\u2026\u201dAs she said that, she glanced towards the tunnel Yi Yun crawled out of and felt pain, her younger brother had never died.Thankfully, they were too poor to afford a coffin, or he would have been buried alive! If that was to happen, she would feel worse than having to bear a thousand lashes on her body.Luckily, her brother had woken up, and luckily he was not buried too deeply.This time, she would never separate from her younger brother again.The girl noticed that Yi Yun stubbornly did not get on her back and decided that he was probably feeling embarrassed. She shifted the basket forward and firmly held Yi Yun\u2019s thighs close to her waist.Yi Yun was befuddled, he had no idea how he ended up on the girl\u2019s back. All he felt was his body being lightly lifted up onto the girl\u2019s soft shoulders and that all his weight was now supported by a pair of slim legs.The girl\u2019s pair of tiny hands held Yi Yun\u2019s legs and with a heave, adjusted his position as she headed down the small path.Yi Yun could smell the young girl\u2019s body fragrance as he laid on her back; it was different from the aromas that came from perfumes or body lotions city people used, it was a fresh smell, made up of wildflowers and soil. It was refreshing.He started to confirm more of what was now happening\u2026He did not want the girl to piggyback him, but he didn\u2019t know how to voice it out.Using his own language to talk to someone who wasn\u2019t his sister, it would be too awkward.At this moment, Yi Yun heard a rumble from afar. He couldn\u2019t resist looking back towards the sound. The girl also looked back.All they saw was a dust storm forming in the distance.The girl flinched and hurriedly ran to hide behind a big tree while carrying Yi Yun.The dust storm approached at a dazzling speed. Yi Yun looked carefully and suddenly saw a huge beast running on the field!He gasped when he carefully looked at the beast.Heavens! Is that a wild beast?It was seven to eight meters tall and over ten meters long. It had long sharp fangs and limbs as thick as steel beams. Its razor sharp claws were like blades that formed horrific deep trenches.Compared to this monster, the beasts on Earth, like the lion or tiger, were more like kittens.What startled Yi Yun even more, was that a middle aged man was riding on the weird beast. With a commanding aura, he sat cross legged on top of it with a sword slung across his back. Because of the angle, Yi Yun could not see his face, but his blood had frozen over as the person sitting on top of the wild beast, was over ten times more terrifying than the wild beast.With this Yi Yun knew without a doubt that the place he had crawled into, was no longer Earth.He had arrived in a mysterious world. His name was Yi Yun and he had been resurrected from the dead. He had a cute and beautiful elder sister who adored him. Her name was probably Jiang Xiaorou.The \u201cElder sister Jiang Xiaorou\u201d written on that tombstone wasn\u2019t a signature inscription, it was common practice to list the loved ones of the deceased.It seemed like Yi Yun only had his elder sister, Jiang Xiaorou, in his entire family.All of this wasn\u2019t a dream. It was actually happening\u2026He had tunneled through space-time.Heaven, are you fucking kidding me!?Yi Yun wanted to cry. What sort of bad luck was this? Climbing a mountain resulted in him tunneling through space time!Although it was better than death, but\u2026 to reach a totally unfamiliar world. There were beasts the size of hills, with crazily strong people. From the sword that the strong man had, this was probably an era where cold metal reigned.With his small and weak stature of not more than twelve years of age, he would not even be sufficient to fill the gaps in a wild beast\u2019s teeth!Yi Yun was adamant that this was related to him touching the mysterious purple crystal card. It could even be that from the moment the cave collapsed, he was no longer on Earth. He might even have been transformed into the Yi Yun of this different world. And due to the darkness of the cave, he was unable to realize this\u2026So if he had come to this world due to the crystal card, was it possible to return with the crystal card?This was Yi Yun\u2019s first thought. As a person living a peaceful life in the modern world, it was hard for him to accept this medieval era. It was not a world that he understood. The only thing he gained after losing everything he once had, was a multitude of questions.Recalling the crystal card, Yi Yun paused, where is the crystal card?As the question flashed in his mind, Yi Yun felt a coolness at his chest. Touching it with his hands, he felt the crystal card securely resting on his chest. This puzzled Yi Yun, he did not recall placing the crystal card there, and yet it was there.What in the world is this thing\u2026?Yi Yun did not understand, but undoubtedly, it was not simple!If he examined its capabilities, it would undoubtedly play a huge role, be it him staying in this world or returning to Earth.He had to grab every opportunity to examine and understand that card.Out of nowhere, a name flashed in Yi Yun\u2019s mind, Purple Crystal Origins.Purple Crystal\u2026 Purple Crystal Origins\u2026Why did those words appear in my head? Why did such a name flash in my mind? Yi Yun was puzzled, the name Purple Crystal Origins appeared in his mind the moment he wanted to name the purple crystal card.Purple Crystal Origins\u2026 let\u2019s just call it Purple Crystal, but could its\u2026 original name be Purple Crystal Origins?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - If I were to become an expertPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 3: If I were to become an expertBefore following Jiang Xiaorou, Yi Yun never expected that \u201chome\u201d would look like this. When Yi Yun originally saw the sword bearer riding that huge beast, he guessed that this world was one filled with flying martial arts experts, with elites from all sorts of large clans.Having tunneled through mysteriously, if he could be involved in a huge clan or sect, he could even learn martial arts one day. Even if he lacked talent, he would still be able to survive without worry.But, seeing the ramshackled house in front of him, Yi Yun nearly collapsed.In the past, Yi Yun had gone to rural villages, the houses he saw there were many times better than the house in front of him now.This spartan house was made of mud and rocks. Besides a table, two stools, two old beds and a stove, there was nothing else.Jiang Xiaorou piggybacked Yi Yun into the house. Yi Yun was not accustomed to being piggybacked by a young girl. He had struggled to get down a few times, but his body was just too weak. Just a couple of steps tired him out and then Jiang Xiaorou had to piggyback him again.Yi Yun felt embarrassed that a man like him had to be given a piggyback by such a young girl.\u201cYun\u2019er, you must be hungry\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said as she placed Yi Yun on one of the wooden beds. Although she was sweating profusely, her face was energetic. She was naturally happy that her younger brother had come back from the dead.Yi Yun looked at Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s sweaty clothes. Although his body was thin and light, the journey had been at least three or four miles. Jiang Xiaorou, who was about fifteen years old, had to piggyback him sporadically and she did not have it easy.If it had been a fifteen-year-old girl from Earth, simply walking empty-handed for three to five miles would have tired her out completely, not to mention giving someone a piggyback ride.\u201cYea\u2026 A\u2026 A bit.\u201d Yi Yun moved his parched lips. These were the first words that came out of his mouth ever since he had been transported to this world. He originally thought that using a language that wasn\u2019t his would be difficult, if not impossible. But surprisingly, it was just as easy as using his native language.\u201cI\u2019ll prepare the meal,\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said with a smile. She delicately wiped the mud from Yi Yun\u2019s face before pulling over a pillow for Yi Yun to rest against and covered him with a thin blanket. She covered Yi Yun in a deft and gentle manner, leaving Yi Yun in a trance.This girl was clearly not his sister, but due to her giving him a piggyback as well as the meticulous care she gave him, he slowly began to develop tender feelings for her.Yi Yun wanted to help Jiang Xiaorou light the fire for the stove, but she insisted that he stayed in bed.\u201cYou\u2019ve just recovered from a serious illness, take care to not catch a cold. Lie down here, Sis will be back soon.\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said as she lifted a nearly empty bag of grain.Fifteen minutes later, Jiang Xiaorou placed the broken wooden table in front of the bed. On the table was a big bowl of rice porridge, two unknown wild fruits and a bowl of boiled wild vegetables.Yi Yun had been starving for days so his stomach started rumbling the moment he saw the food.Yi Yun was craving for pork or some roasted chicken, or duck and fish. Just the thought of it churned Yi Yun\u2019s stomach.How can I satiate my extreme hunger with this?He wolfed down a large mouthful of porridge. His empty stomach reacted by making him even hungrier.He ate a few mouths of porridge and some of the boiled oil-less vegetables. The vegetables were so bitter that he even had trouble swallowing more of the food despite his extreme hunger.As Yi Yun had trouble swallowing such an unpalatable meal, he noticed that Xiaorou was looking at him without eating; he curiously asked, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating?\u201d\u201cI ate just before I found you,\u201d Jiang Xiaorou stammered as she turned white.Yi Yun paused; he recalled that Jiang Xiaorou was at the graveyard at around three in the afternoon, how could she have eaten by then?It suddenly dawned on him that even food like this was probably not easily obtainable.What sort of world is this, with strong experts riding wild beasts, yet there were poor people that starved?Yi Yun pushed the bowl of porridge forward and stood up to go check the grain bag in the corner of the house. As expected, the grain bag was already empty.Yi Yun realized that the porridge Xiaorou usually prepared was even smaller in quantity. Because of his resurrection, Xiaorou had purposely cooked more porridge for a weakened him to \u201cnurse him up\u201d.\u201cI\u2019m full. You have some,\u201d Yi Yun said as he pushed the bowl to Jiang Xiaorou. On one hand, he had lost his appetite, while on the other hand; he couldn\u2019t accept that a girl had to abstain from eating just to feed him.He lamented in his heart if it was still possible to return to his world from this alternate world. If he really couldn\u2019t, he wanted to find an opportunity to train and become a soaring expert.But from the looks of it, survival was an issue. He might even starve to death before he researched anything.\u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d Jiang Xiaorou stubbornly said. \u201cTomorrow is the day that they hand out rations, we can get a piece of meat then. I\u2019ll prepare it for you.\u201dJiang Xiaorou\u2019s face blushed the moment she mentioned the handing out of rations. It was clear that she highly anticipated it.Yi Yun stayed silent. On Earth, he felt that life was tough. But compared to this alternate world, that sort of life was incomparable. With insufficient food and the constant danger of starvation, life was really tough. It was really torturous to endure hunger.In the middle of the night, a night breeze slowly blew as frogs hidden within the pond grass croaked. Yi Yun was still awake. He leaned on the bed, immersed in moonlight. He tossed and turned while holding the mysterious Purple Crystal. It was all because of the Purple Crystal that resulted in him climbing out of the collapsed mountain body. This small crystal card was unquestionably a treasure. If he studied it, it could potentially be beneficial in some way.This alternate world was filled with dangers for normal people. But in recollection, the middle-aged man riding the huge beast in the wilderness had a commanding aura. Compared to the suffering people folk, the differences were like Heaven and Earth.\u201cIf I were to become an expert, I could be free. At the very least, I wouldn\u2019t starve\u2026\u201dYi Yun touched his stomach as he recalled how he eventually managed to give some of his dinner to Jiang Xiaorou. As he was still a growing child, the porridge had long since been digested, he was already hungry again.As he felt the emptiness of his stomach, the smooth and cold Purple Crystal in his hand started to spread a faint coolness, as if\u2026Oh?Yi Yun suddenly noticed something. He bolted up from bed as he stared at the Purple Crystal. An ecstatic smile crept upon his face.Upon careful examination, Yi Yun noticed that tiny, faint purple dots of light surrounded the Purple Crystal.These light dots appeared out of nowhere and slowly floated into the Purple Crystal before they disappeared, as if the Purple Crystal absorbed them. This process carried on indefinitely as the Purple Crystal\u2019s glow became a bit more intense.What is the meaning of this?This discovery caused Yi Yun\u2019s breathing to speed up.As the Purple Crystal\u2019s glow became brighter, Yi Yun felt the Purple Crystal turn colder. This unique coolness traversed up both his arms, into all his limbs, as if the miraculous light cleansed his body. It absolutely refreshed him.Yi Yun remembered this feeling. While he was digging his way out of the cave, he felt this coolness whenever he was out of breath. It rejuvenated him with strength whenever his body was failing him.Yi Yun knew that, for a person to live and to move, it was due to energy that was provided to the body, allowing it to renew itself.Without eating, there would be no nutrition. Naturally there would not be energy either, and will in the end result in starvation.Completing such a long tunnel without eating or drinking for days, with intense labor conditions requires an energy source. This coolness must be the Purple Crystal providing him with life-giving energy.Thinking carefully, when he originally discovered the Purple Crystal in the cave, the Purple Crystal was emitting a faint glow like a night pearl.However after tunnelling into this strange world, the Purple Crystal\u2019s glow had weakened. This could have been a result of energy depletion.But now, the Purple Crystal\u2019s glow was beginning to recharge and grow stronger. What could be the energy source that was recharging the Purple Crystal?Yi Yun carefully observed and realized that these vague tiny dots formed a surface leading out the window. It seemed like it\u2026 came from starlight.Starlight was the energy source recharging the Purple Crystal?Yi Yun thought for a while and jumped out of bed. He went to the stove and dug out some burning coal. He lit a handful of grass and watched as the yellow flames danced.Yi Yun carefully placed the Purple Crystal in the burning fire.Yi Yun\u2019s theory was simple, if the Purple Crystal could absorb the energy from starlight, it could perhaps absorb the energy from its surroundings?Fire, which is a form of energy in Yi Yun\u2019s understanding was likely stronger than starlight. If the Purple Crystal absorbed the energy in the flames, it could be faster?Yi Yun did not once consider the possibility that the flames could destroy the Purple Crystal.But, no matter how much Yi Yun burned the Purple Crystal, the Purple Crystal showed no change, nor could he feel the Purple Crystal gain any heat.The Purple Crystal was like a block of ice which couldn\u2019t melt. It was cold to the touch even after the coal fire died down.Yi Yun shook his head as he abandoned the experiment.He decided to venture outside the house. The starlight outside would be denser and could provide the Purple Crystal with more energy.If the Purple Crystal was filled to the brim with energy, what sort of changes could it bring?Yi Yun eagerly anticipated the thought!Yi Yun opened the house door and the courtyard door before carefully closing them behind him. He was afraid to wake the sister up in the adjacent room. But when Yi Yun walked into the courtyard, he was slightly startled.He saw a girl in green, sitting under a tree not far from him. She was carefully polishing an arrowhead.The cold arrowhead reflected the chilly moonlight onto the girl\u2019s delicate face, as if veiling her in a layer of silver yarn. By the girl\u2019s side flew dozens of fireflies, as if they were surrounding a goddess.Jiang Xiaorou?Yi Yun saw a shiny stack of arrows by Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s side. Each arrow was well manufactured with a sharp arrowhead.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dAlthough Yi Yun didn\u2019t know anything about weapons, he could appreciate the elegance of these arrows.\u201cYun\u2019er, why did you get up? It\u2019s very moist at night and your body just recovered. Go back to bed quickly,\u201d Jiang Xiaorou immediately stood up with the intention of sending Yi Yun back into the house.\u201cSis, why are there so many arrows?\u201d a curious Yi Yun asked. Jiang Xiaorou didn\u2019t seem like she could string a bow.\u201cThis is for the exchange of tomorrow\u2019s rations. It has always been this way\u2026\u201dJiang Xiaorou looked at Yi Yun weirdly.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun was obviously unaware of this. Mysteriously, he had tunneled into this world, he understood the words and language, but he did not have a single clue about the life of \u201cYi Yun\u201d. All of his memories were his own.It resembled people who suffered amnesia after a head injury. Although an amnesiac would lose his memory about events, he would not lose his language skills.Yi Yun had long thought of a perfect excuse, explaining, \u201cSis, I died once, so there are some things I can\u2019t remember\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t remember?\u201d a startled Jiang Xiaorou asked. Yi Yun had fallen down from a mountain wall while picking herbs and broke his bones. He had then laid bedridden for a while before he succumbed to his injuries. He might have hurt his head back then.Thinking of that, Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s heart ached and worried. \u201cYun\u2019er, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Yi Yun quickly stopped Jiang Xiaorou. He wanted to stop her worries. \u201cSis, tell me about this world, and about the middle-aged man who rode that huge beast. What\u2019s happening, there are so many things I do not remember\u2026\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Who said I didn\u2019t have any males in my housePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4: Who said I didn\u2019t have any males in my houseJiang Xiaorou did not suspect anything and explained the various aspects of the world to him.Yi Yun originally imagined that this was a world where martial arts was respected, but after listening to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s description, Yi Yun realized that he had underestimated the importance of martial arts in this world.More precisely, this was a world where martial arts was life. In this world, humans had their own cities and campgrounds while the wilderness belonged to the wild beasts and desolate beasts. Humans risked the threat of being attacked by wild beasts or desolate beasts when out farming or hunting. Because of these monstrous huge beasts, it had limited the range of human activities. So among the commoners, there was a supply deficit.For a campground or a city, high-level warriors were a lifeline! Without the protection of the high level warriors, desolate beasts could destroy the residents of campgrounds and cities in a night.Unfortunately for Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou, their tribe was a small tribe without a single high-level warrior. The entire tribe was in a precarious state, one that could be destroyed anytime. Because of the lack of strength, these small tribes had a lot of troubles cultivating or collecting food. They were unable to survive on their own, but relied on the manufacturing of weapons such as arrows and armor for the big tribes cities in exchange for some rations and beasts to survive.The raw materials for the arrows Jiang Xiaorou made came from a bigger tribe. She was only in charge of manufacturing them.\u201cYun\u2019er, go back in. Tomorrow I can exchange quite a bit of rations with these arrows. I can even exchange a piece of desolate beast meat. Do you still remember desolate beasts?\u201d Those were the strongest beasts, and only very large tribes were able to hunt them. Eating a piece gave a lot of strength!\u201cIf one ate for prolonged periods, one could become a warrior very quickly!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said it dreamingly, for if her brother could become a warrior, it would be absolutely splendid.It was a pity that they only had a chance to eat a desolate beast every few months. The hopes of becoming a warrior were destined to be an extravagant wish.However, in large tribes, the young had desolate beasts for their meals, and it was actually not considered valuable among the big tribes. Although desolate beasts were hard to hunt, a desolate beast was over ten meters high and weighed a few tons. It was sufficient to feed ten people for years.To the proud elites in the big tribes, the meat of the desolate beasts was for the commoners. What they ate was the desolate beasts\u2019 bones, or desolate bones.All the essence in the desolate beasts was in their desolate bones. A huge set of desolate beast skeleton could be refined through a special method to obtain a bean-sized desolate bone essence.This desolate bone essence was used to help warriors break their limits by opening up their meridians, stimulating blood pulses and various beneficial effects. It was something all martial artists yearned for.Of course, a desolate bone essence was simply a legend to the poor families in a lowly tribe like Jiang Xiaorou and Yi Yun\u2019s.Forgetting a desolate bone essence, even refining a piece of desolate bone would require many steps and secret methods. It was impossible for a normal person to refine it successfully.\u201cDesolate beast, desolate bone essence\u2026\u201d Yi Yun mumbled to himself. The terms he heard from Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s mouth surprised him, as she was so knowledgeable.After a silent night, Yi Yun woke up early the next morning due to hunger.Without eating for a few days, and only eating a tiny bit of porridge, Yi Yun\u2019s level of hunger was understandably high.\u201cSis Xiaorou!\u201dNow, Yi Yun was accustomed to calling Jiang Xiaorou sister. He had learned from the chat yesterday with Jiang Xiaorou that he used to call Jiang Xiaorou \u201cSis Xiaorou\u201d.\u201cOh\u2026Sis Xiaorou, why are you\u2026\u201dYi Yun suddenly realized that Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s clothes were soaked with a lot of dew, and her originally bright eyes were now speckled with red blood vessels. She looked extremely tired.Looking at the two bundles of arrows that Jiang Xiaorou was hugging, it was clear to Yi Yun that Jiang Xiaorou had not slept once throughout the night to finish the arrows!They were so poor that they could not afford to light a lamp. Jiang Xiaorou had used the faint glow from the fireflies and the moonlight to arduously finish the arrows overnight.Jiang Xiaorou smiled saying, \u201cYun\u2019er, previously when you fell and hurt yourself, I kept taking care of you. In the past two days, I was busy with your burial and rites, so I didn\u2019t have time to make the arrows. Today is the day we exchange them for rations, so if I had not rushed to finish them, the two of us would starve. I\u2019m even going to get you desolate beast meat to nurse you up!\u201dAs she said that, Jiang Xiaorou looked lovingly at Yi Yun\u2019s forehead.Yi Yun was dumbfounded as he saw Jiang Xiaorou use linoleum to wrap the two bundles of arrows carefully. Her expression was that of glee and satisfaction.Yi Yun exhaled deeply and tightened his fists. He was determined to give the sister who cared for him a much better life.\u201cLet\u2019s go, it\u2019s time to collect our rations!\u201dJiang Xiaorou held on to Yi Yun while carrying the two bundles of heavy arrows. She came full of anticipation to the Sun Valley field where the ration exchange was taking place.There were already many people gathered there.The thing that caught people\u2019s attention was the man in a robe on stage.He looked approximately twenty-five and sat majestically on a beast hide covered chair. A well-made sword hung by his waist.The man in the robe was lazily glancing at the suffering crowd as they busied themselves below the stage.These people were moving the bundles of arrows and the sets of exquisite leather armor. A person who looked like a treasurer recorded down every item that was moved.Standing beside the robed man was an elderly man dressed in yellow. He was all smiles, with a fawning look on his face.\u201cAre the weapons and armor satisfactory, Lord Tao?\u201d The elderly man bowed before him as his face wrinkled up. The robed man took a glance at the elderly man before snorting as a response.Although the robed man was full of disdain, the elderly man didn\u2019t betray any of his thoughts and carried on smiling.Lord Tao was an ambassador from a large tribe, and was in charge of collecting the weapons. It was because Lord Tao was not considered special in his tribe was he sent here on the errand, but to the yellow-robed elder, he was someone of utmost importance.Jiang Xiaorou handed over the two bundles of arrows she made in exchange for two small wooden tablets. With the two wooden tablets in hand, Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s face reddened as she gripped it tightly in her clammy palms for this was for her and her brother\u2019s ration.After fifteen minutes, all the weapons and armor were stored in the large cart that was pulled away by two big horned horses.Lord Tao lazily scanned the books as he threw a large wooden chest at the yellow-robed elder before leaving with his subordinates.The yellow-robed elder politely sent Lord Tao away with smiles before finally wiping them off his face to exude a face of dignity.All the tribal folks were burning with anticipating saying, \u201cPatriarch, please distribute the rations.\u201d\u201cRight! We haven\u2019t seen it in months!\u201d A couple of people had started shouting for they were all waiting to collect the rations to fill their stomachs back home.\u201cSilence!\u201d as the yellow-robed elder quelled the masses with a gesture. Yi Yun never expected that this spineless old freak was the Patriarch.\u201cSince everyone is so impatient, let\u2019s distribute the rations!\u201d The moment he finished saying, a few strong men walked up hurriedly and brought out bags of rations from a warehouse and stacked them into a small mound.\u201cThat\u2019s not right, Patriarch. Why is there so little this time?\u201d\u201cYeah! There used to be a lot more!\u201d \u201cAlso why don\u2019t we see any beasts?\u201dMany people started rabbling for they had handed more weapons than previous years, yet the amount received was pathetically lesser. Not only were the rations halved, but, even the beasts had disappeared.\u201cThe Fire Cloud tribe has gone too far, how can they dismiss us with this tiny amount?\u201d\u201d\u201cPatriarch, what\u2019s the meaning of this!\u201dSeeing that the mob was getting more disorderly, the yellow-robed elder snorted and said, \u201cShut your mouths!\u201d You will understand in a while. Distribute the rations now! Hand over your wooden tablets, and whatever you receive is all you will get!The yellow-robed elder said it with force resulting in many of the dissatisfied to zip up their mouths immediately. This yellow-robed elder was a warrior. Although he was a low-classed Mortal Blood warrior, he was definitely the tribe\u2019s pillar, so few dared defy him.\u201cThose from the warrior preparation camp are the first to receive the rations!\u201d The moment the yellow-robed elder waved his hand, a group of men wearing animal leather walked forward. Their age ranged from fifteen to forty years old. Without exception, all of them were stout and muscular from their training. These people were members of the warrior preparation camp, and were the hope of the tribe. As young adults with good physical attributes, they were chosen from young for training. Besides hunting occasionally, they did not farm or manufacture arrows or armor.Besides, anything beneficial like food was first distributed to the warrior preparation camp. Because, if any of them were to become a high-class warrior, they would bring lots of riches to the tribe. Besides being able to protect, high-level warriors\u2019 output capabilities were extremely high as they were strong enough to go out into the wilderness to hunt. Just a few large wild beasts would be enough to feed the entire tribe for days. Without exaggeration, a single high-level warrior could sustain a small tribe!There were dozens of people in the warrior preparation camp, and because they never participated in the manufacturing, they naturally didn\u2019t have any wooden tablets; but each of them still took away a big bag of rations.The small amount of rations was further reduced by a fifth, but there were tens of times more people who haven\u2019t received the rations compared to the warrior preparation camp.From this, it was fated that many would starve.Jiang Xiaorou, who was by Yi Yun\u2019s side, grasped the wooden tablet tightly. Her face was pale for their days were numbered if they didn\u2019t manage to obtain any rations.The people were solemn as the warrior preparation camp members took their usual share, which definitely meant there wasn\u2019t enough to distribute.\u201cHousehold with Tier one males, come collect your rations!\u201d The yellow-robed elder gave another order. In this world where martial arts was life, those males not from the warrior preparation camp received distributions proportional to their abilities.A simple test was that of strength; being able to lift 300 lbs was a Tier one male!The lesser they lifted, the lower their tier.Those households with Tier one males heaved a sigh of relief and rushed forward to collect their rations. The wooden tablets were just for show. These households received much lesser rations than normal, but at least they received something.These households were originally wealthier, and would have surplus food. So even though their days ahead required them to be frugal, it wasn\u2019t a desperate situation.\u201cHousehold with Tier two males, come collect your rations!\u201d The yellow-robed elder opened his mouth again. Compared to the person who was bowing to \u201cLord Tao\u201d, this yellow-robed elder was a totally different person with his cold demeanor.A Tier two male could lift about 250 lbs. of stone. The rations they received were reduced greatly.The ration bags depleted rapidly. With every disappearing bag, Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s face turned paler. Her clammy hands griped the wooden tablet tightly.The problem wasn\u2019t about having fewer bags of rations; this was a matter of life and death. Without the rations, they would starve to death!She was originally full of hope for this round\u2019s ration distribution. Besides getting the rations, she was hoping to receive a piece of beast meat to nurse Yi Yun. However, there weren\u2019t even any normal rations left.\u201cHousehold with Tier three males, come collect your rations!\u201dWith the depleting rations, Jiang Xiaorou held her breath.The yellow-robed elder frowned, as the amount of rations was too little. Many still had not received it. In the months to come, many would be fated to starve to death.But for the tribe\u2019s benefit, to catch that golden opportunity, the yellow-robed elder could only harden his heart and sacrifice the weak.It was common for people to die of hunger or sickness in the tribe. The adverse living conditions resulted in the average life expectancy to be frightening short.\u201cThe rest, come collect your rations.\u201dWith those words, a large group of people rushed forward. Jiang Xiaorou screamed as the mob pushed her down.She was bruised from her fall, but she held on to her wooden tablet closely, as if it was her freedom giving her hope.\u201cSis Xiaorou.\u201d Seeing Jiang Xiaorou fall, Yi Yun rushed through the mob and pulled her up.\u201cAre you alright, Sis Xiaorou?\u201d Yi Yun was anxious as being trampled by this mob would result in death. Jiang Xiaorou held on helplessly to Yi Yun\u2019s hand.\u201cStop squeezing. All of you be orderly!\u201d The yellow-robed elder shouted. His voice seemed to be imbued with a special energy, causing the mob that was squeezing forward to quiet down.\u201cLine up, one by one!\u201d The yellow-robed elder was authoritative. No one dared to defy him for they all knew he had the power. He was in charge of the tribe, and he would execute whoever disobeyed on the spot.The people lined up for the rations, even if it was a pathetic amount. But in a while, the rations were gone, leaving many without any.Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s heart sank. Without the rations, they could not survive.\u201cWang Long, bring out a few stored rations out,\u201d said the yellow-robed elder to a stout man. Wang Long was one of the yellow-robed elder\u2019s family members.\u201cYes, Patriarch.\u201d Wang Long left and returned in a short while with a small cart of rations. These were the stored rations containing only grain.On Earth, eating grain was a source of vitamins resulting in healthiness. However in this alternate world, it was a totally different matter. Grain was the remnants after processing. It was mixed with wheat bran as food. The taste was horrible and hard to swallow.Also grain was low in nutrients, and difficult to digest. In fact, it provided very little energy, about half of the rations. Although it was grain, it was better than nothing. The crowd could only resign to fate and collected the extremely tiny amount of grain. Jiang Xiaorou was right at the back, and by her turn, there was almost no grain left.She passed the two sweat sodden wooden tablets and received two palm-sized bags of grain. Even if she and Yi Yun ate the grains as porridge, it wouldn\u2019t last them more than ten days.Jiang Xiaorou was stunned as she held the light bags of grain, unwilling to accept her fate.Her brother had just come back from the dead, are they going to starve together?\u201cWhat are you staying there for, stop blocking the way!\u201d The man in charge of distributing the grain said impatiently, wanting Jiang Xiaorou to leave as soon as possible.Jiang Xiaorou felt anger. She had worked hard overnight to make those arrows, and all she got was this tiny amount. Although she was a weak girl, she daringly faced the group of men who held the tribe\u2019s authority. \u201cWhy is there so little? I handed over two bundles of arrows. Not only did I not get the rations, but all I got was grain that is far from the normal amount!\u201dThe man in charge of distributing the grain was stunned. He never expected the young girl to have the courage to question him.\u201cDo you even know the rules? You are just a kid, and a young girl at that. Without any males at home, what\u2019s the point of having so much food? It would be a waste!\u201dIn this world, the smaller tribes favored males. In the big tribes, there were various kinds of desolate beasts, and even desolate bones. So the differences between the two sexes didn\u2019t matter as much.But in a small tribe, a male\u2019s strength was an advantage gap that couldn\u2019t be closed. Few girls had the strength comparable to men.Being looked down upon, Jiang Xiaorou shouted angrily, \u201cWho said I didn\u2019t have any males in my house? There is one right here!\u201d Saying that, Jiang Xiaorou grabbed Yi Yun\u2019s hand and stood beside him.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Lian ChengyuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: Lian ChengyuYi Yun\u2019s thin and frail body was even shorter than Jiang Xiaorou. Although he looked like a kid, but in Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s heart, Yi Yun was the man of the house, a man who would support the family in the future!Holding Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s hands, Yi Yun felt her agitation as her palm heated up with a slight tremble in her fingers. Facing their impending deaths, and the unfairness of the tribe, Jiang Xiaorou didn\u2019t expect anyone to stand up for her. She could only do it herself, as a fifteen-year-old girl, against a bunch of stout men.The atmosphere went silent for a moment as everyone dazedly looked at Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou. After a short silence, a few of the men in charge of distributing the grain roared with laughter.\u201cHe is your household\u2019s man? Hahahaha!\u201d\u201cYoung lass, have you not seen a man before? Do you want me to show you what it means to be a man?\u201d said one of the men lewdly\u201cA kid who doesn\u2019t even need to shave, and a thin monkey at that. I say. Kid, how many days have you stopped using diapers?A few of the men guffawed, as Jiang Xiaorou turned red from embarrassment as she clenched her fists tightly. Not a single person behind her was willing to stand up for her.The ruling class of the tribe was filled with all the strong and laborious warriors. As the weak couldn\u2019t defeat the strong, no one bothered with them as they had their own meals to worry about.\u201cEh, I recall something. Didn\u2019t this brat die a few days ago?\u201dIn a small tribe, deaths weren\u2019t uncommon. Even more so was Yi Yun\u2019s lack of any standing, so his death wasn\u2019t news to anyone.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I know him. He\u2019s full of illnesses. His body is so weak that the wind can blow him over,\u201d agreed another person.\u201cWho said my brother has died!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou stared at the man like a leopardess. Their bodies were so disproportionate in size, like a sparrow against a vulture. Even so, Jiang Xiaorou gritted her teeth and stood her ground. There was an air of killing intent in her eyes, one that could be seen in a beast.It was hard to believe that a weak young girl like her could exhibit such a stare. Jiang Xiaorou held on tightly to a long and thin pole-like item she had hidden behind her. She had secretly kept one arrow for defensive purposes!Facing Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s glare, the man frowned because she angered him. As a deacon in the tribe, and a member of the warrior preparation camp, his position in the tribe was very high. This situation was like a tiger being pinned down by a kitten.\u201cYou foolish lass, what are you staring at? I\u2019ll dig out your eyes if you keep staring!\u201d The man said angrily, but Jiang Xiaorou continued gritting her teeth, not standing down, for they would not survive if they didn\u2019t receive any rations today. The arrow in her hand was gripped even tighter almost to the point of her drawing it out!\u201cThis lass is interesting!\u201d Situated in a clean and high house, a smirking lad in silver armor had been monitoring the conflict between Jiang Xiaorou and the man through the window.This silver-armored lad had an overpowering presence. His bright outerwear only served to enhance the difference between him and the suffering commoners.\u201cShe is still hiding an arrow. All the arrow-making materials have been accounted for, but even a defective arrow must be collected. I don\u2019t know how this lass managed to hide the arrow, but from the looks of it, she might have the courage to use the arrow offensively.\u201d\u201cIf she were to go on the offensive, she would definitely be in a sorry state,\u201d politely said an elder standing beside the silver-armored lad.\u201cThat\u2019s right. However if she were not to go on the offensive, she would probably starve to death,\u201d said the silver-armored lad nonchalantly. \u201cTell me more about the girl.\u201dThe elder bowed responding, \u201cAnswering Young master, her name is Jiang Xiaorou, a girl from the lower castes in our Lian tribal clan. She and her brother were originally not from the Lian tribal clan. She was a refugee who managed to find a foothold in the Lian tribal clan. A few years ago, her brother Yi Yun\u2019s mother passed away. The siblings became orphans. It was expected that the two children without their mother would die for sure, but this Jiang Xiaorou, though young, surprisingly managed to take care of both herself and her brother, and have lasted for a few years.\u201dThe elder was extremely polite. He knew everything about everyone that numbered a thousand in the entire Lian tribal clan.A typical large tribe usually did not take in refugees, only smaller tribes did. In fact, this was one of the ways for a small tribe to sustain their population, however the refugees were always of a much lower status than the natives.\u201cShe\u2019s actually a girl from elsewhere.\u201d The lad mumbled to himself as he slowly smirked.From the situation before, he realized that Jiang Xiaorou had a different air that he couldn\u2019t describe, for it wasn\u2019t one a poor family\u2019s child would have. Furthermore, Jiang Xiaorou had elegant and refined looks. In a small tribe that endured suffering, such a beautiful girl was a rarity. Such a beautiful and charming girl with a defiant attitude with an unknown past kindled the interest in Lian Chengyu.\u201cYoung master, has she caught your eye?\u201d asked the elder who couldn\u2019t resist asking. Young master Lian Chengyu had extremely high prestige in the tribe!The entire Lian tribal clan had few warriors, but for an honest count of experts, there were only three. One was the Patriarch who was the yellow-robed elder, the warrior preparation camp\u2019s coach, Yao Yuan, and lastly was Lian Chengyu. He was the grandnephew of the yellow-robed elder. The Patriarch was already in his 60s, but Lian Chengyu was only seventeen, so he had a bright path ahead. Lian Chengyu was undoubtedly going to be the next Patriarch. He was also the person with the highest chance of becoming a \u201cPurple Blood Warrior\u201d.With Lian Chengyu\u2019s birth stature, he wasn\u2019t supposed to marry a woman from outside, because of her low stature.\u201cSo what if I\u2019m interested? Soon this small Lian tribe will not bog me down. I\u2019ll go out and have a great adventure on the vast wilderness! Are you trying to use the Lian tribal clan rules to stifle me?\u201dAlthough Lian Chengyu had said it calmly, the cold words made the elder shudder as he hastily said, \u201cI was joking, Young Master. Old me was just asking. Old me spoke too much, please don\u2019t take it to heart!\u201dThe elder was about to slap himself as he said that, for although the Lian tribal clan was small, the clan rules were very strict!In the wilderness, where the strong ruled over the weak, many countries imposed military law. In the tribes, the warriors held power, so regardless of the laws, the tribal clan rules were extremely strict!The strong held the weak\u2019s lives in their hands. Lian Chengyu who was a powerhouse in his tribe had absolute authority to decide on a person\u2019s fate.Besides, Lian Chengyu showed no mercy. Since young, he had gone through numerous tribulations, and had experienced cruel in-fighting even in the tribe.Seeing the elder about to slap himself, Lian Chengyu said coolly, \u201cAlright. Stop acting in front of me. This girl is still young. I\u2019ll only want her as a maid or a concubine. So you don\u2019t have to worry. This would not violate the tribe\u2019s rules.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026thank you for your forgiveness, Young master,\u201d the elder nodded hurriedly.\u201cWell\u2026Let me ask you. This Jiang Xiaorou, why does she have a different surname from her brother?\u201d Lian Chengyu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the ongoings on the field. He realized that Jiang Xiaorou was extremely protective of her brother, while her brother was a illness-riddled weakling. Yet, Jiang Xiaorou seemed proud of her brother.\u201cThis\u2026I heard that when Jiang Xiaorou was in difficulty, she was adopted by Yi Yun\u2019s mother. It was probably for that reason that Jiang Xiaorou was very grateful to Yi Yun\u2019s mother, so she also treats Yi Yun very well.\u201d\u201cAh, is that so\u2026\u201d Lian Chengyu frowned as he stood up.\u201cGet lost now!\u201d Seeing Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s legs rooted to the ground, the man was angered. He stepped forward in front of Jiang Xiaorou and was about to slap her!A weak girl like Jiang Xiaorou could not compare to the man\u2019s large body. This slap if landed would have thrown Jiang Xiaorou into the air!Jiang Xiaorou was about to draw the arrow when she felt her hand being pressed down. Yi Yun quickly whispered into her ear saying, \u201cdon\u2019t be rash!\u201dSaying that, in one fluid move, Yi Yun was standing in front of Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cHold on!\u201d said Yi Yun with his hands raised.\u201cWhat do you think you are?\u201d The man was angered; it was actually this weak skinny monkey. He would send him flying too!Yi Yun was itching to kick the man in his groin, but he knew that a wise man does not fight when the odds are against him. Having lived two lives, he was calmer, and knew that being rash in this situation would be disastrous.\u201cA real man doesn\u2019t fight with womenfolk. Furthermore, aren\u2019t you from the warrior preparation camp? You must be very strong, so how can you lay your finger on a young lady. Wouldn\u2019t that be the joke of the people?\u201d Wary of the violent actions of the man, Yi Yun said it quickly but clearly. Everyone present heard it.The man hesitated as he looked strangely at the lad in front of him.Wouldn\u2019t a twelve-year-old kid jump out to lambaste him? Or he would have stupidly taken the slap in his sister\u2019s stead and sent flying?But, him jumping out and saying those words, it was a simple taunt that was extremely effective. He left his hand in mid-air as he hesitated in swiping his hand down.This man felt like he was punching the air. Indeed, as a member of the warrior preparation camp, and in the eyes of many, to hit two kids would not be something to be proud of. Furthermore there was some conflict of interests between the warrior preparation camp and the ordinary citizens, so it was easy for him to be brought down with words.The man may be brash, but he did not want to be talked behind his back.\u201cWell, at least you know your place!\u201d said the man as he lowered his hand while staring at the siblings. \u201cI\u2019m in a good mood today, so I\u2019ll not bother arguing with you. Get lost now!\u201d\u201cYun-er!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said as she pulled Yi Yun\u2019s hand. She felt helpless for she knew that she had nothing to gain by entering into a conflict with the man. But to leave would mean their starvation.\u201cSis Xiaorou\u2026don\u2019t worry,\u201d as Yi Yun held on to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s hand, gesturing to her to calm down. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll be leaving now, but before that, little me has something to consult you on\u2026\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Spit it out!\u201d the man said impatiently.\u201cOh, it\u2019s this. My sister handed over two bundles of arrows and in accordance with the clan rules, more rations than this should be obtained\u2026\u201dYi Yun dangled the light bag of grain in the air as he asked with an earnest look, without any hints of interrogating.The man hissed, \u201cWhat clan rules? Being strong is the rule! What I say becomes the rules!\u201dThe man aggressively said. Yi Yun sneered in his heart. What an idiot, the man\u2019s arrogance had led him straight into his trap.Yi Yun gave him a look of injustice, saying, \u201cBrother, you may set the rules, but you should let us have something to live by.\u201dBy saying this, Yi Yun had included that everyone was on board when the man said, \u201cbeing strong is the rule! What I say are the rules!\u201d as it most likely ruffled the feathers of many of them.Immediately after, many people behind Yi Yun could not help but echoed him by saying, \u201cRight, Soldier-brother, I handed over 6 pieces of armor, yet all I got was a tiny amount of rations. I want an explanation as well.\u201d\u201cWhy are there so few rations this time? We want to know too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m an old person with a family to feed. This amount of rations isn\u2019t enough!\u201dThe people of the Lian tribal clan had endured misery all this time. They had the intention to revolt against the tribal clan leadership, but due to the differences in strength and them being without a leader, none of them stood forward. But with Yi Yun\u2019s provocation, they could no longer sit idle.The man\u2019s countenance fell, he did not expect that a kid\u2019s words would cause such a disturbance amongst the crowd. Seeing the situation escalate, he was beginning to lose control over it.\u201cAll of you shut the f**k up!\u201d the man roared.But his roar was severely limited.\u201cGive us an explanation. We want an explanation!\u201d\u201cWhy are there so few rations!?\u201dLaws fail when violators are legion. Usually the first person who jumps forward would receive \u201cspecial care\u201d, but with the situation escalating, everyone gained courage.Just as the situation was about to go out of control, a clear voice rang out, \u201cYou want an explanation, I\u2019ll give you one!\u201dThis sound contained an amorphous energy, instantly quieting the chaotic situation.Everyone traced the source of the sound, only to see a silver-armored lad with a long sword in hand, walking over.\u201cIt\u2019s Young master Lian Chengyu!\u201d\u201cLian Chengyu!\u201dSeeing this lad, everyone was surprised. Lian Chengyu was the person in the tribe who was most likely to become a Purple Blood Warrior. Lian Chengyu\u2019s talent was apparently comparable to a large tribe\u2019s genius.If the Lian tribal clan produced a Purple Blood Warrior, everything would be different! The day that happened, Lian Chengyu could support the entire tribal clan!If Lian Chengyu went one step further, and impressed a powerful tribe, he definitely would have the means to bring the entire Lian tribe into the city.To many in the tribe, being able to live in a city would be heavenly. To be able to build a city in the wilderness was too difficult as it would be an easy target, filled with humans, for big and strong desolate beasts to attack! Without human experts backing the city, the desolate beasts would easily trample it!Many experts were located in every human city. With a thick high wall and a long heritage history, the city was protected, leaving humans to survive within the city walls safely. With sufficient food sources, they did not need to fear starvation nor the threats of the beasts. Who didn\u2019t want to live such a pleasant life?Lian Chengyu was the Lian tribal clan\u2019s hope. His position within the tribe had already exceeded the Patriarch\u2019s!When Lian Chengyu came forward, everyone fell silent.\u201cGrandpa.\u201d Lian Chengyu first acknowledged the tribal Patriarch, who was the yellow-robed elder.\u201cAh, Chengyu, since you have stepped forward I will leave it to you.\u201dIn the tribe, many men married at the age of 16. So a 17-year-old Lian Chengyu was well qualified to take charge.Lian Chengyu didn\u2019t say a word to the tribe at first. Instead, he faced Yi Yun with a meaningful smile. \u201cYou are Yi Yun, right?\u201dYi Yun\u2019s eyebrows jumped. The first thing Lian Chengyu said to the tribe was towards him, and although it was one of smiles, Yi Yun could sense the danger behind it.Yi Yun instigated the unrest of the people, and he had tried his best to made it appear unintentional. Whether intentional or not, as the tribe leadership\u2019s representative, Lian Chengyu was highly likely to attack him.\u201cNot bad for a twelve-year-old. You don\u2019t seem like a child, you might one day amount to something big!\u201d Lian Chengyu chuckled as he patted Yi Yun on the shoulder nonchalantly. Many in the crowd were surprised that a person of Lian Chengyu\u2019s stature had taken the initiative to pat the shoulder of a commoner.Also, this praise was extremely noteworthy! Lian Chengyu actually said that this poor kid could amount to something big! Is that possible?Although they were in disagreement, since those were words from Lian Chengyu\u2019s mouth, they had nothing better to say. To them, this young man must have received some sh*t luck to be appreciated by Young master Lian. He might even be given some henchman position of Young master Lian in the future. That was a position many dreamed of!\u201cYoung master has thought too highly of me.\u201d Yi Yun smiled stiffly, but he felt tightness in his heart. He was constantly on high alert ever since the moment he met Lian Chengyu. He had felt a numbness on his shoulder, followed by a warmth that spread through his shoulder before almost instantly disappearing when Lian Chengyu patted him.If Yi Yun wasn\u2019t sharp and on high alert, he would have thought that the feeling was an illusion, or thought that it was due to nervousness when Lian Chengyu patted him on the shoulder.What did this Lian guy want? Could there be some trick\u2026?Yi Yun didn\u2019t believe that Lian Chengyu would pat him on the shoulder in front of everyone, or compliment him for nothing. To him, Lian Chengyu\u2019s gaze was full of enmity.\u201cGive them some rations.\u201d Lian Chengyu turned to the man in charge of handing out the food and spoke. Even though Jiang Xiaorou was still young, she should be taken care of for another two years, not starved to death.\u201cYes, Young master!\u201d the man answered. Although he was unwilling after having been tricked by Yi Yun, he had to obey Lian Chengyu\u2019s orders.The man hesitated for a moment before handing over a 50 pound sack of grain to Yi Yun.Yi Yun became even more vigilant but displayed a look of gratefulness. He accepted the bags and disingenuously said, \u201cThank you Young master.\u201dAlthough he was verbally grateful, Yi Yun was raring to beat Lian Chengyu up. The food that belonged to Jiang Xiaorou as a result of her hard work of making arrows could have been exchanged for a piece of meat, but all they got was a bag of grain. They even had to be thankful! It was preposterous!Being inferior in capability resulted in being inferior in everything. In this world, strength was the truth!\u201cI so want to give him two panda eyes\u2026\u201d Yi Yun thought, but displayed a flawless poker face.Seeing Yi Yun collecting two to three months worth of food, the others were all full of envy and jealousy. But since it was awarded by Lian Chengyu, they did not dare say anything except, \u201cYoung master Lian, can you explain to us why there are so few rations today?\u201d\u201cYeah, Young master Lian should stand up for us!\u201dLian Chengyu already stood on the stage, smiling at everyone. It was as if the compliment he gave to Yi Yun was nothing, and he was no longer interested.With a smile, he said, \u201cMy fellow tribe members, you have worked hard for all these years!\u201dLian Chengyu did not go straight to the point with his first sentence, but used it to quell the masses. To Yi Yun, this was a clumsy tactic, but with Lian Chengyu\u2019s stature, those words had already made the poor flattered.\u201cYou want an explanation, I\u2019ll give you an explanation. Bring it up!\u201d Lian Chengyu waved his hands and six men behind him lifted up a large wooden box up with wooden poles. Yi Yun remembered that, that \u201cLord Lu\u201d left behind this box after receiving the weapons and armors. This must be something from the large tribe!\u201cOpen it!\u201d Lian Chengyu ordered. It was impossible to conceal the item inside the box. To refine it, a lot of labor would be required.Two big men pried the box open in front of everyone. When the box opened, gorgeous light with beautiful patterns emitted from it.The crowd exclaimed in disbelief. They had never seen such a scene before.Lian Chengyu went forward and, using a red rock, waved it along the glowing light streams. The light streams rippled in reaction before slowly disappearing.In an instant, chilly air poured out\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - Desolate BonesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: Desolate Bones\u201cIt\u2019s so cold.\u201d The onlookers couldn\u2019t help shivering. All they saw was a white mist being emitted from the box. When the mist eventually dissipated, they saw a large set of shiny bones inside the box.The biting cold came from these bones!\u201cWhat is that?\u201d They were all shocked, for they had never seen any rare items. Although they did not know what it was, they could guess that it was likely some immense treasure.\u201cThese are desolate bones!\u201d Lian Chengyu said with a sense of satisfaction. \u201cThe light patterns you saw previously were there to seal the chill of these bones.\u201d\u201cDesolate bones? These are desolate bones?\u201d Most people in the crowd had never heard of desolate bones, but Yi Yun had already heard about them from Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s description.In this world\u2019s wilderness, there existed strong desolate beasts. Every desolate beast had the ability to easily destroy a small tribe like the Lian tribe.Desolate beasts may be frightening, but their body was full of treasures.Desolate beasts were excellent supplements. However, as a person\u2019s appetite was limited, how much of a hill sized desolate beast could a person eat?Fortunately, most of the essence was gathered within their bones, and through a special method, it was refined into a tiny piece.A set of desolate beast bones was considered the most precious item in a desolate beast\u2019s body.Looking at the desolate bones inside the box, although it was only a tiny portion of a desolate beast\u2019s rib, it was still considered precious!\u201cThe reason why we have fewer rations today is because besides exchanging for rations, a lot of the weapons and armors were used to exchange for this set of desolate bones! In fact, to obtain it, the arrows and armor you manufactured were insufficient. Due to my experience outside in my youth where I obtained some mental cultivation methods, only by exchanging those did we finally have enough to exchange for this set of desolate bones!\u201d In between Lian Chengyu\u2019s speech, the elder beside him had explained the usefulness and preciousness of the desolate bones to everyone.Although the elder said it vicariously, many in the audience could not accept it.The desolate bones may be good, but what did that have to do with them?No matter how stupid they were, they knew that they would have no stake in the results of refining the essence from the desolate bones.\u201cI know your thoughts; you are worried about your future life. You are worried about starving to death. I understand everyone\u2019s situation. But think about it, is there an end to those days! In the wilderness, there are as many small tribes as there\u2019s sand in a desert. They do not have the power to protect themselves and can be destroyed at any time!\u201d\u201cOur Lian tribal clan is also one of them!\u201d\u201cDo you really want to lead such a precarious life forever? Worrying when the next meal is, worrying if you will be killed by beasts while sleeping at night!?\u201d\u201cDo you really want such a life?\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s words were full of incitement. Many in the tribe clenched their fists! Such a life was debilitating. If there was a hell, it was this!\u201cI\u2019ve endured enough!\u201d shouted someone in the crowd.\u201cGood! I too do not want to lead such a life! There\u2019s a chance now. In three months\u2019 time, the human empire, the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom will be having a mass recruitment of experts within its territory! If one were to pass the multiple rounds of selection by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, one can become a warrior of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom!\u201cThis is an extreme glory, and also a great opportunity!\u201d Saying this, Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyes were burning with flames!Yi Yun understood these eyes; they were one of extreme desire and ambition!Lian Chengyu was a man with ambition. He didn\u2019t want to be trapped in such a small tribal clan. He wanted to go out into the wilderness and make a name for himself!\u201cNo wonder he was willing to sacrifice so many of the tribe just for that set of desolate bones\u2026 he wants to take the test of the Kingdom in three months!\u201d Yi Yun was suddenly enlightened. He originally thought that Lian Chengyu might have slowly accumulated the rations over time to exchange for the desolate bones.For him to kill the golden goose probably meant that he was going to use the desolate bones to make a quantum leap in strength!Lian Chengyu\u2019s words quickly confirmed Yi Yun\u2019s hypothesis.\u201cI, Lian Chengyu, was born and bred in the Lian tribal clan. I am a son of the Lian tribe. I will give my all for the entire Lian tribe! Thankfully, with this set of desolate bones, I can break through into the realm of a Purple Blood Warrior within three months! Once I become a Purple Blood Warrior, I can easily pass the exams arranged by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, becoming a warrior of the kingdom!\u201d\u201cWhen that happens, I can personally protect the entire Lian tribe. And as a warrior of the Divine Kingdom, I can even bring the Lian tribe into the cities of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. If I were to make any contributions in the future, I can even own my own part of the city! When that happens, everyone can enter my city and live a comfortable life!\u201d\u201cIn three months! That\u2019s right; just endure for three months. The day the exam is over, I promise you a life of no worries! Today, for the tribe to tighten their belts to provide for me, I will return it a hundred times, no, a thousand times!\u201d Lian Chengyun\u2019s words were bewitching, and the normal suffering people could not see through to his ambition. They were all immersed in the promise of a better future and began anticipating it.Three months, just another three months and they could move into the city?Is this real?\u201cThis guy could be a politician on Earth\u201d Yi Yun began to ruminate as he clearly knew that no one would question the scarcity of rations distributed anymore. Lian Chengyu\u2019s promise of a castle in the air had silenced everyone. Any further questions would be dealt with, not by Lian Chengyu but by the surrounding people.The poor were helpless. A person\u2019s life was cheap. A bag of rations was worth several lives, so for the curated promise by Lian Chengyu, it was normal for there to be more deaths.People had led tough lives and were too depressed. They needed hope, a pillar of support for them to carry on living. They believed in even a sliver of hope. Anyone who professed against it would be dealt with severely by the desperate.Noticing that people were still confused, a henchman jumped up loudly yelling, \u201cLong live Young master Lian Chengyu!\u201dSuffering people who were starving were easily incited. To them, they were willing to sacrifice their lives to ensure a better life for their offspring.\u201cLong live Young master Lian Chengyu\u2026\u201d A few people shouted weakly.But the moment people started shouting, the shouting increased. Even those that were worried about their next meal had to go with the crowd.This was the sorrow of the weak; they had no choice.Seeing the people\u2019s reactions, Lian Chengyu was very satisfied. As long as he wanted it, the entire Lian tribe would be his stepping-stone. He wanted to step on this stone and create his own legend!\u201cChengyu, well done.\u201d The yellow robed elder said after walking up behind Lian Chengyu.\u201cGrandpa, you don\u2019t have to praise me. It\u2019s nothing. If I didn\u2019t ignite the emotions of these people, it would be hard to carry on. Refining the bones will kill many.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d sighed the yellow robed elder. He knew that refining the bones would kill many. But regardless of the number of deaths, this opportunity must not be lost.\u201cOne success is formed from a thousand bones. Grandpa, why do you sigh. The tribe will remember them for their deaths. Furthermore\u2026 with a few dead, there will be more food left. Holding out for another three months wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201dLian Chengyu said this casually. He was not worried over the sacrifices. How many people died a day in the wilderness?A few ants dying could make a hero. It was definitely worth it, because a hero could save many more ants.What more, the hero was himself!Lian Chengyu\u2019s words were not heard by anyone other than the yellow robed elder.\u201cYun\u2019er, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou had noticed that Yi Yun was not paying attention and jolted him. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Yi Yun shook his head. He was in a trance, not because of Lian Chengyu\u2019s speech, nor was it for the insufferable fate of the Lian tribe, but he had noticed that a few faint dots of light had flown over, like fireflies in the night sky.The lights flew into his mouth and disappeared.Shortly thereafter, the coolness of the Purple Crystal permeated, becoming even clearer.Obviously, the Purple Crystal was absorbing the lights. Just like the Purple Crystal absorbed starlight at night!And looking for the source of the lights, it actually was\u2026Yi Yun heart skipped a beat, it can\u2019t be\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Killed SecretlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8: Killed SecretlyThe light source was from the wooden box, which meant the desolate bones!Yi Yun broke into a cold sweat at this unexpected turn of events.The desolate bones emitted bits of light, which flew towards him. How could Lian Chengyu not investigate this phenomenon?With more and more light dots, it was getting too obvious. He was sure to be discovered!The moment it was investigated, he could only explain it with his life!\u201cYun-er, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why is your forehead full of sweat?\u201d\u201cSis Xiaorou, you\u2026\u201d Yi Yun saw many light dots flying, but Jiang Xiaorou didn\u2019t seem to notice it. \u201cSis Xiaorou, you don\u2019t see anything?\u201dYi Yun asked with a guilty conscience. He realized that besides Jiang Xiaorou, the surrounding people did not seem to notice the light dots.\u201cSee what? Yun-er, are you sick?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou asked with a concern. Yi Yun\u2019s body was weak and he had just resurrected the previous day. It would be terrible if he were to fall sick again.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun paused for a while before heaving a sigh of relief. It seemed like he was the only one who could see the light dots?Could it be that only the owner of the Purple Crystal was able to see the strange happenings of the Purple Crystal?He glanced furtively at Lian Chengyu who still had a calm smile on his face. Lian Chengyu would occasionally look at the box of desolate bones with a manic look in his eyes!\u201cThat guy hasn\u2019t noticed the light dots\u2026\u201dWith that, Yi Yun relaxed. If even Lian Chengyu couldn\u2019t see it, then no one else could except himself.Yi Yun was further convinced that the Purple Crystal was a wonderful treasure!At this moment, Lian Chengyu turned his gaze towards him with a meaningful smile.He walked forward and stood in front of Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cThe food is a reward for you. Take it and don\u2019t starve yourself. If it\u2019s insufficient, come look for me.\u201d Lian Chengyu said those words softly. His voice was congenial, but his expressions and tone were one of superiority. For whatever he gave, he could take back.Jiang Xiaorou stayed silent. Lian Chengyu did not mind that as he admired her for her stubbornness when the rations were distributed. It didn\u2019t mean that he liked her stubborn attitude towards him and was determined to slowly rub it off her till she was as obedient as a kitten.What he wanted was an obedient servant girl, not a lady that needed coaxing.With a brother by her side, she had something to cling on to and stay determined. This was not what Lian Chengyu wanted. Besides, Yi Yun\u2019s mother adopted her, and they had no blood relations. Lian Chengyu did not like the fact that the non-blood siblings were living together.Furthermore, Yi Yun had stirred the masses, and almost caused a commotion. He took it to heart that a twelve-year-old kid could be so scheming. He would be a threat when grown up.What Lian Chengyu wanted was obedient people, as his stepping-stones, and not scheming people like Yi Yun who were hard to control.As the desolate bones were about to be refined, it was a big matter to Lian Chengyu. He was willing to pay any price for it to succeed.He didn\u2019t want any uncertainty, because he was about to isolate himself for training. Besides, the desolate bones had a problem, refining it would cause deaths!With a food shortage and people dying, it was easy to incite public rage. He was afraid of mutiny while he was isolated. They could flip the cauldron where the desolate bones were being refined. If his plans were destroyed, killing all of them was pointless.From Lian Chengyu\u2019s point of view, Yi Yun hated him, and didn\u2019t have a trace of fear or respect towards him.Yi Yun had already a record of inciting chaos. If Yi Yun sought revenge while inciting the people due to the starvation and deaths isolated him, Yi Yun could be the spark that spelled disaster.Thinking of this, Lian Chengyu smiled again and patted Yi Yun\u2019s shoulder gently once again.Yi Yun\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but before he had time to react, Lian Chengyu\u2019s hand was already on his shoulder.F**k! Yi Yun wished he could have chopped off Lian Chengyu\u2019s hand. He felt Lian Chengyu was as sinister as a venomous snake!Lian Chengyu said coolly, \u201cWhat are you nervous about, are you afraid of me? You and your sister don\u2019t have it easy. Take care of your sister.\u201dSaying that, Lian Chengyu withdrew his hand as Yi Yun felt that numbness again.Lian Chengyu had patted his shoulders twice, but he could do nothing about it.\u201cIf there are any problems, look for me,\u201d said Lian Chengyu to Jiang Xiaorou. He was always smiling. Yi Yun frowned for he sensed that Lian Chengyu had the hots for his sister.That must be it. It was no wonder he gave so much food, if he not for his coveting of Jiang Xiaorou. There was no reason to hand out the precious food.The thing about approaching him if there were any troubles shed light on his thoughts. If Jiang Xiaorou were to go to him, indescribable things would definitely happen.With a wave of Lian Chengyu\u2019s hand, the warriors from the warrior preparation camp sealed the box containing the desolate bones.The moment it was sealed, Yi Yun felt the disconnection between the Purple Crystal he had and the desolate bones. The floating light dots also disappeared shortly.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Something cropped up in Yi Yun\u2019s mind as he saw the warrior preparation camp members carry the desolate bones away.\u201cYun-er, what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d On the way home, Jiang Xiaorou had sensed that Yi Yun wasn\u2019t paying attention and was frowning.Yi Yun couldn\u2019t be carefree for a venomous snake like Lian Chengyu had patted him on his shoulders twice. It was unknown what had been done. Yi Yun didn\u2019t tell Jiang Xiaorou, as he didn\u2019t want her to worry. Also, she was still young and wouldn\u2019t be able to see through Lian Chengyu\u2019s wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing act.Unexpectedly, Jiang Xiaorou suddenly said, \u201cYun-er, that Lian Chengyu, you must be careful of him. Try to avoid him if possible.\u201dJiang Xiaorou\u2019s words stunned Yi Yun for a while. He didn\u2019t expect her to have such a keen intuition.In actual fact, Lian Chengyu\u2019s behavior could not be faulted on the surface. He was a Young master who was concerned about his people, an amiable and respected tribal clan leader.Yi Yun was able to sense Lian Chengyu\u2019s underlying motives as he had seen the acts of several politicians from Earth. People like Lian Chengyu could be found in historical books and international news. Yi Yun could only sense hypocrisy when he heard Lian Chengyu\u2019s words. This insight wasn\u2019t something the suffering poor could attain.To Yi Yun, the two pats from Lian Chengyu on his shoulders clearly spelled out his hostility.Yi Yun was stumped that Jiang Xiaorou was able to sense it too.\u201cAnyway, just avoid him.\u201d Hearing Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s determined words, Yi Yun realized that he did not fully understand this sister of his.Be it the desolate bones, desolate monsters and her intuition, including her extreme beauty compared to to the other tribal girls made her stand out in the poor tribal clan\u2026As expected by Yi Yun, dinner consisted of wild vegetables and porridge.In this world, people only ate two meals. A typical day began at 5 am before they ate breakfast at 9 am. Of course, breakfast was just Yi Yun\u2019s way of calling it; they had a different name for it here. Finally, dinner was eaten at 4 pm.Yi Yun understood that in ancient China, people only ate two meals, just like in this strange world. In a situation with scarce resources, having two meals a day was probably most scientific and optimal for surviving.While eating, Jiang Xiaorou felt somewhat guilty that she didn\u2019t manage to get meat for her brother.Yi Yun wasn\u2019t taking it to heart, as he was busy thinking about the two pats on his shoulder. It was all speculation and suspicion on his part; he had no clue how serious it would be.After finishing a bowl of grain porridge, as Yi Yun was about to eat a few mouthfuls of wild vegetables, he felt his arm go numb and dropped his chopsticks.\u201cYun-er, you\u2026\u201dYi Yun grunted for his left hand could no longer move. Both his arms were hurting, as if someone was breaking it!\u201cYun-er!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s face went pale, she didn\u2019t know what was happening to Yi Yun and quickly helped him to the bed.Damn it!Yi Yun\u2019s arm was full of pain as he gritted his teeth. Without question, this was the work of Lian Chengyu. Yi Yun had not guessed wrongly!It was unknown what method Lian Chengyu had used, but with the disparity in power, even if Yi Yun had sensed Lian Chengyu\u2019s enmity, he had no way to avoid it.This was the law of the jungle where the strong determined the fate of the weak.\u201cYun-er, how are you? Is this an after effect of your fall while picking herbs?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d As Yi Yun opened his mouth, he realized his tongue had gone numb. He was experiencing a gradual increase of paralysis in his entire body.Yi Yun began to to realize that the moment he lost all feeling in his body was the moment of his death!Lian Chengyu wanted his life?Yi Yun was both shocked and angry. If he didn\u2019t guess wrongly, Lian Chengyu had transmitted some form of energy like \u201cKi\u201d or \u201cQi\u201d that had destroyed his meridians!A normal twelve-year-old child would not have been able to figure it out. Even Yi Yun himself would have thought it was an after effect from his old injuries.After his death, besides Jiang Xiaorou, no one would grieve for him. In fact, many would think he was fated to be\u2013how could a dead person suddenly revive?By killing Yi Yun mysteriously, Lian Chengyu would not only have taken revenge for the incitement of the crowd, but also receive the good will of the people.Jiang Xiaorou would be in a grievous situation, and suffer subsequent difficulties in life. She could even approach Lian Chengyu. Lian Chengyu could then gain her easily by using conciliation tactics!Killing Yi Yun and obtaining Jiang Xiaorou, what a venomous plan!Yi Yun gained a deeper understanding of this world. This was not the lawful society of Earth. It was a brutal and primitive place where power determined everything. It was like an apocryphal world in novels where killing someone was nothing\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was unable to speak, hear or see.He only felt his face wet with tears, Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s tears.She was shouting with all her life, but Yi Yun could only vaguely see her mouth move. The voices were stretched and unclear!Yi Yun couldn\u2019t take that lying down. With all his determination, he managed to move his stiff tongue saying, \u201cLian\u2026Lian Chengyu\u2026\u201dAlthough Yi Yun\u2019s voice was not clear, Jiang Xiaorou was able to decipher it, \u201cLian Chengyu? Lian Chengyu harmed you?\u201dYi Yun was already completely unable to speak. He felt a cold corpse-like stiffness spreading to his heart.If his heart were to stiffen and stop beating, then his life was over!Yi Yun felt like a fish left out to dry; neither could he move nor could he breathe. All he could do was wait for death. Unexpectedly, just as the stiffness spread to his heart, he felt a cold feeling starting to develop.This cold feeling was exquisite and familiar. It was like pure spring water cleansing his body!Purple Crystal! Yi Yun rejoiced, it was the feeling from the Purple Crystal. In the worst of times, he would always feel the Purple Crystal!The stiffness had already permeated throughout his body, but met its nemesis when it reached his heart. He had always kept the Purple Crystal close to his heart in his clothes.Just as the Purple Crystal was activated, Yi Yun felt a small whirlpool in his heart.The tiny eddies may not amount to anything, but\u2026 \u201cSwish!\u201dA light sound rang. Without struggle or suspense, Yi Yun felt his body go light; the Purple Crystal had absorbed all the energy permeating within his meridians. All the stiffness in his body had disappeared.Yi Yun knew he had already completely recovered. He moved his four limbs and realized nothing was amiss. He was only covered in sweat due to his nervousness.Already fine? Yi Yun could not believe it, that once the Purple Crystal activated, he was fine in less than a second!This\u2026The Purple Crystal by Yi Yun\u2019s heart made him speechless. What exactly is the Purple Crystal?\u201cYun-er, how are you. Don\u2019t scare sis!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou saw the originally stiff and immobile body of Yi Yun moving but there was a silly look on his face. She was extremely worried.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Sis Xiaorou. I\u2019m\u2026totally fine\u2026\u201d said Yi Yun just as he felt something amiss. Just as he finished his last word, he felt something brew in his stomach.\u201cEugh!\u201d Without warning, an extreme nausea overwhelmed Yi Yun before he vomited.Previously, Yi Yun vomited only gastric juices as his stomach was empty, but this time, it was different. He had vomited out black blood clots, which smelt rancid!This horrified Jiang Xiaorou. In this strange world, vomiting was equivalent to declaring a death sentence.Yi Yun kept vomiting without stop. Besides vomiting, he also perspired out smelly sweat that was sticky. It resembled black mud.Seeing Yi Yun break out into a sweat and vomiting, Jiang Xiaorou was unfazed by the stench that filled the house. She scrambled to wipe Yi Yun\u2019s mouth and pat his back.\u201cYun-er, Yun-er, don\u2019t scare sis. What happened to you? What happened?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s voice trembled.Yi Yun did not have a chance to respond till he vomited out all the black blood. But weirdly, he didn\u2019t feel weakened, instead he felt even better. Besides having an empty stomach and being extremely hungry, he felt rejuvenated.Yi Yun felt like he could eat an entire roasted lamb and pig if they were placed in front of him.\u201cSis, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just hungry, and\u2026 I need a bath.\u201dThe sticky sweat had adhered to his body like a sticky mud shell and was indescribably uncomfortable.\u201cYun-er, you\u2019re hungry?\u201d Hearing Yi Yun\u2019s words, Jiang Xiaorou was delighted. In ancient times, a measure of healthiness was the ability to eat.No matter if it was \u201cLian Bo is old, is his appetite the same as old?\u201d or Zhuge Liang\u2019s goal to deter the enemy by pretending to eat a lot, both made the point that appetite was a mark of health.This criterion was worthy of being taken as a reference.Jiang Xiaorou wiped her tears and rushed to prepare the food. While boiling the grain porridge, she prepared Yi Yun\u2019s bath water, and cleaned up Yi Yun\u2019s vomit.Yi Yun comfortably took a bath. He never felt any better.The strange thing was that after his bath, Yi Yun felt his eyesight was even better. He could see clearly the water droplets on the trees about 8 meters away.Oh?Yi Yun was slightly stunned, but before he could think about it, he heard Jiang Xiaorou shout, \u201cthe porridge is ready, Yun-er, come have your meal!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Yi Yun could also smell the aromas of the grain porridge.Weirdly, the grain porridge Yi Yun had trouble swallowing in the past tasted sweet and delicious.Yi Yun finished two big bowls of grain porridge, and he felt the porridge digest the moment it entered his stomach. He was still hungry after finishing two bowls of grain porridge, but he felt rejuvenated and energetic.\u201cYun-er, are you feeling better?\u201d Next to Yi Yun, Jiang Xiaorou watched him without eating. She had gained hope that maybe Yun-er was really better!Jiang Xiaorou may not be a doctor, but she knew that treatment was about ventilating the blood vessels.Thinking carefully, Yi Yun vomiting blood may be a horrible scene, but he didn\u2019t vomit fresh blood but black blood.That might have been the congested blood in Yi Yun\u2019s stomach. It might be a good that he vomited the congested blood.Also the layer of sweat from Yi Yun\u2019s body was very dirty. Vomiting congested blood and dirty sweat, was it a blessing in disguise for Yun-er?\u201cSis, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ve never felt anything better\u2026\u201d Before Yi Yun could finish saying his sentence, he felt a soft body embracing him\u201cIt\u2019s great you are fine. You scared sis\u2026\u201d said Jiang Xiaorou softly. In this wilderness rife with killings, abuse and death, this brother sister duo had only each other as kin.She hugged Yi Yun tightly, afraid that the moment she released him, she would lose him.After hugging him for a long while, Jiang Xiaorou wiped her tears away and carefully examined Yi Yun. After she was satisfied that he was alright, she said, \u201cYou previously mentioned Lian Chengyu\u2019s name. Was Lian Chengyu the one who harmed you?\u201dYi Yun hesitated for a while before nodding his head, \u201cSis Xiaorou, I think Lian Chengyu has the hots for you!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s words made Jiang Xiaorou blush. \u201cYou are still a child, don\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201dIt was indeed weird for a twelve year to say such words.\u201cLian Chengyu, he\u2019s too evil!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou gnashed her teeth saying. She resented that the Lian Chengyu had harmed her brother, but she was powerless against him for he was too strong. He had control over the entire warrior preparation camp.\u201cPeng!\u201d Suddenly there was a loud sound. Jiang Xiaorou jumped while turning around, and saw the yard door kicked open. A burly man had burst in\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This intruder was the person who they previously got into a conflict with during the ration distribution.Yi Yun also knew his name, Zhao Tiezhu.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Seeing Zhao Tiezhu barge in, Jiang Xiaorou tensed up. Her hands surged under the blankets and secretly grabbed the arrow hidden underneath them.\u201cHey, little girl, what are you nervous about. I\u2019m here on business today. Young master Lian has already isolated himself for training. He will be isolated for three months, preparing to attain the level of Purple Blood Warrior in preparation for the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s warrior selection. The Patriarch has ordered that the entire tribe has to head to the mountain to pick herbs, which will be used by Young master Lian to soak in! Each person has to hand over up to 8 oz of herbs daily!\u201d\u201cPick herbs? Soak?\u201d Yi Yun recalled that his past self had fallen off a cliff, to his \u201cdeath\u201d, while picking herbs.So it seems the picked herbs are for the warriors to soak in.It was pathetic, to pick herbs at an early age for others and fall to his death while doing so, without any compensation. Even their rations were withheld.\u201c8 oz of herbs per person a day? How is that even possible?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou thought furiously. \u201cBesides, if they were to pick herbs, where would they find the time to make arrows? Without the weapons, how were they going to exchange for rations with the big tribes? Won\u2019t we starve to death then!\u201d\u201cHahahaha! You are still thinking about exchanging for rations? When Young master Lian reaches the level of Purple Blood Warrior and gets chosen by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, you don\u2019t even need to exchange for rations anymore. We will all move into the city, and I guarantee you that you will have enough to eat and drink!\u201dThe man sarcastically said while looking covetously at Jiang Xiaorou. This little chick is a beauty; in time to come, with better nutrition, she will definetively become even prettier.\u201cMy brother hurt himself previously while picking herbs. His feet aren\u2019t nimble yet, yet you insist he has to pick herbs, do you really want his life?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said with a trembling voice. Yi Yun had originally fallen to his death, but having just come back to life, his body was still weak. Sending him back to pick herbs was the same as sending him to his death!Furthermore, picking herbs gave them no benefits. All the herbs were given to the tribe without compensation!The man listened to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s words and disdainfully laughed, \u201cHow can a person\u2019s life compare to the entire clan\u2019s glory!\u201d As long as Young master Lian reaches the level of Purple Blood Warrior and gets chosen by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, he will benefit generations to come and protect our clan for hundreds of years. The clan\u2019s history books will record all of your meritorious deeds!\u201d\u201cSuch a blessing for generations to come, yet you are haggling, you sure don\u2019t appreciate it!\u201d\u201cBesides, the Patriarch has ordered it. To strengthen your body and to make you more energetic, all the herbs remnants will be given back to you after they have been brewed. You can then use it to soak in. In the past, these remnants were only reserved for the warrior preparation camp.\u201dAs the man said this, Jiang Xiaorou only gripped the arrow in her hand more tightly, till her fingers went white. \u201cWhat if we can\u2019t make the quota?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t make it?\u201d the man face turned cold. \u201cHumph! The tribe doesn\u2019t rear trash; if you can\u2019t pick herbs, what rights do you have to eat? If you can\u2019t make the quota, your rations will be confiscated. Many others are still waiting for that food!\u201dThe man said and glanced over at Yi Yun who was lying in bed. He recalled Yi Yun causing him trouble in front of the crowd. Lian Chengyu had later reprimanded him for being incompetent during the distribution of rations.Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s heart immediately burned with rage, \u201cKid, stop pretending to be dead. I heard that you were injured, let me see exactly where you are injured!\u201dThe man thrust out his hand to grab Yi Yun!He was deliberately trying to make Yi Yun suffer, so his thrust was extremely strong.Yi Yun wanted to dodge the man\u2019s sudden attack, but Yi Yun suddenly felt as if the world slowed down in front of his eyes. The fierce look of that man, his actions were all clearly reflected in Yi Yun\u2019s eyes.Including Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s worried face, Yi Yun saw the arrow in her hand under the blanket.It felt like time had frozen. Sounds and the air itself seemed to have become a part of his own body, everything was clearly perceived by Yi Yun.With everything slowed down, a cool and clear feeling was felt coming from the Purple Crystal.Purple Crystal?The cool feeling from the Purple Crystal shook Yi Yun\u2019s body!Yi Yun felt that in that instant, he could dodge the man\u2019s grab, snatch Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s arrow, raise his body and thrust the arrow into the man\u2019s throat, killing him!The feeling was extremely intense and the images of his body doing the movements perfectly played out in his mind, giving him the urge to give it a try.But in the end Yi Yun decided against it, it wasn\u2019t yet the time for him to turn the Lian tribal clan against him.Just stirring the crowd led to the Lian Chengyu\u2019s killing intent. If he were to kill or beat up a tribal warrior, the consequences would be more severe. How could a kid, who originally was weak as a fly, kill a member of the warrior preparation camp? Wouldn\u2019t this gain the attention of the upper levels of the tribe? There was no way he could explain the source of his power!He looked as Zhao Tiezhu grab approached him, and retreated without a trace. Zhao Tiezhu only managed to scrape his skin and seize his clothes.Zhao Tiezhu originally wanted to beat Yi Yun up, but he didn\u2019t expect to miss when Yi Yun shrank backwards!If he were to grab another time, Zhao Tiezhu would lose face, so with a grunt; he lifted Yi Yun up before throwing him back down onto the bed.\u201cLooks like this monkey isn\u2019t hurt! Tomorrow at sunset, hand over the herbs. For every ounce missing, ten pounds of rations will be confiscated!\u201d Finishing his sentence, Zhao Tiezhu walked out and left.\u201cYun\u2019er, are you alright?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou asked worriedly. But Yi Yun did not say a word.What was that feeling a moment ago?A well-trained Zhao Tiezhu had moved as slow as a tortoise in front of him, making him vulnerable to Yi Yun\u2019s killing intent.If it wasn\u2019t because Zhao Tiezhu suddenly got Alzheimer\u2019s\u2026 could it be that his own speed had increased?Could it be\u2026 my body?\u201cSis Xiaorou, what male tier am I again?\u201d Yi Yun seemed to have realized something and impatiently asked Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cWhy are you asking about this all over sudden? Yun\u2019er, in the past you weren\u2019t even at a tier. Even the weakest tier five male can lift a hundred pounds. Yun\u2019er, you could only lift 30 pounds\u2026\u201d\u201c30 pounds huh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun was speechless, but in the Lian tribe, they had to lift a rock over their heads. 30 pounds was similar to a bag of rice; a weak kid would have trouble lifting that.\u201cWhere are the tribe\u2019s rock weights stored?\u201d Yi Yun asked.\u201cBehind the village, at the training grounds. Why do you ask this Yun\u2019er?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d Yi Yun smiled. \u201cSis, sleep early tonight. We still have to pick herbs tomorrow.\u201dIn the middle of the night, the dark sky was filled with numerous bright constellations.This era didn\u2019t have any streetlights and the poor were unwilling to use their oil lamps. So the entire Lian tribe village was pitch black.The training ground behind the village was a wide field. The members of the warrior preparation camp normally trained here. A dark shadow sneaked into the training grounds, looking around him tonight.\u201cFound it!\u201d Yi Yun was delighted. As Jiang Xiaorou described, there were rows of rock weights arranged on the training grounds.From 20 lbs. to 300 lbs. there were even 500 lbs. millstones and a 1000 lbs. stoneroller.Yi Yun was here today to test his strength! He wanted to know what changes his body had experienced\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 - The Reason for the ChangePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11: The Reason for the ChangeThe training ground was empty. Due to the moisture at night and the cold weather, a layer of dew covered the rock weights speckling them white.All these rock weights were made from green steel. They were not worn down even with the elements bearing down on them for centuries.In this wilderness, people were used pounds, rocks and cauldrons as measurements of a martial artist\u2019s strength.The measurement level of pounds was similar to Earth. A rock was a hundred pounds. A cauldron weighed ten rocks, so it was a thousand pounds!Seeing the place empty, he stood in front of the row of rock weights and chose a 50 lbs. rock weight. He wiped the dew off the rock weight and lowered his body. Rise!The rock was lighter than Yi Yun expected. He could lift it using one hand!Yi Yun was delighted; it was as he guessed!Following that, Yi Yun chose a 100 lbs. rock weight.This time, it was a bit tougher to lift it with one hand. With both hands, it was easy once again.Taking a deep breath, Yi Yun stood in front of a 200 lbs. rock weight. He squatted and with both hands under the rock weight, tightened his muscles and strength came from his hip to his feet.\u201cRise!\u201d Yi Yun gritted his teeth and lifted the 200 lbs. rock weight above his head!\u201cI\u2019ve raised it!\u201d Yi Yun was delighted. He held it up for about 3 minutes before throwing the rock weight on the floor.To be able to lift a 200 lbs. rock weight, which was about three times the weight of a twelve-year-old boy, would be something mind-blowing on Earth.His strength had increased exponentially overnight!And strength wasn\u2019t the only thing; the increase in his speed was even greater!As a child, strength was his main weakness, and was much worse than adults. However, his speed was comparable. Previously when he faced Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s attack, Yi Yun was convinced his speed was at least twice his opponent\u2019s!His body had undergone a tremendous change!Thinking back about his vomiting of black blood and the dirty sweat, it was probably the legendary Marrow Cleansing.His body that had a terribly poor foundation had undergone a tremendous increase both in strength and speed after the Marrow Cleansing!The transformation was without question a result of the Purple Crystal. However, why did the Purple Crystal bring about such a change to his body?Yi Yun tried touching the Purple Crystal by his chest but touched emptiness.\u201cHuh!?\u201d Yi Yun was alarmed, and hurriedly unwrapped his clothes.The Purple Crystal had disappeared\u2026However, that cool feeling by his chest had never decreased one bit.What is this?!Yi Yun lowered his head and lightly touched his chest where his heart would be. He had a strange feeling that the Purple Crystal was there all along, and had never left him.With every heartbeat, the Purple Crystal vibrated, as if the Purple Crystal had merged with his heart as one.That faint coolness also spread throughout Yi Yun\u2019s body with every vibration by meandering through his veins.Yi Yun lifted his head up and saw the tiny dots of starlight in the sky fly towards him, or more accurately, to the Purple Crystal.The starlight entered his body and disappeared.Yi Yun had a couple of hypotheses for the various phenomena the Purple Crystal had exhibited.The Purple Crystal could absorb energy!In this world, in this Universe, energy was the building blocks of everything!From the large spinning galaxies, star formation and supernovae to the small ants building nests or the wilting of grass could not escape the need for energy.From the physics Yi Yun learned on Earth, the entire Universe began from a particular point comprising of infinite energy.Energy could convert into matter, turning into life, turning into everything.And in this strange world, the Qi cultivation of experts was also naturally a form of energy.The Purple Crystal had a natural affinity with energy.It could absorb starlight and other forms of energy. The two attacks by Lian Chengyu was also a form of energy. That form of energy must be a form of \u201cQi\u201d that Lian Chengyu had cultivated.The Qi had hid in his body, causing his whole body to go numb. However, when that energy reached his heart and touched the Purple Crystal, the Purple Crystal absorbed it!It was also obvious where the energy the Purple Crystal absorbed went.That coolness that flowed within his veins was a manifestation of energy. The energy the Purple Crystal absorbed had spread through his blood flow and nourished his body. With every heartbeat, Yi Yun felt his body grow a little stronger.Thinking back of his body\u2019s Marrow Cleansing, it must have been a result of energy entering his veins.Energy could change the composition of every element; it could give life to people, giving them power and strength!His own strength had grown from 30 lbs. to 200 lbs. This change could be considered a total metamorphosis.What energy could have caused this?Just the tiny bit of starlight, or the energy Lian Chengyu had left in his body couldn\u2019t have been enough to cause such a fate-defying change.The answer was undoubtedly those desolate bones!When the rations were being distributed, Lian Chengyu had opened the wooden box holding the desolate bones. Yi Yun had saw many light dots fly from the desolate bones into the Purple Crystal. The Purple Crystal had absorbed them all.Desolate bones were the most precious part of a desolate beast. All its essence were in the bones, and was worth a lot more than desolate beast meat!The essence refined from the desolate bones could cause a warrior to make a breakthrough, and allow a genius like Lian Chengyu to breakthrough to the Purple Blood Warrior level.The value of the desolate bones was unbelievable!A weak kid like Yi Yun without any foundation and a weak body to boot had no reason not to metamorphosize with the tiny amount of energy from the desolate bones.After figuring it out, Yi Yun felt enlightened.He breathed in deeply, and calmed himself down. The Purple Crystal was no doubt a great treasure. It had combined with his body, and with every heartbeat, the Purple Crystal would inject energy through his veins into his body, raising his power!For his power to increase with every heartbeat and cultivating himself with every heartbeat, the Purple Crystal\u2019s effectiveness was fate defying.Even with such a treasure, Yi Yun\u2019s expressions did not betray his tremendous joy.Conversely, Yi Yun\u2019s face grew serious. Having lived through two lives, even though his first life was limited in experience, but with his reincarnation, Yi Yun had already undergone several mental changes.When he first entered this strange world, Yi Yun was confused. But after acclimatizing, he had turned calm.With such a treasure, he couldn\u2019t be too greedy or without any desires. He knew that if he got carried away and flaunted his treasure, it would be possible to be seen through, and lead to trouble!Yi Yun knew that the secret of the Purple Crystal was not to be revealed to anyone.In this strange world, Yi Yun could only trust in his sister, Jiang Xiaorou. However, with one less person knowing, there was one less danger.The treasure had no owner. If Jiang Xiaorou, a weak girl who was easily hurt knew too much, it could cause harm to her.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a huge pot centered amongst them. In it cooked something that smelled delicious!This was the smell of meat!Yi Yun recognized the smell immediately as he had been hungry for days.After the Marrow Cleansing, Yi Yun realized that his appetite was fabulous. All the coarse rice porridge digested cleanly the moment they entered his stomach.Yi Yun understood that as his body got better, its energy appetite got larger.Being a person in the early beginnings of martial training, he didn\u2019t have the ability to absorb the \u201cHeaven-Earth Yuan Qi\u201d. He could only rely on food as his source of energy.But with the pathetic amounts of rice porridge he ate daily, it was utterly inadequate to replenish his energy!Without food, how could he grow stronger?All the elites in the tribe ate desolate beast meat daily. It gave large amounts of high quality energy, and was worlds apart from the whole grain porridge he ate!Yi Yun knew that if he starved himself for prolonged periods, it would cause adverse harm to his body. He was still in his growing years, and only had a tremendous improvement in his body due to having been rejuvenated through the Marrow Cleansing.Just like when a bamboo reaches the jointing stage, if little water were provided, it would be lead to the inability of harvesting it by digging it out. It would cause tremendous trouble!In fact, Yi Yun\u2019s current capabilities could easily allow him admission into the warrior preparation camp, where he could enjoy better treatment. However, if he wanted to obtain everything as a young fledging, the secret of the Purple Crystal might be revealed. His rejuvenation overnight could never be explained.Besides, Yi Yun was not amiable with the warrior preparation camp or Lian Chengyu, so he had no plans to enter the warrior preparation camp.\u201cIt must be wild beast meat. They obtained it by hunting.\u201d\u201dJiang Xiaorou said jealously.Based on this world\u2019s customs, a normal person ate two meals a day. They wouldn\u2019t eat breakfast upon waking up at 5am, but eat at 9am.Only the warriors and the warrior trainees could have three meals a day. They could eat the moment they woke up as they needed the energy for training.Because the members of the warrior preparation camp needed training, they didn\u2019t need to participate in the manufacturing process. They would occasionally go hunting.Due to the danger of the wilderness, these warrior trainees obtained little from their hunts. With the small amount obtained, the food was ate only by themselves, and none would be given the people. The reason being they needed to eat meat for training and to grow strength. For the poor plebeians, all they did were handiwork which didn\u2019t exhaust much energy, so grain would suffice for them.When Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou passed by, the men from the warrior preparation camp saw them. Zhao Tiezhu whistled as he took a piece of meat with the bone attached and munched in front of Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cThis roe deer meat is so fragrant, hahaha!\u201d laughed Zhao Tiezhu with a triumphant expression.The meat was flame roasted with salt and spices, the juices oozed out with a fragrance!Zhao Tiezhu ate messily while licking his lips and fingers, as if he were about to swallow his own tongue.Besides doing that, he sporadically took out a goat hide container and drank from it sparingly.It was alcohol!In the Lian tribe, alcohol was an absolute luxury. With food being scarce, how was it possible to get the grains to make alcohol?The members of the warrior preparation camp could obtain a lot more rations allowing them to use a small portion of the rations to make the alcohol. They used the alcohol to warm their bodies during the winter mornings.Even the remnants from the brewing were not wasted as they would distribute them to the poor. Although the remnants would have turned sour, it was better than starving to death, so the remnants were never wasted.As such, the tribal elders had never objected to the warrior preparation camp from secretly brewing.\u201cHahaha, drinking alcohol and eating meat are great joys in life.\u201dZhao Tiezhu laughed loudly without a care in life.It was only during such times that Zhao Tiezhu enjoyed the joys of life and the benefits of being a member of the warrior preparation camp bestowed upon him.\u201cThese two beggars are really pitiful. Let\u2019s give them some of the leftover broth later.\u201dThe doe deer was roasted, so there was no broth. Jiang Xiaorou knew Zhao Tiezhu was deliberately teasing them. With a grunt, she grabbed Yi Yun\u2019s hand ready to leave. But at this moment, her stomach betrayed her by growling.Because Zhao Tiezhu was further away, he did not hear it, but Yi Yun heard it clearly. Jiang Xiaorou turned red from embarrassment.Yi Yun watched by the sidelines, amused at her cuteness. To Jiang Xiaorou, having her stomach growl was beneath her status as an elder sister.\u201cSis Xiaorou, in the future I\u2019ll get you all sorts of delicacies, letting you eat the most delicious foods in the world!\u201dYi Yun said it seriously while looking into Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s eyes.Jiang Xiaorou was shocked to hear her brother say such words. She brushed it off as child speak, but was happy that Yi Yun was so thoughtful of her.She tenderly touched Yi Yun on the head, and said to him with a baby voice, \u201cSis is waiting!\u201dBeing teased and touched on the head by a little loli, Yi Yun was speechless. But what could he do when he was shorter than the little loli. \u201cSis Xiaorou, do you know about the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom?Based on what Lian Chengyu had said, there would be a Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior selection in three months. Once chosen, the person will undergo a drastic change in status. This was why Lian Chengyu was so desperate cultivating himself, and obtained a piece of desolate bones at all costs.\u201cTai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2026\u201d Xiaorou\u2019s expression wandered into her memories. \u201cTai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s human tribe is an ancient kingdom. It has jurisdiction over 108 states, and 24 wild lands!\u201d\u201cOur present location is among the 24 wild lands, named Cloud Wilderness.\u201d\u201cTai Ah Divine Kingdom is very powerful. There are many experts in the capital. The kingdom\u2019s warriors mostly come from the 108 states. It\u2019s not that the wild lands\u2019 warrior are weak, but because of the low population in the 24 wild lands. Organizing a warrior selection requires a lot of logistics and manpower, so the assessment costs are high.\u201cFor the warrior selection process, the preliminaries will be done by people from the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom to select people from the tribes, or those young warriors would be going to their deaths by crossing the wilderness.\u201cBut this time, the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom choice of doing the warrior selection in the Cloud Wilderness is extremely odd. Regardless, it is a great opportunity for the numerous small tribes in the Cloud Wilderness. Lian Chengyu eyed this opportunity and wants to soar to the top in one go, escaping this poor small village.\u201dWith Jiang Xiaorou slowly explaining, it surprised Yi Yun, \u201cSis, how do you know so much?\u201dJiang Xiaorou\u2019s voice may still sound juvenile, but her insight and verbal ability was nothing like a child\u2019s.\u201cI heard all of this from my birth mother. I have also read quite a lot about strange phenomena when I was young, so I know quite a bit. Yun-er, it looks like you don\u2019t remember a lot of things. I taught you how to read too.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun rubbed his head and smiled sheepishly. Indeed, how could a kid from a poor family read?It was to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s credit that he could read.To be able to read since young, Jiang Xiaorou must have been born with a silver spoon.\u201cSis Xiaorou, Lian Chengyu said that if he were to become a kingdom warrior of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, he would bring the entire tribe into the city, is that true?\u201d\u201cExtremely difficult\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou shook her head. \u201cTai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s warrior selection has many rounds. There\u2019s the preliminaries, semi-finals, many are eliminated each round. Those with exceptional results are bestowed \u2018Kingdom Scholar\u2019. That is an extremely prestigious title. The best among the Kingdom Scholars will be able to enter the kingdom\u2019s capital and enjoy the kingdom\u2019s resources, and learn the \u201cTai Ah Sacred Technique!\u201d\u201cTo bring the entire tribe into the city, not only have one got to pass the semi-finals, one has to have good results. Lian Chengyu might not reach that standard yet. Even if he were to reach that standard in the future, from his personality, it is unlikely he will care about us\u201d\u201cYun-er, why do you ask? You can\u2019t be hoping that Lian Chengyu will become a kingdom warrior and lead us to a good life, right?\u201d\u201cI was just asking.\u201d Yi Yun touched his nose saying. He would be better off wishing that pigs could fly than count on Lian Chengyu.\u201cIf that guy were to come out of isolation and see him alive, he might kill Yi Yun at the first opportunity!Yi Yun was banking that he would already have obtained the ability to protect himself by then. The identity of the destroyer was still up in the air!\u201cIt seems like I could participate in the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s warrior selection, that is definitely a quick way to ensure that the both of us can lead a good life!\u201d\u201cFor that \u2018Tai Ah Sacred Technique\u2019, it has to be some kind of cultivation manual. To practice martial arts in this world, manuals are a must. The Purple Crystal may be magical, but it could only rejuvenate myself. If I don\u2019t enter the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, where would I get a cultivation manual?\u201d Yi Yun made the decision while mumbling to himself.He couldn\u2019t leave the Lian tribe yet for even though his strength had increased, it was still foolhardy to cross the wilderness. He had to enhance himself while in the Lian tribe, pass the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s warrior selection. That was the best choice he had under his circumstances!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 - The Unexpected Outcome of picking HerbsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 13: The Unexpected Outcome of picking HerbsAlthough the Lian tribe was located in the wilderness where living conditions were tough, the tribe owned a herb producing area, and that was the Lian Clan Herb Mountain!The Lian Clan Herb Mountain was an area with a higher density of Yuan Qi, which was conducive for the growing of herbs. It could barely be considered a shrine.Although said to be a shrine, it was only regarded as one by the poor Lian tribal clan. In the eyes of a big tribe, the Lian Clan Herb Mountain would be nothing. After all, in the vast wilderness, there were plenty of places with dense Yuan Qi.A typical large tribe would choose rich wonderlands to settle down. Only such places were rich in production and beneficial for the cultivation of warriors.The most important factor was that the strong desolate and wild beasts avoid these \u201cshrines\u201d for some unknown reason. This was most important as it ensured the safety of the clans.Of course there would be the rare occurrence of an injured or provoked desolate beast that would charge through and destroy a small tribe.Of course everything had both advantages and disadvantages. While keeping out a large number of desolate beasts, the shrine also caused the number of animals in its vicinity to dwindle. Hunting was not an easy task for the rabbits or deer had been hunted clean early on.As such, only Purple Blood Warriors had the ability to go into the vast wilderness to hunt.The shrines in the vast wilderness were a highly sought after resource. The Lian tribe\u2019s herb mountain was considered to be of an extremely low grade, if not, how was the Lian tribe able to hold on to it?Although the herb mountain was of low grade, but to the Lian tribe it was highly treasured for it was the reason the tribe was formed.Every time the villagers were sent up the mountain to pick herbs, they would undergo a rigorous body search to prevent anyone from secretly hoarding herbs.Yi Yun carried the herb basket and walked alongside Jiang Xiaorou. He asked about the martial world\u2019s levels.The lowest level of martial arts was called Mortal Blood, and warriors of the Mortal Blood level were called Mortal Blood Warriors.Mortal Blood did not have a clear boundary for its levels, but was just a general term used by the martial arts community.Mortal Blood came from the fact that they were mortals with normal blood.Mortal Blood Warriors was in truth just normal warriors. Although they practiced martial arts, they were unable to distinguish themselves from other mortals. They could not escape the fact that they were mortals.But Mortal Blood Warrior were much stronger than normal people. They could tear a tiger apart, and run as fast as horses.The realm of Mortal Blood was split into five levels, first level\u2013Valiant, second level\u2013Vigor, third level\u2013Thunderous fourth\u2013Meridians, fifth level-Qi Gatherer.The first level of Valiant was obtained through continuous weight lifting, running, piling, wrestling and nourished with ginseng, antlers, meat and various treasured food. By slowly improving their body\u2019s constitution, their strength and speed would greatly improve!Yi Yun\u2019s current level was considered Valiant. His strength had increased to about 300 lbs, and his speed was twice that of Zhao Tiezhu.Yi Yun would be considered to be much stronger than most Valiant warriors as he was only twelve and his physical fitness was comparable to a fit male.Strictly speaking, Valiant could not even be considered the first step into martial arts.For Mortal Blood level two, Vigor would refer to a martial artist with greatly improved fitness, with extremely long breaths. A well trained Vigor could form an air arrow with one breath. This was known as \u201cBreaths in like a Snake, Out like an Arrow\u201d. It was visually obvious in winter, and an air arrow could shoot as far as 5 feet away piercing through paper!A person at the level of Vigor would have a third of the heartbeat rate of a normal person. But every deliverance of blood had lingering effects. Such a warrior could run as fast as a horse for an hour without panting or an increase in heartbeat rate.Third level Thunderous refers to the body\u2019s perfection of circulation, muscle, fascia and bones. Every part of the body could be perfectly coordinated. One could stay perfectly still and attack like a lion.A Thunderous warrior having perfected his body would emit thunder-sounding sounds from his joints when he exerted strength, giving the level its name.Fourth level Meridians refers to the clearing of the twelve meridians and the conception and governor vessels, with perfect circulation of the meridians. Upon reaching this level, a martial artist could feel the world\u2019s Yuan Qi.Fifth level Qi Gatherer supplements the fourth level\u2019s Meridians. An martial artist can feel the world\u2019s Yuan Qi, and also absorb it into his body.At the peak of Qi Gatherer, the world\u2019s Yuan Qi would transform the body, and rejuvenate a person, resulting in him reaching a brand new state\u2013Purple Blood.Strictly speaking, the Purple Blood level was the true beginnings of martial arts training.When a warrior cultivates his body to a certain stage, his body will undergo changes. The moment he breakthroughs into the Purple Blood Warrior realm, all his blood will become as heavy as mercury. This blood would appear golden purple in the sun.This gives the state it\u2019s name!Warriors entering the realm of Purple Blood were very strong, and could support a small tribe single-handedly. Hence, a Purple Blood Warrior enjoyed an extremely high status in the wilderness.A Purple Blood Warrior would be treated as an emperor in any small-medium tribe. Every member of the tribe would obey his instructions. He had vast control and determined the life and death of the tribe. All the pretty women in the tribe were up to the Purple Blood Warrior\u2019s choice. All these women with the Purple Blood Warrior would also be honored, so even if she was the daughter of the Patriarch, she would gladly climb into his bed.This was unavoidable. Which girl leading a precarious life eating tiny amounts of porridge would not embrace the appearance of hero who could lead her to a better life.In this age, people exalted the strong, especially the females! \u2026\u201cYun-er, I\u2019ll climb up to pick the herbs. I\u2019ll throw them down for you to pick up.\u201dJiang Xiaorou said that as she tried climbing up a cane. The Lian Clan Herb Mountain covered a vast area but was an extremely dangerous mountain!Most of the previous herbs grew on the cliffs, so they were not easy to pick.Climbing the cliffs to pick herbs was an extremely dangerous task. It led to many deaths. Yi Yun had previously fallen to his death.With Yi Yun revived, Jiang Xiaorou was adamant not to let Yi Yun climb the cliff again.Yi Yun insisted on not letting Jiang Xiaorou take the risk. He said, \u201cSis, you pick the herbs at the bottom. Leave the top to me!\u201d\u201cYun-er, stop fooling around! You just recovered. How could you have the energy to climb\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said halfway as she saw Yi Yun grab onto the cane and climbed up nimbly like a monkey.\u201cYun\u2026Yun-er\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou stared as she saw Yi Yun climbed up. He was climbing the vertical cliff as though it was flat ground. When did Yun-er become so agile?Picking herbs off a cliff wasn\u2019t just about climbing high. It also required experience and to be familiar with the herbs and where they most likely grew.For example, some herbs preferred the shade, while others preferred to be in the sun. Some herbs preferred it dry, while others preferred it moist.Yi Yun had caught up on his herbal knowledge the day before, but his knowledge was limited.He was planning on using his agility to make up for his lack of knowledge, but he quickly learned that wasn\u2019t required.Just as Yi Yun reached a height of 8 meters, he saw light dots rising up from a boulder a short distance away.The light dots remained in the air for a few seconds before flying straight into Yi Yun\u2019s chest.Following that, the Purple Crystal\u2019s faint coolness became more vivid, and energy flowed through his veins, making him feel extremely comfortable.Without question, the Purple Crystal was absorbing energy.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dYi Yun climbed over easily and looked under the boulder and saw fiery red fruits the size of his fists!Dan Guo was a low quality Purple Blood realm herb. Looking at its color, it was likely more than twenty year old herbYi Yun was delighted. Just as he wanted to pick it, a light dot flew out from the Dan Guo right into his chest!A few seconds later, a third light dot followed by a fourth.The number of light dots increased. The Dan Guo\u2019s surface had a slight sheen, so without careful examination, it would have been missed.The Purple Crystal could absorb the essence of the Dan Guo!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 - Sucking it all dryPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 14: Sucking it all dry\u201cThis Purple Crystal can even absorb the energy of herbs? Yes! The herbs must contain some \u2018herbal essence\u2019 and it itself must be some form of energy?\u201d\u201cA warrior will become stronger after eating herbs. This is because their body absorbs the herbal essence, transforming it into energy.\u201dYi Yun felt enlightened. He had been doing numerous experiments the past few days. He had used fire, hot water, static electricity from rubbing clothes, objects that Yi Yun felt \u201ccontained energy\u201d. However, the Purple Crystal could not absorb these \u201cenergies\u201d.The known energies the Purple Crystal could absorb were starlight, desolate bones, herbal essence, and the Yuan Qi from Lian Chengyu\u2019s attack.Thinking carefully, these energies, besides the weak starlight, were all highly relevant to this world\u2019s cultivation of martial artists.Maybe even starlight was related to cultivation. This world might even have a cultivation technique that absorbed starlight.As for the desolate bones and herbs, it was needless saying that they were good items that enhanced a martial artist\u2019s body.It seems the Purple Crystal could only absorb energies that aided in martial practice.However, after the Purple Crystal absorbed the herbal essence in the Dan Guo, would the Dan Guo still be useful?It\u2019s probably useless!The Dan Guo still looked perfect, but it was in actual fact, worse than herbal dreg.Yi Yun knew that items like Dan Guo could not be eaten directly. A special procedure had to be done to brew it.And the brewing procedure was only known by the upper echelons of the tribe.Besides the Dan Guo, all the other herbs in the Lian Clan Herb Mountain would be poisonous when eaten. Not only did it lack any benefits, it would be hard to digest, causing a person to bleed to death!If not for that, the Lian tribal clan would not have so easily let the poor pick herbs from the mountain. If they had eaten the herbs for themselves, how would anyone know?However, after the Purple Crystal absorbed the herbal essence from the Dan Guo, it nourished Yi Yun\u2019s body without causing any toxic effect.This was the magical property of the Purple Crystal.It converted chaotic energies into energies simple people could absorb. It could allow Yi Yun to absorb all the herbs on the mountain without anyone knowing!It was totally undetectable!Upon realizing this, Yi Yun could not help laughing.\u201cYun-er what are you laughing about,\u201d shouted Jiang Xiaorou. She was anxious over Yi Yun, worried he would fall. It would be a terrible outcome if he were to fall onto the rocks from such a high height.\u201cSis Xiaorou, look what this is?\u201dYi Yun plucked and threw the Dan Guo which had lost all its essence down.\u201cDan Guo? It\u2019s huge!\u201dJiang Xiaorou was pleased, but felt a sense of sadness. A twenty-year-old Dan Guo may be good, but her brother had no opportunity to use it. It would only be brewed by the old men in the tribe before letting Lian Chengyu soak in it.With mixed emotions, Jiang Xiaorou stored the Dan Guo in the herb basket.Their mission was to pick 8 ozs of herbs per person. The required weight was based on the lowest graded herbs. This twenty-year-old Dan Guo would be considered more. With the good luck they had today, they could keep their rations.It was such a pathetic state. Risking her and her brother\u2019s life to pick herbs, even if they had fate defying luck by picking all sorts of rare herbs, they would all be handed over to others for nothing.\u201cYun-er, just do it adequately. Don\u2019t climb up any further.\u201dJiang Xiaorou shouted worriedly seeing Yi Yun climb more than ten meters high. The herbs won\u2019t for themselves, so it was pointless to risk their lives.Yi Yun pretended not to hear her because he had seen a light float above a tall pine tree nearby. There were herbs there!Yi Yun climbed over easily, with one hand on the branch, he plucked off an umbrella shaped herb from the pine tree\u2019s roots.\u201cBlack Fungus is more valuable than Dan Guo.\u201dYi Yun was delighted, he absorbed without reservations all the energy from the Black Fungus. That hearty feeling was felt once again. Yi Yun knew that the energy from the Black Fungus had entered his heart and traveled to every part of his body, nourishing his muscles. This feeling was so comfortable for Yi Yun.Afterall, Yi Yun had been in a constant state of hunger these past few days.After his Blood Cleansing, Yi Yun felt hungrier than ever before. Yi Yun\u2019s body was in rapid growth and was desperate for energy, but he was not capable enough to hunt alone.Eating large amounts of food could provide the energy, but how could normal food compare to herbs? This Dan Guo and Black Fungus were timely assistance to Yi Yun!Yi Yun noticed that after absorbing the Black Fungus and a few rounds of blood circulation, the herbal property of the Black Fungus had given him plenty of strength and improving his eyesight. He could see the head and six legs of ants about ten meters away.Black Fungus could improve one\u2019s eyesight. Yi Yun wasn\u2019t well versed in pharmacology, but he understood that such low grade herbs did not have such amazing results. The old fogies in the tribe would have to use large quantities of herbs to conjure up the medicine to have any effect.But using the Purple Crystal, the results were immediate and very notable.This Purple Crystal might have increased the effectiveness of the herbs!Yi Yun threw the \u201chigh grade herbal dreg\u201d Black Fungus to Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cBlack Fungus! Yun-er, how could you have such good luck!\u201dJiang Xiaorou felt incredulous. Such a high grade herb might be picked once in the entire day, but Yi Yun managed to pick two. He was too lucky!Yi Yun laughed without responding. With the Purple Crystal, as long as he neared the herbs, he would see light dots rise up, like a lighthouse leading him to them. How could he not pick valuable herbs?At this point, Yi Yun had already climbed more than ten meters high. But after perfectly absorbing two of those herbs, he felt more energetic than usual, and climbing more than ten meters was an easy task.However, Yi Yun didn\u2019t want to be too alarming, and climbed down.He changed locations and carried on picking herbs!Yi Yun strategy of absorbing, picking and finishing the herbs was like a hurricane sweeping through.He discovered that this Lian Clan Herb Mountain was like his own treasure ground.He had been starving for days, and had worried that he didn\u2019t have the strength to cultivate himself. However, this Lian Clan Herb Mountain had solved this big problem of his.Yi Yun climbed up a cliff. This cliff was extremely high, and few could get up there. From Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s angle, she couldn\u2019t see what Yi Yun was doing.\u201cYun-er, be careful!\u201dJiang Xiaorou\u2019s voice came from the bottom of the cliff and was distorted by the mountain winds.\u201cSis Xiaorou, don\u2019t worry, I know myself.\u201dYi Yun was jumping up the rocks easily, even a four meter wall was overcome by Yi Yun with a single kick.In his field of view, he noticed that a baby-fist sized light was emitted from a boulder\u2019s cracks.This light was ten times brighter than any of the light dots Yi Yun had previously seen!\u201cOh? This is!\u201dYi Yun was shocked. To be able to emit such a bright light, the herb within the boulder must be extremely valuable.Yi Yun pushed the boulder away and found a crooked Purple Jade Ginseng. It was well hidden at the top of a cliff few could climb. So it had grown for years without being discovered.This was too good for Yi Yun.Yi Yun made no reservations in sucking the Purple Jade Ginseng\u2019s energy with the Purple Crystal.The Purple Crystal was filled with purple light which gathered within Yi Yun\u2019s body. Yi Yun felt a surge of warmness that spread through his meridians, and heated up his limbs before rising to his head. It made Yi Yun\u2019s five senses more keen and made his limbs feel like they were floating.This feeling was the same as being drunk. Yet, his body was extremely warm. Yi Yun felt like he had infinite energy that needed venting!Yi Yun\u2019s body was itchy and uncomfortable. He looked up and saw a boulder that seemed to weigh 300 lbs. Yi Yun felt as if there were millions of ants crawling on him, so he had to vent.He came to the boulder and lifted it up.Once! Twice! Thrice!After lifting the boulder more than ten times, his body broke out into warm sweat, but felt extremely content.He didn\u2019t feel it was thrilling enough and started carrying the rock to do deep squat jumps. After jumping for twenty times, his feet grew numb. The sweat on him had all evaporated.It feels great!Yi Yun moved his body and all his joints cracked!When a martial artist practiced, he would consume desolate bones, soak his body in herbs to strengthen his mind and body!After strengthening, by supplementing it with daily training, without the resources or willpower, it would be impossible to amount to anything.Yi Yun didn\u2019t touch that Purple Jade Ginseng. Such a high grade herb would cause a commotion. Furthermore, he had already absorbed all its medicinal properties and didn\u2019t want trouble for himself by picking it.A normal person without rest might not be able to pick 8 ozs of herbs, but with the Purple Crystal leading him, and his keen senses, he could see the herbs from far. So in two hours, he had picked the required 16 ozs of herbs for both Jiang Xiaorou and himself.Of course, all the herbs had been sucked dry by the Purple Crystal. Although they looked fine on the surface, they had already became herbal dregs.Yi Yun passed the herb basket to Jiang Xiaorou, ordering her not to hand over the herbs too early to prevent suspicion.\u201cYun-er\u2026how did you do it so fast\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou felt that regardless of anything, her brother had finished picking the herbs at an astonishing speed. \u201c\u201cMy luck was great. Sis Xiaorou, I\u2019ll go down now for something. You just need to be here to act busy. I\u2019m leaving!\u201dSaying that, Yi Yun had tore down the mountain.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instructing them was the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Instructor, Yao Yuan. He was one of the three warriors besides the Patriarch and Lian Chengyu who had reached the fifth level of Mortal Blood.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dThe punches roared into the sky. These members of the warrior preparation camp had been individually groomed arduously by the tribe.It was near winter; it was cold and windy in the vast wilderness, but each and every member of the warrior preparation camp were sweating a river from their practice!Overseeing it up on a platform, Instructor Yao Yuan frowned and shouted \u201cStop!\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s roar was as loud as thunder!The practicing warriors immediately stopped.\u201cLet me teach you the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, it is one of the basic skills handed down by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom!\u201dThis \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 may only consist of eighteen stances, but each stance is filled with deep knowledge! You idiotic pigs only learn the moves, but do not understand the deep underlying knowledge. It\u2019s showy but of no use!\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s words negated all of the hard work the men had spent cultivating themselves!However, no one dared said anything because Yao Yuan had extreme prestige in the warrior preparation camp.Lian Chenyu had high prestige because of his future. He could become a Purple Blood Warrior, or a level even higher than Purple Blood.Yao Yuan had high prestige because of his past.Yao Yuan was not a member of the Lian tribe. He was an outsider who had previously reached the level of Purple Blood. However he had been wounded while being chased by his enemies and fell back into the realm of a normal warrior. He entered the vast wilderness to seek refuge and found it in the Lian tribe where he then stayed for several years.Although he had lost his powers, Yao Yuan still had his experience. No one was unconvinced of his ability to train the warrior preparation camp.That was because Lian Chengyu was trained by Yao Yuan!A youth like Lian Chengyu, having grown up in a small tribe like the Lian tribe, without a master expert\u2019s guidance, would he have been able to attained so much?\u201cDo not look down on this \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. In the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, the most precious would be the \u201cTai Ah Sacred Skill\u201d, but you could only gain access to it after reaching a very high level. It\u2019s of no use for those below Purple Blood! For those below Purple Blood, you have to practice the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019! Even the royal family members of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom do so!\u201d\u201c\u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 is a top skill for training your body. If you want to measure its value, an entire city might not be enough! The Tai Ah Divine Kingdom wanted to strengthen the kingdom\u2019s strength by giving the poor an opportunity to learn martial arts and face the dangers plaguing the vast wilderness. As a result, they deliberately made \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 a public skill.

In this world, nine shi was about 900 pounds!\u201cListening to what Yao Yuan said, this \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 is indeed a very good fist technique. To think that in order to strengthen the kingdom, the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom opened up this basic fist skill to the public. The monarch of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom has some qualities of a sage.\u201dWithout blinking, Yi Yun stared at the training grounds while holding his breath. He was here to secretly learn martial arts!The fist stances Yi Yun had learned prior to tunneling through space-time were military boxing while he was in the military. It could only be considered street brawling and would not do in this strange world. Although his fitness had improved tremendously, without martial arts or techniques, he would be at a disadvantage against a real enemy!Without techniques, his cultivation would be much slower in the future.The problem would be magnified the higher he went. If not, the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s \u2018Tai Ah Sacred Technique\u2019 wouldn\u2019t be so treasured!\u201cI\u2019ll do a demonstration for you first. Look carefully!\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s voice roared as Yi Yun paid close attention.\u201cThis move is called \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019. It\u2019s good for training the tendons!\u201dYao Yuan stood in front of a wooden stake, and stretched his left foot forward. He grabbed his left ankle with his left hand before bending his right knee. With his body curved, his back was bent like a bow, emitting faint sounds.This posture looked very weird, but it gave the impression of a bow being pulled. Yao Yuan\u2019s right fist, by his waist, was just like the arrow on the bow!Suddenly, Yao Yuan moved!His body straightened suddenly.\u201cBam\u2013\u2013\u201dYi Yun heard a very clear loud sound from Yao Yuan\u2019s body.Yao Yuan\u2019s right fist had moved like lightning, hitting the wooden stake!\u201cBoom!\u201dThe wooden stake split apart!The surrounding warrior preparation camp members let out a gasp.\u201cInstructor Yao is amazing!\u201d\u201cDamn, it was such a thick stake, and he split it with a fist. Instructor Yao is teaching the way of the metal fist!\u201dThe bunch of men started to suck up to Yao Yuan, but they were all truly in admiration. In the vast wilderness, the strong was always worshipped.Yao Yuan\u2019s face was furious despite all the fawning he received from the men.\u201cAll you saw was my fist?\u201d\u201cHmph! I said previously, this \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 is a move to train your tendons! The reason my fist destroyed the stake was not because my fist was strong, but because I used the strength in my tendons!\u201d\u201cEveryone\u2019s body is a treasure! Do you know that in the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, there\u2019s a treasured bow named the Star Shooting Bow. Do you know what its bowstring is made of?\u201dThe men were clueless when Yao Yuan asked. Having never heard of the Star Shooting Bow, how would they know what the bowstring was made of?\u201cIs it made of silk?\u201d\u201cIs it the legendary Dragon Ribs?\u201dYao Yuan shaked his head saying, \u201cThe Star Shooting Bow bowstring is made of the tendons of the founding emperor of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom after he died!\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s words left the men dumbfounded.Human tendons as bowstrings!?\u201cThat\u2019s right! The move I just used, \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 was to stretch my entire body out. Using the bones as a bow and tendons as the bowstring, I \u2018shot\u2019 out my fist! Being able to perfectly exert one\u2019s tendon\u2019s strength is the crux of \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019! So \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 is a move used to train one\u2019s tendons, not fist!\u201d\u201cDid you not hear the sounds my body made when I threw out the punch?\u201d\u201dThere was a very clear sound when Yao Yuan punched, \u201cBam\u201dYi Yun heard it very clearly. It was exactly the sound a bowstring produced when an arrow was shot.\u201cFierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u201c is a skill that pulls your tendons, making them stronger and more elastic! At the peak of \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019, just the sound the tendons produce is enough to scare a geese flying in the sky! This is known as \u2018Surprise Bow Drops Flock\u2019!\u201d\u201c\u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 has another move, \u2018Dragon Rising to Nine Skies\u2019, which is a move that trains one\u2019s bones. When this is punched out, the whole skeleton will crack loudly like a lightning-less thunder from a distance!\u201d\u201cThunder Occurring in the Nine Clouds, Surprise Bow Drops Flock. If you reach this realm, you can be considered to have mastered \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019!\u201dAfter hearing Yao Yuan\u2019s words, the men stared agape. It had to be an exaggeration!Could a person reach such a realm?Seeing the men\u2019s expressions, Yao Yuan knew it was hopeless.He carried on, \u201cThe realm of Thunder Occurring in the Nine Clouds, Surprise Bow Drops Flock can be quite a challenge for all of you. I do not expect that you will reach that realm, but if you were to cultivate your tendons to sound out like a bowstring, no matter how tiny; to cultivate your bones to create the skeleton cracking sounds, I would be satisfied!\u201d\u201cIn that case, you will have at least reached the third level, Thunderous.\u201dAs Yao Yuan was teaching the men, Yi Yun\u2019s blood was sent pulsing through his veins as he heard this.Thunder Occurring in the Nine Clouds, Surprise Bow Drops Flock!Could he reach such a state?Yao Yuan described the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 as something so valuable that \u201can entire city might not be enough\u201d. A city in this strange world was worth more than the cities on Earth. Each city in the vast wilderness had to withstand the test of the desolate beasts. Without many experts, it would not be possible to hold it down. To build a city, countless amounts of blood had to flow!It was obvious considering how many of the poor people who supported Lian Chengyu\u2019s cultivation just from his simple promise of the city.\u201cI must observe this set of fist techniques well. If I were to learn it well, it would be a breeze during the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior selection. I might even be able to get the title of \u2018Kingdom Knight\u2019. When that happens, Sis Xiaorou will bask in glory together with me!\u201dHaving come to this world, Yi Yun decided to make the best of it.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Leave some soup for Lian ChengyuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: Leave some soup for Lian Chengyu\u201cHand in your herbs! Hand in your herbs!\u201dAs it grew dark, Zhao Tiezhu started shouting at the village entrance.Five members from the warrior preparation camp had set up a long table. On the table sat five circular pans.These pans were woven from bamboo, and was usually used for sunning dates or herbs.Three of the five pans were already filled.People lined up to hand in the herbs they picked. A long-bearded elder identified each herb\u2019s age and rarity. He used a small scale to weigh the herbs before recording it down.When it was Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s turn, Yi Yun slowly handed his harvest over.The bearded old man took a look and his eyes lit up, \u201cDan Guo! Black Fungus! Liquorice root! Wild Ginseng! These are good herbs!\u201dThe elder looked at these expensive herbs as if they were his babies, and started stroking them the moment they entered his hands.Yi Yun stood by the side and heaved a sigh of relief. This old man may be a herb expert, but he was unable to tell that the herbal essence had long been sucked dry by the Purple Crystal.This was understandable. The herbs that were sucked dry by the Purple Crystal did not look any different from a recently picked herb.\u201cHehe, kid you sure got lucky. You can keep your rations today!\u201dZhao Tiezhu was very pleased seeing the herbs.They were in charge of collecting the herbs, and they would received rewards from Lian Chengyu if the quality was high!When Lian Chengyu began his meteoric rise in the future, his lackeys would have something to gain. He could enter the big city, and might even get a job in the city!\u201cI recognized that you were a suitable medicine boy, with the natural talent to pick herbs. For me to send you picking herbs was due to my foresight, matching you to your best potential!\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t die the last time has improved your herb picking skills. According to this standard, hand in another ounce of herbs tomorrow!\u201dAs Zhao Tiezhu said that, he casually smiled.\u201cWhat!?\u201dJiang Xiaorou was enraged. Picking 16 oz of herbs was already extremely difficult, yet Zhao Tiezhu added more!Jiang Xiaorou knew Yi Yun\u2019s herb picking speed was fast, and a tiny bit more would not matter to him. But knowing Zhao Tiezhu, it would be to \u201cgive them an inch, and they\u2019ll take a yard\u201d. An accident will eventually happen!\u201cWarrior Zhao, you must be joking. These herbs were picked extremely arduously from my hard work all day. It\u2019s my all.\u201dYi Yun\u2019s intonation was extremely slow. As he moved his lips, his eyes were glancing at the three pans filled with herbs.A layer of light dots had begun floating on the surface of the three pans.These light dots were obviously drawn out by the Purple Crystal. They were like fireflies in the night, and floated slowly to Yi Yun.A unnoticeable smile suffused on Yi Yun\u2019s face. The Purple Crystal needed some time to absorb the herbal essence. Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s bullsh*t was to Yi Yun\u2019s delight.\u201cDamn it You think I\u2019m negotiating with you!?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu slammed the table, giving the bearded old man a shock.\u201cYou cheap folk only know how to eat. It\u2019s rare that there\u2019s something you trash could be used for, and here you are coming up with all sorts of excuses! The Lian tribe doesn\u2019t rear freeloaders. The people either be warriors, or do honest labor work! Hand over one more ounce of herbs tomorrow. Scram!\u201dBeing scolded in the face by Zhao Tiezhu, Yi Yun\u2019s face scrunched up and his body froze.The people around him understood that for a twelve year old child to be scolded so harshly in public, it would be an extreme blow for Yi Yun.Zhao Tiezhu saw Yi Yun\u2019s face turn white. He wanted to tease further.Jiang Xiaorou could not bear it anymore before pulling Yi Yun away. However, Yi Yun\u2019s feet were rooted in the ground and was immovable. It was as if he had turned to stone from Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s harsh words.\u201cI\u2019m almost done absorbing\u2026If I were to absorb anymore, Lian Chengyu will be suspicious.\u201dYi Yun was unfazed by Zhao Tiezhu. He was treating his words as a mad dog\u2019s barking. He was only concentrating on how much herbal essence he should absorb.Absorbing about 80% would do. I need to leave some soup for Lian Chengyu. Even a fool would be able to spot something amiss if such a large amount of herbs lacked any herbal essence.Yi Yun could not go into conflict with the upper echelons of the Lian tribal clan. He may be able to get rid of Zhao Tiezhu, but he was still no match for people like the Patriarch or Lian Chengyu.The herbal essence absorbed by the Purple Crystal quickly entered his bloodstream, circulating through Yi Yun\u2019s body. It made him feel his a warmness in his channels. His body grew warmer and his face turned pinkish.Yi Yun felt his body light with euphoria.Yi Yun\u2019s appearance looked pathetic to the crowd. His face was red, and his limbs were limp. It must have been a result of Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s reprimanding.\u201cPoor kid. He\u2019s so young. He\u2019s being singled out because he opposed Zhao Tiezhu on the day of the ration distributions\u201d\u201cThis kid sure has a bitter life. His mother died shortly after they arrived in the Lian tribe. He\u2019s weak and prone to illnesses. He has no strength, he won\u2019t be able to resist Zhao Tiezhu.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up with the people from the warrior preparation camp using the village. You guys think Young master Lian Chengyu will really bring us into the city?\u201d\u201cShh, don\u2019t speak nonsense. If the people from the warrior preparation camp hear it, you\u2019ll be in sh*t luck!\u201d\u201cI think this kid will get fixed to death sooner or later\u2026\u201dIt was common for people to fall to their deaths when picking herbs up in the mountains. The more expensive a herb, the higher it was. Yi Yun must have climbed up high, risking his life to hand over such high grade herbs. He was doomed to fall to his death going forward.But so what if someone died in the Lian tribal clan? The lives of the people here were worthless.\u2026Late at night, the moon hung in the sky like a silver hook.In the Lian Patriarch\u2019s drug room, a few men were fanning the flames made from a large pile of timber under a big pot.A few old men from the drug room were carefully arranging the herbs. They began brewing the herbal medicine made of several combinations of herbs and supplementary drugs.The supplement drugs and heat were confidentially passed down in the Lian tribal clan. It was not to be known to the commoners. For if they knew how, they could secretly pick herbs and brew it for themselves.The upper echelons of the Lian tribal clan felt that using herbs on the commoners was the same as using good grain to feed the pigs. It was useless.Even the members of the warrior preparation camp did not have a chance to soak their body in herbs.The herbal stew that was carefully brewed was specially for Lian Chengyu.\u201cGood! Good! You did well this time. There were several good herbs collected!The Patriarch was very satisfied after looking at the herb roster.\u201cThis is expected of little me,\u201d said Zhao Tiezhu nodded with a fawning smile. \u201cIt was ordered by the Patriarch and it concerns the future of Young master Lian, little me would never dare to fail to comply. The moment I left the training grounds, little me ran to the herb mountain to supervise the picking of herbs. Even the cowardly ones had to climb up the cliffs. As such we had good luck finding the Black Fungus and Dan Guo.\u201dZhao Tiezhu took all the credit from Yi Yun.\u201cNot bad! You worked hard. Go to the warehouse and collect a pound of meat,\u201d the Patriarch patted Zhao Tiezhu on his shoulders.\u201cThank you Patriarch!\u201d said Zhao Tiezhu happily.\u201cYes, do well. When Chengyu becomes a kingdom warrior, he will be in need of errand runners. If you are wise, you can get the appreciation of Chengyu. If you can be by his side, when Chengyu soars, you will definitely reap some of the benefits.\u201d\u201cThank you Patriarch for his kind words!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu knelt down kowtowing. He was inexplicably excited.That kid Yi Yun was his lucky star. He didn\u2019t expect that little minion to be that good at picking herbs. In the future, he\u2019ll give him benefits like a tiny bit of herbal dreg and some rations. That poor kid will be so thankful receiving that tiny amount and will do everything as his slave horse!Zhao Tiezhu walked off as he dreamed of his bright future, commanding the masses in the big city.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Tendons like bowstringsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17: Tendons like bowstringsWhile the Lian tribal clan was brewing the herbal medicine, Yi Yun had secretly came to the back of the Lian Clan Herb Mountain.Facing the moonlight, Yi Yun stood on a boulder like a pine tree.Yi Yun had previously used the opportunity to absorb large amounts of herbal essence using the Purple Crystal when Zhao Tiezhu was collecting the herbs.Now the herbal essence was surging through his body like a fire storm!The best way to absorb the herbal essence was to cultivate himself. During the cultivation process, he would digest the herbal essence and train up his body!Yi Yun slowly straightened his left foot, with his left hand grabbing his left ankle. With his right knee bent, his body bent like a bow.This was the \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 stance. Yi Yun had secretly learned the first six stances of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. He gestured it accurately.\u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 crux was to tighten the body\u2019s tendons. Yi Yun kept pulling his body till it hurt before punching with a roar!\u201cKa-cha!\u201dYi Yun had punched through a small tree in front of him!However such a result was not satisfactory for Yi Yi Yun. He didn\u2019t want the power from the fist, but to be able to push his tendons to their maximum.In the five levels of Mortal Blood, the first three levels, Valiant, Vigor and Thunderous were simply a measure of the martial artist\u2019s body conditions. Through continuous training of the flesh, organs and bones, the body\u2019s hidden potential will be revealed, resulting in the realm of Vigor and Thunderous. It was all a natural process and not something one could aim for.Yi Yun understood that by mastering \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, he would have no problems reaching the fifth level of Mortal Blood. Because based on what Yao Yuan said, \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was a basic technique that even a Purple Blood realm person could employ to great effect.\u201cKa-cha!\u201dA clear snap. Yi Yun broke a thin pinetree with the thickness of a fully grown leg. His fists were bruised, but it didn\u2019t matter. The herbal essence that the Purple Crystal absorbed were gathering in Yi Yun\u2019s body, slowly spreading, becoming part of Yi Yun\u2019s strength.Yi Yun loosened his fists before clenching his fists again!Yi Yun practiced \u201cThe Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u201d stance for the umpteenth time. Yi Yun\u2019s muscles was like a young tree sprout being watered, growing and thriving.Yi Yun had trained from midnight to daybreak!Despite the intense training, the Purple Crystal which had absorbed large amounts of herbal essence supplemented Yi Yun with the energy, causing him to be radiant and awake.Yi Yun gave his all for every \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 stance. His tendons were pulled to their extremes every time!Such intense training was also tough for Yi Yun.His body was sore. Besides the soreness, his body had already expended all the herbal essence he had previously absorbed. The essence had blended into Yi Yun\u2019s flesh and blood. Yi Yun\u2019s tendons were repeatedly pulled, slowly making them more resilient.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dYi Yun did not know how many punches he had thrown. Because it was physically demanding, Yi Yun\u2019s sight became blurry. His perception deteriorated but the pain from his punches and the pulsing feeling from the pull of tendons were extremely clear!Yi Yun entered a wonderful state. It was without distractions, a state of semi-consciousness.He had forgotten everything. The only thing he could remember was his body\u2019s tendons. Imperceptibly, Yi Yun had formed a mind map of his tendons and muscles. It was a magical feeling.In this state of selfless training, Yi Yun could \u2018see\u2019 his meridians.Sweat rained down and his fists bled.The sweat had misted his eyes. He heard the faint whistling of the wind. Yi Yun only felt an intense pressure in front of him.In that second, Yi Yun managed to conjure a strength of unknown origins. He roared as his tendons were pulled to their extremes before shooting out a punch!\u201cPeng!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s practice had uprooted the pine tree, scattering the wood!Amidst the flying sawdust, Yi Yun\u2019s body had clearly made a soft \u2018Peng!\u2019 sound.Although it wasn\u2019t loud, it was extremely crisp. Just like the twang of a bowstring, it was especially clear in the wide open night sky.Tendons like bowstrings. So this is tendons like bowstrings\u2026Yi Yun fell onto the ground staring at the sky with his arms wide open.That last punch had used up all of his energy!Yi Yun breathed in deeply. His right fist was mangled red with blood, but the pain made him even more excited!He knew that he had made small progress towards his \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019!This night was the first time he practiced martial arts in his life. He was practicing the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s top technique\u2013\u2019Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. The \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 move was something only a person with Mortal Blood level three, Thunderous could create the twang of a bowstring using his tendons.But Yi Yun managed to do it. Although it was soft, he was after all still in the realm of Valiant. He was also only twelve, his bones and muscles were incomparable to an adult\u2019s.The results were not something any member of the warrior preparation camp could match. He had even exceeded the Lian Chengyu\u2019s Valiant level from the past.\u2026Yi Yun did not have a night\u2019s sleep, but so did the old man responsible for brewing the herbs in the Lian tribe drug room!The pot of herbs had been brewed an entire night. Even the stones propping the pot up were red hot.At dawn, a few strong men came to pour out a large amount of black liquid from the pot.This was the entire pot\u2019s essence.\u201cHmm\u2026these herbs are the best this time. We could still brew it another three times or so. Although it will be less effective, it\u2019s still extremely precious. You guys can use it to shower. The herbal dregs will be left for the commoners. It will be needed when the desolate bones are refined!\u201dThe Lian tribal clan\u2019s imperfect brewing techniques could only obtain 20% of the herbs\u2019 essence. This was their limit.And Lian Chengyu could only absorb half of the herbal essence obtained by the tribe through soaking.Which is to say, Lian Chengyu could only absorb 10% of the herbal essence.The ratio may sound low, but it was understandable. A normal person was unable to absorb a large percentage of the food they ate, not to mention for herbs that were a hundred times harder to absorb.The bucket of black herbal liquid was sent into Lian Chengyu\u2019s isolation chamber.Lian Chengyu had already heard that valuable herbs like Dan Guo, wild ginseng, Black Fungus and licorice were in that pot of herbs!Lian Chengyu\u2019s cultivation had reached to the point of breakthrough. He was most in need of the herbs to enrich himself.\u201cGood! Good! It came just in time!\u201dLian Chengyu looked at the black herbal liquid with a face full of excitement.He disrobed and jumped into the hot liquid naked.The temperature was above ninety degree celsius, sufficient to cook any meat. Even a Mortal Blood fifth level like Lian Chengyu felt pain all over his body.But this temperature was the optimal temperature for absorbing the herbal essence. Such hot water could open up the pores and let the herbal liquid enter the warrior\u2019s body through his pores.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yet it was extremely painful, but thinking that he could one day enter the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom to learn the \u2018Tai Ah Sacred Technique\u2019 and become someone who lorded over the people, Lian Chengyu endured it further!Lian Chengyu\u2019s willpower to become stronger was matchless.A person with weaker willpower would have taken advantage of his status as a young master of the tribe to eat well and partake in debauchery. At best, he would be a distinguished young master, but he would have never reached a similar stature Lian Chengyu possessed.\u201cYoung master Lian has great will!\u201d\u201cYoung master Lian is like an iron man!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not possible for a normal person to soak in this boiling herbal liquid! Young master Lian is a dragon among the people!\u201dSeeing Lian Chengyu being boiled red like a lobster in the herbal liquid, the surrounding lackeys including Zhao Tiezhu started sucking up.The way they spoke was unlike them for they usually used foul language. However, to suck up, they purposely chose to use big adjectives.\u201cMake the fire bigger!\u201d Lian Chengyu shouted while gritting his teeth. It was extremely painful immersed in ninety degree Celsius liquid. Veins protruded on Lian Chengyu\u2019s forehead. His body was covered with red skin, stretching and curling.Under such a condition, if one were to label Lian Chengyu as a \u201cdragon among the people\u201d, he was at best be related to a lobster (lobster in Chinese is literally dragon shrimp).He was indeed at his limits, but the effects of the herbal liquid were weaker than he expected! How could that be?\u201cMake the fire bigger?\u201d The lackeys looked each other in the eye, full of admiration of Lian Chengyu.\u201cF**k! Young master Lian said to make the fire bigger, what are you idling for? Why? Do you think Young master Lian cannot bear it? Young master Lian\u2019s willpower and ability is not something you can fathom!\u201dZhao Tiezhu was more senior, so he gave his subordinates a lesson.After reprimanding them, he moved the large pile of timber into the stove himself. The fire cracked as the flames grew bigger..Seeing Lian Chengyu reaching a key moment in his cultivation progress, Zhao Tiezhu purposely took a large fan to fan at the flames.The fire was so large that the flames were about to burn Lian Chengyu\u2019s hair.\u201cYoung master Lian, do you feel good?\u201d smiled Zhao Tiezhu excitedly.Lian Chengyu could no longer say a word. He had gritted his teeth so tight to the point of his teeth chipping. Besides his tightly clenched fists, his skin was boiled to the point of cracking. Yet, he did not obtain the desired effect.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lian Chengyu thought angrily. Under Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s special treatment, his body was about to melt.Human skin would shrink under high heat to the point of cracking. This phenomenon was appearing on Lian Chengyu\u2019s body!But Lian Chengyu couldn\u2019t care less. He was considering the scary possibility in the deep recesses of his mind. It was a fear that choked him.Having reached such a high level of training and being one step away from the Purple Blood realm, Lian Chengyu was very sensitive to every development in his body.He knew that he was immersed in a pot of high-grade herbs but his heartbeat rate had not increased. His body had been polished, but the results were not evident.\u3002He could not absorb much from a tank filled with good herbs!Lian Chengyu had realized that he might have reached the point of a \u201cbottleneck\u201d!Lian Chengyu had heard from his master, Yao Yuan that when martial artists practiced martial arts, they were prone to hit bottlenecks, especially when they were about to breakthrough to a new level. Some people could be stuck with their bottlenecks for life!The martial way was without end. In the long path of practicing the arts, one had to continuously breakthrough to new realms. A bottleneck would eventually happen, but Lian Chengyu could never believe that he faced his first bottleneck when breaking through to the Purple Blood realm.He could not accept it!He was a favoured child of the Heavens, a golden dragon trapped in shallow waters. He just needed a tiny amount of stimulus to soar into the sky!How could a mere Purple Blood realm be his bottleneck! !He couldn\u2019t believe it!\u201cMore fire!\u201d Lian Chengyu was struggling with all his might as he shouted angrily.\u201cMore\u2026even more fire?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu began to feel something was amiss. He saw the skin on Lian Chengyu\u2019s arms and legs split apart. He shouldn\u2019t need to be cooked to such a state.\u201cYoung\u2026Young master, if you cook any further\u2026it will be overcooked\u2026\u201d the bunch of lackeys hesitantly said.\u201cI want more fire!\u201d Lian Chengyu roared as loud as an angered lion.Zhao Tiezhu could only obey by fanning the flames with his subordinates.The flames grew stronger. The herbs in the liquid bubbled. The pot of herbs had boiled!Even Lian Chengyu had trouble staying within the boiling water. Besides, his body had not been able to absorb much of the herbal essence. He finally roared with his Yuan Qi exploding out of his body.\u201cBoom!\u201d The herb tank exploded, scattering the burning hot liquid!\u201cOuch!\u201dThe surround lackeys immediately screamed in pain from the scalding.Thankfully they were all clothed. Although it was scalding hot despite landing on their clothes, the temperature had already decreased tremendously. Besides, they had thick skin to endure the burns.It was too f**king hot.However, these lackeys were masters at sucking up. They knew that Lian Chengyu would become a warrior of the kingdom, and could the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom knight one day. If they sucked up to Lian Chengyu, they would have a thriving future.Hence, including Zhao Tiezhu, several lackeys ignored their burns and prostrated on the ground shouting, \u201cCongratulations to Young master Lian for his mastery!\u201dThe scene of Lian Chengyu exploding the herb tank was impressive. Zhao Tiezhu and the others misunderstood it as Lian Chengyu having broken through. They didn\u2019t waste time sucking up!But\u2026the jolly laughter of Lian Chengyu and him awarding them did not happen. On the contrary, Lian Chengyu\u2019s body was all red. His flesh had already cracked, making him look extremely ferocious.\u201cScram!\u201d An extremely angry Lian Chengyu kicked Zhao Tiezhu and the other lackeys, sending them tumbling.Zhao Tiezhu was dumbfounded from the kick. He did not dare make a sound even though his butt hurt tremendously. He had no clue what had happened.\u201cAll of you scram!\u201d Lian Chengyu shouted loudly. The lackeys were scared stiff and hurriedly ran off.Suddenly Lian Chengyu raised his hand, \u201cCome back!\u201dLian Chengyu\u2019s gaze was cold, \u201cShow me the herbal dregs!\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201dThe lackeys did not mutter a word. They scrambled away and brought back the herbal dregs without a word.Lian Chengyu rummaged through the herb dregs, and questioned the brewing process. His face turned increasingly ugly.There was no problem with the herbal dregs. There were plenty of good herbs used in it. In fact, even a physician from a large tribe would not be able to tell. Who could have thought that someone had the ability to absorb all of the herbal essence without the secret process of brewing?After seeing the herbal dregs, Lian Chengyu confirmed that he had met his bottleneck!\u201cDamn it!\u201d Lian Chengyu smashed his fist into the wall!He had shown talent in martial arts since young. Yao Yuan had previously said that he would be among the best even in a large tribe.The problem wasn\u2019t because of his body; it was because of this Lian tribal clan!\u201cThe herbs the tribe gave me were too weak! The talented young in the large tribal clans soak in herbs from young. They eat desolate bones for meals. How could I compare with them!\u201dLian Chengyu gripped his fists. He hated, he hated that he was not born in a rich family, but in this desolate place.\u201cThis poor Lian tribal clan has obstructed and delayed me seventeen years of my time! If I were born in the royal family of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, I would have longed reached the Purple Blood realm, or an even higher realm\u2026and might even vie for the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s royal throne!\u201dHaving thought this, he could no longer stand by the Lian tribal clan. He hated the Lian tribal clan; all of the resources of the Lian tribal clan were not enough for his grooming!Why couldn\u2019t I be born in the imperial family?Why couldn\u2019t I enjoy all of that!Their starting point was somewhere my Lian clan could not even see! Yet, I was climbing up like a dog! I hate it!\u201cCome!\u201d Lian Chengyu shouted. Zhao Tiezhu didn\u2019t dare to be any slower and ran towards Lian Chengyu without a sound.\u201cPass my order. Set up the cauldron, and gather the fit men in the village to begin refining the desolate bones!\u201dZhao Tiezhu\u2019s heart jumped. It was finally beginning. It was supposed to be a couple days later. \u201cAbout the herbs\u2026\u201d\u201cKeep picking!\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s voice was indifferent. The Lian Clan Herb Mountain was the most valuable possession of the Lian tribal clan, and the picking of herbs was always regulated to prevent over-harvesting.But now, Lian Chengyu was prepared to leave the Lian tribal clan in a few months. The Lian Clan Herb Mountain was no longer of value to him, so he was willing to squeeze everything from it.Being stifled by the bottleneck, the herbs did little for him, but it was better than nothing.As for the desolate bones\u2026now was the time for the desolate bones to aid him in breaking through the bottleneck\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - VigorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19: VigorA human sized cauldron was set up on the Lian tribal clan grain-sunning ground. The large cauldron was filled with Li Fire water.This Li Fire water was also bought from the big tribes and contained the power of fire within itself. It could reach a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius without boiling. It was specially used for refining desolate bones.The firewood that was stacked under the large cauldron was special. It was purple firewood. Its appearance was curvy; each log was like a dried old snake.Although the purple firewood didn\u2019t look impressive, they were considered expensive. The purple firewood contained a special fire in it. Lit purple firewood could burn an entire day, boiling several big pots of fire.The Lian tribal clan had prepared a long time for this day. Even so, they were reluctant to use the purple firewood. They only used one log a day.With that, the fire began burning.The purple firewood spewed deep purple flames, but was very silent. The temperature of the flames were extremely high, enough to melt rock!Under the purple flames, the cauldron of Li Fire water started boiling!Presiding over the refinement of the desolate bones was the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch, who was Lian Chengyu\u2019s grandfather. Since it was a matter of great importance, he decided to do it personally.\u201cLower the desolate bones!\u201d The Patriarch ordered as the water reached a suitable temperature.A few stout villagers carried a large wooden box, raised the desolate bones before dropping it into the large cauldron!The Patriarch looked at the bubbles in the cauldron with a heavy face.Normally, the refinement of desolate bones was not something normal people could do.People who specialized in refining desolate bones were known as Desolate Heaven Masters! A Desolate Heaven Master\u2019s standing was of the highest honours!They had the ability to purify the essence in the desolate bones, refining what many martial artists dreamed and vied for\u2013desolate bones relic.A common skeletal set of desolate bones was about ten thousand pounds. So although it was known that tremendous energy were stored in the bones, humans were still unable to consume the large amount of bones. Even if they did, it was hard to digest!The energy within the desolate bones was not easily absorbed. Even consuming a large amount of desolate bones would have less than ten per cent efficiency.But after the refinement from a Desolate Heaven Master into a desolate bone relic, it would be as small as a longan, or even as small as a bean. A rich person could easily eat seven to eight of those a day.After being refined by a Desolate Heaven Master, the essence was easily absorbed. As long as a martial artist had reached a certain level, which would prevent his body from exploding from an overflow, then he would be able to digest a desolate bone relic eventually.A Desolate Heaven Master who could refine high-level desolate beasts was a huge asset major powers scrambled to vie for!Rumours said that the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s National Tutor was a Desolate Heaven Master. The status and prestige he enjoyed was nothing an ordinary person could imagine.In this world, there were several levels of desolate beasts. Some desolate beasts could turn over the seven seas, cut through mountains. These desolate beasts\u2019 bones were even harder to refine, impossible for a normal person!It was rumoured that a Desolate Heaven Master who had reached an unimaginable realm had set up a huge array to refine the bones of an ancient desolate beast\u2013Purple Gold Chimera that took him twelve years!To refine a set of desolate bones for twelve years, coupled with the mysterious identity of the person made the legend even more charming.It was said that the refinement caused a region with radius of a thousand miles to turn into a desert. Even the Desolate Heaven Master had paid a price to refine the desolate bones relic.It was unknown what the Purple Gold Chimera\u2019s relic was used for. Rumours were abounded; some said it was used for saving someone.As for whom it was used for, there were dozens of versions. Each version had its own speculations, such as the Desolate Heaven Master\u2019s daughter, his lover, his disciple, etc.Such rumours only solidified the status of a Desolate Heaven Master in their minds. It was the reason why the legends were passed down with embellished details.It was understandable since it was extremely hard for the people to survive in the vast wilderness. To be able to worship such experts, even if they didn\u2019t know them, was extremely exciting just from the legends.As for the Lian tribal clan, a small ant-like tribe could never hire a Desolate Heaven Master. Even the lowest level Desolate Heaven Master was someone they didn\u2019t dare to look at.As such they could only use primitive methods to refine the desolate bones.Thankfully, the price of the desolate bones they were refining was low. Even primitive methods could gather about 50-60% of the desolate bones essence.This was enough for Lian Chengyu.The refinement of the desolate bones proceeded day and night without stopping.Especially at night, one could see the mysterious bright purple light from the purple firewood from an unobstructed spot in the village.While the Lian tribal clan was busy refining the desolate bones, Yi Yun was not sitting idle. He was training day and night.Few people visited the back mountain of the Lian tribal clan, so it was the ideal place for Yi Yun to cultivate himself.It was already the fifth day Yi Yun practiced the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.\u201cPeng!\u201d\u201cPeng!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s served out punches after punches. Each punch was accompanied by a bowstring twang, like a pulse.Yi Yun destroyed tree after tree. Yi Yun\u2019s blood was circulating fast as he breathed in deeply. The blood vessels on his arms and fists protruded out.\u201cHa!\u201d Yi Yun roared and sent a punch to a boulder in front of him.\u201cKa-cha!\u201dThe boulder disintegrated. Yi Yun\u2019s tendons had reached its peak performance!\u201cSu Su Su!\u201dThe birds in the forest scattered into the sky from the commotion.As they flew off in a hurry, leaves that were loosened by the birds swayed down onto Yi Yun\u2019s face.Yi Yun had a hearty feel. It was as if all the energy in his body had moved through his body. It was inexplicably refreshing!Although he had not reached the stage of Surprise Bow Drops Flock with the Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019s eighteen stances, but to scare the birds from the trees was considerable progress.Yi Yun\u2019s strength was still insufficient. He could only do about six hundred pounds. If he were to reach the strength of several cauldrons, or even ten thousand pounds, then surprising the geese flock in the sky would not be impossible!Although he only had 600 lbs of strength, Yi Yun\u2019s Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain when hit out was much more than 600 lbs!Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain, with the tendons as bowstring main crux was to store the potential energy before shooting out a punch. Such a punch would be a thousand pounds in strength, more than capable to break a tiger\u2019s head.Yi Yun closed his eyes satisfactory. He felt the energy that had moved through his body, giving him that immense comfort.Unknowingly, Yi Yun\u2019s breathing started to become extremely long and gentle. The speed of the blood flow in his body also began to exhibit changes.Oh, this is\u2026Yi Yun looked at both his hands. The protruded blood vessels had disappeared, while his breathing had become calm, his heart beat rate was much slower.Yi Yun realized something and leaping onto his feet, he took a deep breath before spitting it out.\u201cWhew!\u201dA white gas flew forward like an arrow for a distance of six meters. A falling leave was pierced before it spun out flying.\u201cVigor realm!\u201d I\u2019ve finally entered the realm of Vigor!\u201dA Vigor warrior took long breaths, had slow but strong heartbeats. The big difference from a Valiant warrior was a Vigor warrior\u2019s endurance He could carry on battling for a long time and could do long distance strikes.For example, a squadron of Vigor warriors could travel hundreds of miles a day on the battlefield, completing a surprise attack from a thousand miles.It was a natural breakthrough to the Vigor realm as Yi Yun\u2019s body had reached a certain level of training.\u201cHaving come to this world, I\u2019ve only really practiced martial arts for five days. I reached the second level of Mortal Blood in five days. This Mortal Blood realm is after all a martial artist\u2019s basic stage. The future levels are unknown. Also the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s experts, what levels are they?\u201dWith the Purple Card, the energy required for cultivating himself was not a problem. The problem lied in the need for a cultivation technique.If he didn\u2019t have a technique to guide his cultivation, he would be like a chef with a bunch of good ingredients, but without any cooking skills. He would still not be able to cook up a good meal.\u201cSince I\u2019ve entered the Vigor realm, let\u2019s try the third stance of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.\u201dYi Yun said to himself as he saw the eastern sky turn white. Seeing that, he raced down the hill.On the way, he passed by the grain-sunning ground. He slowed down his footsteps.Under the thousand pound cauldron burned the purple fire violently. In a twenty meter radius was a tall wooden fence, preventing any unrelated persons from closing in.Because of the wooden fence, Yi Yun was not sure of the situation inside. However, he could feel the extreme heat of the fire from afar.However despite the layers of heat, Yi Yun felt a vague chill residing in it.Although the chill was not obvious, it was excruciating\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - Yi Yun\u2019s suspicionsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20: Yi Yun\u2019s suspicionsIn the past two days, Yi Yun had been dedicating himself to practicing. Because of his injuries, both his hands were bandaged.Yi Yun frequently sneaked out in the middle of the night, and this did not escape Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cYun-er, what have you been doing these past few days? Also, what\u2019s wrong with your hands?\u201dEver since Yi Yun\u2019s mother passed away, Jiang Xiaorou had taken up the responsibility of being Yi Yun\u2019s mother, taking care of him in every possible way.Even when Yi Yun made a mistake, Jiang Xiaorou would not blame him, but stare at him till Yi Yun confessed his wrongdoings.It was the same today.Yi Yun had wanted to make the excuse of hurting himself when picking herbs, but under Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s watchful gaze, he hesitated before speaking the truth, \u201cSis Xiaorou, I\u2019ve been practicing martial arts at night. The injuries on my hand were caused by my training.\u201dJiang Xiaorou was stunned, practicing martial arts?\u201cYun-er, who did you learn martial arts from?\u201d\u201cI secretly learned it,\u2019 said Yi Yun honestly.Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s expression changed. Secretly learning the tribe\u2019s martial arts would be a crime. Also learning martial arts was no easy task. Even without herbs and meat, one needed to have a good meal. Yi Yun only ate gruel and wild vegetables daily. Where did he have the strength to train?This could be a matter of life and death.\u201cSis Xiaorou, do you believe me?\u201d Yi Yun grabbed Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s hand while looking into her eyes seriously.Jiang Xiaorou paused before nodding her head subconsciously.\u201cWell, if you believe me, don\u2019t ask any further. Sis Xiaorou, I\u2019ll lead you to a better life in the future!\u201d Yi Yun said seriously. Jiang Xiaorou was the first person he met in this strange world, and was the person who had cared for him with her life ever since.He felt a sense of gratitude towards her. He wanted not only to change his own fate, but to also change Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s fate.Jiang Xiaorou looked at Yi Yun in a daze, a thought rose in her mind\u2013her brother has grown up.He was no longer the child of old. The words he said were not to be treated as infant speak. He was working hard to match his objectives\u2026Yi Yun was slowly growing accustomed to the plain meals he had. Or it could be said; he had no choice but to do so.Although the grain porridge tasted bad, Yi Yun would digest it immediately after having an increase in appetite. Without the Lian Clan Herb Mountain to support him, Yi Yun would have starved to death, not to mention breakthrough into the Vigour realm.However, although the herbs could supplement the body\u2019s nutritional and energetic requirements, it was not enough to replace meals. The taste of the herbs was worse than grain porridge.As the days passed, for a glutton like Yi Yun, it was a torture for him.The only thing good in his life was Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s pickled vegetables.It was sad to say that although Yi Yun was not considered rich on Earth, he had the opportunity to eat anything he wanted. But ever since he came to this strange world, he had not had a taste of meat. Pickled vegetables were now a delicacy.However, Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s pickled vegetables were indeed considered very delicious. For Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s family, pickled vegetables were considered an extravagance, as the village did not have any salt. All the salt had to be bought from the bigger tribes.Much of the salt was provided to the warrior preparation camp. They used the salt to cure the meat, so only tiny amounts of salt were distributed to the commoners. It was mostly used to boil vegetable soup. Using it to make pickled vegetables was obviously an extravagant way of eating.After a couple of days, all the herbs on the Lian Clan Herb Mountain were picked dry. Even with the Purple Crystal\u2019s guidance, even decent herbs couldn\u2019t be found. To hand over the herbs, the villagers even uprooted the sprouts of the herbs.\u201cHaving picked the entire herb mountain dry like that, without any consideration of the future. It seems the Lian tribal clan has gambled their all, and have given up on the land they stayed. All hope rested on Lian Chengyu. However, even if Lian Chengyu passed the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s warrior selection, only a few people from the warrior preparation camp would benefit. It was likely all the commoners would be abandoned\u2026\u201dYi Yun had mixed feelings. This was the way of living in the vast wilderness. There were limited resources; the strong obtained more resources while the weak were eliminated.With the value of the herb mountain\u2019s value getting lower and lower, the Lian tribal clan\u2019s upper echelons stopped focusing on the herb mountain. All their attention and energies were placed on the refinement of the desolate bones.This set of desolate bones was of the highest importance. For this set of desolate bones, the Lian tribal clan had placed all their bets on it, all their hopes were pinned on it.Even Lian Chengyu had put in his all, his ambition, his hopes; his everything was now bet on this!The refinement of the desolate bones required sixty days!On the tenth day of the refinement process, something weird happened.A few villagers in charge of the refinement of the desolate bones fell sick. It began with a cough and fever, but it soon broke out into diarrhoea, skin rashes and depression. The symptoms resembled typhoid.In a small tribe in such a vast wilderness, a common warrior with good physical fitness and strong physical resistance would be fine, but for the poor villagers, once ill, there was no such thing as a minor illness.Because their body was weak and had poor resistance, and the tribe only had one doctor who served the upper echelons, the poor were doomed to die from the cold ailment.Yi Yun felt something was amiss when he heard the news.Typhoid sounded like the cold, but it was actually a bacterial infection. Yi Yun wasn\u2019t sure if the typhoid in this strange world was the same as on Earth. But with so many ill, it had to be some type of communicable disease.What Yi Yun couldn\u2019t figure out was that common infectious diseases usually spread through water or air. However the villagers who were refining the desolate bones were confined to the cauldron where the temperatures were extremely high!Under sustained high temperatures and low humidity, most common viruses would find it hard to survive. If there was an outbreak, it would be from others, not from the people refining the desolate bones?Could it be a virus that spread easily under dry conditions?Thinking of this, Yi Yun\u2019s heart sank. The matter of the villagers falling sick was not so simple!With five people ill, the people of the Lian tribal clan and especially the rest of the people refining the desolate bones began to panic.With them being there, they could contract the disease anytime.Although life was tough, no one wanted to die.Thankfully, the upper echelons of the Lian tribal clan did not brush the matter aside. The Patriarch came forward to calm the masses, and gave each of the ill a red pill.The pill was the size of a longan, red like blood. According to the Patriarch, it was an extremely expensive herb obtained from refinement. Each pill was worth a fortune.The Patriarch instructed the ill to swallow it down with warm water. The illness will be cured after having the medicine. And the ill that ate the pill felt better on the first day, and felt energetic after a night\u2019s sleep. By the evening of the second day, they were no different from normal people.On the third day, the ill were even livelier, better than before they fell ill.Besides that, the Patriarch distributed a palm-sized piece of bacon to all the villagers who fell ill. This was meat, something these villagers had not seen for months. It was a great gift to them.The poor cherished this piece of bacon and ate tiny amounts of it. Some of them gave it to their children, some to their wife.The news that the Lian tribal clan distributed pills and bacon to the ill spread like wildfire.The people in suffering did it for the tribunal good, and worked even harder for the refinement of the desolate bones. Some even wished they fell ill, for they would receive a pill that made them feel even more energetic, and that piece of bacon.Yi Yun frowned when the news reached him.A pill that could cure the illness, and make them feel even better?Although Yi Yun had no medical training, he knew that having such great effects after eating a pill must be something that stimulated the people, which would have strong side effects.Examples were stimulants such as drugs and other prohibited drugs that could ignite a person\u2019s potential.Yi Yun was especially sceptical about the higher echelons of the Lian tribal clan spreading the news of them handing out pills made of extremely precious herbs.The Lian tribal clan could never be this generous. Besides, to be able to be generous, they had to have the precious herbs, and from Yi Yun\u2019s perspective, even the upper echelons of the Lian tribal clan were poor too. It was a situation of pot calling the kettle black between the upper echelons and plebeians. Also they had limited resources, and had used it all on Lian Chengyu, how could they hand out herbs to the poor?Yet another day, the Lian tribal clan distributed the herbal dregs. These herbal dregs were the remnants of what Lian Chengyu had finished using. It was for those who had refined the desolate bones with the goal of strengthening their bodies. Those who received the herbal dregs were naturally grateful.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - Lian Chengyu exits IsolationPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21: Lian Chengyu exits IsolationThe Lian tribal clan\u2019s elders\u2019 compound late at night.\u201cPeng!\u201d The door to the compound was pushed opened. A young man with a complexion as clear as jade walked out.\u201cChengyu, why did you come out?\u201d The Patriarch stood up the moment he saw the young man. Lian Chengyu had previously announced that he wanted to isolate himself till the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s warrior selection began.Yet it had been less than a month before Lian Chengyu came out of isolation.\u201cMy cultivation met some problems\u2026\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look good. He had planned to use two months to accumulate a strong base before using the desolate bones essence to breakthrough to the Purple Blood realm!By doing so, his fundamentals will be strong, and having accumulated sufficient amounts, when he breakthroughs into the Purple Blood realm, he would reach the peak of the beginning stages of the Purple Blood realm. Among the others in the beginning stages of the Purple Blood realm, he would be able to keep his head up, and it would aid him in breaking through to an even higher realm in the future. It would be very beneficial!Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s warrior selection was particular about a warrior\u2019s fundamentals and cumulative progress. If Lian Chengyu could meet all those requirements, he could get the recognition of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s officers during the warrior selection, and obtain excellent results.However, the circumstances did not permit so. After picking dry the Lian Clan Herb Mountain, Lian Chengyu\u2019s cultivation had a slow development despite all the good herbs!Lian Chengyu believed he had met his bottleneck.In fact, the attitude towards martial arts mattered most when in isolation. With a good attitude, strong confidence and perseverance, it would be easy to break though.When in self-doubt, thinking something was wrong with the cultivation process, such as hitting a bottleneck, it would inevitably cause a loss in momentum and make breaking through even tougher.The psychological effect usually did not have significant effects, but Lian Chengyu had originally lacked the resources for his cultivation, but matters were made worse, causing Lian Chengyu\u2019s progress to be even slower. In the end, he chose to end his isolation prematurely.By clearing his mind and taking a break before obtaining the desolate bone essence, he could then re-isolate himself to breakthrough into the Purple Blood realm.This was Lian Chengyu\u2019s plans. It was a reasonable plan. Sometimes it happened that a breakthrough was not possible, but by taking a break resulted in miraculous insight, resulting in a breakthrough unknowingly.\u201cHow has the refinement process of the desolate bones been?\u201d Lian Chengyu asked the question that concerned him the most. This piece of desolate bone was his entire fortune and life!\u201cYes, it\u2019s still going as planned, but\u2026 A few of the poor villagers involved in the refining were poisoned a few days ago. I was originally planning on letting them hang on a few days, but seeing they were doing badly, I gave them some Blood Thinning Pills. They have all recovered by now and will not affect the refinement.\u201dLian Chengyu knitted his eyebrows upon hearing it, \u201cThese trash are really useless. It\u2019s just been a few days and they can\u2019t take the toxicity from the Frost Python desolate bones! After eating the Blood Thinning Pills, it will overdraw on their vitality. Under such circumstances, they will die before the refinement of the desolate bones is done!\u201dLian Chengyu\u2019s words were cold and inhumane. The Patriarch felt he was going overboard and said, \u201cChengyu\u2026You are asking for too much. These people seldom eat a proper meal or wear proper clothes. How would they be able to endure the toxin from the Frost Python? They have already sacrificed themselves for the Lian tribe. In the future when you make your meteoric rise, you must take care of their families.\u201d\u201cGot it,\u201d said Lian Chengyu with a straight face. \u201cI\u2019m only worried about the refinement process and fear it will be delayed unnecessarily. If these people died too early, it would affect the refinement process. Grandpa, please send the order down to the tribe to gather more help. The more the merrier. With more people, they can all share in the toxicity of the Frost Python and last longer. Although the Blood Thinning Pill isn\u2019t a very expensive drug, but with most of our money gone, we have to save every penny.\u201dLian Chengyu said it lightly. The Patriarch sighed hearing this. He knew that for every person recruited, another life was lost.The pitiful poor even scrambled to join in the refining of the desolate bone for the bacon.\u201cFor the Lian tribe, I guess it has to be so\u2026\u201d exclaimed the Patriarch \u201cIt\u2019s such a pity. If we had a set of desolate bones without any toxicity, there wouldn\u2019t be so many deaths due to the refinement.\u201d\u201cA set of desolate bones without toxin?\u201c Lian Chengyu scoffed. \u201cWith the finances of our tribe and that incomplete technique manual, would we have been able to exchange for a set of desolate bones without toxicity?\u201d\u201cBesides, the Frost Python desolate bones does not have toxin, it just has a hard to dissipate frost Qi. Once it enters the body, it freezes the organs, causing a person to lose his life. With a Desolate Heaven Master he could easily dissipate the Frost Python\u2019s Frost Qi. But why would a Desolate Heaven Master be willing to help clear such a low-grade desolate bone\u2019s toxicity? There was no chance for them to come to our Lian tribal clan!\u201d\u201cEven the young masters of the big tribes were unwilling to use this kinds of desolate bones. Only because this set of Frost Python desolate bones was the cheapest I could get. Just like how a rich family will give the remaining bones to feed the dogs, to the big tribes, I\u2019m like a wild dog waiting to eat their scraps!\u201dLian Chengyu self-deprecating last words were said with his lips twitching and fists clenched tightly, with his nails piercing into his flesh.He hated!The young masters and mistresses of the large tribes could pick among the desolate bones, not using those with side effects or low efficacy!But for him, he had to go through all the trouble and sacrificing his wealth just to obtain a rejected piece of Frost Python desolate bones!Putting all hope on a set of desolate bones, which had immense side effects, and risking his life to consume it was pathetic!\u201cChengyu, it has been hard on you all these years. But you have to know even the bright in the big tribes are few in number. There are even plenty without the talent in the big tribes, they too don\u2019t get much of the desolate beast meat\u2026\u201d The Patriarch felt guilty. He knew Lian Chengyu had great talent, but because the Lian tribal clan was too poor, they were unable to nurture him. All these years, the Patriarch had known that Lian Chengyu had a grudge towards the tribe despite him never uttering a word.It was hard for Lian Chengyu to listen to what the Patriarch had to say. He answered, \u201cGrandpa, don\u2019t console me. Heaven is heartless, treating all things as dogs. Since the world is unfair, I will use my own strength to gain that fairness! Sooner or later, I will take control of my life, and will take control of the lives of others! In the future, I will have all the children of the big tribes at my feet!\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d sighed the Patriarch. \u201cTomorrow I will pass the order to gather more people to refine the desolate bones. I will not care about the number of deaths. With more people, they can absorb more of the Frost Qi\u2026making it safer for you when you consume the desolate bones.\u201dThe Patriarch knew that Lian Chengyu would not feel any remorse for the poor who died for him.Lian Chengyu hated the unfairness of the world. He felt he was extremely unlucky, so how could he be bothered with the unluckiness of others?To Lian Chengyu, the poor were like ants. Even Lian Chengyu saw himself as a slightly bigger ant.The survival of the fittest, this was a notion ingrained deep in Lian Chengyu\u2019s heart. Only by eating the smaller ants could he keep growing till the point where he could control his own fate and the fate of others, as a top expert.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - RecruitmentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22: RecruitmentEarly in the morning as the sun shined and mist rose from the woods\u2026The ancient vast wilderness welcomed a brand new day.With the herb picking halted, Jiang Xiaorou was preparing breakfast while Yi Yun was chopping wood in the yard.He did not use a hatchet, but was chopping them with his bare hands!\u201cPa!\u201d A clear loud snap rang. A clean cut separated the firewood into two.Yi Yun looked at the two pieces of firewood and said to himself, \u201c\u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 when mastered can break a tree trunk into thing chopstick like pieces with bare hands in less than a minute. If I were to practice for another three months, I wonder if I\u2019ll reach that point.\u201dYi Yun was deep in thought when he heard a noisy commotion from far.Listening attentively, Yi Yun heard Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s voice: \u201cLian tribal clan\u2019s people! Listen carefully! The Patriarch has issued an order to recruit ten strong men to refine the desolate bones. Those who are interested can sign up for it. They will be accepted on the basis of merit!\u201dOh? Recruiting ten strong men to refine the desolate bones?Yi Yun had a thought. He had been thinking about the illness the villagers had contracted from refining the desolate bones for the past few days.The large numbers of sick were all healed by a \u201cmiracle drug\u201d.Something had to be amiss for them to recruit new strong men for the refinement.With that thought, Yi Yun threw down his firewood and headed to the grain-sunning ground in the village.From afar, Yi Yun could see Zhao Tiezhu standing up high shouting.Many villagers were alarmed. The villagers who were responsible for the refinement of the desolate bones had received numerous benefits. Besides the miracle drug and the bacon, they were also given food subsidies.Because of the desolate bones, there was extremely little food left in the Lian tribal clan. Being able to collect more food was what the villagers dreamed of.\u201cI\u2019ll sign up!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll sign up too!\u201dThe people rushed towards Zhao Tiezhu to sign up, afraid that they were too late to be in line.\u201cI, Wang Dahu, is willing to refine the desolate bones! I\u2019m a second tier male!\u201dA stout but yellow-faced man due to malnutrition stood in front of Zhao Tiezhu. He looked at Zhao Tiezhu with hope in his eyes\u201cSecond Tier male\u2026that would barely do\u2026\u201d Zhao Tiezhu scrutinized Wang Dahu with a picky glare.Zhao Tiezhu did not know that the refinement process was fatal. It was a top secret in the Lian tribal clan, so to prevent the secret from leaking, only very few members of the upper echelon of the Lian tribal clan knew.The other members of the warrior preparation camp did not know that the set of desolate bones contained a fatal Frost Qi that would seep into their bodies and erode their lives away before sealing their fate by causing them to die from organ failure.So Zhao Tiezhu thought of the refinement process as a wondrous job.Being given the authority to pick people to do such a wondrous job made Zhao Tiezhu complacent. The authority vested in him made many look at him with a fawning look and compliments rained on him.Zhao Tiezhu was extremely picky with the people, \u201cWang Dahu, you stand by the side. You will be considered a substitute; it will be you if there\u2019s no one else more suited.\u201dHearing Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s words, Wang Dahu was delighted. He thanked Zhao Tiezhu incessantly before standing aside obediently.\u201cOh? Liu Er, you\u2019re here to sign up too? For a person with weak legs, a gust of wind would blow you away! You have to know, that the refinement of the desolate bones requires you to chop firewood, man the fire, fan it from daily from morning to night. Also the temperature around the cauldron is extremely high. Without sufficient fitness, you will faint straight away!\u201dZhao Tiezhu impatiently waved his hand to chase away the monkey-thin Liu Er.Lian Chengyu had handed down a mission of picking strong men. Picking weaklings was definitely not wanted.One by one, the villagers rushed forward to sign up, however many were chased away while few stayed.Yi Yun monitored the situation nearby. He felt that there was something wrong with the desolate bones!But, even if there was a problem, he had to investigate it himself.Because the desolate bones were very important to Yi Yun.With the Lian Clan Herb Mountain picked dry, he needed plenty of energy and nourishment for his training. The grain porridge was insufficient.\u201cOh? It\u2019s you!\u201d Just as Yi Yun was thinking about his next step, he suddenly heard a familiar voice behind him.The voice was deep and gentle, but Yi Yun\u2019s face changed the moment he heard it!It was Lian Chengyu!Wasn\u2019t Lian Chengyu in isolation? Based on Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s words, he was to be isolated for three months. Why was he out so early?Yi Yun\u2019s original plans were to exceed Lian Chengyu by the time he left isolation three months later. At that point, he need not fear Lian Chengyu. But now, Yi Yun had just been practicing martial arts for seven days, and even if the Purple Crystal could defy fate, Yi Yun would not be able to defeat a Mortal Blood level five Lian Chengyu who had been practicing martials for ten years.Yi Yun thought carefully, he didn\u2019t have any grave hatred for each other. Lian Chengyu\u2019s attempted murder might have just been a matter of convenience. It was analogous to a person seeing a rat in the house. The person would kill it, but if he missed, he would not tear down his walls to chase it to death.Yi Yun turned around having calmed his expression before meeting Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyes.But upon seeing Lian Chengyu, he immediately showed fear, unsure of what he had to do.\u201cYoung\u2026Young master Lian?\u201dYi Yun retreated a few steps, as if he had been shocked by Lian Chengyu\u2019s sudden appearance.Lian Chengyu frowned; this kid did not die?His original attempted murder was indeed a matter of convenience. The main reason was the hate he felt Yi Yun had for him. Lian Chengyu was afraid that during the critical stages of the refinement process, and the combination of the lack of food and deaths would incite the villagers. Lian Chengyu was afraid that Yi Yun who could easily incite the villagers would cause a riot due to Yi Yun\u2019s hate for himself.Lian Chengyu was pursuing the highest standards of martial arts, to be someone to lord over millions. With this goal, he had the mentality of an emperor. A person of Yi Yun\u2019s stature was negligible. In order to prevent any potential danger; having Yi Yun dead was no big deal. Lian Chengyu had killed numerous; after all the desolate bones refinement alone would cause many deaths.Since killing Yi Yun was a small matter, Lian Chengyu did not take it to heart. He had previously not verified Yi Yun\u2019s fate. It was only after he left his isolation that he discovered Yi Yun alive, puzzling him.For a lowly poor person to not die under his own attack, what could have happened? Were his own skills not enough?\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Lian Chengyu asked.\u201cAnswering Young master, I heard that Lord Zhao was recruiting strong men to refine the desolate bones. I also heard that we could get bacon, so I\u2019m thinking of trying.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d After hearing Yi Yun\u2019s words, Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyes burned with contempt. Yi Yun was only twelve, yet his words on the day of the ration distribution were unlike that of a twelve-year-old child. He also had the ability to incite the people to riot, making him an unstable factor in Lian Chengyu\u2019s calculations.But now, Yi Yun looked like a kid. What could a person who only had eyes on bacon do?Lian Chengyu could not be bothered with Yi Yun except for the mysterious failure to kill Yi Yun.\u201cSince you want to refine the desolate bones, why don\u2019t you sign up? What are you doing out here?\u201d\u201cTo\u2026To be honest to Young master, Lord Zhao only wants people who are at least second tier males, but for me\u2026I\u2026\u201dYi Yun\u2019s voice lowered once he said that. It was as if he was ashamed of his tiny strength, and was unable to say anything further.Lian Chengyu\u2019s contempt in his eyes became clearer. This idiot, to think I thought so highly of him. That\u2019s right, he\u2019s just twelve, what sort of schemes could he have.Lian Chengyu forgot that he too wasn\u2019t that old. He was only seventeen. Among the other seventeen year olds, he was the worldliest, but he was still a bit too young. He could never have dreamed that the twelve year old in front of him had the soul of an adult.\u201cSince you have the heart, and are willing to give your strength to the Lian tribal clan, I will not forbid it. Seeing how ambitious you are, you are a person worthy of grooming. I\u2019ll make an exception and give you a chance.\u201dLian Chengyu gave Yi Yun a few words of \u201cencouragement\u201d.This retard can contribute a bit of strength, although he\u2019s a sickly kid, his fitness does not matter when using him to absorb the Frost toxin. \u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Yi Yun\u2019s Elixir RefinementPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23: Yi Yun\u2019s Elixir Refinement\u201cSo I can refine the desolate bones?\u201d asked Yi Yun.Lian Chengyu made a silent acknowledgement. It was so pitiful seeing a person live a life where he was so happy to be sent to his death.\u201cThank you Young master.\u201d Yi Yun was very happy. This was not faked, for he was truly happy. He had originally thought Lian Chengyu would go crazy and pat him a few more times after seeing him alive to ensure his death.Although Lian Chengyu\u2019s methods would not harm Yi Yun, it would result in many implications.Lian Chengyu might mistake it as an error for failing to kill Yi Yun for the first time. But he would realize it if there was a second time. For Yi Yun, that was not good news.Yi Yun\u2019s goals to refine the desolate bones were fulfilled by Lian Chengyu.Refining the desolate bones gave Yi Yun time to breathe. Yi Yun\u2019s strength increased at exponential rates, so in two months time, things will no longer be the same!\u201cYun-er, why aren\u2019t you coming home to eat?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou had finished preparing the meal and had came out to look for Yi Yun. But she saw Yi Yun speaking to Lian Chengyu the moment she came out the door.Jiang Xiaorou was instantaneously worried. Lian Chengyu had previously harmed Yi Yun grievously, and almost took his life!She walked over quickly, afraid that Lian Chengyu would harm Yi Yun.Although Jiang Xiaorou hated Lian Chengyu to the bone, she knew she could not lose decorum with him.\u201cI see, it\u2019s Young master Lian.\u201d Jiang Xiaorou smiled wryly after seeing Lian Chengyu as she pulled Yi Yun behind her.\u201cOh? Jiang Xiaorou I remember you.\u201d Noticing Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s actions, Lian Chengyu frowned. This girl was still hostile towards himself!Lian Chengyu disliked having the poor plebeians of the Lian tribal clan show any disrespect to him. It was a result of an inferiority complex within him under all the larger powers, so he aimed to establish his authority among the poor who could not compare to himself.But Jiang Xiaorou was considered a woman he admired, so he was more tolerant of her. He would slowly tame her.Lian Chengyu left. Although he admired Jiang Xiaorou, he did not giver her any attention, nor say one word more to her. He was an elite. He was like an emperor who only visited, but never chased. He just needed to wait for Jiang Xiaorou to reach a desperate situation and get Zhao Tiezhu to deal with her.Jiang Xiaorou looked at Lian Chengyu\u2019s back as she clenched Yi Yun\u2019s small hands, \u201cYun-er what was going on?\u201d\u201cNothing, Sis Xiaorou. You don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d answered Yi Yun.Yi Yun was the one who told Jiang Xiaorou that Lian Chengyu had hurt him. Since Yi Yun assured her, Jiang Xiaorou eased up. These few days, she began to vaguely feel that her brother was no longer the mere child he was. He had his own ideas.But Jiang Xiaorou began to think before she felt something amiss, \u201cYun-er, you can\u2019t be thinking of refining the desolate bones? You can\u2019t go to that place!\u201dYi Yun looked at Jiang Xiaorou in surprise. Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s keen intuition was surprising. Though she didn\u2019t know what mysteries the refinement process had, she had figured that it was a dangerous job.Yi Yun thought it over before saying softly, \u201cSis Xiaorou, I\u2019m not as weak as you think. Having came back from the dead, I think I\u2019m different from the past\u2026Don\u2019t you remember me climbing up the 20 meter tall cliffs a few days ago.\u201dWith Yi Yun saying that, Jiang Xiaorou recalled. She was astonished at Yi Yun\u2019s speed climbing up the cliff, but accepted it because Yi Yun liked to climb and pick herbs since young.Thinking it through, Yi Yun was indeed more vigorous. He was much better at scaling cliffs than most of the members of the warrior preparation camp.With that in mind, Jiang Xiaorou felt reassured. Her brother was indeed different.Sometimes, having not died in a fatal situation, there would be great fortune after. Jiang Xiaorou had heard that some people were struck by lightning, and not only did they not die; they obtained special abilities.Could Yun-er be in a similar situation?That night, Yi Yun as a new hire was brought to the grain-sunning grounds.Wooden fences surrounded the grain-sunning grounds. Because of the \u201ctyphoid\u201d incident, the wooden fences increased, preventing anyone from the outside to see in.There were about thirty people split into two shifts involved in the refinement of the desolate bones.Yi Yun was designated the night shift. There were about a dozen people for the night shift. Although these people were not as fit as the men from the warrior preparation camp, they were all large. Among them, Yi Yun was like a little chicken among swans. His height only reached their chest.Seeing Yi Yun, a dozen of the men were shocked. The reason for the stares was obvious, how did such a thin child get selected to refine the desolate bones?Besides his strength, his height was so short that even he could not reach the mouth of the cauldron while standing on a stool. How would he be able to add the \u201cLi Fire Water\u201d into the cauldron?\u201cLad, are you kidding me? Someone like you can refine the bones?\u201d\u201cWhat can you do with your little body? Your legs aren\u2019t even thicker than the firewood!\u201dAll the men had strong views upon seeing Yi Yun. Yi Yun would be given a piece of bacon for not doing any work. They were not cool with that.Yi Yun did not bother speaking, and sat by the pile of firewood, letting them say all they want.\u201cTime for porridge!\u201d A man from the warrior preparation camp brought out a bucket of porridge. There was food provided for those who refined the desolate bones. This was a welfare the upper echelon gave to ensure the smooth refinement of the desolate bones. Only after eating would they have the strength to work.Upon hearing that the porridge arrived, the men\u2019s eyes lit up and ran towards it.\u201cHula\u201d, the bucket of porridge was snatched empty. With Yi Yun at the back, together with how these people struggled and fought for the food, there was already none left for Yi Yun.Yi Yun felt helpless. Bad surroundings make bad civilians. This phrase had its logic. It wasn\u2019t because the people in bad surroundings were immoral, but being moral did not ensure their survival.\u201cTime to work! Work time! The guys from the warrior preparation camp shouted.A few men walked towards the big cauldron. It was time to replace the day shift.Yi Yun straggled at the back. He walked slowly as he stared at the cauldron.In the eyes of others, Yi Yun looked stunned by the huge bronze cauldron that was burnt by purple fire. Indeed, the cauldron was huge. Yi Yun\u2019s height did not even reach the second handle of the cauldron.In fact, Yi Yun\u2019s sight was filled with faint points of light. It looked like flying fireflies dancing in the night.Such a mystical power! This was the energy of the desolate bones, and was the legendary\u2013Power of Desolates!This endless stream of light dots excited Yi Yun. Previously, the Purple Crystal had absorbed some of the desolate bones\u2019 energy, but he stood far away and could not absorb much. It was unlike today, where he was in close contact with the desolate bones.In comparison, the Purple Jade ginseng and the Black Fungus was incomparable to this. Like a person who was accustomed to eating plain food seeing a lavish meal, Yi Yun was extremely excited.This was like a thief entering an emperor\u2019s tomb, a weasel sneaking into a chicken coop!All the energy of the desolate bones belonged to him.\u201cKid, what are you idling for? Chop the firewood!\u201d shouted a man before landing an axe in front of Yi Yun.Yi Yun was awaked from his sluggish state, and happily preceded to chopping wood.\u201cThis lad has a brain problem!\u201d swore the man. He also began busying himself. He and the others were in charge of chopping the firewood.The firewood was the key to the fire source. It was extremely strong and heavy. A few strong men had to work hard before they could cut up the purple firewood.These men worked hard, because if they did well, they could be promoted to foreman, getting more bacon and food.Yi Yun though happy did not get carried away. He knew the desolate bones refinement had something to do with the \u201ctyphoid\u201d break out!He wanted to investigate thoroughly what was the cause of the typhoid breakout. If the Purple Crystal could not resolve it, then no matter how great the rewards, Yi Yun would only run.So as Yi Yun chopped the firewood without much purpose, he was carefully observing the red-hot bronze cauldron.Slowly, Yi Yun realized the problem.From the big cauldron flew out two differently colored light dots.The first was purple in color. It was part of the mainstream. It flew around aimlessly, and Yi Yun realized that if he focused, these light dots would fly towards him.With the Purple Crystal merged with Yi Yun\u2019s heart, Yi Yun felt that he could now control the amount the Purple Crystal absorbed ever since he broke through into the second level of Mortal Blood.He could choose if he wanted to absorb or not.The other light dot was another color, icy blue\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Frost ToxinPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24: Frost ToxinThese cold blue light dots accounted for a small proportion, but it made Yi Yun feel a mysterious bone-biting chill.Yi Yun was familiar with this chilling feeling. He had felt it when he passed by the refinement area while descending the mountain. He remembered it clearly because it was just after breaking through to the Vigor realm.The cold blue light dots floated in the sky like ghosts.Occasionally a light dot would leave the cauldron and dance in the air randomly before entering one of the men\u2019s bodies.Just like snowflakes falling into the water, these light dots would then disappear.Yi Yun could not detect the light dot after that; the light dot had been absorbed by one of the men\u2019s body.Yi Yun\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He vaguely understood that the cold blue light dots were the cause of the typhoid fever epidemic.He quietly observed for a while and realized that the cold blue light dots would randomly fly out and enter the bodies of the men. The men were busy chopping wood, and did not notice anything.Yi Yun was more assured of his speculation. The purple red energy would not fly into the bodies of people. On the contrary, they would remain in the \u201cLi Fire Water\u201d.It seems the desolate bones has two forms of energy, the purple red energy is beneficial to a person, causing a person to transform, allowing a person to break through. On the other hand, the cold blue energy is an invisible killing force!The energy was toxic, although it sounded iffy, yet it wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary.On Earth, there were plenty of energies that had \u201ctoxicity\u201d. One such example was the Sun. It was only after being filtered through the ozone before it\u2019s sunlight could give life to Earth. Humans would have died from the direct sunlight bearing down on them.On Earth, the most frightening elements had \u201ctoxic\u201d energy, such as radioactive Polonium. It killed Arafat, who used to appear often on the news.If one were to use Polonium to kill, a gram would be sufficient to kill millions. A few hundred grams was enough to kill all life on Earth, making it much stronger than the common \u201cpoisonous\u201d items.In Yi Yun\u2019s opinion, the blue light dots were similar in nature to energy, and using \u201ctoxic\u201d to describe it may be inaccurate. However, it was sufficient to understand them as having the capability to kill.Just like on Earth, being exposed to radiation will cause cancer, ulcers and various illnesses. In the vast wilderness, absorbing the desolate bone\u2019s chill toxin would cause \u201ctyphoid\u201d, resulting in deaths.\u201cThen aren\u2019t I in danger being here?\u201d thought Yi Yun. He wasn\u2019t guarding a cauldron; he was guarding a nuclear reactor!Thinking carefully, there were plenty of things that were totally different from Earth, but there were similarities.In terms of energy, the strongest energy on Earth could create atomic bombs or provide nuclear energy.But in this world, the strongest energy was used to create the strongest experts!These experts could topple the mountains and overturn the seas. A flip of hand would destroy a city!These two forms of energy could result in terrible destruction. If not used properly, it would be toxic to the common people!Thankfully, Yi Yun controlled the treasure that could harness the energy in this world\u2013Purple Crystal.\u201cBut can the Purple Crystal deal with this energy\u2026\u201d Yi Yun tried using the Purple Crystal to absorb the blue light dots. Since he could see the blue light dots, he should be able to absorb them with the Purple Crystal\u2026As Yi Yun prepared to absorb the first blue light dot, Yi Yun breathed in deeply and reached out his hand carefully. His heart raced, but he finally rationalized that even if the Purple Crystal could not absorb the form of energy, he wouldn\u2019t die immediately from one light dot.The blue light dot entered Yi Yun\u2019s body.Yi Yun felt it clearly. The light dot flew into his fingertips like an ice crystal, and then entered his bloodstream.\u201cIt\u2019s so cold!\u201d This was Yi Yun\u2019s first thought. It was like having a huge piece of ice stuffed down his collar during winter.It was weird that he felt it so profoundly, but the other men did not feel it at all. Their bodies were not as fit as him, so they shouldn\u2019t be able to resist the cold as much.It seems they have slow reactionary speeds, and are not able to feel the biting cold. However, their bodies will not lie, once they are invaded by the frost toxin, they would slowly lose their strength. If not for the red pill that was given to them from the upper echelon of the Lian tribal clan, they would already be dead?Yi Yun traced the blue light dot that entered his body. It was eventually absorbed and dissolved by the Purple Crystal into energy that mixed into Yi Yun\u2019s blood.When the energy flowed through Yi Yun\u2019s body, that biting chill had already disappeared, and gave Yi Yun a cool refreshing feeling.It was comfortable as if he was soaking in aquatic springs.This made Yi Yun more curious. What sort of treasure was the Purple Crystal, it could even absorb all forms of energy, be they the harmful energy like the blue light dots from the desolate bones or the Yuan Qi Lian Chengyu had used on him. The Purple Crystal would reduce those forms of energy to the purest form of energy to nourish his body.Yi Yun was not aware of the fact that in the vast wilderness, many desolate bones contained toxic energies. The Frost Python desolate bones\u2019 toxin was one of the lowest grades. A low level Desolate Heaven Master could easily dissolve the toxicity. Hence, a toxicity of this level was nothing to the Purple Crystal.After really absorbing it, Yi Yun realized the effect was not significant.The Purple Crystal could indeed absorb the blue light dots, but the absorbing speed was extremely slow, far more difficult than absorbing the purple red light dots.\u201cKid, what are you doing!\u201d Yi Yun was carefully researching the differences between the two types of energy when he heard a man shout at him. In the eyes of others, Yi Yun was just idling.One of the men who wanted to be the \u201cforeman\u201d of the group could naturally not stand Yi Yun\u2019s laziness.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun replied with a smile, \u201cSorry uncle, this axe is too heavy\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d The man responded with a \u2018I knew you wouldn\u2019t amount to much\u2019, \u201cI really don\u2019t know what the top brass were thinking, to send a kid to refine the desolate bones, holding me back! The useless kid I have, Da Tou is about the same age as you. His strength is twice yours!\u201dNot to mention Yi Yun\u2019s age, but even among his same-aged peers, the past Yi Yun\u2019s body was extremely thin and lacked strength.In the vast wilderness, the people worshipped the strong. They were proud of the big and tall men who had dark rough skin.A handsome person like Yi Yun who had smooth skin was considered \u201cridden with ills\u201d. Such a person was not popular.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry uncle. I didn\u2019t only hold you back; I even held your eggs. I\u2019ll work hard in the future.\u201d Yi Yun was still smiling. The man was good at doing hard labor, but his reaction was slow. He had not realized what Yi Yun had said. He only grunted before returning to work while swearing.Yi Yun began to split the firewood at an adequate pace. To avoid trouble, he increased his speed by a tiny bit. It took him five minutes of hard work, amounting to ten chops to split a piece of firewood.He had to stay in line with his status.At the same time, no one noticed that the purple red energies churning in the cauldron were flying towards Yi Yun.As for the cold blue energies, Yi Yun also absorbed as much as he could. He felt that if he could absorb the blue energies, the men around him would not die as a result of the energy.Unfortunately, the Purple Crystal was not highly effective in absorbing the blue energies. Small amounts of energy were still entering the bodies of the men around him.Yi Yun had mixed feeling seeing this. Although these people weren\u2019t pleasant, they did not deserve to die. However, he was unable to save them.If he revealed the truth, the men would not only disbelieve him, and might even report him as rumor mongering to Lian Chengyu for a reward of bacon.These people were definitely capable of doing that. Yi Yun\u2019s situation will be terrible if that happens.In the vast wilderness, the weak had to accept their own suffering. There was no other way around it.Just like pigs, cattle and sheep, they did nothing wrong, but were kept in captivity and slaughtered by humans.The only reason was because they were weak. And in the vast wilderness, being weak was a fault! Being weak made you unable to decide your own fate. Being weak allowed you be trampled on\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just like when eating a meal, there would be a point where one couldn\u2019t eat anymore.If he carried on absorbing the energy, he would feel a turbulent flow of energy within his body, making his body feel numb.At this point, Yi Yun felt full of strength, and needed to vent it.He couldn\u2019t wait to go up to the mountains to cultivate!After arduously waiting till dawn, the day shift came to swap out Yi Yun. Yi Yun raced to the back mountains. He had originally jogged at a slow speed to the mountain entrance, but when there was no one around, he began to run like the wind!He was like an agile antelope, a simple jump covered five to six meters.A three-meter high boulder was bypassed with a leap, a five meter tree was crossed through the middle.Yi Yun was not running, but flying while sticking to the ground! The mountain terrain was complex, but under Yi Yun\u2019s keen senses, no terrain was an obstacle for Yi Yun.He ran to the top of the mountain and descended from the other side down a valley to reach the back of the mountain.During this period, Yi Yun had not rested once. While travelling, he maintained a constant deep breathing pace. His heart was beating at a constant frequency, slow, but strong!After running for an hour, Yi Yun finally stopped. Even after such a long run, neither his face was red, nor was his heart beating fast! Running was also a form of cultivation. After running the distance, Yi Yun enjoyed the sweat on the run.This location was the furthest away from the village and was safe. Any further, he would go beyond the protection of the wonderland, and could meet huge beasts and desolate beasts.At Yi Yun\u2019s present strength, he was doomed if he met a desolate beast.The vegetation was not rich here. A few patches of black rocks littered the ground.This was black ironstone. Black ironstone was as heavy as steel, and was several times stronger than normal rocks. Even the, moss which could break rocks, could not sprout on the black ironstone.The place Yi Yun stood was a flat area below a cliff. It was about thirty meters in diameter.Above the cliff was a waterfall. Numerous droplets of water danced and flew in the air currents, catching the sun and creating rainbows in the mist. This scenery would be a fascinating tourist attraction on Earth.The waterfall was not considered wide, but the vertical drop was high. It was more than a hundred meters. The wild water flow continued its relentless assault downwards. It was a rumble that could be heard from a distance.Yi Yun chose this cultivation location previously, precisely for the waterfall.Yi Yun took a deep breath and circulated the energy within his body. His tough training was about to begin again.In an isolated mountain wilderness without anyone in a ten-mile radius, Yi Yun practiced each \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d stance.There was no lack of boulders at the back of the mountain. Yi Yun had specifically chosen a flat piece of ground with black ironstone.Yi Yun stood in front of the black ironstone and started sending punches on to it!How could mere fists made of flesh and blood break apart such lifeless black ironstone?Yi Yun gritted his teeth, one punch, two punches, three punches\u2026ten punches, twenty punches!He used all his strength in every punch!The first few punches resulted in bruised fists. The pain was heart-wrenching as his fists turned bloody. Finally, as the punches flew, his joints began to rattle.The pain travelled from his fingers to his heart, it was an indescribable pain.But Yi Yun gritted his teeth and endured through it. His face was drenched in sweat. His lips turned white as his face turned pale!Only till the point where his fists\u2019 surfaces were nearly bones instead of flesh that Yi Yun stopped.Following that, he began kicking the boulder. He did so till his legs were covered in bruises. He could barely stand. After a breather, Yi Yun began hitting the boulder with his shoulders and back!Yi Yun used every possible part he could use, but he was eventually still unable to do anything to the black ironstone; instead, his body was filled with cuts and bruises.Pain!Yi Yun rested on the ground. His body was out of strength, and even his vision had blurred.He focused on his breath, and followed the theories of the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d techniques to circulate his energies.This was a self-mutilating cultivation method that Yi Yun did not dare to try previously.However, a few hours ago, Yi Yun had eaten his fill of the Frost Python\u2019s desolate bones energy.The energy contained within the desolate bones was called the Power of Desolates; it was a great gift to any cultivator!Compared to the Power of Desolates, the herbal essence in the Lian Clan Herb Mountain was trivial.Even a hundred-year-old herb would be lacking.With the support from the Power of Desolates, only then did Yi Yun dare to proceed with such self-mutilating practice.This practice was recorded as the Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019s \u201cTiger Claws Smite Rocks\u201d, a method to train the bones.Using the boulder to smite his bones was a tremendously painful and hard process. It was impossible without strong perseverance.Even with perseverance, he had to have the resources to support it.If not, one could end up disabled instead of having the bones trained.Because of limited resources, the members of the warrior preparation camp did not dare to attempt Tiger Claws Smite Rocks.Only the gifted in the large tribes could withstand such injuries through the consumption of desolate beast meat and soaking in desolate beast blood.The Power of Desolates rapidly circulated within Yi Yun\u2019s body. His wounds began to itch, indicating the recovery of his wounds.The desolate bones were indeed top notch, together with the Purple Crystal\u2019s purification; the energy used to heal his body was at a tremendous speed, visible to the naked eye!The method used by \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d to train one\u2019s bones, letting the Power of Desolates to heal those wounds was a cultivation method similar to iron forging.The method of forging swords was to repeatedly hit a steel sword when hot to forge a peerless sword!Yi Yun\u2019s current practice was similar to the forging of a sword.He treated his body as the raw steel and the black ironstone as the anvil. Through repeated hits, he forged his body as a form of cultivation!After resting for six hours, Yi Yun felt that he had recovered. There were scabs on his hands, so it did not affect his movements.Yi Yun wrapped his wounds with cloth, and without any hesitation dived into the waterfalls!\u201cSplash!\u201dThe water smashed into his body, like a thousand pound jackhammer!Under the waterfall was a deep plunge basin!From the perennial impact from the waterfall, the plunge basin was of an unknown depth. From land, the plunge basin was emerald green with no obvious bottom.This was the deepest water body Yi Yun could find in the vicinity of the Lian tribal clan grounds.Yi Yun was practicing another stance of the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d\u2013\u201dDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d!In actual fact, \u201cDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d was not cultivated this way. The vast water referred to the ocean, but there was no ocean in the vast wilderness. Yi Yun could only use the plunge basin of a waterfall.\u201cDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d was a technique to train a body\u2019s internal organs.The more Yi Yun practiced \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, the more he understood its subtleties.A warrior\u2019s strength and energy was easily cultivated. But it was much harder to cultivate the tendons, bones and internal organs.In the stances of the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, a warrior could cultivate his tendons through \u201cFierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u201d by pulling his tendons like a bowstring, strengthening them tremendously.Using \u201cTiger Claws Smite Rocks\u201d, he could train the bones like steel being forged repeatedly.As for the cultivation of organs, it was even harder. Organs were incomparable to tendons, as a warrior could not easily control his organs for training.So the creator of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d had came up with the method of \u201cDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d.\u201cDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d required a practitioner to jump into the ocean and reach a depth of two hundred meters with one breath. The pressure at that depth was extremely high, enough to burst the eardrums and the organs of people!The water pressure would exert itself on a person\u2019s organs. Under prolonged periods of such pressure, a person\u2019s organs would become even tougher!Yi Yun took a deep breath and jumped down into the deep depths of the plunge basin while grabbing a heavy rock!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26 - ThunderousPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: ThunderousThe emerald green plunge basin may look green on the surface, but it had an unimaginable depth. Yi Yun had previously tried exploring its depths but had never managed to dive to the bottom.After submerging himself at about a depth of ten meters, he felt his ears hurting.Human ears were extremely vulnerable. The most unbearable pressure a diver experiences came from his ears. Martial artists were no different.As a person goes deeper, his eardrums will rupture before his organs could feel the pressure. Yi Yun blew up the air in his mouth. By increasing the pressure from his mouth, he could balance the external pressure surge, reducing the pain in his eardrums.After diving to an unknown depth, Yi Yun experienced poor light conditions underwater. Only by looking towards the water surface would he see the beautiful sunshine being transmitted down.In order to have a means of escaping danger, Yi Yun kept close to the cliff. Peppering the cliff were weird rocks. The rocks led downwards into a deeper depth that was complete darkness. It was a terrifying and bottomless darkness.Thankfully, Yi Yun had reached the Vigor realm; his breaths could last him a long while. With one breath, he was able to endure about fifteen minutes.On Earth, the breath holding record underwater was about thirteen minutes. Of course, those people had undergone professional training, and if Yi Yun trained himself more, his timing would be longer.As the pressure increased, Yi Yun felt his lungs being compressed. His abdominal cavity was filled with bodily fluids.The ribs enclosing his lungs were under immense pressure. It was as if a huge bear was stepping on his chest. Yi Yun even heard the creaking sound of his ribs.If not for the bone training he had just completed, Yi Yun\u2019s ribs would most definitely have broken.With his abdominal cavity compressed, tremendous pressure was transferred to Yi Yun\u2019s body, compressing his bodily fluids and organs.Slowly, Yi Yun felt his limit approaching.Diving was a dangerous sport. The moment one lost consciousness due to the water pressure, one was undoubtedly doomed. The corpse would slowly fall to the bottom and get completely crushed.On Earth, deep diving enthusiasts had to make all sorts of preparations such as ropes, balloons and other life-saving devices.As for Yi Yun, he naturally had none of that. He had to rely on his own assessments.\u201cSplash! Splash!\u201dIn the quiet depths underwater, Yi Yun could hear his own heartbeat and even the sound of his blood flowing.The sunlight in the mountains was already dimmer, but at these deep depths, one could say that Yi Yun was totally surrounded by darkness. Under a quiet, dark and high-pressure environment, the only thing that Yi Yun could clearly feel was the Purple Crystal Origins in his chest. That cool feeling flowed through his bloodstream.This cool feeling was like the fountain of life in fairy tales. Although it was extremely weak, it could ensure Yi Yun\u2019s survivability. It allowed Yi Yun to stay conscious under such extreme conditions.This situation resembled the time he experienced the cave-in back on Earth. Trapped under the earth, the Purple Crystal had accompanied him in that quiet and dark environment.Yi Yun also felt that the Purple Crystal was like his life\u2019s last refuge. When his organs were damaged under the immense water pressure, the Purple Crystal would silently repair his organs. It allowed him to not only experience the immense water pressure but also recover in the shortest time possible.Yi Yun lost his sense of time underwater. He kept following the theories of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d by circulating his energies. When he felt his breath was mostly used up, he began to swim upwards.Deep-sea divers would usually not have much energy or air. As swimming upwards consumed a lot of energy, most people on Earth used devices like balloons to propel their bodies upwards, but Yi Yun had to rely on himself.This was without question a great test for Yi Yun\u2019s heart and lungs.Under such immense pressure, breathing and heart beating experienced a hundred times more stress.Yi Yun held his breath, and by virtue of his willpower and the lifeline provided by the Purple Crystal, he swam upwards meter by meter!\u201cSplash!\u201d As Yi Yun\u2019s head emerged from the water, he took in large gulps of air. His face was pale. His lips were white and pupils constricted.Having dived to a depth of more than a hundred meters for more than twenty minutes, Yi Yun could not believe that he had done it without any device except a rock. He was surprised at the degree he performed \u201cDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d for the first time.Yi Yun swam towards land. His hair was dripping with water. After a few long breaths, he felt deeply that his body was no longer the same.The Power of Desolates energy had been completed digested. Before coming to the plunge basin, Yi Yun felt bloated with energy, but after this round of cultivation, he felt extremely hungry. It was as if he had not eaten for three days.This was the effect of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d!The \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d combined with the Power of Desolates from the desolate bones had increased Yi Yun\u2019s strength by leaps and bounds!\u201cIt really\u2026feels great!\u201d Yi Yun could not help uttering a cry.\u201cKa Ka Ka!\u201d In the midst of this long cry, Yi Yun\u2019s joints began to emit cracking sounds. Although they were not loud, they were extremely clear, like the sound of stirring steel pellets.\u201cThunderous realm, this must be Mortal Blood\u2019s third realm, Thunderous!\u201d Yi Yun was delighted. The five levels of Mortal Blood were natural endpoints after sufficient training. Without any bottlenecks, as long as one worked hard, with sufficient energy supplied, anyone could reach the fifth level of Mortal Blood.Although anyone could reach level five of Mortal Blood, the difference in speed of doing so was great.A talented person would not only cultivate quickly, his fundamentals would be solid, making him much stronger than ordinary people.As for people with little talent, being stuck among the levels of Mortal Blood for three to five years wasn\u2019t uncommon.Yi Yun knew that he lacked talent. After tunneling through space-time, he was a normal person who was thin and weak. He had little strength, amounting to the lifting of a 30 kg rock weight.Such a body\u2019s talent could be in no way good. It was probably not far from the (one of the men refining the desolate bones) man\u2019s son, \u201cDa Tou\u201dBut with the help of the Purple Crystal, Yi Yun\u2019s cultivation had improved tremendously. In half a month, he was already at the third level of Mortal Blood.Then was it possible for him to become a Purple Blood Warrior in two and a half months\u2019 time at the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior selection?With a Purple Blood Warrior in this tiny tribe, it would cause a sensation and craze among the people!No matter who it was, if they could become a Purple Blood Warrior in the Lian tribal clan, they would be worshipped!He would have the highest prestige and wield absolute power in the tribe to determine life and death.Yi Yun looked at the time. After this round of cultivation, it was already late afternoon. He had cultivated since morning. Yi Yun had once again not slept.Having just broken through to the Mortal Blood level three\u2019s Thunderous realm, Yi Yun did not feel a tinge of sleepiness. He meditated according to the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 methods for two hours, and felt as if he had slept soundly for eight hours, feeling full of energy!\u201cIt\u2019s about time to refine the desolate bones. I\u2019ve cultivated the whole day. I\u2019m so hungry!\u201d Yi Yun had not eaten for a day. Previously, he had the energy from the desolate bones to support him, so although his stomach was hungry, his body was able to provide him the energy without problems.But after undergoing the intense training from the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, the desolate bone energy within Yi Yun\u2019s body had been depleted, so his hunger was much more unbearable.From the color of the sky, the sun was about to set. Yi Yun returned to the village.At the grain-sunning ground, the cauldron was burning bright, and it was time to change shifts.Seeing Yi Yun return, \u201cDa Tou\u201d\u2018s father pointed to a stack of firewood and said straight, \u201cThese firewood. Chop them up for me. You didn\u2019t do anything last night. This place doesn\u2019t employ useless people. If you can\u2019t finish it, there will be no porridge for you today.\u201dYi Yun was speechless upon hearing that. It was not as if he had eaten any porridge yesterday. The men had all rushed headlong into the fray. The number of rice grains Yi Yun had managed to receive could be counted with his fingers. The bucket of rice porridge was drank and licked cleanly that it didn\u2019t even need scrubbing.Yi Yun sat in the corner and began to chop the wood unhurriedly.This firewood was as thick as a fully grown leg. It had to be chopped apart before dicing it into uniform sizes, in order for the fire to burn uniformly.Without anyone realizing, a sheet of red and blue light that came from the cauldron, as Yi Yun chopped wood, now covered him.Previously, Yi Yun did not absorb all the energies from the herbs, leaving some soup for Lian Chengyu, because he was fearful that Lian Chengyu would realize something was amiss.But this time, for the desolate bones, it was different. Yi Yun was determined to absorb all the energy from the desolate bones, and increase his strength by leap and bounds. By then, he would no longer fear Lian Chengyu.Yi Yun felt a little sorry for Lian Chengyu. He confessed in his mind: \u201cYoung master Lian, I\u2019m sorry. If I don\u2019t reach the Purple Blood realm, then it\u2019s too bad. For me to finish up this set of desolate bones cleanly, with nothing left, I can only apologize.\u201d\u201cIf through luck, I can reach the Purple Blood realm before I finish absorbing the desolate bones, then I\u2019ll\u2026er\u2026carry on sucking it dry. After all, the Purple Blood realm is just the beginning step on the martial arts road. There\u2019s still a long path ahead.\u201d\u201cSo please be a good man till the end. I will always remember you in the future.\u201d After Yi Yun finished confessing, he began to absorb the desolate bones energy.It was a tremendously comfortable feeling to be able to absorb the Power of Desolates without any restrictions while the body was seriously lacking in energy.The lack of energy and hunger; although they were two different feelings, they had much in common.In the case of extreme hunger, what greater joy was there besides having a sumptuous meal of delicacies?Yi Yun did not stand on ceremony with Lian Chengyu. He knew that the desolate bones\u2019 energy was so vast that he would need a while to absorb fully.After all, Lian Chengyu\u2019s primitive methods of brewing the desolate bones could at best refine a small amount of the desolate bone\u2019s essence. Just this small amount of essence was enough for Lian Chengyu to breakthrough to the Purple Blood realm.However for Yi Yun, using the Purple Crystal to absorb the desolate bone\u2019s energy, he could absorb it completely and with high efficiency. Also Yi Yun\u2019s cultivation level was still low at the Thunderous realm, if the cultivation speed increased any faster, Yi Yun might even scare himself\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27 - SickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 27: SickChapter 27: SickYi Yun absorbed the desolate bone\u2019s energy at night, filling up his energy reserves. In the day, he would spy on the warrior preparation camp\u2019s practicing, secretly listening in on Yao Yuan\u2019s teaching of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d.The warrior preparation camp was not a restricted area. It was common for people to come and go. As long as Yi Yun was careful, he would not be discovered.After learning the skills, Yi Yun would go to the back mountain to cultivate. He would digest the energy from the desolate bones, combining it into his body. Such a cultivation rhythm was perfect.Within days, Yi Yun\u2019s Thunderous realm became more and more based. He could stay underwater for twenty-five minutes, almost as long as a dolphin.About a month before the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior selection, a man who was refining the bones with Yi Yun fell sick.Although Yi Yun had absorbed as much of the toxic blue light energies, there were still some light dots that entered the bodies of others, causing them to contract the so-called \u201ctyphoid\u201d.After the first person fell sick, Yi Yun also \u201cfell sick\u201d, and his \u201csickness\u201d was extremely serious.Yi Yun could no longer refine the desolate bones. According to Jiang Xiaorou, he had diarrhea, was pale in the face, and extremely weak. Jiang Xiaorou had to take leave on his behalf as he was bedridden.Zhao Tiezhu strained his ears to finish hearing Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s description. A delightful sense of schadenfreude engulfed him as he broke into a smile, \u201cOh my, diarrhea? Pale in the face? Extremely weak? Tsk tsk tsk, wasn\u2019t he pretty hardy? How could he be bedridden this time?\u201dZhao Tiezhu said it with an eccentric voice. Jiang Xiaorou face turned cold, as if in a rage. But in fact, she was just posturing. She of course knew Yi Yun was fine, and just pretending to be ill.\u201cYour brother was originally a weakling. Even if he died, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But Young master Lian sure has a good heart, and has handed me the pills!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu said it as he reluctantly pulled out a red pill from his hip.Zhao Tiezhu had no intention of giving Yi Yun the pill. He could only wish for Yi Yun\u2019s death, but he did not know why Lian Chengyu had high appraisals for Yi Yun, and specifically gave him the pill to pass to Yi Yun. He was to make sure that Yi Yun ate the pill.Did Young master Lian really think that highly of the little bastard?Zhao Tiezhu felt upset thinking of this.\u201cYoung master Lian is such a good person!\u201d\u201cYoung master Lian is too kind!\u201dAt this time, as the men refining the desolate bones fell ill one after another, many people had gathered to obtain a pill. Having seen Zhao Tiezhu take out the legendary pill that could bring people back from the dead to give to Yi Yun, the people began to sing praises of Lian Chengyu.These people had previously thought Lian Chengyu would ignore them. But seeing that a useless lad like Yi Yun could receive a pill, they thought their strong man at home would also receive one.Especially the bulging bag Zhao Tiezhu held in his other hand looked like it contained bacon. These people became even more agitated. The situation had put the crowd in a nearly uncontrollable frenzy.\u201cLord Zhao, my man in the house has fallen sick too!\u201d\u201cLord Zhao, my child\u2019s father is seriously ill. He has been vomiting for three days!\u201dA crowd gathered around Zhao Tiezhu hoping for a pill, and some bacon. Their eyes were full of hope. They were almost about to kowtow to Zhao Tiezhu.Zhao Tiezhu was pleased for he enjoyed being praised by a crowd of people. He felt Young master Lian was too soft hearted. Giving such precious pills and bacon to these poor commoners was such a waste!Zhao Tiezhu had originally wanted to secretly eat a pill, but Lian Chengyu had warned him previously, so he had to give up on that thought. The fact that he had to personally deliver the pill to that monkey Yi Yun upset Zhao Tiezhu tremendously.\u201cStop making a fuss! As long as you are really ill, there will be something for you!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu opened up the cloth bag, and after accounting for the number of people, handed out the pills and bacon.Everyone who received a pill and bacon gave endless thanks, \u201cThank you Lord Zhao! Thank you Lord Zhao!\u201d\u201cWhat are you thanking me for. You should thank Young master Lian. Young master Lian will remember your sacrifice to the tribe. As long as you work hard refining the bones, Young master Lian and the tribe will not let you down.\u201dZhao Tiezhu said it with a sense of achievement. He had the illusion that he was representing the upper echelon of the Lian tribal clan. In fact at that moment, Zhao Tiezhu felt he was one of the upper echelon of the Lian tribal clan.\u201cYes, yes. Thank you Young master Lian,\u201d as some of the people knelt down and kowtowed towards the Patriarch\u2019s compound.Zhao Tiezhu was pleased with the outcome. He had distributed most of the pills and bacon. There were two pieces of bacon left, one of it was the biggest piece, and the other was the smallest piece.Of course the biggest piece was left for himself. When Lian Chengyu allowed him to distribute the bacon, he had already reserved the largest piece for himself.There was a count of the number of pieces of bacon, so it was a problem if there was one less. The solution was to cut out a small piece from the second largest piece of bacon.Of course, this piece was the smallest piece of bacon. He gave this smallest piece of bacon to Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cThis is yours.\u201d Zhao Tiezhu said it straight.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Seeing the tiny piece of bacon, Jiang Xiaorou knew Zhao Tiezhu had did it on purpose. However, she knew it was pointless to argue, so she accepted the piece of bacon.Yun-er had not had meat in a long while.\u201cHow\u2019s your brother?\u201d said Zhao Tiezhu lazily as he kept the largest piece of bacon.\u201cDidn\u2019t I say so earlier!\u201d replied Jiang Xiaorou sharply.\u201cHehe, let me follow you back. What can I do, I have a good heart and I care for the citizens,\u201d said Zhao Tiezhu as he made a division between himself and the commoners. The word \u201ccitizens\u201d was extremely irksome to the ears.As for why he wanted to see Yi Yun was partly due to Lian Chengyu\u2019s instructions, or he couldn\u2019t be bothered less. Zhao Tiezhu did not understand why Lian Chengyu was taking such care for the little monkey.Actually, Lian Chengyu had only said it to Zhao Tiezhu casually, and did not take it to heart. He had aspirations higher than the sky, to become one who lords above all, and enjoy endless riches. Why would he bother about some small character like Yi Yun?He was just curious why Yi Yun had not died all this while.He had fell off a cliff when picking herbs the first time. He was even able to dig himself out after being buried.The second time was when he had secretly transmitted a fatal Yuan Qi into Yi Yun\u2019s body, but Yi Yun still did not die.Lian Chengyu wanted to know that with the refining of the desolate bones\u2013the desolate bone\u2019s frost poison together with the toxicity of the Blood Thinning Pills, could Yi Yun still survive it?To Lian Chengyu, Yi Yun was like a c*ckroach. Although a c*ckroach was small and weak, it had an extremely tenacious vitality. Even after being squashed with its organs burst and losing the capacity to move, a c*ckroach could still survive a day or two without food and water.Yi Yun was similar. Although he was so weak, he had survived numerous death experiences.\u201cPeng!\u201dThe yard door was kicked opened. Jiang Xiaorou asked with a crisp angry voice, \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d\u201cHaha, to see your brother.\u201d Zhao Tiezhu strutted in and saw Yi Yun lying on the bed.Yi Yun\u2019s face was covered in sweat. His hair was wet and sticking to his forehead. There was a pot that seemed to contain vomit, emitting a foul stench.\u201cDamn it, it\u2019s noxious!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu pinched his nose and passed the Blood Thinning Pill to Yi Yun, \u201cI don\u2019t really know what dog sh*t luck you have, to be able to get special treatment from Young master Lian. You look worse than a beggar of beggars. Looking at you makes me feel sick. Quickly eat this pill!\u201dYi Yun picked up the Blood Thinning Pill on his blanket with a deadpan expression. Jiang Xiaorou rushed forward with a bowl of water.When Yi Yun held the Blood Thinning Pill, he could feel the energetic properties of the pill.There were pathetic amounts of energy in it. It did not contain any valuable herbs, but contained a very poisonous substance.A good pill contained energy within it. The pill\u2019s medicinal essence would spread through the body when a person consumes it. It will then naturally heal injuries, giving the person a new lease of life.But a bad pill like the Blood Thinning Pill contained nearly no energy. It used the toxic substance to stimulate a person\u2019s potential, without any concern for the consequences.So although a person could recover quickly after eating this pill, it would greatly shorten the person\u2019s life.For a pill that did more harm than good, Yi Yun of course did not eat it.Although Zhao Tiezhu was looking from the side, it wasn\u2019t hard for Yi Yun to deceive him. He ate the Blood Thinning Pill and drank a mouthful of water. It seemed like he drank a lot of water, but when the bowl was removed, Yi Yun had spit out all the water back into the bowl.Following that, Yi Yun looked as if it took a lot of work to swallow, but his mouth contained no water, so naturally nothing was actually swallowed.Immediately following that, Yi Yun would pretend that his body was weak to point that he had difficulties even in drinking water, and would cough violently.Jiang Xiaorou came forward with a cloth to wipe Yi Yun\u2019s mouth. In the process of wiping his mouth, Yi Yun spit out the Blood Thinning Pill without any trace, leaving the pill in the cloth.With the cloth scrunched up, nothing could be seen.Zhao Tiezhu was full of disregard and impatience, so he did not see through Yi Yun\u2019s act. Even if it was Lian Chengyu who came, he would probably not have seen Yi Yun spit out the pill.After all, Yi Yun had the appearance of a twelve-year-old. Who would think that he could be capable of such acts?\u201cCount your blessings! After eating this pill, it will not only save your life, but it will make you more energetic. It\u2019s better than looking like a ill-ridden weakling!\u201d Saying that, Zhao Tiezhu walked off.After Zhao Tiezhu left, Yi Yun scrutinized the Blood Thinning Pill in the cloth with a flash in his eyes. This Lian Chengyu is so cruel. To refine that set of desolate bones, he was prepared to kill numerous people!This strange world was unlike Earth.On Earth, there would be instances where a child brings a knife to school to stab another child to death after a quarrel between the two. These kind of situations were rare, and only seen on news networks like Tencent.But in this power-oriented strange world, such matters where someone could be killed over some words, eh\u2026Could it still be labeled a matter?Because of the peaceful rule of law on Earth, murder was a huge deal, but over here, murder was as commonplace as slaughtering cattle.In fact, plenty of times, killing someone did not need a reason. Not looking right was sufficient reason\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His \u201crecovery\u201d was the fastest for he simply needed to wipe off the fake sweat\u2013water he had sprayed on his face.As such, Yi Yun headed to the grain-sunning ground the next morning as if full of energy,After this bout of illness, Yi Yun and the group changed from the night shift to the day shift. This suited Yi Yun\u2019s wishes since he could no longer learn much more from Yao Yuan\u2019s \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d. Yao Yuan was not planning to teach the remaining stances, but the first few stances was enough to occupy Yi Yun for a period of time.Refining the desolate bones in the day, and practicing in the back mountains at night made it more covert.\u201cKiddo Yun, is your body feeling better?\u201d asked the auntie from next door. She had seen Yi Yun skipping down the road, as if he had excessive energy.\u201cAuntie Wang, I\u2019m totally fine! Thanks to Young master Lian\u2019s elixir! Young master Lian is such a great person!\u201d smiled Yi Yun, with a look of gratitude. As he went down the road, he boasted to others about the effectiveness of the Blood Thinning Pill.\u201cThat\u2019s great, that\u2019s great!\u201d Auntie Wang said as she saw Yi Yun\u2019s energy, knowing that he had fully recovered.For an adult like Yi Yun, it was pretty awkward for him to skip down the road, but he was after all a twelve-year-old child in the eyes of others.The age of twelve was when kids were the most playful. Yi Yun was \u201cnoticed\u201d by Lian Chengyu because Lian Chengyu had felt he was too mature, unlike a child.A twelve year old had to behave like a twelve year old. If he acted as one occasionally, it would reassure people that nothing was out of the norm.\u201cMy family\u2019s man wanted to brew that bone soup thingy, but too bad he was not able to. Kiddo Yun, you sure are lucky.\u201d Auntie Wang said with envy.\u201cHa ha, Auntie Wang, There\u2019s still some bacon left from the one I received. I\u2019ll give you a piece tonight.\u201d Yi Yun said casually; he did not cherish this piece of bacon that were coveted by all these poor commoners.Actually, Yi Yun had cut a small piece from the bacon to feed a dog. Of course, that dog did not belong to Yi Yun\u2019s family for a poor family did not have the means to rear a dog. Even if they did, the dog would have long been slaughtered and eaten.In the entire Lian tribal clan, only the warrior preparation camp reared a few dogs. All of these dogs were hunting dogs. As there were few wild beasts near the wonderland, searching for rabbits without hunting dogs would be no different from searching for a needle in a haystack.Yi Yun had fed the meat to the dogs because he was worried that Lian Chengyu had poisoned the bacon. Although it was unlikely, Yi Yun had to be cautious.After seeing that the dog was all right, Yi Yun then allowed Jiang Xiaorou to use the meat for cooking.Yi Yun had not enjoyed the taste of meat for ages. However, the taste of the bacon wasn\u2019t great, as it had been cured far too long. The meat was hard and tasted like wood. It only tasted salty and lacked the fragrance of meat.But for such a piece of bacon, Jiang Xiaorou had insisted on leaving it for Yi Yun, and refused to eat it. Yi Yun took a lot of effort to convince Jiang Xiaorou to have a small bite.Yi Yun did not eat much himself. He even hung the remaining meat on the wall.Yi Yun had aimed for the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior selection in two months; hence he was not concerned about this tasteless piece of bacon. He had heard from Jiang Xiaorou that the Auntie Wang from next door had taken care of them in the past, especially in the years after Yi Yun\u2019s mother had passed away. Jiang Xiaorou was always out of food before the ration distribution, and if not for Auntie Wang giving them some food, they would have long starved to death.It was a great, kind debt, after all few people would give their food to others in this world. It was much more difficult than lending money on Earth.Hence, giving this piece of bacon to Auntie Wang was fitting.\u201cHow\u2026How can you. Kiddo Yun, you and your sister are undergoing puberty, it was hard for you to obtain this meat. Auntie can\u2019t accept it!\u201d Auntie Wang said firmly, giving mixed feelings to Yi Yun.In this poor and backward tribe, although there were many obstinate citizens and wicked people, but there were people like Auntie Wang who thought of others even when they were starving.Such a land could actually produce all kinds of people.\u201cAuntie Wang, Xiaoke is also in the growing stage. Even if you don\u2019t eat it, Xiaoke would need too.\u201d Auntie Wang\u2019s child, Zhou Xiaoke was about the same age as Yi Yun. When they were young, she used to follow Yi Yun all around.With Xiaoke growing up and full of life, together with Yi Yun\u2019s resurrection, the two had interacted a lot less.\u201cAuntie, say no more. I\u2019m going to brew the bone soup.\u201d Yi Yun did not wait for Auntie Wang\u2019s reply before running away.\u201cThis kid!\u201d Auntie Wang shook her head, but a happy smile plastered her face.In the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch compound, Lian Chengyu was standing in the middle of the stone courtyard, practicing his boxing.He wore a loose practice suit. This practice suit was made of a rare silk fabric uncommonly found in the Lian tribal clan. It was very expensive. This practice suit was smooth and soft to the touch, and was extremely comfortable when worn.Lian Chengyu walked in circles in with varying speeds. When he was slow, he was like an old man exercising in the morning, but when he was fast, he was like a cheetah hunting a prey.Through it all, Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyes were focused on his fingertips. His arms were like a snake sliding through the woods, making it difficult to determine where he would launch his attack .Zhao Tiezhu stood silently by the side, waiting for Lian Chengyu to finish his practice.After about half an hour, Lian Chengyu was finally done.He held his hands by his waist and spit out a breath arrow. This arrow flew far without dissipating.Spitting out a breath arrow was the symbol of the Vigor realm, but Lian Chengyu\u2019s breath was no longer a simple Vigor realm\u2019s breath. It was powered from the Mortal Blood\u2019s fifth level, Qi Gatherer. Lian Chengyu was able to gather the Yuan Qi from the environment into his body, so the air he spit out was not only air, but also consisted of Yuan Qi!\u201cFabulous! It\u2019s absolutely fabulous!\u201d shouted Zhao Tiezhu as he saw Lian Chengyu finish. His eyes lit up as he began to kiss ass.\u201cThis strength, this skill, in the warrior selection in two months, Young master will definitely become a Kingdom Knight of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu began his flattery once again. Lian Chengyu\u2019s strength was indeed not bad. For him to have that ambition, he had to have the means to do so. He had reached the fifth level of Mortal Blood the previous year, so the few punches he displayed were reminiscent of a master\u2019s.\u201cCut the crap, how is the refining of the desolate bones?\u201d\u201cEverything is going as per normal!\u201d It has to be normal!\u201d said Zhao Tiezhu as he patted his chest. \u201cThose cheap people were extremely grateful after receiving Young master\u2019s bacon and drugs. They wish they could refine the bones all day!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026Give them some of the herbal dregs then,\u201d said Lian Chengyu casually. The herbal dregs were of no more value to him. Suddenly, Lian Chengyu asked, \u201cRight, what happened to that Yi Yun?\u201d\u201cYi Yun\u2026\u201d Zhao Tiezhu gave a look of disdain. \u201cThat kid fell sick a few days ago and had diarrhea, and was covered with sweat. The entire house stank. He was no different from a beggar.\u201d\u201cIf not for Young master\u2019s mercy, he would have long died without the elixir! Lowly me followed Young master\u2019s instructions and saw with my own eyes that the kid swallowed the pill. But thankfully, that kid still has some conscience. These few days he had been going around singing praises of Young master, saying that he could recover all thanks to Young master\u2019s medicine!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s mouth formed into a gentle arc after listening to Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s narration.This tribe of cheap lives, each more foolish than the preceding one. He thought that there were a few clever ones in the tribe like Yi Yun, but it seemed he had worried too much.It was good, them being dumb allowed him to cover up any incidents in the future.\u201cMake sure to keep watch. The nearer we are to the end, the more we need to ensure that nothing goes wrong with the refining of the desolate bones. If it\u2019s refined successfully, I\u2019ll reward you greatly. If anything wrong happens, you will pay me with your head!\u201d Lian Chengyu said the last word with great killing intent, scaring Zhao Tiezhu into nodding incessantly.\u201cYoung master, don\u2019t worry. This servant will keep watch day and night, I will ensure that nothing goes wrong!\u201d\u2026Zhao Tiezhu hurried to the grain-sunning ground in a flurry. Yi Yun was still chopping wood in his usual unhurried manner. Yi Yun secretly smiled when he saw Zhao Tiezhu, it was true an idiot could do no harm.\u201cWhat are you looking at, get to work! Are you looking to die!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu roared and threw a big bag. When the bag was opened, out came a huge pile of herbal dregs.These were the remnants after Lian Chengyu finished soaking his body in.\u201cThis herbal dregs are a reward for you. The necessary supplementary drugs are in there too. Take them back and boil it in water. Soak your body in it while it\u2019s still hot, and it will benefit you much. Damn it, you guys really have it good!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu swore as he said those words. The men\u2019s eyes lit up after hearing it. They rushed to grab the herbal dregs.Of course, Yi Yun did not get any. Even if it was given to Yi Yun, he would not have wanted it. That was after all the bathwater of Lian Chengyu, would he want to soak in the leftover bath water? It must be a joke!Yi Yun still did the motions of lunging forward. When he did not get any, he just sighed.Seeing Yi Yun having such a slow response, and being dim-witted, Zhao Tiezhu could not help laughing. This idiot could not do anything even when in a hurry, what else could he do? He deserved starving to death!Zhao Tiezhu left, as the men carried on refining the desolate bones. The refinement process was to brew the desolate bones\u2019 essence in the Li Fire Water, and then evaporate all the Li Fire Water, allowing the dissolved essence to crystalize.The Li Fire Water\u2019s boiling point was extremely high, so it was not easy to evaporate it away. Countless amounts of firewood had been burnt. The men in charge of the refinement had their skin grilled red.But Yi Yun was an exception. His skin was still like a baby\u2019s bottom and his cheeks were rosy. This rosiness was not a result of the fire, but from the absorbing of the desolate bones\u2019 essence. Because he was well-nourished, his healthy body displayed a healthy pink.As Yi Yun looked at Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s back, he glanced at the huge cauldron. Again he had satiated his appetite, and could not wait to go \u201crampant\u201d on the back mountain.His body was full, but his fist could no longer wait!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Opening up the MeridiansPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29: Opening up the MeridiansAs the days went by, the Lian tribal clan\u2019s back mountain was dotted with Yi Yun\u2019s footsteps.Yi Yun would refine the bones at night, peek at the warrior preparation camp in the morning, and then spend the rest of the day in the back mountain cultivating. Only at dusk did he return home to sleep for two hours.Yi Yun\u2019s cultivation was extremely tough, but it also caused his strength to jump leaps and bounds.The back mountain was separated a distance from the herb mountain, and since his location was very far from the village, few people ever came here in the day. At night, there wasn\u2019t even a shadow, so Yi Yun could train at ease.Fifteen days later\u2013\u201cHa!\u201dYi Yun roared, as his body shot up like an arrow into the sky. He had leaped past a ten-meter-high rock!With the air ringing in his ears, every joint in Yi Yun\u2019s body cracked loudly like a dragon or tiger\u2019s roar!\u201cFierce Tiger Descends the Mountain!\u201d\u201cYi Yun kept his body taut with his feet pressed against his hip, before sending a punch flying out!\u201cTwang!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s body emitted a clear sound, it was the sound of a strong bow\u2019s twang. This was made by Yi Yun\u2019s tendons! Compared to Yao Yuan, this sound was even more intense!\u201cKa-cha!\u201dA huge rock crumbled in front of Yi Yun as he smashed through it with a punch!Spider web-like cracks appeared throughout the rock!This was no ordinary rock, but one made of black ironstone. It was stronger than ordinary rocks, but today it had been smashed by Yi Yun\u2019s punch.\u201cChirp! Chirp! Chirp!\u201dIn the forest, several birds flew away in fright. All the bugs and frogs quietened immediately due to the shock!At that moment, the entire mountain was silent. Only leaves and bird feathers fell to the ground, or onto Yi Yun\u2019s head and shoulders.Thunder Occurring in the Nine Clouds, Surprise Bow Drops Flock!My fists have reached such a state!Currently when Yi Yun exerted all his energies, his joints would crack loudly, with a thunderous sound; as for Surprise Bow Drops Flock, it would only be possible for a lone injured goose. Because even a nine-shi strongbow would have trouble intimidating a flock to drop.A casual movement of Yi Yun\u2019s body issued \u201cKa Ka Ka\u201d sounds. His bones were well forged like metal and his tendons were as strong as dragon ribs!\u201cMy current level has been fully consolidated. It\u2019s time to attempt at opening my channels, and enter the fourth realm of Meridians!\u201dThe human body had meridians, but ordinary people did not have their meridians opened, so they were unable to complete a circulation to accommodate the Yuan Qi from Heaven and Earth.When a warrior practiced the arts, he would attempt to clear his meridians after his body was completely trained. It was the first step on the path of martial arts.A human\u2019s channels consisted of twelve regular meridians and eight special meridians.The twelve regular meridians spread throughout a person\u2019s limbs. They were the three arm yin meridians (lung, pericardium, heart), three arm yang meridians (large intestine, triple burner, small intestine), three leg yang meridians (stomach, gall bladder, bladder), and three leg yin meridians (spleen, liver, kidney).As for the eight special meridians, they spread throughout the body. The most two important special meridians were the Ren Du Er Mai.The position of the Ren Du Er Mai is in the central axis line of a person, and will be seen as a straight line from the front.The Ren vein is located in the front, while the Du vein is in the back. The two lines circle into a bundle in a person\u2019s body, passing through the Dan Tian and Hui Yin. Like two ropes that passed through a person\u2019s crotch, they held up a person\u2019s body.There were broken channels between the Ren Du Er Mai. When the Ren Du Er Mai was opened up, the broken channels would heal up, forming a central expressway for a person\u2019s energy to fully circulate. So to be able to open up the Ren Du Er Mai was an important step to opening up the entire body\u2019s meridians.In the Wuxia novels Yi Yun had previously read, there were multiple ways to open the Ren Du Er Mai.For example, Zhang Wuji used the \u2018Heaven and Earth Great Shift\u2019 to open up his meridians. While Xuzhu opened up his meridians by inheriting the powers of Li Qiushui and Tonglao.Including the ancient medical books, there were multiple records on how to open up the Ren Du Er Mai. The moment the Ren Du Er Mai was opened, a person would be rejuvenated, and enjoy a boost in power.The perfect outcome of the meridians would pave the way for a higher realm of martial arts in the future.Yi Yun crossed his legs and sat down. He began to accumulate his energies to open up his meridians!As long as he opened up his meridians, Yi Yun\u2019s strength would be about the same level as a peerless expert from those wuxia novels.In ancient China, he would be able to walk up walls, settle any grievances, and behead the general of an entire enemy division.There were two ways to open up the Ren Du Er Mai. One was to rely on external help, while the other was to depend on himself.In the novels, there would be peerless experts helping the main character to open up the Ren Du Er Mai, causing the main character to increase in strength. This was also known as \u201cpower transfer\u201d.It may be fast, but it was not the proper way. It was better to cultivate by himself.Of course Yi Yun chose the second method of opening up his meridians by himself.Written in the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d was a way to open up the meridians. By sitting cross-legged, every breath should be made as long as possible.Once a warrior reaches the third level of Mortal Blood, their breaths would mix with the energy accumulated in their body causing a circulation that spread like fire!Yi Yun consciously sent that energy to his Dan Tian, and compressed it!Again and again, Yi Yun\u2019s body was filled with energy. His breaths increased in speed, but each breath was deeper than the last.Obtaining the essence of the Sun and Moon, and breathing in the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi!If someone looked from a distance, they would see Yi Yun\u2019s body engulfed in a thin layer of faint light.Especially Yi Yun\u2019s chest. There was a purple light concentrated there which slowly spread throughout his body.This was the light the Purple Crystal Origins emitted after absorbing the Yuan Qi from the surroundings. When Yi Yun breathed out, the Purple Crystal in his heart would absorb the energies from the surroundings, helping Yi Yun\u2019s last effort in trying to open up the meridians.Slowly, the purple light surrounding Yi Yun grew denser. This purple light resembled the ancient Chinese legends of \u201cPurple Air Comes From The East\u201d, a symbol of a saint!With the energy accumulated time and time again, Yi Yun\u2019s body began to make sounds resembling the roars of dragons and tigers. His blood flow was like a mighty stream, flowing without restraint!With each breath, the air around Yi Yun swirled rapidly. It was as astonishing as a whale sucking in water.\u201cPhew\u2013Phew\u2013Phew\u2013\u201dYi Yun\u2019s breaths became more and more heavy. Every breath would muster up his body, his body was like a boat being roughed up by the waves.As his body moved up and down, the energy in Yi Yun\u2019s body began to condense.His tendons began to emit twang-like sounds, while his skin was like blown up leather. His bones emitted popping sounds.When this accumulated to its extremes, Yi Yun felt his body about to explode. He controlled his energy and sent the heat flow towards his Dan Tian, wave after wave, as if they were crashing on the rocks!Yi Yun slowly began to approach his limit. When the small vessels on the surface of his body was about to burst, he heard a \u201cboom\u201d. With Yi Yun in the center, energy exploded out. The rock Yi Yun was sitting on cracked, and the trees in a five-meter radius broke!Yi Yun felt his body go limp. His nostrils, ears were all bleeding. But this wasn\u2019t fresh blood but black blood. Including Yi Yun\u2019s pores, a greyish sweat pulp oozed out.It\u2019s done.Fourth level of Mortal Blood\u2013Meridians!Yi Yun knew that he had finally opened up his meridians, and had become equal to a hero from a wuxia novel.When Yi Yun read novels in his youth, he had often dreamed of becoming a handsome gallant, walking up walls, upholding justice and settling grievances.As for today, he had finally obtained that power.However, in this strange world, the energy was much richer than on Earth. Opening up the Ren Du Er Mai on Earth would make one a peerless master, but that would be because Earth did not have the \u201cHeaven Earth Yuan Qi\u201d.But in this world, not only was there Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, there was also Power of Desolates, psychic powers and other mysterious energies Yi Yun was still unable to understand. These energies were as powerful as the nuclear powers on Earth.These energies could be used by himself, so the fourth stage of Mortal Blood, Meridians was just infant steps on the path of martial arts.Yi Yun leaped up from the ground. He could clearly see and feel his surroundings. He knew everything that occurred within a ten-foot radius, every rustle of the leaves and every squirm of a worm was heard loud and clear.He could count the number of leaves that had dropped in front of him with a glance. There were thirty-two leaves!With a clear awareness and a sharp mind, many martial artist experts had an eidetic memory. This was a result of their meridians opening up resulting in an improvement of their brain\u2019s capabilities!After all, the Ren Du Er Mai cycles through the brain, with the energy passing through the brain, it improves a person\u2019s memory and reactions.\u201cIt feels awesome. So awesome!\u201dHaving undergone a body transformation, Yi Yun was extremely delighted. He had perfectly broken through into the fourth level of Mortal Blood\u2019s Meridians. Not only that, he had experienced another round of Marrow Cleansing.Mortals eat all sorts of grains causing their bodies to be filled with impurities. Before reaching the Purple Blood realm, it was a necessity to undergo a round of Marrow Cleansing.The more thorough a Marrow Cleansing was, the better it was. Yi Yun having gone through it twice, had less dirt than the previous time.Yi Yun undressed himself and jumped into the plunge basin for a bath. He dived dozens of meters deep, and held his breath underwater for about twenty minutes before swimming back up.\u201cPuah!\u201dYi Yun emerged out of the water like a giant carp, creating an explosion of water droplets!He was buck naked. Without any change of clothes, Yi Yun wore his old damp clothes.This set of clothes was soaked with water. It stuck to Yi Yun\u2019s body, clearly outlining the firm curves of his body.After days of arduous practice, Yi Yun\u2019s muscles had grown firmer, and his body shape was getting better by the day. He had also grown taller, becoming a handsome young lad.Yi Yun gave off a brand new aura after breaking into the Meridians realm.He stood on a large rock, with his body like a sheathed sword. He had an overpowering presence. Under the soft moonlight, it illuminated Yi Yun\u2019s delicate skin, making it shimmer like mercury.Such a young lad no longer looked like a poor kid who had nothing to eat.Although he was like an uncarved sculpture, he was like a diamond in the rough. The clothes he wore could only be described as \u201crags\u201d, but it could not conceal his shimmering aura.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Jin Long WeiPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30: Jin Long Wei*Having broken into the Meridian realm, the world seemed different to Yi Yun.He did not need to use the Purple Crystal Origins to perceive the ubiquitous Yuan Qi in this world. This Yuan Qi was like the air; it would enter his body with each breath and be exhausted from his pores. This subtly changed Yi Yun\u2019s physique.Heaven Earth Yuan Qi had a higher grade of energy than food.Normal people ate grains, but a cultivator could use the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi as their energy source. Upon reaching a certain level, they could avoid eating grains completely.In ancient China, \u201cZhuang Zi\u2013A Happy Excursion\u201d contained the records of \u201cdoesn\u2019t eat the five grains, but sucks the wind and drinks the dew\u201d.It meant that a person could survive solely on the energies provided by the Heaven and Earth, losing the need to eat the five grains. Such a survival method allowed a person\u2019s body to be purer. With fewer impurities, they could also live longer.The ancients held this state in high esteem, so there were plenty of documentation in the ancient books.Of course, Yi Yun was still far from the state of avoiding grains. Yi Yun felt that even if he had reached the state where he could avoid grains, he felt that he would never succumb to that state.On Earth, Yi Yun was a glutton, erm\u2026that lacks sophistication. It should be said that Yi Yun was a food connoisseur \u2013 yes, a food connoisseur. The former was a symbol of laziness and gluttony, while the latter was for someone who could enjoy the beauties of life.Yi Yun not only enjoyed eating, he was also a good cook. He had lived alone for a long time on Earth. Although his dishes were not comparable to a top chef, his home-cooking was absolutely delicious.If Yi Yun had worked hard to build a career after two years, with his looks and culinary skills, he would be an extremely eligible bachelor in the eyes of women.Unfortunately, with the tunneling through space-time, he had to start from scratch. In the poor and sufferable Lian tribal clan, Yi Yun could not display his culinary skills.Yi Yun could only hope that he would lead a good life in the future. He would set up a table of delicacies to reward himself. As for avoiding grain, sucking the wind, drinking the dew can all go to hell. Such a way of living was terrifying. If he could not satisfy his tastebuds, wouldn\u2019t that be a great loss in the pleasures of life?Having arrived in this strange world for a month, the only meat Yi Yun had seen was that piece of bacon. Although it tasted bad, it was still meat. With the bacon finished, there was only coarse grain porridge. Yi Yun\u2019s tastebuds were crying in dissatisfaction.Of course, under his conditions, Yi Yun could only endure the gut-wrenching hunger, and replenish his energy using the desolate bones essence.Thankfully, the desolate bones essence tasted great.Since the Lian tribal clan has withheld the food, leaving no food for me, I\u2019ll eat their desolate bones essence!After all, he had already decided to absorb the desolate bones essence clean. Yi Yun was not planning to stand on ceremony and decided to absorb as much essence as he wanted today with the aid of the Purple Crystal\u2019s capabilities.It was what Yi Yun had always been doing, but there was a disruption in his plans today.At dawn, Yi Yun realized that the tribe was extremely lively when he returned to the village.The young and old from the tribe had came out of their houses. They had gathered in the square in front of the Patriarch\u2019s compound, causing the tiny square to be filled with people.In the midst of the crowd, there was a massive object about the size of a hill.Yi Yun focused on it and was surprised. That small hill like object was a huge beast!This\u2026Yi Yun was stunned, how could such a huge beast appear in the Lian tribal clan? Looking at the head of the beast, it was absolutely mighty. One such beast could easily level the entire Lian tribal clan!But with so many people crowding around it, the huge beast clearly was not on the offensive, cohabiting with the Lian tribe in that small space peacefully.Oh?Yi Yun\u2019s mind suddenly flashed, \u201cThis beast\u2026\u201dHe recalled to the day he had crossed into this world. He had seen a huge beast running in the wilderness while returning home with Jiang Xiaorou!That beast was about ten meters long, with sharp fangs and muscular limbs that resembled metal pillars. Its running speed was extremely fast.And on the back of that monster was a man, who had a sword slung on his back. That man\u2019s aura was commanding and extremely terrifying.That scene had left a deep impression on Yi Yun. After all, being an earthling, such a scene was extremely shocking.And now, this huge beast in the square looked identical to that beast running through the fields. It might even be the same beast!Yi Yun suddenly understood that someone important had arrived in the Lian tribal clan. This huge beast was the VIP\u2019s mount!How could Yi Yun miss such an important matter? He flew quickly towards the square.En route, Yi Yun saw the villagers celebrating, as if it were the new year.Yi Yun also listened in to the conversations. These conversations made Yi Yun\u2019s heart race.The owner of the huge beast was a member of the Jin Long Wei!The Jin Long Wei was the elite military division of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. The levels of the leading members were above the Purple Blood realm!With the basic units comprised of Purple Blood warriors, the Jin Long Wei\u2019s battle prowess wasunbeatable!The person who founded the Jin Long Wei was the founding emperor of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. Back then, the Tai Ah Emperor led the Jin Long Wei across the lands, laying the foundation of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom.This devastating division, the Jin Long Wei carried on its legacy till now, for an unknown number of generations.Chosen personnels at the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior selection would enter the Jin Long Wei reserves. They would first cultivate in the reserves, and after passing the evaluations, they could become an official member.But to pass the evaluations was extremely difficult. If they failed the final evaluation, they would be sent to the regular army. It will then end their journey towards being an elite member of the Jin Long Wei.\u201cIf he\u2019s a Jin Long Wei member, then that is to say this person who came to our tribe must be at least a Purple Blood warrior.\u201dA Purple Blood warrior from the Jin Long Wei was totally different in battle prowess from a Purple Blood warrior born from the Cloud Wilderness.In actual fact, the Jin Long Wei member who came to the Lian tribal clan was an expert at the peak of the Purple Blood realm.Having reached such a level, and having been well honed in the Jin Long Wei, his battle prowess was unmatchable. He was an elite warrior of the Jin Long Wei!For such a person who came to the vast wilderness, even the Patriarch of a hundred thousand large tribe would have to bow respectfully.To the Lian tribal clan, such a status was terrifying.As such, the upper echelon of the Lian Chengyu went all out. Lian Chengyu and the Patriarch put on their biggest smiles while leading the welcoming party.Yi Yun had also seen it clearly. The man was the same man he had seen when he first arrived into this strange world. He had a commanding aura, and exerted a pressure even from afar.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed him!\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s mind began to light up. This was the second time meeting him.Having met him just after tunneling into this world, it was definitely not a coincidence.Thinking it through, ever since coming into this world, and from his understanding of the Cloud Wilderness, he knew that the Cloud Wilderness, and especially the Lian tribal clan, was a poor tribe that no expert would ever bother with.That is to say, being an elite of the Jin Long Wei, he must have his reasons for staying around the Lian tribal clan for such a long period. But what could be the reason?\u2026*Translator Note: Jin Long (\u9526\u9f99) means beautiful, bright dragon. Jin Long Wei will roughly mean Bright Dragon Guard.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 - PreliminariesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31: PreliminariesAs Yi Yun was in deep thought, someone caught his glance.Ever since breaking into the Meridians realm, his five senses were extremely keen. He spotted Jiang Xiaorou who was looking around while tip-toeing among the tumultuous masses.\u201cSis Xiaorou!\u201d Yi Yun let out a cry.\u201cYun-er!\u201d Having seen Yi Yun, Jiang Xiaorou was pleased. \u201cOh, Yun-er you\u2026\u201dShe felt that a difference in Yi Yun today, but she could not put her thumb on it.If one were to describe the Yi Yun of the past, it would be a submissive harmless child. The present Yi Yun was that of a smart-looking handsome young lad. Even his rag-like clothes could not suppress Yi Yun\u2019s aura of elegance.A diamond in the rough\u2026Jiang Xiaorou suddenly recalled this phrase. Every good sword was hidden within a sheath, waiting for the day it would be unsheathed.The present Yi Yun gave Jiang Xiaorou such a feeling.However, only Jiang Xiaorou could feel that difference because she was extremely familiar with Yi Yun from their constant interaction. For people not familiar with Yi Yun, they would only find something different and brush it off. After all, Yi Yun was a ill kid who was good for nothing.\u201cSis Xiaorou, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Yi Yun laughed. He knew that his aura had changed after breaking through into the Meridians realm. \u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s going on.\u201dHe grabbed Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s hand naturally and pushed through the crowd. Having reached the Meridians realm, an invisible force would push the people apart with a stretch of his hand, allowing him easy passage. People who came round to figuring out what happened would only see a kid passing through.By the time they had a response, they would think that Yi Yun\u2019s body was small, allowing him to squeeze through the masses.\u2026At the center of the square, the Lian tribal clan upper echelon were still carefully giving the sword bearer a proper reception.\u201cChengyu, give the order. Kill the cows and set up a feast!\u201d The Patriarch waved his hand, although his heart ached.The tribe reared a few cattle. It was the entire fortune of the Lian tribal clan. Although the cattle looked similar to the cattle on Earth, their strength was much greater.In the wilderness, rocks littered the ground. Some of the rocks were black ironstone. Opening up a piece of land for agriculture was extremely difficult. Without the cattle, the Lian tribal clan would not be able to produce any food. And when that happens, the Lian tribal clan would totally rely on the Tao tribal clan for food.Hence, in the Lian tribal clan, each cow\u2019s value was worth more than ten lives. It sounded pathetic, but that was reality.With the Jin Long Wei arriving in the Lian tribal clan, the tribe had to entertain the guests. However, the tribe had been tightening the belt for the refinement of the desolate bones, so there was no food left. They could only resort to killing the cattle.The sword bearer naturally knew that the small tribes in the wilderness led tough lives. He said coolly, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to kill the cattle. I met several fierce beasts, who attacked me on the way here. I killed them and stored the meat on the Near-horn beast as rations. You just need to get people to take it down and cook it.\u201dThe man may have said it without any flair, but the people of the Lian tribal clan were shocked.In the Cloud Wilderness, there were three types of beasts that would attack humans. They were the wild beasts, fierce beasts and the desolate beasts!Wild beasts were the most common kind of beasts. They were similar to tigers and leopards on Earth. An experienced hunter, even if they lacked martial arts would be able to capture one using traps.As for fierce beasts, they were a power unto itself. They were comparable in strength to a Purple Blood warrior!There were extremely many fierce beasts in the Cloud Wilderness. In fact, the greatest threat hunters of the tribe who went out to hunt, were these fierce beasts.Although desolate beasts were strong, but they would lay dormant in areas known as \u201cDesolate Lands\u201d that had dense amounts of Power of Desolates. As long as one avoided the \u201cDesolate Lands\u201d, they would be safe.However the spread of fierce beasts was too wide, it was unavoidable!A Purple Blood realm warrior had the ability to hunt, not only because they had the ability to kill many fierce beasts, but because if they couldn\u2019t defeat one, they had no trouble escaping.This sword bearer had crossed the wilderness and easily killed numerous fierce beasts. Such strength was very enviable!Lian Chengyu took a deep breath and clenched his fists. The large bulging bag on the Near-horn beast was clearly the meat hunted from the fierce beasts.\u201cOne day, I would eventually have that strength, and would even far exceed that!\u201d Lian Chengyu decided.Hearing that they did not need to kill the cattle, the Patriarch was delighted. Still he politely said, \u201cHow can that do? We can\u2019t let a guest prepare the food. Our Lian tribal clan may be poor but\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough, you don\u2019t have to carry on. My trip here is on official business,\u201d said the sword bearer with an authoritative voice. He was not interested in the fake niceties the Lian tribal clan displayed.\u201cHigh Ambassador, please speak! Although my Lian tribal clan is nothing, but it has thousands of people. If the High Ambassador has any requests that would need us, please speak your mind!\u201d The Patriarch spoke humbly without any vexation from having his words cut off. He knew that a member of the Jin Long Wei would not come to such a worthless place like the Lian tribal clan.The man said, \u201cRecently, the Cloud Wilderness had a huge event. And the location of the Lian tribal clan happens to be within the area of the event! The Jin Long Wei is here for that reason.\u201dAs the man\u2019s voice tapered off, the Patriarch\u2019s expression changed. Something happened in the Cloud Wilderness?Furthermore, from the tone of his words, he was just one of the many Jin Long Wei members who came.An event that could be considered great by the Jin Long Wei was something the Lian tribal clan could not even fathom. He did not know if it was a blessing or curse for the Lian tribal clan to be within the event\u2019s area of influence.If they got engulfed by such a big matter, the ant-like existence of the Lian tribal clan would be extinguished without a sound.Seeing the Patriarch\u2019s expression, the man said coolly, \u201cThis matter shouldn\u2019t involve you. However, there will be plenty of people passing the vicinities of your tribe. There may be many big shots among them. It\u2019s best not to offend them.\u201d\u201cYes, old me will bear what High Ambassador says in mind,\u201d nodded the Patriarch.The man carried on, \u201cMy visit to the Lian tribal clan was a matter of convenience. My superiors have ordered me to give you some pointers in preparation for the soon-to-be Kingdom\u2019s selection!\u201dHaving said that, the man turned towards the tribe. His voice was loud and clear even ten miles away.Momentarily, the rambunctious crowd was silenced.\u201cMy name is Zhang Yuxian. Remember well. My visit here to the Lian tribal clan is to choose thirty youngsters below the age of twenty-eight as my temporary disciples. I will give pointers on your stances and techniques!\u201d\u201cI will only be here for about three to five days. You will need to work hard. If you understand the content I teach, you will definitely pass the Kingdom\u2019s selection!\u201dThe Lian tribal clan held their breath the moment Zhang Yuxian said those words.The Kingdom\u2019s selection!It was tied to their future. The entire tribe had burnt their bridges to ensure that Lian Chengyu passed the warrior selection!The members of the warrior preparation camp were especially excited. They were so excited that they had trouble breathing.An expert from the Jin Long Wei actually came to their Lian tribal clan to give them pointers on their skills and techniques. This was such a good thing!They did not harbor any hope at passing the Kingdom\u2019s selection, but if they received Zhang Yuxian\u2019s pointers, and learned an advanced skill from the Jin Long Wei, it would aid them in their future growth!When Lian Chengyu eventually passed the Kingdom\u2019s selection and entered the city, those who were stronger could win themselves riches!\u201cThe thirty people will be chosen by me. The participants of the Kingdom\u2019s selection will also be chosen from those thirty! In other words, those not chosen by me will not be qualified to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection!\u201d After hearing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words, Yi Yun suddenly understood. This Zhang Yuxian was the Kingdom selection\u2019s first examiner.The Kingdom\u2019s selection was rarely held in the Cloud Wilderness. There was a lack of resources in the Cloud Wilderness, so the warriors\u2019 average strength was low. Since the distribution was wide, it was hard to hold an examination. To ensure that all the tribes could participate in an examination would involve large amounts of manpower and resources.So having an experienced elite Jin Long Wei like Zhang Yuxian do a preliminary selection would save a lot of time!\u201cNow, all those who wish to become a temporary disciple of mine by participating in a three day training period, and wish to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection, step forward. I will choose thirty!\u201d A commotion arose the moment Zhang Yuxian finished his sentence.The members of the warrior preparation camp were the first to lunge forward with all their might.Those who knew how to read the attitudes like Zhao Tiezhu first looked at Lian Chengyu for approval before they squeezed forward to be before Zhang Yuxian.In a short moment, the entire warrior preparation camp\u2019s members had stood forward.There were about sixty people in the warrior preparation camp, and those who matched the age requirement numbered about forty.Zhang Yuxian was only going to choose thirty, which meant there would be about a dozen people who would be eliminated!The weaker members of the warrior preparation camp became nervous, afraid they would be brushed off by Zhang Yuxian.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 - The weak are enslaved as slavesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32: The weak are enslaved as slaves\u201cEveryone is here, Lord Zhang. Please take your pick. Of course, lowly me will want to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection. If possible, I wish to be a subordinate of the Lord, receiving the Lord\u2019s teachings,\u201d said Lian Chengyu respectfully.Zhang Yuxian took a glance at Lian Chengyu and measured him up.\u201cOh? What is your cultivation level?\u201dA Mortal Blood warrior was after all in the beginning stages of cultivation, all they practiced were skills that involved their bodies. The five levels in Mortal Blood were classified by a person\u2019s physical phenomena. Hence, it was hard to tell with a look that a person had opened up their meridians, or if their bones and tendons could make sounds.Only a person who had reached a cultivation level at the spiritual level could sense a person\u2019s level of accomplishment. This was called \u201cOpening Heaven\u2019s Eyes\u201d. Only then could they judge a Mortal Blood warrior\u2019s cultivation level.Evidently, Zhang Yuxian had not reached such a level.\u201cAnswering the Lord, lowly me has reached the peak of Mortal Blood level five, Qi Gatherer. I\u2019m one step short of the Purple Blood realm!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Zhang Yuxian furrowed his brows. \u201cTo be able to reach such a level while growing up in a small tribe that lacks resources. You must either have exceptional talent or have had an opportunous event. Either way, it\u2019s all very good!\u201dZhang Yuxian nodded saying, \u201cStay behind then!\u201d\u201cThank you for the Lord\u2019s appraisal!\u201d Lian Chengyu said respectfully. He was not overjoyed because he had taken for granted that he would pass Zhang Yuxian\u2019s assessment!His goal was the Kingdom\u2019s selection. If he could not even pass the preliminaries, there was no point talking about his high ambitions.After choosing Lian Chengyu, Zhang Yuxian turned his head and looked towards the members of the warrior preparation camp. He stared at them for five minutes before feeling a sense of disappointment.Besides Lian Chengyu, no one else in the entire Lian tribal clan caught his eye.He could only choose a general from among the dwarves. He reluctantly began choosing some.Although he was ordered by his superiors to choose thirty, Zhang Yuxian had his own principles. He could not be bothered to teach those who seriously lacked talent.\u201cIs there no one else in the Lian tribal clan who want to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201d Zhang Yuxian\u2019s eyes swept through the commoners of the Lian tribal clan.Coming into contact with Zhang Yuxian\u2019s glance, the people were a prudent lot. They too wanted to be given pointers from a legendary person like Zhang Yuxian. But they could not even make ends meet, so they knew no martial arts. Even if they stood forward, they would be brushed off by Zhang Yuxian.It would only be humiliating to step forward; the entire tribe will mock his feeble attempts.The commoners\u2019 reaction was within Lian Chengyu\u2019s expectations, he laughed saying, \u201cSorry for the joke displayed before the Lord, the ones who practice martial arts in the tribe are all here. As for the rest, they are commoners who are good for nothings. They are only good for agriculture and picking herbs. They are not suited for martial arts, so may the Lord not pay attention to these people, may the Lord please\u2026\u201dBefore Lian Chengyu finished, a voice rang from the crowd, \u201cPlease let me through\u2026\u201dIn a moment, a growing boy holding on to a young lass had squeezed out of the crowd.Yi Yun was originally late, so he was in the outer layers of the crowd. He did not enjoy the good positions afforded to the warrior preparation camp members.\u201cYun-er, you\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou had been pulled forward before she could grasp the situation. Only when she went through the last layer of the crowd did she realize where she and Yi Yun were.Jiang Xiaorou was dazed. This was the center of the square!Seeing Zhang Yuxian surrounded by the Lian tribal clan\u2019s upper echelon standing in front of her, Jiang Xiaorou was momentarily lost.And at this moment, Jiang Xiaorou felt Yi Yun release her hand, and saw him walking forward. He stopped walking only when he reached the group of warrior preparation camp members.Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s mouth gaped, but nothing came out of her mouth.As for Lian Chengyu, his smile froze. All the members of the warrior preparation camp were also stunned!Zhang Yuxian looked surprisingly at Yi Yun asking, \u201cYou want to participate?\u201d\u201cYes, milord!\u201d said Yi Yun in a short but powerful voice.Those words stunned the crowd into silence. Everyone looked flabbergasted at Yi Yun.This Yi Yun must be mad?He didn\u2019t know his place. He was like a little chick and probably didn\u2019t even weigh eighty pounds. All the strongmen in the crowd who were ineligible were stronger than him by a hundred times!Besides, Yi Yun had never practiced martial arts. He had almost died picking herbs. He couldn\u2019t even chop the firewood for the desolate bones well, and he wanted to sign up?The men who wanted but did not dare sign up looked furiously at the young kid, Yi Yun.\u201cThis kid is creating trouble at such an occasion, does he not want to live?\u201dWhen a person sees another with courage do something he lacked the courage to do, it was often he would feel a sense of envy. Many of the commoners in the Lian tribal clan were precisely in that situation.\u201cYi Yun, you little slave. How dare you show no respect for your elders. Today\u2019s situation is not one you can mess with! Get the f**k down!\u201d Lian Chengyu did not expect a retard like Yi Yun to have such actions on such an important occasion.Yi Yun was just a child, and he was the weakest among the children. To dare sign up for the selection, it was clearly him using Zhang Yuxian to pass time!It was so humiliating. It could even damage his reputation in front of Zhang Yuxian. Zhang Yuxian would think that he had disciplinary troubles, that he could not even control a child.Yi Yun took a glance at Lian Chengyu and responded to his atrocities calmly and sharply, \u201cIn the wilderness, the weak are enslaved as slaves. To put it bluntly, the weak are slaves. If my strength is weak, then it is only right to call me a slave. I will not retort that. But if one day, Young master Lian meets a person stronger than himself, he too will become a slave. What does Young master Lian think of that?\u201dLian Chengyu\u2019s expression changed. He was furious. What was this? A little slave in the tribe dared to talk to him like that!?If not for Zhang Yuxian, Lian Chengyu would have killed Yi Yun with a slap.\u201cThe weak are enslaved as slaves?\u201d Zhang Yuxian smirked. He did an unexpected glance at Yi Yun, \u201cInteresting. To have such insight despite being born in a small tribe. You said it right. The weak are enslaved as slaves, and that is applicable to everyone. If I were to one day be subjected to someone more powerful than I, I too would become a slave.\u201dHearing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words, Yi Yun was surprised. He never expected that Zhang Yuxian would openly admit that he could submit to another. This frankness may not be rare among important people, but it was seldom displayed from an important person to someone of lower stature since it was disdainful.Zhang Yuxian\u2019s approachability surprised Yi Yun.Lian Chengyu had to pull back his rage with Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words. An elite Jin Long Wei had already admitted so, he no longer dared say anything!However, it did not mean that Lian Chengyu could tolerate Yi Yun causing a mess at such an occasion. He said to Zhang Yuxian, \u201cHigh Ambassador, this kid is named Yi Yun. He is a lowly drug child in our Lian tribal clan. He has no martial arts background. He\u2019s here only to use you to pass his time. The lowly me will throw him out. Please do not fault my inability to discipline my tribe, causing such a joke.\u201dLian Chengyu was so furious not because Yi Yun had questioned his authority, but because he had humiliated him in front of Zhang Yuxian.Unexpectedly, Zhang Yuxian did not mind. He casually pointed to a spot saying to Yi Yun, \u201cYou as a child sure are interesting. Stand here. I will check your suitability for practicing martial arts later.\u201dZhang Yuxian may appreciate Yi Yun but he was not overly concerned. From his point of view, few people in the wilderness were suited for martial arts. Since Yi Yun dared to stand forward, he would help examine Yi Yun.Since Zhang Yuxian had already made clear his position, Lian Chengyu could say nothing but shoot a resentful glance at Yi Yun.\u201cThank you milord.\u201d Yi Yun thanked him in a decent manner and stood beside the warrior preparation camp troops. Incidentally, he was standing beside Zhao Tiezhu.This was because Zhao Tiezhu was close with Lian Chengyu, so he had became the unspoken leader of the warrior preparation camp. As such, he stood first in line among the troops. With Yi Yun coming over, he naturally ended up standing beside Zhao Tiezhu.As a result, Yi Yun was now standing at the first position.As for this, Zhao Tiezhu was a bit irritated. What a joke, he was of great stature and great strength, how could he be compared to this little retard?He was planning on entering the city with a high position as part of the family of a Kingdom Knight in the future. What was there to nitpick with a retard?\u201cLittle slave, you are here as a joke, right?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu mocked. He was waiting to see Yi Yun make a fool out of himself.Yi Yun could not be bothered with him, and stood there silently.At this time, Zhang Yuxian began his selection. No one knew what Zhang Yuxian\u2019s selection criteria was. They had all gathered their strength awaiting it.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - Eating a Large Pagoda TreePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: Eating a Large Pagoda Tree\u201cHow old are you?\u201d Zhang Yuxian looked at the first person\u2013a short but stocky man. The members of the warrior preparation were both stout and dark-skinned.This man had a considerable status in the Lian tribal clan. Even among the warrior preparation camp, he was one of the strongest. He felt honored being the first to be examined by Zhang Yuxian and was dying of anticipation.\u201cLord, I\u2019m twenty-six this year. I can raise a 400 lb stone roller. I\u2019m not bullshitting. Such a heavy rock can be lifted by me four to five times like a toy. If the Lord wants to follow me, I\u2019ll lift it to show you!\u201d This man introduced himself confidently. Zhang Yuxian did not take notice of his self-boasting words, and silently placed his hand on the man\u2019s shoulder. He began to inject Yuan Qi in.One who has \u201cOpened Heaven\u2019s Eyes\u201d could see a person\u2019s muscles, meridians, bones with a glance, and from there determine if a person was suitable for martial arts.However, Zhang Yuxian had not reached such a realm. So his selection method was to inject a person with a little Yuan Qi, and see how the person\u2019s body would absorb it.Those who could absorb it well had a suitable constitution. Those who had poor absorption had an unsuitable constitution.After a short venture, Zhang Yuxian was speechless. Less than 10% of the amount of Yuan Qi he had injected was absorbed by the man. It was about 7-8%.This talent was too unbearable to see.\u201cDo you think you can defeat your enemies just because you can lift rocks?\u201d Zhang Yuxian stared into the man\u2019s eyes saying, \u201cYour constitution is extremely common, it\u2019s not suitable for martial arts.\u201dZhang Yuxian\u2019s words were like a bucket of cold water splashed on the man\u2019s face. The self-boasting man was confused.Not suitable for martial arts? How could I not be suitable for martial arts?That man felt extremely disgruntled, but coming into contact with Zhang Yuxian\u2019s cold stare, he faded backwards like a defeated c*ckfighter.I was always stronger than my peers since young. I could lift a 400 lbs stone roller when I grew up. If I wasn\u2019t suited for martial arts, would I be able to lift the heavy stone roller? These thoughts swirled in the man\u2019s mind. He had been practicing martial arts for years, and to be told by Zhang Yuxian that he was unsuitable for martial arts, negated all his previous efforts.Of course, he only kept that in his mind for he did not have the courage to contradict Zhang Yuxian.\u201cStay here for now,\u201d Zhang Yuxian did not plan on sending him packing immediately, but kept him there.It was because Zhang Yuxian knew that he had to be mentally prepared when making a selection in the wilderness. It was hard for these people to become an expert under such poor environments.A tribe without any experts would continue on from one generation to the next, and it was very unlikely a prodigy could transpire out of that.But very quickly, Zhang Yuxian realized that he had underestimated the extent of the poor quality of men in the vast wilderness. He began to understand that there was no such thing as worst, only worse.As he went down the line, the self-boasting man from before was actually considered not bad. As he reached the end, most of them could only absorb 6-7%, there were even some who could only absorb 4-5%.It was a terrible sight.Zhang Yuxian could only lower his standards. He finally decided that all those who could absorb more than 6% could stay behind.\u201cYou\u2026I guess you barely qualify.\u201d Zhang Yuxian looked helplessly at a stout man, and could only describe it with the word \u201cbarely\u201d.As he probed down the line, his elimination rate was at about 50%.With about forty warrior preparation camp members, there were only about twenty who qualified under such standards, clearly missing the thirty people target.\u201cLord Zhang sure is strict. Those soldiers from the warrior preparation camp are so strong, but half of them were eliminated.\u201d\u201cThankfully we didn\u2019t go up, or it will be so humiliating.A few men who had previously wanted to make an attempt after seeing Yi Yun signing up felt lucky.Under such elimination practices, only a very gifted person could be selected.And they could tell that Zhang Yuxian was not really satisfied by the people who had passed. It was only because there was no one else to choose that he had to pick a general among the dwarves.Upon understanding this, the crowd began to be admire Lian Chengyu even more.Only Lian Chengyu won the praise of \u201cextremely not bad\u201d.\u201cYun-er\u2026\u201d, clasped Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s tiny hands. She looked at Yi Yun worriedly. She knew that Yi Yun had been secretly practicing martial arts the past few days, but she did not think that his ability would rise above the members of the warrior preparation camp.If Zhang Yuxian would not even pick those men from the warrior preparation camp, how would he choose Yi Yun?Jiang Xiaorou was still standing in the middle of the square. Her position was extremely awkward. The crowd\u2019s eyes were on her. Her brother was among the preliminary candidates. Jiang Xiaorou could neither retreat, nor could she stand there.Yi Yun noticed Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s worried eyes and moved his mouth slightly, \u201cSis Xiaorou, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201dZhao Tiezhu burst out into laughter after hearing Yi Yun\u2019s words, \u201cYou f**king bullshitter, I can pick any stray dog, and it would be stronger than you. Lord Zhang would rather choose a dog as a disciple rather than you!\u201dFacing the cynical mockery, Yi Yun could only stare coldly into Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s eyes saying, \u201cYou should just care for yourself, as for myself, you don\u2019t need to worry.\u201d\u201cYa hey! This kid sure got c*cky, to think he used those words against me! If you were to be chosen today, I will uproot that large pagoda tree by the village entrance and eat it, leaves and roots all.\u201d Zhao Tiezhu burst into laughter as he said that. At the same time, another man standing beside Zhao Tiezhu, another warrior preparation camp member echoed mockingly, \u201cThen I\u2019ll eat that big stone roller by the village entrance!\u201d\u201cHaha, you guys sure are humorous. I\u2019ll join you guys by drinking all the water in the East River.\u201dThe men from the warrior preparation camp began to turn rowdy.Yi Yun looked helplessly at these men and shrugged, \u201cWhatever.\u201dAt this time, Zhang Yuxian had already reached Zhao Tiezhu. Zhao Tiezhu wiped off his smile and stood up straight.Zhang Yuxian pressed on Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s body and said \u201cTwenty-eight?\u201dZhao Tiezhu replied hastily, \u201cThe Lord sure has great eyes, little me is indeed twenty-eight.\u201dZhang Yuxian frowned for Zhao Tiezhu was also not satisfactory to him. But considering that the numbers were too few, he reluctantly said, \u201cI guess you meet the minimum requirements. I will keep you to make up the numbers.\u201dZhang Yuxian began to reach the conclusion that having a Kingdom selection in the Cloud Wilderness was a pointless endeavor.Zhao Tiezhu heaved a sigh of relief, and shook his fists, \u201cThat\u2019s great! I passed!\u201dHe was very excited and began demonstrating in front of Yi Yun. Although he had barely met the minimum standard, he had still passed!He was about to practice martial arts with the High Ambassador. When he had a meteoric rise, he could marry multiple wives and walk towards the peak of humanity, not something a weakling like Yi Yun could compare with.At this time, Zhang Yuxian was in front of Yi Yun.Everyone\u2019s eyes were concentrated on Yi Yun\u2019s body.Lian Chengyu sneered, I want to see how you are going to get out of this!That thought had bubbled into his mind, but he pricked it immediately. Yi Yun was a mentally handicapped kid, so Yi Yun would be oblivious even if he was humiliated.A mentally handicapped kid did not need to wrap things up. Causing an uproar was common. He might even mistake the jeers as compliments.Lian Chengyu was speechless when his train of thought reached this conclusion. It was akin to the quote that one should never argue with an idiot, they will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.\u201cYi Yun, right?\u201d as Zhang Yuxian stood before Yi Yun.\u201cYes, mi Lord!\u201d\u201cHave you never really practiced martial arts?\u201dZhang Yuxian gave a wistful glance at Yi Yun. He was only at the Purple Blood realm, and could not tell Yi Yun\u2019s level, but he had felt that Yi Yun\u2019s body was hiding a power.To be talented yet self-effacing!\u201cI\u2019ve trained a bit,\u201d Yi Yun chose his words wisely. Training by stealing lessons was also considered training.\u201cLord, this kid is lying!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu began to snitch, \u201cI can attest to the fact that this kid has never practiced martial arts!\u201dYi Yun looked at Zhao Tiezhu as if he was a retard, \u201cHow would you know if I practiced martial arts? I\u2019ve passed the tribal grounds multiple times. I\u2019ve also practiced some of what Instructor Yao had taught.\u201dYi Yun openly admitted that he had practiced martial arts. This was to prepare for the day when he had to reveal his real strength. It would make people think he was a prodigy, lowering the risk of the discovery of the Purple Crystal.If not, he would be unable to explain where he got all his skills from.\u201cYou secretly learned martial arts?\u201d Hearing Yi Yun\u2019s words, not only did Zhao Tiezhu laugh, even the other members of the warrior preparation camp were trying hard to hold it in. They did not dare be audacious in front of Zhang Yuxian.At this point, no one pursued his crime of secretly learning martial arts by stealing lessons.A member of the warrior preparation camp said, \u201cInstructor Yao\u2019s \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d is so profound. We couldn\u2019t even grasp it by following his every move. You dull kid without any strength learned it secretly? What could you have learned!\u201dYi Yun could not be bothered to retort. He just wanted to leave the impression that he had practiced martial arts. It could be used to cushion the blow when he revealed his real strength.Zhang Yuxian pondered as he placed his hand on Yi Yun\u2019s shoulder, slowly injecting his Yuan Qi.Zhang Yuxian had not expected much. He had appreciated Yi Yun for his bravery for it was rare for a kid to step forward under such circumstances. Of course, appreciation was one thing, but the practice of martial arts was not only about bravery.The Yuan Qi Zhang Yuxian released into Yi Yun\u2019s body completed a circulation, and as he waited expectantly in receiving the Yuan Qi back to see how much was absorbed\u2026He realized that the Yuan Qi he injected had disappeared without a trace!\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Zhang Yuxian stared, how could this be?His brows began to jump as he refused to believe the situation he was in. He injected another surge of Yuan Qi into Yi Yun\u2019s body.This burst of Yuan Qi entered Yi Yun\u2019s meridians as if they had entered a black hole. The moment it passed Yi Yun\u2019s heart, it was absorbed by the Purple Crystal, with not a drop left.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhang Yuxian was shocked. The Yuan Qi he had injected in Yi Yun had been absorbed totally!?Seeing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s eyebrows jumping, Lian Chengyu did not know if Zhang Yuxian had been angered. He walked to Zhang Yuxian\u2019s side with a sullen expression.Lian Chengyu\u2019s thoughts revolved around the examination of the Lian tribal clan Zhang Yuxian was conducting, but alas, an eccentric flower like Yi Yun had messed it up.Although he treated the lives of the Lian tribal clan as dirt, he did not want the Lian tribal clan shamed in front of outsiders. It would result in others thinking lowly of him.Lian Chengyu reluctantly smiled, \u201cLord High Ambassador, the banquet has been prepared. Shall we eat first?\u201dLian Chengyu had wanted to divert Zhang Yuxian\u2019s attention, wishing he could cover up the incident with Yi Yun. But suddenly, Zhang Yuxian grasped Yi Yun\u2019s shoulders with both hands.He measured up Yi Yun carefully.A poor tribe in the vast wilderness could produce such a talent?Besides, this youth in front of him had the courage and commitment towards martial arts. He had proven himself by standing up in public.Besides that, the youth had a hidden amount of power within himself. It had sparked Zhang Yuxian\u2019s interest.\u201cYou are good, very good! I never thought that I would find such an unpolished gem in a small tribe in the vast wilderness.\u201d Zhang Yuxian was not stingy with his compliments. His voice projected far and loud.Ah?Beside Yi Yun was Zhao Tiezhu, who was ready to mock Yi Yun when he failed to qualify. He suddenly widened his eyes like a rooster being grabbed by the neck.What did Lord Zhang just say, I did not hear wrongly!Lian Chengyu who was gearing to lead Zhang Yuxian for a meal stood dumbfounded. He was not sure how to react momentarily.The outer ring of people who could not see the situation did not know what had happened. Their interest was piqued after hearing Zhang Yuxian compliment someone.\u201cWho? Who received such a high compliment.\u201d People in the outer ring started jumping to catch a glimpse.\u201cYou have a \u2018Seamless Body\u2019. Even a low grade Purple Blood Seamless Body is extremely good! You will be appreciated even in a large tribe!\u201dSeamless Body?The people, including Lian Chengyu did not know the term Seamless Body.But this did not prevent them from understanding Zhang Yuxian\u2019s attitude.\u201cVery good\u201d, \u201cunpolished gem\u201d, \u201cappreciated even in a large tribe\u201d!Even Zhao Tiezhu with his feeble mental processes knew that Zhang Yuxian\u2019s compliments for Yi Yun had exceeded Lian Chengyu!How could this be. Zhao Tiezhu felt like he had eaten a pound of shit, leaving a spectacular expression on his face.The other warrior preparation camp members were all dumbfounded. Their mouths gaped open.\u201cBrother, he\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s eyes were watery. She was the only person who had wished that Yi Yun would amount to something. However, happiness had came too suddenly that even she had trouble believing it.She had seen Yi Yun\u2019s growth since he was wearing diapers. She had never felt that Yi Yun was talented. Was what Zhang Yuxian said true?Jiang Xiaorou felt something iffy. Even Lian Chengyu\u2019s evaluation was weaker than her brother\u2019s?\u201cThis kid is a martial arts prodigy? How could this be!\u201d Lian Chengyu clenched his fists. He could not accept it.Zhang Yuxian had favored Yi Yun even more!Lian Chengyu was always the number one prodigy in the Lian tribal clan, how could he tolerate someone exceeding him?Besides, the other person was a young slave!\u201cThis\u2026Lord High Ambassador, you say this kid is a martial arts prodigy? Could you have made a mistake\u2026\u201d Everyone doubted Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words but only Zhao Tiezhu could not keep it in and dumbly asked.Zhang Yuxian\u2019s face turned solemn, and said coldly, \u201cYou doubt me?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhao Tiezhu was shocked. He shook his head vigorously, \u201cNo, I dare not, little me doesn\u2019t dare.\u201dZhang Yuxian gave a cold glance towards Zhao Tiezhu saying, \u201cI have limited time. In an hour, those who were selected, gather around here. I will impart martial arts to you for three days!\u201dSaying that, Zhang Yuxian left. He had no interest in the welcoming banquet.Zhao Tiezhu, Lian Chengyu and the rest of the warrior preparation camp were staring with utter bewilderment.They looked at Yi Yun as if he was a freak. They could not accept the fact!Yi Yun had passed the preliminaries. He had even received extremely high compliments. How could that be?\u201cYun-er!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou had seen the glares Lian Chengyu and company shot at Yi Yun. She rushed forward to pull Yi Yun by her side, worried about him.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it! I don\u2019t believe it! That Lord said I was not suitable for martial arts. He even said this kid was some gem, or what body. I can lift a 400 lb stone roller. That kid doesn\u2019t seem like he can even hold a chicken firmly. I can\u2019t be compared with him?\u201dThat short stout man began shouting.His words were met with astounding response.\u201cI can\u2019t compare with that kid? I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\u201cThis kid sure has some sh*t good luck!\u201dThe warrior preparation camp were originally full of confidence, but it had been wiped clean during Zhang Yuxian\u2019s preliminary examination. Yi Yun was the only one who had received high compliments.They were definitely disgruntled.At this point, Zhao Tiezhu walked towards Yi Yun, saying, \u201cKiddo, don\u2019t be too proud. I\u2019m not sure what was wrong with Lord Zhang. You think we don\u2019t know? You have been ill-ridden since young, like a little chick. You can\u2019t even lift a 50 lb rock weight. You almost died picking herbs. Such a person as a martial arts prodigy? My foot!\u201dZhao Tiezhu was not wrong. The children of Yi Yun\u2019s age could lift 50 lb rock weights, and Yi Yun could barely lift 30 lbs a few months ago.Yi Yun himself did not expect a \u201cSeamless Body\u201d assessment.Yi Yun having the Purple Crystal and his keen senses from entering the Meridians realm had already guessed what Zhang Yuxian was doing. He had injected energy to test a person\u2019s talent.This energy was absorbed by the Purple Crystal, resulting in the misunderstanding by Zhang Yuxian.To be honest about his talent, his body\u2019s innate talent was nothing out of the ordinary. There was definitely no Seamless Body.A real martial artist prodigy would not have such a poor constitution like Yi Yun. If a body had a high affinity with energy, it would absorb energy from the surroundings in an invisible manner, causing the body to grow strong.How could one expect a starving child that grew up in the vast wilderness be a prodigy?Of course, although Yi Yun understood it, he decided to accept his title as a prodigy.It was a good way to explain himself when he revealed his strength.With that, Yi Yun looked at Zhao Tiezhu with a faint smile.Seeing Yi Yun glancing over at him, Zhao Tiezhu stared back with a look of disdain, \u201cWhat? Disgruntled? If you are disgruntled, you can fight with me. I\u2019ll squash you with a finger. I\u2019ll let you win if i use an additional hair!\u201dZhao Tiezhu was also fuming; he wanted to teach Yi Yun a lesson.But Yi Yun replied calmly, \u201cUncle Tiezhu, have you finished eating the large pagoda tree?\u201dA critical hit with one sentence!Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s mocking words he had planned on saying got stuck in his throat. His remained silent as his eyes stared like a dead fish on the ground.\u201cAnd that warrior from before\u2026have you eaten that stone roller?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026and there was another one who wanted to drink up the East River\u2019s water.\u201dYi Yun said in an amused manner. His body was small and thin, while his face was still boyish. It did not seem capable of causing any harm, but every word he said embedded within itself an extreme amount of destructive power.The members of the warrior preparation camp quickly disavowed their statements. No one took responsibility for what they said. The words they had previously said in front of the entire tribe had smacked them right back in the face.\u201cMy fellow warriors, little me shall head back to take a rest. I need to make preparations for practicing martial arts with Lord Zhang. Also Young master Lian, since little me needs to practice martial arts, can I take leave on the refining of the desolate bones?\u201d Yi Yun asked earnestly. Lian Chengyu\u2019s face was utterly black. How could he dare not to?\u201cOf course. Practicing martial arts is more important.\u201d Saying this, Lian Chengyu felt his intestines twist.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 - Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s warningPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34: Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s warningYi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou returned home almost under the escort of all the villagers.To the Lian tribal clan, it was big news that Yi Yun had passed the examination.A poor kid had been chosen by a High Ambassador and would be given martial art pointers. He could even participate in the Kingdom selection in the future!This could not be described by any auspicious omen.\u201cYou say, I watched this Yun-kiddo grow up. I never felt anything special about him. He\u2019s really a martial arts prodigy? And to contest in the Kingdom selection. Is that true?\u201d\u201cSince it was said by the High Ambassador himself, there has to be some truth in it. But I doubt he would have enough time to prepare for the Kingdom\u2019s selection. Even if Yi Yun was a prodigy, he would have absolutely no hope.\u201dTo the villagers of the Lian tribal clan, they knew that martial arts wasn\u2019t something that could be accomplished overnight. The Kingdom\u2019s selection was an elite selection process. To catch Zhang Yuxian\u2019s fancy was already some sh*t good luck.It would be akin to daydreaming for him to pass the Kingdom\u2019s selection.No matter how clever a child was, giving a child, who had never read before a scholarly collection was pointless. It would never allow him to pass the exam to become a scholar in two months.It was the same logic with participating in the Kingdom selection. The Lian tribal clan had came to a consensus, which no one doubted.With a lot of effort, Jiang Xiaorou finally brought Yi Yun home.Despite Jiang Xiaorou closing the courtyard\u2019s door, many people had climbed up the walls to look into Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house. As the mud walls in the villagers were short, a kid could easily climb up the walls.As a result, a row of people were slumped over Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house walls. The mud walls began to sink, as if they were about to collapse.Jiang Xiaorou did not bother about that. She had mixed thoughts. She was proud of her brother, but it was also mixed with the fear and confusion of the unknown future.Jiang Xiaorou knew that Yi Yun only had talent, but lacked strength.The villagers might have mixed it up, thinking that Yi Yun had undergone a life changing event. Jiang Xiaorou knew that in the vast wilderness, strength was of utmost importance. A person with talent had to let the strength grow to be of use, or it would be useless!\u201cYun-er, Lord Zhang said you had a Seamless Body, do you know what a Seamless Body is?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou held onto Yi Yun\u2019s hands as she sat by the bedside.Yi Yun shook his head, \u201cSis Xiaorou, could it be that you know what it is?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026I\u2019ve heard a bit about this. A Seamless Body means that a body does not have any energy \u2018leaks\u2019. Such a constitution is extremely suitable for practicing martial arts.\u201d\u201cSeamless Body also has levels. The lowest level is Mortal Blood Seamless Body. One can be without leaks while in the Mortal Blood realm, but will not be able to do so upon reaching Purple Blood. A Purple Blood Seamless Body would not have any leaks in both the Mortal Blood and Purple Blood realm. But at higher levels, they will not be able to do so\u2026I don\u2019t know what you are at the moment.\u201dYi Yun was surprised at Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s words, \u201cSis Xiaorou, how do you know so much?\u201dJiang Xiaorou touched Yi Yun\u2019s head saying, \u201cWhen I was young, I had my talent tested by my family, so I had learned something from there.\u201d\u201cThe steps to testing a Seamless Body were extremely troublesome. That Lord Zhang did not have any array set up, and his cultivation was limited, so he could only test you crudely\u2026\u201d\u201cA person with Seamless Body is highly appreciated in a clan. But if you were only a Mortal Blood Seamless Body, then the appreciation will be limited. However the higher levels of Seamless Body are extremely rare. I remember on the day of the test, a cousin of mine named Jiang Mingzhe was a Sage level Seamless Body. The entire family was overjoyed, and they celebrated for days. There were many VIPs who came during those days, as for the details, I don\u2019t really remember anymore\u2026\u201d Yi Yun was stunned after hearing Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s words.Sage level Seamless Body?Although he didn\u2019t know what level that was, it sounded really powerful.And\u2026to be able to produce such a constitution in the family, what sort of clan did Jiang Xiaorou belong to.Yi Yun knew that Jiang Xiaorou came from a rich background. She was taught how to write from young. She had read widely, so she knew about cultivation. It was not possible children from small families could do.Having been born in such a clan, how did she inexplicable find herself seeking refuge in the vast wilderness, to be eventually adopted by his own family?Yi Yun could not help but ask, \u201cSis Xiaorou, what sort of family clan was yours?\u201dJiang Xiaorou wrinkled her little brow as she thought for a while before shaking her head saying, \u201cI don\u2019t remember anymore. I only remember it was a big family clan. Then I remember\u2026that I began reading and writing at a young age. I remember the courtyard I stayed in when I was young. As for the events after that, I don\u2019t remember anymore even if I tried.\u201dJiang Xiaorou\u2019s words piqued the curiosity of Yi Yun. Did Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s family experience some huge transition?Could such a brilliant family been destroyed, causing the clan to disperse?Dynasties rose and fell, families grew and were destroyed. In this world, nothing was eternal.\u201cYun-er, this set of clothes was made by me. See if it fits.\u201d As Jiang Xiaorou said that, she took out a set of newly sewn clothes from some old baggage.It was made of green fabric. It was very rough as people from the Cloud Wilderness usually wore clothes made of linen. They were tough and resistant.Yi Yun was surprised. The family was so poor that locks were not needed. It was not an exaggeration but a fact. Poor families like Yi Yun\u2019s did not have locks. In the Cloud Wilderness, locks made of metal were expensive. A poor family\u2019s entire fortune was not worth more than the price of a lock.In such a situation, Jiang Xiaorou was able to obtain a piece of cloth to make him new clothes?Yi Yun received the clothes with mixed feelings. Although the cloth was rough, it was elegant and neat. The ends of the cloth were studded with tiny pins. This was sewn one stitch at a time by Jiang Xiaorou.Honestly, the texture of the clothes was not good, in fact, it was pretty bad. Compared to the cotton and silk clothes Yi Yun had experienced on Earth, it was a heaven and earth difference.But such a piece of clothing made Yi Yun feel extremely special.\u201cQuick, put it on. I wanted to give it to you for the new year, but you will be practicing martial arts today in the school yard. It\u2019s a joyous occasion, so you should wear something nice. Others won\u2019t be able to mock you that way.\u201d Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s words formed a lump in his throat. He took a deep breath before taking off his tattered clothes. He then changed into the new set of clothes.The clothes make a man just as a saddle makes a horse. Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s clothes were extremely fitting. Although it was made of linen, it matched well with Yi Yun\u2019s growing body and the aura he obtained after breaking through into the Meridian realm. It was eye-catching.Jiang Xiaorou pulled Yi Yun over and looked all over him, feeling extremely pleased.But she recalled something, saying, \u201cYun-er, you may have been appreciated by Lord Zhang, but Lord Zhang will leave in three days. He isn\u2019t related to us, so it will be hard for him to take care of us, so in the future, we must rely on ourselves.\u201d\u201cLord Zhang may say you have a lot of talent, but talent is not enough to protect yourself. You might face a disaster before you mature. It\u2019s because an elephant has tusks, while a rhinoceros has a horn that they are hunted. When you are practicing under Lord Zhang, don\u2019t be too excessive. Keeping things low key and staying cautious is the right way to go.\u201d\u201cEspecially people like Lian Chengyu who are extremely narrow minded. He will not spare you if you steal his limelight!\u201d\u201cWhen Lord Zhang is here, Lian Chengyu would not dare try anything, but what would happen after Lord Zhang leaves? Lord Zhang wouldn\u2019t know what sort of person Lian Chengyu is, nor would he know the ongoings in the Lian tribal clan and Lian Chengyu\u2019s hostility towards you. Lord Zhang likely has his hands tied with some matters, and he came here out of convenience for the Kingdom\u2019s selection preliminaries. He will likely not put too much thought into it, and wouldn\u2019t meddle with the internal affairs of the Lian tribal clan. Hoping for him to protect you will be extremely hard. Do you understand?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou said a lot in one breath, astonishing Yi Yun.Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s thoughts were prudent. Her understanding of people and the world exceeded girls of her age.A normal girl would have fainted upon hearing her brother had been appreciated by a High Ambassador. She wouldn\u2019t stay at home to give him advice, but run off to the neighbors to brag about her capable brother.\u201cSis Xiaorou, I understand everything you said,\u201d Yi Yun held on to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, if I wasn\u2019t confident in dealing with Lian Chengyu, I would never have stepped forward today.\u201dYi Yun had carefully weighed his choices before registering.Without question, Yi Yun had to pass the preliminaries hosted by Zhang Yuxian. Not only was it a required ticket for entry to the Kingdom\u2019s selection, but to be able to be imparted skills from Zhang Yuxian made Yi Yun extremely interested.Previously, Yi Yun had stolen lessons from Yao Yuan, so the effectiveness was largely reduced. Yi Yun had to step forward when Zhang Yuxian was making his selection.However, Yi Yun could only reveal his talent, but not reveal his actual training in front of Zhang Yuxian.Zhang Yuxian did not know Yi Yun\u2019s trump card. Even Lian Chengyu did not know. Yi Yun was a weak kid a few days before, without herbs or people imparting skills to him, it was preposterous that he reached the Meridian realm out of nowhere!If Lian Chengyu informed Zhang Yuxian of this, Zhang Yuxian would feel suspicious. A proud person like him could not even have such a fast cultivation speed even if he ate all sorts of precious herbs daily.At that time, Zhang Yuxian might even suspect that he had a secret!Although Zhang Yuxian seemed like an upright person, but it was best to err on the side of caution. An upright person could be tempted by the huge treasure in front of him to do horrible acts. Yi Yun definitely could not expose the Purple Crystal.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 - Cornerstone Skill of the ArmyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35: Cornerstone Skill of the ArmyLate in the morning, Yi Yun came to the school ground. Zhao Tiezhu and the bunch of warrior preparation camp members had arrived early with eagerness. They had moved big stone rollers and millstones over.These boors relied on these items to train their strength. It was what they were best at, and something they were extremely proud of.So although Zhang Yuxian had not arrived, these men from the warrior preparation camp had began lifting the stone rollers.There were many villagers in the vicinity. They could not stop themselves from watching such a lively scene.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t this our martial arts whiz! How about it, have a go at it.\u201d Zhao Tiezhu demonstrated as he saw Yi Yun squeeze out from the crowds.\u201cPeng!\u201dWith a thud, Zhao Tiezhu had thrown a 500 lb stone roller in front of Yi Yun.\u201cDo you dare to have a go at it?\u201d said Zhao Tiezhu with a contemptuous look at Yi Yun.In front of all these people, Zhao Tiezhu wanted to prove that it was only through sh*t good luck that Yi Yun was considered a martial arts prodigy.\u201cBrother Zhao, you are being too hard on him. How could he lift a 500 pound stone roller? Come little brother, why don\u2019t you try this small rock weight.\u201dAnother man threw a 200 lb rock weight at Yi Yun. He complemented Zhao Tiezhu in humiliating Yi Yun.To them, even 50 pounds would be tough for Yi Yun, not to mention 200 pounds. How could he be a martial art prodigy?Yi Yun looked at them as if they were retards. He couldn\u2019t be bothered with them.He had already proved his talent for martial arts. He did not care if they believed. He had achieved his goal of planting the seed in their minds.Next, he had to cultivate properly. When he showcased his extraordinary strength at the Kingdom\u2019s selection, it would be understandable.Yi Yun did not plan on being in direct conflict with Lian Chengyu. Lian Chengyu\u2019s cultivation was one level higher than him, and had rich fighting experience. Besides, Lian Chengyu wasn\u2019t just one person, there were others like Yao Yuan and the Patriarch, and numerous people from the upper echelon that supported Lian Chengyu.If it really came down to it, Yi Yun felt his current strength was too weak. Besides, he had a weakness\u2013Jiang Xiaorou.\u201cLord Zhang is here!\u201d Suddenly a man shouted in a low voice. All the members of the warrior preparation camp scattered like chickens and began lifting the stone rollers.\u201cHey! Ha! Hey! Ha!\u201dThese people had been lifting stone rollers for years, resulting in a harmonious chant.The scene was really in full swing.Accompanied by Lian Chengyu, Zhang Yuxian walked to the center of the square. The men\u2019s faces were flushed with excitement. They tried to display their strength to Zhang Yuxian, hoping to gain some credit.Amongst all, Zhao Tiezhu was working the hardest. The expression on his face said, \u201cDo you see it?\u201d This was his real strength. He could fool around with a 500 lb stone roller. How could he be incomparable to a small kid. Lord Zhang, take a good look, did you make a mistake just now?Seeing this scene, Zhang Yuxian frowned. He felt his minimal amount of patience grinding low. The upper echelon of the Kingdom did not know any better and wanted to hold a Kingdom selection in the wilderness. And he had to take on the task. He felt he was teaching a pile of trash.\u201cYou bunch of trash, stand well for me!\u201d Zhang Yuxian suddenly roared. His sound waves exploded forward like a bomb, scaring the members of the warrior preparation camp. They all released their grip\u201cPeng! Peng! Peng!\u201dMany of them nearly broke their backs by dropping the stone roller on the ground.Zhao Tiezhu and the rest were a little dumbfounded. They did not expect the originally majestic but amiable Zhang Yuxian to change totally.In fact, the Jin Long Wei was an army. As an instructor in a unit, it was common to beat a person to death. Zhang Yuxian was being moderate because he could not be bothered to stoop down to the level of junk. Beating these trash who had brain problems was a sully to his reputation as a Jin Long Wei.\u201cYou bunch of idiots! I will only be teaching you three days of skills during this visit to the Lian tribal clan! I had originally wanted to teach you fist skills or movement skills, but from your actions and ignorance, I doubt I can finish teaching you a skill.Zhang Yuxian swept the crowd with his sharp gaze. It felt like a knife had scraped past their face, itching their facial skin!Zhang Yuxian turned his body and walked to a corner of the school field. There stood a tall and thick tree.This was the \u201clarge pagoda tree\u201d Zhao Tiezhu had promised to eat when he mocked Yi Yun.Zhang Yuxian stood in front of the large pagoda tree. He looked up and suddenly sent a chop towards the tree.\u201cKa-cha!\u201dA crisp sound erupted. This large pagoda tree had been cut down with Zhang Yuxian\u2019s hand chop!Wow\u2013The men from the warrior preparation camp gasped at seeing this scene. The surrounding villagers were shocked and couldn\u2019t stop grinning. They had never seen such a terrific display of skills.Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyebrows jumped. If it was a kick, he would have been able to do the same. But a casual hand chop to bring down a large pagoda tree as if he was cutting grass was a shocking display of power.Zhang Yuxian dragged the large pagoda tree that weighed thousands of pounds as if it was a wooden stick. He threw the big tree before the members of the warrior preparation camp.As the people looked at the tree, they recalled Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words. Zhang Yuxian had said that he will teach them one skill. Was it this hand chop?Thinking of this, many of them couldn\u2019t help anticipating it. This move was too cool. Even if they couldn\u2019t match Zhang Yuxian, just a tenth of the power would be extremely cool!\u201cToday the skill I\u2019m teaching you is neither a technique not a combat skill. It\u2019s a mystic technique! It\u2019s a cornerstone skill of the Jin Long Wei, priceless! If you can learn it well, the road of martial arts will be be smoother, and it will greatly increase your body\u2019s strength. It will also increase your survivability!\u201dZhang Yuxian\u2019s words aroused the curiosity of the people. Not only did it help in their martial arts, it also increased their strength, and even survivability. It was a cornerstone skill of the Jin Long Wei!This mystic technique sure sounded great, what was it?\u201cYou!\u201d Zhang Yuxian pointed at Zhao Tiezhu, \u201cstep forward!\u201dZhao Tiezhu intelligently stepped forward in front of Zhang Yuxian. He was a part nervous and a part excited.\u201cThis mystic technique will be demonstrated by you.\u201d Zhao Tiezhu was delighted hearing those words; a good outcome had fell into his lap.Hahaha.Zhao Tiezhu laughed in his heart thrice. Zhang Yuxian was going to personally impart the mystic technique to himself, would he not learn it well?Although Lord Zhang did not say anything, he had appreciated me after all. It was expected, I have one of the greatest strength in the entire warrior preparation camp.With today\u2019s practice target being that large pagoda tree, I would at least be able to cut down a large piece of bark with one chop!As Zhao Tiezhu was itching to try, Zhang Yuxian split the large pagoda tree apart with two chops!Following that, Zhang Yuxian pointed at the large pagoda tree and said to Zhao Tiezhu, \u201cYou! Eat this large pagoda tree!\u201dWith those words, an excited Zhao Tiezhu nearly tumbled, planting his head into the ground.What? What the f**k?Eat this large pagoda tree.Eat the large pagoda tree.Eat the tree.Eat\u2026The words rang in Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s head. He couldn\u2019t believe Zhang Yuxian.I couldn\u2019t have heard it wrongly!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you not understand?\u201d Seeing Zhao Tiezhu hesitate, Zhang Yuxian\u2019s expression turned cold.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Zhao Tiezhu was speechless. He felt that Zhang Yuxian was teasing him.Did Lord Zhang hear his lampooning of Yi Yun, and was purposely teasing him.But no matter how discontent he was, he did not dare to retort Zhang Yuxian.At this time, the members of the warrior preparation camp looked at Zhao Tiezhu with pity. They knew what words Zhao Tiezhu had previously said to Yi Yun.They did not expect retribution to come so fast!Seeing Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s misfortune, the two men who had pitched in about eating a large stone roller and drinking the East River\u2019s water began to twitch.They wished they could slap their own mouths. Why did they join Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s craziness? It was possible they would receive their just deserves in a while!It was possible to take a bite or two from the large pagoda tree, but how could one eat the stone roller.\u201cZhao Tiezhu, what are you idling for? You were ordered to eat the tree, did you not hear?\u201dLian Chengyu saw Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s reluctance and reprimanded him.Lian Chengyu did not care what the reason was. He decided that since it was commanded by Zhang Yuxian, any order from the High Ambassador had to be complied. After all, it wasn\u2019t just because of his rotten luck.\u201cI\u2026I\u2026\u201d Zhao Tiezhu made up his mind despite his bitter face. He said, \u201cI\u2019ll eat\u2026\u201dHe crouched down and broke off a piece of wood.Zhao Tiezhu looked at this piece of wood with a tearless grief. This piece of wood could be used to build a house. I\u2019m being treated as a termite!Seeing Lian Chengyu\u2019s unfriendly face, Zhao Tiezhu could only resign to fate as he stuffed the piece of wood into his mouth with his eyes closed.This taste was was an indescribable \u2018enjoyment\u2019.Zhao Tiezhu felt as if his throat was being torn apart. He had managed to swallow a piece with extreme difficulty. He looked at Zhang Yuxian helplessly. It read, \u201cis that enough?\u201dBut Zhang Yuxian simply said, \u201cCarry on!\u201dZhao Tiezhu almost fainted!He was great at lifting stone rollers, chopping trees and piling, but eating wood was a torture!\u201cLord Zhang, I don\u2019t understand this mystic technique?\u201d Lian Chengyu had originally thought that Zhang Yuxian was teasing Zhao Tiezhu, letting him understand the importance of following orders.But now it didn\u2019t look right. It seemed making Zhao Tiezhu eat the tree was part of the mystic technique.If so, then even he had to eat the wood in a while. So he asked to be sure.Towards Lian Chengyu, Zhang Yuxian\u2019s attitude was better. He said, \u201cThis mystic technique is known as the \u2018Elephant Swallowing Technique\u2019. It\u2019s a technique used to train your stomach and digestive abilities! A person who accomplishes much in the Elephant Swallowing Technique can eat as much as they want every meal. It is rumored some can even eat an entire elephant, hence its name.\u201dThe members of the warrior preparation camp had an expression on their faces. Simply stated, this Elephant Swallowing Technique was just a technique for eating.Isn\u2019t this a gluttony skill? Can this be considered a mystic technique?Seeing the expression on the members of the warrior preparation camp, Zhang Yuxian knew what they were thinking.He said disdainfully, \u201cYou people have the exposure similar to an ant. How dare you evaluate the cornerstone skill of the Jin Long Wei! Simply ridiculous!\u201d\u201cTraining a warrior\u2019s stomach is very important! With good heart and lungs, you can endure longer, and fight harder. But being good at fighting can\u2019t be better than cultivation. With your stomach strong, it will be a benefit to cultivation!\u201d\u201cFor Mortal Blood warriors, you may be moving stone rollers, fighting, climbing up trees and houses. Where does all this energy come from? It\u2019s from your meals!\u201d\u201cSome warriors with a well-trained stomach have astonishing appetite. They can finish a cow in three days, the amount of nutrition they absorb will naturally be more. Their muscles will grow stronger, and their strength increases naturally.\u201dZhang Yuxian\u2019s voice was loud. Yi Yun was moved by his speech.Indeed, a warrior\u2019s energy output was terrific. This energy had to come from somewhere. And that energy source for Mortal Blood warriors had to come from their meals.Meals were energy. If one could eat more, there would be natural benefits.Consider the children of average talent that came from noble families. Most of the time, they would not be distributed desolate bones essence for their cultivation. The only method to increase their strength was by eating desolate beast meat.Most people would be full from about four kilograms of desolate beast meat. With such an appetite, it was pointless for them; they might as well take care of the family business.There were others who could eat a hundred kilograms of desolate beast meat and still have room for more.All the desolate beast meat could be digested, obtaining the essence within. By working hard to cultivate, they would be able to reach a higher level.Hence, having a good stomach allowed one an advantage!Zhang Yuxian\u2019s foundation mystic technique was the Elephant Swallowing Technique.It was a fundamental technique for practicing the arts!Zhang Yuxian carried on, \u201cThe warriors from the large tribes, practice the Elephant Swallowing Technique with desolate beast meat. As you lack the materials in the Cloud Wilderness, you can\u2019t even fill your stomachs. However practicing the Elephant Swallowing Technique is still useful!\u201d\u201cHaving a strong stomach allows you to absorb the nutrients of anything you eat!\u201d\u201cCommoners will waste a lot of the essence when they digest the five grains they eat. Most of it is excreted as feces.\u201d\u201cHuman waste is even eaten by dogs. Maggots thrive in the feces and the dung beetle rolls the dung into balls as their brooding chambers! In it, there are large amounts of nutrients that were not completely absorbed!\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t even absorb completely the five grains, don\u2019t even think about eating precious foods!\u201d\u201cWithout a good stomach, you won\u2019t even be able to digest precious foods!\u201d\u201cAfter learning the Elephant Swallowing Technique, you will be able to absorb anything you eat completely! When you encounter a famine, you can eat and digest the bark on the trees or Guanyin clay (Kaolin/China clay), giving you the nutrition to sustain life!\u201d\u201cFrom today, your meals will consist of tree roots, tree bark and Guanyin Clay. After you are done eating, follow my method to practice your Elephant Swallowing Technique to kickstart your stomach to digest these hard-to-digest foods into nutrients!\u201dAfter hearing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words, the members of the warrior preparation camp were speechless. They had to eat that?They could only have wood and Guanyin clay as meals for three days!They had originally thought that they would be able to feast on the meat Zhang Yuxian had obtained from hunting fierce beasts.However, reality is cruel. Besides fierce beast meat, they were not even allowed to eat rice porridge.The faces of the members of the warrior preparation camp were bitter. No one wanted to eat the tree.They needed to at least ease into the process.As they looked at each other, Yi Yun walked out of the bunch. He crouched down in front of the big pagoda tree, broke off a branch and swallowed it down, leaves and all.Practicing the arts wasn\u2019t meant to be an enjoyment. It required suffering, frustration and the risking of their lives.Not only martial arts. Yi Yun knew that on Earth, children who practiced acrobatics, dance or Judo underwent tough training. For example, a teacher would kneel on a child\u2019s back to exert pressure. That kind of pain wasn\u2019t something an adult could endure.In this strange world, behind the scenes of a peerless expert was indescribable effort. Eating some wood or Guanyin clay was nothing.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - Twelve MovesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37: Twelve MovesSeeing that Yi Yun was the first to follow his instructions, Zhang Yuxian nodded with satisfaction.The others did not think likewise. Zhao Tiezhu looked at Yi Yun eating the tree and sneered, it isn\u2019t so simple eating wood.You may be trying to be a hero, but I\u2019ll see how you burst to your death later.When the people faced famine, people ate grass roots and tree bark. But no one tried eating wood, especially uncooked hardwood.Besides termites or borers, few animals in the world ate wood. The wood fibers in the wood was not something the stomach could digest.\u201cGo! Dig up some Guanyin clay!\u201d Zhang Yuxian ordered. Guanyin clay was actually magnesium silicate. No one knew why it was called Guanyin clay. Maybe during the famine periods, the people looked to the Guanyin goddess for help. This clay could fill the stomachs, so it obtained such a name.But in reality, Guanyin clay was a poison. It was not harmful in small amounts. But slightly larger portions would result in indigestion. It would be impossible to excrete it out, and a person would eventually die of abdominal distension.Coincidentally, the Lian tribal clan had such a material. Some people may wonder why would people eat the Guanyin clay if they knew it could kill?This was because of the ignorance of the local people. They believed that if they had a sincere heart, they would receive salvation from Guanyin.The second reason was that Guanyin clay tasted much better than tree bark and grass-roots. Its appearance and taste resembled flour. Some people who could not resist the temptation under extreme hunger would die from eating too much.The Guanyin clay was dug up and piled into a bunch.This Guanyin clay was moved here by the citizens. The citizens of the Lian tribal clan had became onlookers.Seeing the people from the warrior preparation camp about to eat the Guanyin clay, the onlookers were worried. It was okay eating some Guanyin clay, but the results would be devastating if they finished that large amount.\u201cBegin.\u201d Zhang Yuxian said lightly. Yi Yun did not hesitate and began eating the Guanyin clay in large amounts. It did not have any special taste but a bit creamy.The Guanyin clay was much easier to swallow than the wood.Seeing Yi Yun\u2019s actions, the people from the warrior preparation camp could not take that lying down.They bit the bullet and began eating.They believed Zhang Yuxian wasn\u2019t out to harm them. Although it was awful eating that, but for practicing the skill, they had to endure it!But just as the thought flashed in their heads, Zhang Yuxian destroyed that thought when he said, \u201cThe Elephant Swallowing Technique isn\u2019t that easy to learn. Some people who ate the Guanyin clay for the practice of Elephant Swallowing Technique did not manage to learn it before dying of abdominal distention.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d Hearing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words, the courage they had summoned deflated.If you can\u2019t master the Elephant Swallowing Technique, eating all this wood and Guanyin clay would result in death!Learning this technique would result in deaths. They thought they would be subjected to suffering, but it would not be life-threatening. But the truth proved that they had thought wrong!Seeing Zhao Tiezhu and company\u2019s expressions, Zhang Yuxian gave a disdainful glance, \u201cDo you think the practicing of martial arts is to treat others to dinner and having a good time? And from that, you will learn a peerless skill?\u201d\u201cWhen a warrior practices the arts, he has to understand that he will constantly confront death! There are often deaths even among the Jin Long Wei members\u2019 normal training! Without pushing your body to its limits, how do you expect to breakthrough!?\u201d\u201cThe path of martial arts, entering mysterious lands, vendettas, vying for treasure, destroying the devil within, escaping death, surviving tragedies! Which one of those doesn\u2019t have deaths? You are only at the beginning stages. If you don\u2019t dare to eat Guanyin clay, then don\u2019t practice martial arts. Just die in this vast wilderness!\u201dZhang Yuxian had no more demands from the likes of these people. He also did not say how much Guanyin clay or wood a beginner of the Elephant Swallowing Technique should consume.It was up to a person\u2019s courage to determine how much he should eat.The warrior preparation camp members looked at each other. They unknowingly began to slow down their eating speeds.As for Yi Yun, he paused for a while. After a short silence, he began eating at a constant speed, not affected by those words.Zhang Yuxian noticed Yi Yun and nodded. This courage was admirable.As for Zhao Tiezhu and company, they naturally noticed Yi Yun non-stop eating of the wood and Guanyin clay. Zhao Tiezhu maliciously whispered, \u201cThat little bastard, he may be showing off now, but he will die from bursting later!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mind the idiot, Brother Zhao. We are just beginners. Let\u2019s not eat too much. Half a pound, no\u2026four to five ounces should do\u2026\u201dThe men from the warrior preparation camp began to carefully weigh the amount they ate. They ate it sparingly like a gluttonous child unwilling to finish a cake.\u201cBrother Zhao, don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew. Let\u2019s do it step by step. We will do it steadily. We will let Lord Zhang see our martial arts talent! How could we not match up to a little kid!\u201dThe men from the warrior preparation camp suppressed their anger. Zhang Yuxian had looked down on them, and his words implied that he had chosen them just to fill the numbers.They had conceded to that, but they could not agree to Zhang Yuxian\u2019s high appraisal of a sickly child like Yi Yun!They thought they could lift stone rollers while practicing martial arts with Zhang Yuxian. It was their forte where they could act cool and easily pushover Yi Yun. It would have been fun.But they never expected that they were required to eat a tree for their cultivation!It was like a bolt out of the blue!\u201cIt\u2019s just eating wood and Guanyin clay. What\u2019s there to fear? Bros, eat! We have to exceed Yi Yun. This little chick is just here to play afterall.\u201dZhao Tiezhu grew madder and madder just thinking. If the other men did not dare eat, he would purposely eat more. He did not believe he would be unable to learn the Elephant Swallowing Technique.At this point, Yi Yun had already eaten about a kilogram of Guanyin clay at a leisurely speed. The Guanyin clay had begun to expand in his stomach. He felt as if a lead block had been stuffed into his stomach and was falling.Yi Yun\u2019s stomach began to hurt.This kind of pain is not obvious in the beginning, but it becomes worse as time goes by, to the point of causing people to die from pain.Suddenly, Yi Yun heard a voice say, \u201cFollow me, do these twelve moves.\u201dYi Yun raised his head and saw Zhang Yuxian standing in front of everyone. Zhang Yuxian eyes were on him, with an encouraging smile.With that, Zhang Yuxian began to move.It was hard to describe Zhang Yuxian\u2019s movements. His movements looked blurry. It seemed like he was standing in another space-time dimension, having cut off contact from the outside world.He demonstrated each of the moves. Each move was extremely strange. But when the actions connected, it gave off a consistent natural feel.Zhang Yuxian\u2019s speed varied. It contained a hard to describe charm.These actions appeared in the irides of the people, but it was as if seeing a shadow that didn\u2019t exist. It looked like an illusion.Dreamy\u2026Yi Yun suddenly thought of something, he felt like it was a dream seeing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s movements.In a dream, the things seen, the words said were all very real and clear.It was possible to have utmost creativity in the dreams, creating beautiful poems.One could feel that his literary talent was excellent in the dream, but no matter what, he would never be able to remember what was written or said.Upon waking up, everything would be forgotten.Seeing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s movements, Yi Yun had such a strange idea.Is the \u201cElephant Swallowing Technique\u201d just a fundamental skill? Why do I find it much better than the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d?Yi Yun could not believe it.At this point, Zhang Yuxian had already finished. Although he could not remember most of the moves, Yi Yun knew that Zhang Yuxian had done the entire set of movements three times!\u201cAlright, these are the twelve moves of the Elephant Swallowing Technique. Do it accordingly. If you can do it, you will have some small success with the Elephant Swallowing Technique, and it wouldn\u2019t be hard to digest that bit of Guanyin clay.\u201dWh\u2026What?Hearing Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words, Zhao Tiezhu and company stared wide-eyed!What did Zhang Yuxian just do?They only saw a blur. Zhang Yuxian\u2019s body shook, leaving some after-images, and then he was back there standing.Some of them were thinking if they were giddy, since they saw double.They did not understand the situation. It was impossible for them to follow Zhang Yuxian\u2019s movements!\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Upon seeing the sodden expressions of the warrior preparation camp members, Zhang Yuxian asked.\u201cA\u2026A question\u2026\u201d Zhao Tiezhu swallowed a mouthful of saliva and said his question with difficulty. \u201cIf\u2026If we can\u2019t learn yo\u2026your movements, then wh\u2026what will happen to the Guanyin clay and wood that we just ate?\u201dZhao Tiezhu felt hopeless. It was too complicated. He couldn\u2019t even understand the moves. It was impossible for him to learn it in three days!\u201cOh?\u201d Zhang Yuxian frowned. He could not be bothered with Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s retarded question and said, \u201cWhen you go to the bathroom, use a finger or a pick to dig, and you might survive. Remember not to drink any water.\u201dHearing Zhang Yuxian finish his words, Zhao Tiezhu and company suddenly felt like they had eaten a kilogram of shit, the kind that had been fermenting in the intestines for days.That expression was indescribable.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This isn\u2019t some Elephant Swallowing Technique, it\u2019s a prank!Many of the warrior preparation camp members had already began digging their throats with their fingers, hoping to vomit out the Guanyin clay and wood they had just eaten.However, it was useless. The Guanyin clay was extremely sticky. The moment it reached the stomach, it sank and coagulated. Vomiting this final block would prove difficult.Even though the men from the warrior preparation camp had vomited out their gastric juices, only a few wood splinters came out. The Guanyin clay was still bound tightly in their stomachs.Momentarily, the men all froze up.\u201cLord Zhang, please stop joking. I couldn\u2019t even see your movements!\u201d said the men who were close to tears.\u201cHow could anyone learn such a movement?\u201dHearing the complaints of the warrior preparation camp members, Zhang Yuxian was indifferent. He did the twelve moves of the Elephant Swallowing Technique again. However, this time, he did it at a slower speed, allowing the people from the warrior preparation camp to see better.But Yi Yun realized that when Zhang Yuxian lowered his speed, there was a charm lacking in his set of moves!And it was this charm that was the crux of this set of moves!\u201cLet me try!\u201d At this time, Lian Chengyu stood forward.Lian Chengyu had already eaten quite a bit of Guanyin clay and wood.Lian Chengyu had some perceptive ability afterall. He barely demonstrated the movements Zhang Yuxian had done. But in fact, his movements were far from correct.Of course, only Yi Yun could tell. As for Zhao Tiezhu and company, they were full of admiration.\u201cYoung master Lian is a man of God!\u201d\u201cWow, how could you do those moves?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu and company began to suck up. They were truly full of admiration for Lian Chengyu. It was so astounding of Lian Chengyu.But Zhang Yuxian looked at Lian Chengyu and said lightly, \u201cThat barely counts.\u201dGiven this evaluation made Lian Chengyu feel a sense of defeat. The moves were too hard, and he felt it was quite impressive that he was able to mimic it.But Zhang Yuxian only rated it as \u201cbarely counts\u201d. His standards were too high.Lian Chengyu always had confidence in his talent. He felt that it was not because he failed to do well, but it was Zhang Yuxian\u2019s standard that was overly strict. Zhang Yuxian was also not generous with his praises.At this moment, Lian Chengyu noticed that Zhang Yuxian\u2019s gaze was focused on Yi Yun.Yi Yun had closed his eyes as if in a daze.Lian Chengyu sneered, having eaten so much wood and Guanyin clay, the kid\u2019s stomach must be hurting right now.This Elephant Swallowing Technique was so difficult, the set of movements was full of mystery. How could a twelve year old child like him learn it? It was best that he died a painful death from a ruptured stomach!Due to Zhang Yuxian\u2019s high praise for Yi Yun, Lian Chengyu treated Yi Yun with great animosity.Yi Yun was fully immersed in his own world.Yi Yun could not be bothered watching Lian Chengyu\u2019s movements after a while. It was because Lian Chengyu could only barely match a few of the moves. And it was those moves that Yi Yun realized lacked a certain charm!From this point, Yi Yun realized something. He closed his eyes and began pondering.In Yi Yun\u2019s mind, Zhang Yuxian\u2019s movements were repeated again and again like a movie.After breaking through to the Meridian realm, Yi Yun\u2019s five senses were extremely keen. Although Zhang Yuxian\u2019s movements were quick, Yi Yun still managed to gain some insight.Also having lived two lives, he had very high perceptivity. His eyes had been nourished by both the Purple Crystal and his meridians, making his mind\u2019s movements of Zhang Yuxian even clearer. The outer form first came together, and slowly each move began to emit that charm.Yi Yun realized that the Elephant Swallowing Technique was extremely mysterious.First one had to eat hard-to-digest and impossible to excrete food. Next, they had to use this set of mysterious moves to train their stomach and intestines.These moves, if one paid attention to the poses, would have their charm reduced.If one wanted to reflect the charm, then the poses would no longer be accurate.It was a mysterious set of mystic techniques!Yi Yun began to have such a thought. He felt that the Elephant Swallowing Technique was more mystical than the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d. But why would a cornerstone skill of the Jin Long Wei be widely spread among the grassroots?It wasn\u2019t time to think about this. Yi Yun began to reach out his hands according to his memories.Suddenly, Yi Yun began to move. With his eyes slightly closed, and without any sense of direction, he began to demonstrate the movements of Zhang Yuxian using the mysterious feelings in his memories.One by one, Yi Yun\u2019s train of thought became clearer, and his speed increased.People who were looking at Yi Yun only saw a blur shadow of Yi Yun!Zhang Yuxian\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up.Yi Yun managed to simulate a trace of the charm of the Elephant Swallowing Technique in his first practice! This had nothing to do with one\u2019s practice or physique. Only a person\u2019s perceptivity mattered.The difficulty of the Elephant Swallowing Technique was its comprehension. It took Zhang Yuxian a long while to understand the charms behind the Elephant Swallowing Technique. He too had suffered eating the Guanyin clay during that period.This kid, Yi Yun had an exceptionally perceptive mind!As for the men from the warrior preparation camp, they were all shocked at Yi Yun\u2019s movements. They did not understand the mystery behind the Elephant Swallowing Technique, but no matter how dumb they were, they knew that Yi Yun wasn\u2019t doing it haphazardly. Because they too perceived an incomprehensible illusion from Yi Yun\u2019s movements!\u201cThis\u2026This kid\u2026\u201d The men were stunned. They did not need to judge if Yi Yun\u2019s moves were accurate. From Zhang Yuxian\u2019s eyes, they knew they had to accept a more frustrating reality. Yi Yun could perform the Elephant Swallowing Technique!\u201cHow could this be. This little slave born from a low caste managed to learn Lord Zhang\u2019s movements after he demonstrated twice?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu and company did not know how many times Zhang Yuxian had demonstrated the moves. They only saw his movements blur twice, hence they had concluded he had done it twice.\u201cHe actually learned such a difficult move?\u201d The members of the warrior preparation camp could not accept it. They had always been condescending, and deep down, they felt they were the ruling class of the Lian tribal clan.But today, an inferior plebeian had climbed over their heads, suppressing them greatly.The lifting of stone rollers, which they were proud of was worthless in the eyes of Zhang Yuxian, but they could not learn a thing Zhang Yuxian taught them.Even the bright star of the clan, Lian Chengyu was suppressed by Yi Yun!Lian Chengyu clenched his fists. A deep sense of anger and frustration burned in his eyes. This sense of frustration slowly turned into cold killing intent!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For an unknown reason, it was extremely energy depleting. In Yi Yun\u2019s semi-conscious state, he repeated the moves five times before he felt exhausted!Yi Yun opened his eyes and felt his abdomen burning, it was as if a fire had lit up!His body\u2019s energy surged to his stomach. Large amounts of blood and energy was being supplied!A normal person would have their blood flow to their stomachs after a meal. This was to aid the digestive process.Yi Yun was in a similar situation, just magnified a hundred times.Yi Yun felt that if he wished, his entire body\u2019s blood could be condensed within his stomach. Even metal nails and glass could be digested!The bloated feeling from eating the Guanyin clay had totally disappeared. Under the strong peristalsis within his stomach, the coagulated Guanyin clay had already been separated.Yi Yun lifted his head to realize that everyone was looking at him. Zhang Yuxian had a smile on his face. As for the people from the warrior preparation camp, they could only be described as astonished, jealous and hostile.At this time, Lian Chengyu walked over to Yi Yun with a smile.\u201cYi Yun, I must give in.\u201d Yi Yun looked surprised as Lian Chengyu said that. Lian Chengyu also patted Yi Yun\u2019s shoulder saying nicely, \u201cYi Yun, to be honest, I was suspecting if you had passed the preliminaries due to luck. But you have just proven yourself. I apologize to you. I can\u2019t believe that you have such great talent!\u201dLian Chengyu was not stingy with his praise, \u201cIn the past, using you to pick herbs was a waste of talent. From now on, you can enter the warrior preparation camp. The Lian tribal clan will focus on grooming you!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too bad that the Kingdom\u2019s selection is in a few dozen days. You have to blame me for not noticing your talent, wasting your time. With only this amount of time left to practice martial arts, it\u2019s unlikely you can pass the Kingdom\u2019s selection\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s alright. If this stupid brother of yours becomes a Kingdom warrior, I will definitely help you. I will ensure that you will be able to walk out of this vast wilderness. At that time, you will be able to support our Lian tribal clan, and be glorious. We can even mass migrate into the cities!\u201dLian Chengyu said it earnestly. His eyes did not exhibit the slightest amount of deceit.If Yi Yun did not know Lian Chengyu well, he would have been fooled!It is impossible to judge a man\u2019s heart from his face. If a person good at hiding his true intentions wanted, it was impossible to tell from his facial expression what he was truly thinking.Lian Chengyu was exactly doing so.Yi Yun understood that he was doing it as an act in front of Zhang Yuxian.The moment Zhang Yuxian left, Lian Chengyu would reveal his true self.How could Lian Chengyu tolerate his growth?Yi Yun sillily smiled, saying to Lian Chengyu, \u201cThank you Young master Lian, I will not disappoint the Young master.\u201dSeeing Yi Yun fooled, Lian Chengyu broke into a smile. He did not expect that under the skin of this twelve year old child was an adult with richer experience than Lian Chengyu.Lian Chengyu carried on with some words of encouragement before turning towards Zhang Yuxian saying, \u201cLord Zhang, I\u2019m a dumb student. My perceptivity is not as good as little brother Yi Yun. I still haven\u2019t mastered the Elephant Swallowing Technique, could Lord Zhang please demonstrate it again for us students?\u201dSince he had decided to settle scores later, Lian Chengyu showed humility on the surface. But for Zhao Tiezhu and company having heard those words, they began choking.\u201cYoung master Lian\u2026\u201dZhao Tiezhu was worried. How could Lian Chengyu think so highly of Yi Yun, how could he say those words\u2026\u201cShut up. All of you are good for nothings. All the tribe\u2019s rations and meat were provided to you, but you can\u2019t even learn this Elephant Swallowing Technique today. It\u2019s so humiliating. If you don\u2019t practice it well, do you really want to burst dying from eating Guanyin clay?\u201dThe moment Lian Chengyu said \u201cburst dying\u201d, Zhao Tiezhu and company suddenly changed their expressions. Right, this isn\u2019t a joke. If they don\u2019t learn it well, they would have to pay the consequences!Seeing Lian Chengyu appropriate handling of matters, and his good choice of words, Zhang Yuxian nodded. Lian Chengyu had both talent and good leadership potential. He was a talented individual.Zhang Yuxian said, \u201cFor this Elephant Swallowing Technique, eating wood and Guanyin clay is just the beginning stage. If you meet the criteria, you can even try eating materials with devastating energies. Extremely valuable food will make your practice even better.\u201dThese words were only for Lian Chengyu and Yi Yun. From Zhang Yuxian point of view, only Lian Chengyu and Yi Yun had the ability to leave the vast wilderness and become a true warrior.He turned towards Zhao Tiezhu and company, saying, \u201cAs for you, although you won\u2019t have the opportunity to eat all those valuable foods, but if you were to master the Elephant Swallowing Technique, you will be able to eat grass-roots and tree bark safely during a famine. It will be a great boon to your survival. Even learning a tiny bit will be extremely valuable for you.\u201d\u201cI will do it again. The speed will be much slower. Look carefully. To be able to identify the charm of the Elephant Swallowing Technique will all depend on yourself!\u201dWith that, Zhang Yuxian began moving again.He really slowed down, but he was still unable to get through to Zhao Tiezhu and company.The result for that night was wailings from the toilets of the Lian tribal clan.Some people say that the most painful thing in life is the failure to find a bathroom when experiencing diarrhea. They would eventually have to sh*t in their pants.But for Zhao Tiezhu and company, what would this be called?Only those who experienced what Zhao Tiezhu was feeling will know that even shitting in their pants was extreme bliss.That night, the only doctor in the Lian tribal clan boiled a huge pot of laxatives. Every member of the warrior preparation camp drank it, but they still could not succeed in excreting it out.As a last resort, they had to follow Zhang Yuxian\u2019s words. They used their fingers to dig. When they realized their fingers were not long enough, they used bamboo sticks.As for bamboo sticks being inserted into their rectum\u2026That feeling was\u2026\u201dheavenly\u201d.In fact, using a bamboo stick to dig was not easy. It was an extremely difficult task for an individual, because they could not see.As a last resort, they had to \u201chelp one another\u201d. They had to reveal their ass, letting a brother help\u2026That scene was too perfect that Yi Yun didn\u2019t want to think about it.To be able to bust ass for a comrade was nothing. But to help a comrade dig out shit, that would be true love.Just listening to the shrill cries, one could imagine the carnage happening. The bamboo sticks might have dug through something\u2026On the second day, Zhao Tiezhu and company\u2019s faces walked soft-footedly with an ashen expression.They had not been able to sleep the whole night for they were constantly running to the toilet. Even after they drank the laxative, all that came out was yellow liquid, as for the bamboo sticks\u2026Even known tortures were nothing in comparison.However, thankfully they did not eat too much Guanyin clay. As a result of the laxatives and the digging, no one died.\u2026For the second day of training, Zhao Tiezhu and company no longer dared to eat the Guanyin clay. As such, Zhang Yuxian only taught Yi Yun and Lian Chengyu.Eventually, Zhang Yuxian did not even stay the full three days at the Lian tribal clan.On the second night, a jade scroll that accompanied Zhang Yuxian trembled, producing a sound.This jade scroll was a messaging device the Jin Long Wei used.Seeing the jade scroll tremble, Zhang Yuxian\u2019s expression changed. He left a note, mounted his huge beast and disappeared off into the night\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 - Each having a SchemePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40: Each having a SchemeEarly the next morning, the members of the warrior preparation camp arrived at the square. They already knew that Zhang Yuxian had left. Many people had heard Zhang Yuxian\u2019s beast galloping away last night. Of course, that included Yi Yun.\u201cYi Yun!\u201d At the square, Lian Chengyu called Yi Yun from afar. His expression was still warm.\u201cYoung master Lian, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yi Yun smiled; he knew that Lian Chengyu\u2019s current demeanor was an act for the villagers.At the square, there were many onlookers. Although Lian Chengyu had long since wanted to get rid of Yi Yun, he did not want to do it in front of the villagers.Having appreciated Yi Yun, it was possible Zhang Yuxian would return to the Lian tribal clan for Yi Yun after he completed his mission.Even if Zhang Yuxian didn\u2019t return, he might ask about Yi Yun at the Kingdom\u2019s selection.If Lian Chengyu had attacked Yi Yun in public, it would make him feel better. However, with so many people watching, word would spread. At any rate, he couldn\u2019t silence the entire tribe.If the matter was investigated by Zhang Yuxian, Lian Chengyu would be implicated. Hence, he planned on using a slow and steady manner to get rid of Yi Yun.Noticing that Lian Chengyu did not turn the tables, Yi Yun happily joined in with Lian Chengyu\u2019s Tai Chi practice. Besides, if they had really broke into conflict, Yi Yun\u2019s strength was still insufficient. Also, Yi Yun was still not done absorbing the desolate bones essence.\u201cYi Yun, Lord Zhang left behind a note and a box of pills. In the note, he instructed that the pills were for the both of us. The pill for me isn\u2019t a mild drug. A person with low cultivation cannot eat it. As for yours, it\u2019s very suitable for building a beginner\u2019s foundation.\u201dLian Chengyu reasoned it well. If Yi Yun didn\u2019t know who he was, he would have fully believed in it.\u201cOh, a pill!?\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s eyes lit up. He was extremely excited and anticipant. \u201cLord Zhang left a pill for me?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Seeing Yi Yun\u2019s silly look, Lian Chengyu sneered in his mind. He\u2019s indeed a retard. He actually believed that there was a pie in the sky.\u201cLord Zhang sure was generous. The kindness he gave the two of us must be remembered even if we rise up!\u201dLian Chengyu patted and advised Yi Yun. In his eyes flashed killing intent.With Zhang Yuxian gone, Lian Chengyu could no longer conceal his killing intent towards Yi Yun.\u201cYoung master Lian words are wise. Little me will not forget,\u201d Yi Yun answered with a sincere desire of learning.\u201cYi Yun, your talent is far greater than mine. When the desolate bones essence is extracted, I intend to give you some of it. This desolate bones essence not only concerns our future, but it concerns the future of thousands of lives in the Lian tribal clan. I can\u2019t trust anyone else but little brother Yi. I will be more assured if you lead the brewing.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do it this way. In the day, you will carry on refining the desolate bones. When it is refined, we shall consume it together as brothers. I will then help you, allowing you to reach the second realm of Mortal Blood, Vigour. I will then give you the pill from Lord Zhang, allowing your cultivation to go one step further!\u201dLian Chengyu smirked as he said those words. Yi Yun, on the other hand, knew it was a mocking expression.Without Zhang Yuxian, to Lian Chengyu, Yi Yun was just a child who could be crushed easily in his palms.Even if Lian Chengyu had really prepared a pill for him, it would most likely be a slow-acting poison. It would paralyze him and cause him to slowly die in pain.But from Lian Chengyu\u2019s point of view, no poison was better than the Frost Python\u2019s frost toxin. It was without cure. Using the Frost Python\u2019s frost toxin to kill Yi Yun was most fitting!\u201cI will complete whatever matter Young master Lian assigns me.\u201d Yi Yun patted his chest with a guarantee. He pledged like a hot-blooded youth.When Zhang Yuxian arrived in the Lian tribal clan, the refining of the desolate bones was not halted. Its location was just moved to the Lian Clan Herb Mountain. After all, having a huge cauldron burning day and night when Zhang Yuxian entered the Lian tribal clan was not appropriate.Lian Chengyu wanted to use the frost toxin to continue harming Yi Yun. It would slowly cause him to die a miserable death. It would also allay suspicions away from him since dead men tell no tales.As for Yi Yun, he planned to absorb all the energy of the desolate bones before he fell out with Lian Chengyu. He wanted to break through to the Qi Gatherer realm, increasing the cards in his hand.As such, both of them connected well as they each had their own schemes. With that, Yi Yun happily went to refine the desolate bones.Of course, to Lian Chengyu, Yi Yun\u2019s elated behavior resembled an immature kid.\u201cThis retard. I\u2019m sending him to his death and he\u2019s so happy. How could my talent lose to this retard? It\u2019s so humiliating!\u201d Lian Chengyu sneered. He balled his fist so tightly that his knuckles emitted soft explosive sounds.\u2026Yi Yun was pining after the desolate bones, as he had not absorbed its energy for three days.Without the desolate bones supplementing him with energy, Yi Yun\u2019s cultivation was slower. He would also feel hungry as a result.\u201cDamn it kid, where did you die to?\u201dThe dark faced men in charge of refining the bones snapped at Yi Yun.These men had been staying up on the Lian Clan Herb Mountain, so they were not aware of the events that happened with Zhang Yuxian.Their impression of Yi Yun was still that of an ill-ridden child. So they were not amiable towards him.Yi Yun did not pay attention to them. He went to his familiar spot and began chopping wood.Today, he was prepared to absorb all the energy from the desolate bones. Because Yi Yun knew that there was not much time left. Lian Chengyu\u2019s patience might run out in a few days.He had to break through into the fifth Mortal Blood level, the Qi Gatherer realm.Facing the burning cauldron, Yi Yun took in a deep breath. In his vision, he saw endless points of lights.These points of lights were like a delectable cuisine; Yi Yun was already drooling.Come on, I\u2019ll eat it clean!With that in mind, Yi Yun conjured up a purple vortex with his heart in the eye of the storm.In that split second, Yi Yun felt his body heat up. A heat flow began circulating through the Ren Du Er Mai Yi Yun had just recently opened up.After that, in Yi Yun\u2019s vision, several purple red light dots appeared from the cauldron\u2019s mouth. An uncountable number of light dots began to emerge from the \u201cLi Fire Water\u201d, and flew towards Yi Yun like a flock of birds!\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yi Yun was momentarily shocked. The number of light dots were more than he anticipated. It had even formed a line!\u201cShoo! Shoo! Shoo!\u201dThe light drops rained on Yi Yun\u2019s body, entering his meridians without resistance.Yi Yun suddenly felt his body tremble. He felt his meridians were about to burst!Pain!An extremely intense pain caused Yi Yun to fall to the ground. And the energies were still entering his body without pause.If the men refining the desolate bones could see, they would see Yi Yun\u2019s body covered by a halo.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 - WoundedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41: WoundedYi Yun had mustered up his strength to absorb the energy from the desolate bones today, but he did not expect that the energy would be so overwhelmingly violent.He had originally estimated that he would need at least five to six days to finish absorbing the desolate bones\u2019 energy.But currently, Yi Yun had absorbed more energy in those few seconds than the cumulative amount he had absorbed a few days ago!Could this be a result from opening up the meridians?Yi Yun felt the warmth within his body\u2019s meridians. He suddenly came to an understanding.This was the first time he was absorbing the desolate bones after breaking through into the fourth level of Mortal Blood, the Meridians realm!Previously, Yi Yun\u2019s meridians were blocked, so he could only absorb the desolate bones\u2019 energy using his flesh. As there was a limit to his flesh\u2019s capacity, Yi Yun would normally be satiated quickly.But with his meridians opened up, it was different. The meridians are the body\u2019s channels to transfer Yuan Qi, so their capacity were much higher than flesh.Meridians were like an energy highway. Yi Yun having reached the Meridians realm was equivalent to having opened up an energy highway within his body.Originally, the desolate bones\u2019 energy would seep into Yi Yun\u2019s body, but now, the energy would enter his body directly using the meridian highway. It was completely incomparable.Yi Yun had no formal education with regards to martial arts, so he did not know the difference. Due to this, he had hurt himself, and the injury was quite serious. Yi Yun had only opened up his meridians a few days ago, so he was not able to withstand the energy surge.He had basically absorbed all the desolate bones essence from the Frost Python in an instance!\u201cThere\u2019s such a thing\u2026absorbing too much energy will result in this. That\u2019s some bad luck.\u201d Yi Yun felt extremely unlucky. He felt his meridians all around his body about to break. It was as if he needed hospitalization from indigestion after eating at an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet.In fact, if the energy was beyond a certain amount, it could break a person\u2019s meridians.It was not something new in the martial arts world. Commoners could die from being unable to digest aged herbs. Some warriors explode to their deaths when they aren\u2019t able to digest the desolate bones relic they consumed.This way of dying was really pathetic. Yi Yun felt it was the same as dying from overeating.Yi Yun felt his body burn up. He felt something in his throat before a mouthful of blood surged upwards.\u201cHey, little monkey, why are you lying on the ground? Are you playing dead so you don\u2019t have to work?\u201d A black-faced man grumpily scolded. This man had a son, \u201cDa Tou\u201d. He had even used \u201cDa Tou\u201d against Yi Yun a few days ago.\u201cDamn it, did you hear me,\u201d Da Tou\u2019s father flared up seeing Yi Yun still lying on the ground. He threw down his axe, ready to kick Yi Yun a few times. But he noticed Yi Yun\u2019s face pale, and his body was trembling. His nostrils and ears were bleeding fresh blood.Seeing that, Da Tou\u2019s father was dumbfounded!Something happened!Although Da Tou\u2019s father wasn\u2019t a good man; he had a sharp tongue and loved to hoard the belongings of others; however, he would fluster when encountering a dying person.\u201cHurry, report to the superiors. Tell them someone is dying.\u201d Da Tou\u2019s father told his companions.This wasn\u2019t Da Tou\u2019s father cursing Yi Yun, but having seen Yi Yun bleeding from seven orifices, how could he not die?In the Lian tribal clan, there was practically no medical procedures. Due to the lack of resources, the tribe had weak immunities, so even a common cold would cost death, what more bleeding from the seven orifices.To Da Tou\u2019s father, Yi Yun was sure to die!\u201cI say little monkey, please don\u2019t die here. If you want to die, please go somewhere else\u2026\u201d Da Tou\u2019s father was about to grab Yi Yun, but when he touched Yi Yun\u2019s hand, he felt a burning sensation. Da Tou\u2019s dad cried in pain. He fell over, and crashed into a pile of firewood. He had almost hit his head on the red hot cauldron. If he did, his life would be practically over.Even so, Da Tou\u2019s father burned a handful of his hair. It scared him ashen. It was as if something had entered his body when he touched Yi Yun.\u201cWhat the?\u201d Da Tou\u2019s father was shocked. This matter was too strange. It was as if he had been bitten by a snake. The hand used to touch Yi Yun was still shaking.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Many men rushed over.Da Tou\u2019s father had hardly recovered from his shock, but said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this kid is possessed. Quick! Inform Young master Lian.\u201dA man rushed to report after Da Tou\u2019s father finished his sentence.Da Tou\u2019s father began thinking, and said to Yi Yun in fear, \u201cI say little monkey\u2026Ah no, I say little brother. What\u2019s wrong with you? You must hang on. I\u2019ve already called people over. The tribe\u2019s doctor will be here soon.\u201d\u201cDa Tou\u201d\u2018s father may say so, but he knew that the only doctor in the tribe would hardly come forward to save Yi Yun.That doctor was exclusive to the upper echelon of the tribe. If not, with a thousand people in the tribe, he would never be able to handle it if everyone consulted him when they were sick. Even if he could, there was insufficient medicine. The Lian tribal clan\u2019s medicine was extremely precious.So when a poor person fell sick, they had to rely on themselves. If they couldn\u2019t hang on, then they would just die. After all, life was cheap.\u201cI say little brother, I was greedy before. I stole your porridge. Please don\u2019t blame me.\u201d Da Tou\u2019s father did not know that Yi Yun had been appreciated by Zhang Yuxian, but seeing Yi Yun on his deathbed, he decided to reconcile with Yi Yun \u201cbefore his death\u201d. He was worried Yi Yun would turn into a ghost and haunt him for revenge.The people in the vast wilderness were superstitious. It was probably because they needed a crutch in life since life was tough. They believed the evil would go to Hell, and the good would go to Heaven. The poor had the opportunity to reincarnate to a good family.Yi Yun heard all of this and was at a loss whether to cry or to laugh. I\u2019m not dead yet, and I\u2019m already being cursed.However, this was a painful lesson. If he absorbed too much desolate bones essence, he could really die.To be in this state today was some ill luck. The phrase too great a pleasure will bring about sadness was the exact way to describe his current state.\u2026As Yi Yun was suffering from his damaged meridians and bleeding from his seven orifices, Lian Chengyu had already received the news from Zhao Tiezhu.\u201cYoung master Lian, hehe. That Yi Yun is not going to make it. I heard he was possessed. His nostrils and mouth are pouring blood!\u201dZhao Tiezhu was very happy hearing Yi Yun in trouble. This kid who got appreciated by Lord Lian is doomed for sure.\u201cOh?\u201d Lian Chengyu was originally training, but after hearing Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s words, his movements slowed down, but an elated look flashed in his eyes.What possession. Lian Chengyu felt it was just the stupid commoners\u2019 perception. Lian Chengyu was sure that Yi Yun\u2019s situation was a result of the desolate bones\u2019s frost energy and the Blood Thinning Pill.This kid\u2019s time to die is here!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 - Jumping down the ChasmPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: Jumping down the ChasmThe symptoms of being invaded by the Frost Python\u2019s frost energy and the overdrafting of a person\u2019s life force from a Blood Thinning Pill was the same as what Yi Yun was experiencing.Most of the time people will vomit black blood and exhibit an ashen dead look. Although it wasn\u2019t so spectacular like bleeding from the seven orifices, minor deviations were not abnormal. After all, everyone\u2019s constitution was different.And from Lian Chengyu\u2019s impression, although Yi Yun had martial arts talent, his body was too weak. His life force was not enough for the Blood Thinning Pill\u2019s overdraft, so among the men refining the desolate bones, Yi Yun would be the first to succumb.\u201cThat little slave, he succumbed so quickly. I was planning on playing with him for another two days. Too bad, he couldn\u2019t live up to it.\u201d Lian Chengyu did not believe Yi Yun would have any possibility of escaping his fate.The Frost Python\u2019s frost energy was without cure. For a commoner, it was fatal. Not even Yi Yun, even Lian Chengyu would not be able to withstand the Frost Python\u2019s frost energy or he would not have needed to sacrifice so many people from the tribe to absorb the frost toxic.This sort of frost toxic could only be gotten rid off by a Desolate Heaven Master, or even a Purple Blood Warrior would not dare to take in the Frost Python\u2019s desolate bones essence!Lian Chengyu was actually worried about Yi Yun\u2019s impending death. With Yi Yun dying the moment Zhang Yuxian left, would such a coincidence lead to Zhang Yuxian\u2019s suspicion?But Lian Chengyu\u2019s worry gave him pause for a second; in the next second, he carried on with his training.His motions were smooth as per normal; no one could pick out the slightest fault.After he finished his set of moves, Lian Chengyu slowly cooled down. Each movement was done with precise attention to detail.After finishing, Lian Chengyu suddenly thought of something. The corners of his mouth curved. Yi Yun had given him an inspiration!\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. So what if he dies? Don\u2019t let it affect the refinement of the desolate bones,\u201d Lian Chengyu said coldly.\u201cOf course, the refinement of the desolate bones is guaranteed! Little me has already ordered the rest to keep working, but\u2026what should we do with the little bastard\u2019s body? Should I find a few brothers, hang the little bastard up, and after mutilating him, feed him to the dogs?\u201dZhao Tiezhu said it with a smile. Yi Yun\u2019s death would be the punishment he deserved. His ass was still hurting. Zhao Tiezhu had irrationally blamed his anal pains on Yi Yun.Lian Chengyu coldly snorted saying, \u201cBy hanging up Yi Yun\u2019s corpse for mutilation, you want the entire village to see that? When that happens, people will think it was us who harmed Yi Yun. When Lord Zhang questions us, who is going to bear the responsibility!\u201d\u201cYes, Young master Lian is right,\u201d Zhao Tiezhu immediately said. \u201cLittle me thinks too simply. Young master Lian is wise afterall.\u201d\u201cWell, drag Yi Yun\u2019s body to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house. It would be bad luck for him to die beside the refinement cauldron!\u201d Remember, when you bring the little bastard over, make sure that he is really dead. Forget it, I\u2019ll verify it myself.Lian Chengyu found it odd that Yi Yun was able to revive time after time again. Although he was doomed to die from the desolate bones\u2019 frost toxic, Lian Chengyu still wanted to verify it to be rest assured.\u201cJiang Xiaorou? Haha, I wonder what that little girl will be like when she sees her brother!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu said with an excited look.Lian Chengyu knew that with Jiang Xiaorou and Yi Yun\u2019s relationship, she would faint the moment she saw Yi Yun.But Lian Chengyu did not have any tenderness toward women. This was the vast wilderness, rife with killings, both cruel and tragic. Lian Chengyu wanted to let Jiang Xiaorou know what it was like in the vast wilderness.He would not spoil any women, even if he liked her.He was a future elite; he wanted to make women understand that it was him, Lian Chengyu who rescued them from suffering. He was the one who gave them food to eat, a place to stay.The women need to learn how to appreciate him, learn how to be grateful, and learn how to serve him in reverence. Any women he treated well was a great gift to them. And any women he treated badly was their just deserves. Without him, all those women would have died in the vast wilderness!This was because of Lian Chengyu\u2019s inferiority complex. He hated the world, and slowly evolved into a bigoted dictator. He wanted to become a dominator, dictating the lives of everyone around him.\u2026With Yi Yun in trouble, the men who were refining the desolate bones were convinced he had been possessed. None of them dared to touch Yi Yun.It\u2019s not a joke. If Yi Yun died, the spirit might change targets. What if it possessed one of them?If not for the cauldron they had to man, they would have all been long gone.The current Yi Yun was pale in the face and bleeding from his nostrils.Today was really a big one, to actually suck dry the desolate bones in one go!Yi Yun had to thank his lucky stars that his tiny meridians were not torn apart by such a large amount of energy,Noticing that the informant had returned, Yi Yun knew that he could no longer wait here. He was not in the condition to return to the village. He did not wish to leave his life in the hands of others. The current him had no way of resisting Lian Chengyu.\u201cI need to find a quiet spot, and quickly digest all these oppressive energy.\u201d Yi Yun thought before lifting his body. He walked towards the chasm nearby.At the bottom of this chasm was the Lian tribal clan\u2019s East River.The East River\u2019s water flow was extremely turbulent. The waterfall Yi Yun had previously practiced at was a part of the East River.\u201cKid\u2026Wh\u2026What are you doing?\u201d Seeing Yi Yun walk towards the chasm, it seemed like he was about to jump off. The men\u2019s faces were white with fear.\u201cHe\u2019s been possessed by evil spirits! Evil Spirits!\u201d Da Tou\u2019s father lost his calm. He felt that Yi Yun\u2019s eyes were not focused, and guessed that he did not know he was just above the chasm.Jumping down would be a guaranteed death!And following the East River\u2019s flow, it would reach a waterfall. If he fell down the waterfall, death was no longer a surprise.\u201cSh\u2026Should we stop him?\u201d A man swallowed his saliva and stammered.But no one responded. Under the sky, only their lives mattered.They too might be possessed if they made contact with Yi Yun.\u201cThis little brother is already so seriously injured so I doubt he will survive. It\u2019s best to cut short prolonged suffering, so jumping down isn\u2019t a bad idea. Then\u2026little brother Yi, we will not send you off. Have a good trip through the netherlands, don\u2019t blame us for your death.\u201d Da Tou\u2019s father comforted himself and at the same time advised Yi Yun, hoping he would not seek revenge after dying.At this point, Yi Yun had already reached the edge of the chasm. He had already recovered a tiny amount of his Yuan Qi, but the energy in his body was still extremely turbulent. The heat was surging throughout his body, causing extreme discomfort.The current Yi Yun wasn\u2019t weak. On the contrary, he had an inexhaustible supply of energy. Jumping down the chasm into the waves would actually allow him to use up the energy.It was also his best route of escape.Yi Yun did not hesitate. With one step, he dropped down from the cliff.HuThe men drew a cold breath. Even someone with nine lives would not survive the drop with their seven orifices bleeding\u201cSplash!\u201d Yi Yun fell into the river. The chasm was about fifty meters high. Even as a Mortal Blood level four, Yi Yun felt the pain from the fall. After all, he was not in the best of conditions.It was already deep in winter, so the river water was icy cold. It was only because of the fast-flowing water that prevented the water from freezing.Yi Yun followed the drift. He felt the raging energies in his meridians flare up in his entire body.Yi Yun held his breath and swam against the water flow!Yi Yun knew that he was in such a state because he had over-absorbed the energy. The energy within him needed to be consumed, or his meridians would tear from the energy surge!Swimming was a good way to consume the energy. He had to endure despite the pain.If he could bring the amount of energy down to within the limits of his body, he would be able to recover slowly.Yi Yun calculated that in about an hour, he would be brought to the waterfall he had previously trained at!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yi Yun knew that he was approaching the waterfall.He kept adjusting his breathing rhythm, keeping his body in its optimum state.On Earth, people had dived from sixty meters without dying, as for the East River\u2019s waterfall, it was at a height of a hundred meters.Although Yi Yun\u2019s fitness level was superior, he had never undergone professional diving lessons. Besides, he was not in his best condition, so it was a huge challenge.\u201cBoom!\u201dYi Yun could hear the sound of the waterfall crashing into the plunge basin. The rapids had already sucked Yi Yun forward.After churning in the water, Yi Yun suddenly felt an emptiness under his feet. The instant feeling of weightlessness overwhelmed Yi Yun. All he saw from above was the whiteness of the torrential waters.With that, he fell a hundred meters down the waterfall.From afar, the majestic cliffs looked like a giant standing at attention. The waterfall that flowed from the cliffs looked like the sword of the giant. With the giant leaning on the sword, the scene was extremely breathtaking.As for Yi Yun, he was just a tiny black dot rolling down the giant sword at an impressive speed!\u201cSplash!\u201dThe large splash resembled a lotus in full bloom.The water assault Yi Yun experienced after resurfacing was tremendous. The powerful force attacked his organs and body. It made Yi Yun feel like his body was on an anvil, being forged by a hammer.This heavy blow loosened Yi Yun\u2019s muscles. Although it caused immense pain throughout his body, he still felt an incredible sense of comfort.Yi Yun held his breath and dived straight down!His body was on fire. The deeper he went into the icy cold water, the more comfortable he felt.By doing so, he had quietly dived to a depth he had never previously reached.Till he\u2026Reached the bottom!This was the first time Yi Yun had managed to reach the bottom of the plunge basin!At the bottom of the plunge basin was clean and pure sand. The sand was like polished jade. Yi Yun curled up his body into a fetal position, and seemed to fall into deep sleep at the bottom of the plunge basin.He had seemed to lost the concept of time. After an unknown period of time, Yi Yun felt a cool feeling in his heart. It prevented him from suffocating even though he wasn\u2019t able to breathe.The heat in his meridians began to cool down from the cold water. The water carried on exerting its pressure on Yi Yun\u2019s organs\u2026Yi Yun felt as if he had returned to his mother\u2019s body. He felt like a baby in his mother\u2019s womb, cut off from the outside world\u2026It was as if a fire was burning in his body. Yi Yun\u2019s only thought was to digest that energy as fast as possible. If not, it could burst his channels, and result in a devastating outcome.In the nearly zero degree celsius plunge basin, Yi Yun\u2019s body temperature rapidly decreased. A person in zero degrees air would not die as long as they stayed awake. But when surrounded by zero-degrees water, it would not take ten minutes for the person to be frozen completely.The low temperature, high pressure and lack of oxygen was a harsh environment. It allowed Yi Yun to quickly consume the desolate bones energy within his body. As his body consumed the energy, his body\u2019s constitution was improved, and went through a Marrow Cleansing.As the passage of time flowed, it was silent underwater. There was not the slightest movement in the plunge basin. It was as if Yi Yun had entered a completely independent space-time dimension. In this dimension, he could hear his slow but lingering heart beat.\u201cDum! Dum! Dum!\u201dAgain and again, the rhythm spaced out in intervals like a pendulum.Slowly, it seemed like Yi Yun\u2019s soul had left his body. His last thought in his mind had disappeared. Yi Yun seemed to had frozen up.A person who loses his consciousness during a deep dive was doomed to die.Although Yi Yun had lost consciousness, the Purple Crystal in his chest was slowly pulsating, sending energy to every part of Yi Yun\u2019s body.Yi Yun had entered an ethereal state. Every cell of his body was absorbing the desolate bone energy to fight the cold and fighting the alarming pressure!In fact, even a top skill like \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d was unable to train every inch of flesh and blood. No matter if it was \u201cFierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u201d or \u201cDragon Rising to Nine Skies\u201d, there would be parts of the body it would miss.Wherever it missed, it would become a weakness of the warrior.The only stance \u201cDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d could use the enormous water pressure to, in theory, uniformly train every inch of a warrior\u2019s body.Nonetheless, there was a physical limit. Not many could practice \u201cDragon Dancing in Vast Water\u201d to the extreme.To be able to temper every inch of flesh and blood, one had to enter an ethereal state of mind, or a person\u2019s body will be subjected to the regulations of the mind. It will consciously use the most often used strong organs. For instance, when a person pushes a boulder, they will inadvertently use their familiar hands, and exert pressure.Only by emptying one\u2019s consciousness could every cell resist the pressure and cold naturally. Only then can the body be tempered completely. Under such a state, a person\u2019s body will follow its instincts. This was also the concept of \u201cNo Law, No Shape, No Void, No Me\u201d!To be able to enter this state was extremely difficult. It was even harder to achieve that in the deep waters as losing consciousness was equivalent to suicide!Although Yi Yun had lost his consciousness, the Purple Crystal Origins was distributing energy through Yi Yun\u2019s blood. Yi Yun\u2019s brain, meridians and organs were nourished by the energy. A person\u2019s body needed to breathe because the body needed to release energy through respiration. But with the Purple Crystal Origins providing energy, oxygen was no longer needed.In this state, Yi Yun unwittingly spent a whole day and night underwater!All his bones, organs, and cells were suddenly alive. It seemed like they had developed their independent consciousness.It was until late in the morning of the second day that Yi Yun slowly floated up. It was just like a drowned body floating\u2026\u2026The Cloud Wilderness was one of the twenty-four wild lands of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. Besides the wonderlands protected by the large tribes, few people trod through the wilderness.In the Cloud Wilderness, besides the wonderlands people gathered around, there was another place known as \u201cDesolate Lands\u201d!The Desolate Lands had rich Power of Desolates. And the really strong desolate beasts were all found in the middle of the \u201cDesolate Lands\u201d!A lacking warrior would definitely die if he entered the Desolate Lands!!But\u2026at this time, along the boundaries of the \u201cDesolate Lands\u201d of the Cloud Wilderness appeared an elder and a young girl.The elder was dressed in a yellow robe. His body was overweight and he had a ruddy complexion. Only his eyes were small, making him look ugly.As for the young girl beside him, she had a slim figure. She looked seventeen. Her eyebrows were curved above a pair of slender eyes. A pair of pupils as clear as spring water resided within those eyes. They were extremely clear.The young lady wore a set of linen clothes. Under the rough sleeves, an arm as white as a lotus root could be seen.This girl had delicate white skin, with thin blood vessels running through.Generally speaking, such white skin with redness was very beautiful. This was also a symbol of health. However, this girl\u2019s skin though white gave off a feeling of weakness.But one wouldn\u2019t think so just by looking at the situation.The young girl\u2019s jade like hands were dyed red from blood. And in front of the young girl laid a dead fierce beast the size of a cow. This girl had slain it single-handedly!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why did we end up coming to the Cloud Wilderness? The Cloud Wilderness is a barren heathland, probably void of strong desolate beasts!\u201d The young girl said with a sweet and gentle voice.\u201cNorthwestern divine wilderness\u2026Sigh. You were born with Yin Meridians and lack physical strength. Among the desolate beasts that roam the Northwestern divine wilderness, there are some high level desolate beasts. It will be tough for you to handle them,\u201d the fat elder shook his head.\u201cAlright, Xingtong, I\u2019ll give you fifteen minutes to refine this level six fierce beast into a desolate bone relic. As mentioned before, this is to give you experience. Unless your life is in danger, I will not interfere.\u201d After the fat elder finished his words, he chose a big rock to rest his buttocks, and began to look at the scenery.The girl nodded her head. She rolled up her sleeves with a finger, then she took out a bronze disk. The bronze disk was inscribed with dense runes. The moment the disk appeared, it flew up into the sky and grew larger. Very soon, the disk was about the size of a house. Following that, the level six fierce beast was absorbed by the disk, turning into a blinding white light.In the white light, the fierce beast\u2019s carcass seemed to burn up. Its flesh melted and together with the essence from the blood, it seeped into the bones. In a few seconds, the fierce beast had turned into a skeleton. After a few more seconds, the skeleton also began to melt and started to fuse\u2026As this was going on, the girl\u2019s fingers began to link up to form a seal. Her fingers were long, and due to the fast movements of the sealing process, finger shadows were formed. Series of sealing charms were sent out by her, flying into the disk, combining with the beast\u2019s bones.In less than fifteen minutes, the entire beast\u2019s bones had completely melted, eventually reducing to a bone relic the size of a green bean. If Lian Chengyu saw this scene, he would have yelped out in shock.Desolate Heaven Master! This young girl was a Desolate Heaven Master! It was hard to believe the girl had this fearsome ability of easily refining a level six fierce beast in less than fifteen minutes. If this girl wanted, refining the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Frost Python desolate bones would have been a breeze!The bone relic fell into the palm of the girl who began frowning upon seeing the bone relic. She was clearly not satisfied. \u201cIt\u2019s still not small enough.\u201d The girl shook her head. Her goal was to reduce a six grade fierce beast to the size of a rice grain in fifteen minutes. Judging from the outcome, it seemed like she was still a distance away from the goal.\u201cXintong, don\u2019t be too eager. You are the most talented Desolate Heaven Master I\u2019ve seen in all my years of walking the world, too bad\u2026\u201d The fat elder said with a sigh. To be able to reduce a six grade fierce beast to a relic the size of a rice grain within fifteen minutes was not something he could have done at seventeen.It was a pity that the girl named Xintong had Yin Meridians. Her skin was so pale because of the Yin Meridians. Having Yin Meridians was an extremely rare condition. It was a terminal illness that would only appear in females.A girl with Yin Meridians was weak to the cold. Even during the summer, she would have to wear a coat. A normal person with Yin Meridians would at most live to eighteen before falling into a slumber for two to three days. As time went on, she would sleep longer and more frequently, to the point of each slumber lasting nearly a year. Over time, her body\u2019s vitality would slowly wilt away, eventually leading to death.But Xintong was born in the ancient Lin family clan, which had an old heritage. With the support of the Lin family, she could consume fire elemental desolate beast relics. With the fire elemental relics\u2019 pure Yang, she was able to combat the chilling cold within her body.Although living a long life wasn\u2019t a problem, for cultivation it was a different story. A person born with Yin Meridians could never completely open up her meridians during the Meridian realm. A latent danger would result from this realm. It would also be harder to cultivate to a higher realm, and the higher it was, the more difficult it was. Eventually, a bottleneck was reached!Although having Yin Meridians was a curse, there were always exceptions. Legends told of a human Great Empress who had Yin Meridians during ancient times. She had used her own strength to connect her meridians. When the Yin Meridians were connected again, an unknown transformation would happen. However, this was poorly documented in the history books.Lin Xintong\u2019s master was this fat elder. He had tried to connect up Lin Xintong\u2019s broken meridians, but from the ancient methods left by Desolate Heaven Masters, none of them were successful. Those ancient methods were arcane and obscure. Be it the ingredients or the refinement techniques, they were too confusing for the old fat man, resulting in abysmal results. The fat elder cared for his disciple and had tried all sorts of methods while wandering the vast wilderness, but to no avail.\u201cMaster, don\u2019t sigh. Although I have Yin Meridians, with fire elemental bone relics, I can live for at least three hundred years. I\u2019m much more blessed than other commoners.\u201d The young girl having born from a clan with ancient heritage never worried about her meals and had seen all sorts of treasures. But over the years of wandering the wilderness, her experience taught her the hardships of the world. She knew how commoners struggled in this world. This made her sympathetic. Indeed, although she had Yin Meridians, she was much more blessed than the commoners by thousands of times.The girl swallowed the bone relic that she had just completed refining. A bone relic refined from fierce beasts was poorer in quality to a desolate bone relic. However, few warriors actually ate desolate bone relics. It was enough to eat fierce beast relics, as it took a long time to refine a desolate bone relic.\u201cUp ahead, we will enter the territory of the Lian tribal clan. Hmm, this Lian tribal clan is a small tribe of less than a thousand households. We don\u2019t really have to enter.\u201d said the fat elder as he took out a map made of rubber. He unfurled it and while looking at it said happily, \u201cThis map is all thanks to the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s Jin Long Wei. They created a new map. Originally the map of the Cloud Wilderness had not been updated in eight hundred years. Many small tribes had changed positions. An old map would not have all this indications.\u201dLin Xintong looked at her master\u2019s map, provoking a sense of doubt within her. To make a map of the Cloud Wilderness was a thankless and pointless job. Those small tribes were as many as the sand grains of the five Ganges Rivers. It was unknown which tribe would collapse, giving birth to a new one. Such a detailed map required a great deal of effort to draw, but it would be useless in about a hundred years.Connecting it to the recent ongoings of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom in the Cloud Wilderness, Lin Xintong asked, \u201cMaster, why did we travel from afar to come to the Cloud Wilderness on purpose? Also, I heard that the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom has sent the Jin Long Wei here, in preparation for the warrior selection in the Cloud Wilderness soon. It requires a lot of effort to hold a warrior selection in the vast wilderness, so why did the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom do it?\u201d\u201cIs the reason why we are here in the Cloud Wilderness related to the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Not only was there a lack of resources, but even a prodigy would not be noticed by others. So it was impossible to get ahead in life.The Tai Ah Divine Kingdom knew that, but nothing could help the situation. Besides the Cloud Wilderness, even some prodigies from the 108 states might be missed!Over the years, an unknown number of wilderness prodigies had died in vain. They either died from starvation, illness, from falling to their deaths while picking herbs or being eaten by beasts.Those who could become great men ended up dying as beggars. Even after dying, they were not given a proper burial and were simply buried underground. Sometimes there might be a wooden stick erected as a tombstone\u2013just like Yi Yun\u2019s. However, these tombstones would decay and collapse after a few years. Once those who remembered the dead died too, their presence in the world was erased.Born poor and dying without a trace; that was the fate of the people in the wilderness. Lian Chengyu understood it deeply, resulting in his distorted view of life.The fat elder said, \u201cOur trip here has both something and nothing to do with the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s selection. To say it more concretely, the reason why we are here and the sudden warrior selection by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom are likely caused by the same incident.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d This had evoked the young girl\u2019s interest. A pair of slender long eyes gently stirred as her long eyelashes caught the faint sunlight.\u201cFive months ago, some strange phenomenon had happened in the Cloud Wilderness. It was a day with clear skies, but in a couple of seconds, the entire sky in the Cloud Wilderness, a region of hundred thousand miles was covered by thick clouds!\u201d\u201cAnd the strange thing about it was, the clouds were purple in color!\u201d\u201cThe purple cloud covered the entire Cloud Wilderness. This sort of phenomenon was simply amazing. Even the astronomers of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom declared that night an astronomical phenomenon, and named it: \u2019Purple Clouds\u2019 Birth\u2019!\u201d\u201cThis phenomenon had happened again two months ago. It was even more spectacular, covering the celestial objects and masking the world!\u201d\u201cThis Purple Clouds\u2019 Birth had alarmed the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom; but for the commoners in the Cloud Wilderness, they did not know anything. As the phenomenon happened at night, with their normal eyesight, it would be hard for them to distinguish the colors at night. They also didn\u2019t know that the purple clouds had covered the entire Cloud Wilderness, nor did they know that the Purple Clouds\u2019 Birth had caused a Yuan Qi disorder in the confines of the Cloud Wilderness.\u201d\u201cAt that time, even in the deepest parts of the Cloud Wilderness, desolate beasts that lay dormant for hundreds of thousands of years were startled!\u201d\u201cThere are only a few possibilities for such a phenomenon to happen.\u201d\u201cFirst, it could be the birth of some treasure. However, the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom had used treasure compasss five months ago to search the Cloud Wilderness. Although the treasure compasss would be unable to find the exact location of the treasure, they would be able to confirm the existence of a treasure within a large vicinity.\u201d\u201cBut the treasure compasss had not a single reaction. That meant that there was either no treasure, or that the treasure was so mysterious that the detector could not detect it. If it was the latter, it would be hard to imagine! Such a treasure would be capable of stirring a storm of bloodshed on the lands!\u201d\u201cThe second possibility is a reclusive lord among the human race had made a huge breakthrough. Or it could have been an ancient desolate beast causing chaos. However, such a possibility is extremely unlikely; although the Cloud Wilderness is extensive, it would be a speck when considered under the backdrop of the entire world. There\u2019s nothing special about it, so a reclusive lord or an ancient desolate beast would not likely choose this place.\u201d\u201cAs for the third possibility, the odds are slimmer. They are legends purely from hearsay, it\u2019s pointless speaking of those. I\u2019ve brought you here to the Cloud Wilderness, one was for that phenomenon, for who knows if there will be any treasure that will join up your Yin Meridians!\u201d\u201cMaster\u2026\u201d the girl faintly sighed. Although she was touched, she could not bear seeing this fat elder rushing everywhere over even the tiniest possibility of curing her of her terminal illness.But she knew that her terminal illness was a curse, although rumors mention of an ancient empress had managed to join up her meridians through her own powers, it was after all a rumor.Such rumors proved the difficulty of joining up the meridians of this terminal illness!The fat elder knew Lin Xintong\u2019s thoughts and smiled, \u201cAlright, coming here for such a phenomenon to enrich your experience is a must, even if there were no results from it. This phenomenon that happened within the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom had caused the Tai Ah royal family to be alarmed. Besides the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, even neighboring kingdoms had sneaked into the Cloud Wilderness to investigate!\u201d\u201cIn the past few months, Tai Ah Divine Kingdom had sent out the Jin Long Wei, looking for the cause of the phenomenon. They were yearning that it was the revelation of some treasure. Since the Jin Long Wei were in the Cloud Wilderness, they might as well hold a warrior selection.\u201dAfter the fat elder\u2019s monologue, the girl understood suddenly. It was no surprise the Jin Long Wei had drawn up a detailed map, that included even the thousand-household small tribes for the Cloud Wilderness.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get going. After passing that mountain, we will pass through the Lian tribal clan, then we will stop by at the Tao tribal clan. That is a big tribe of over a hundred thousand households. We can rest there.\u201dJust as the fat elder finished saying that, his heart skipped a beat and let out of quiet \u201ceh\u201d sound.\u201cMaster, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cIn the waterfall ahead, there\u2019s someone there. It seems like a case of drowning. Let\u2019s go take a look!\u201d he said as he started moving forward through the dense forest. Although his steps looked slow, each step yielded a large distance, as if the ground under his feet had contracted in length.Lin Xintong had also followed. There were people who lived at the peak, and would not interfere with the sufferings of the millions of people in this world. But if they were to actually meet it, they would interfere by saving lives.\u2026Yi Yun did not know how long he had been under the plunge basin. From the previous night, after absorbing all of the desolate bones energy in one go, Yi Yun had jumped into the plunge basin, entering a cultivation trance state. Till now, Yi Yun was still not fully awake; it was as if he was still in a dream.The desolate bones\u2019 energy had already been digested completely by Yi Yun\u2019s body, with not a drop left!His body had entered a starvation mode once again.In a daze, Yi Yun felt a soft hand grabbing him by the collar, lifting him up\u2026Yi Yun\u2019s body was light; he felt like he was lying on a soft grass patch, and the soft hands were pressing on his chest.\u201cPuah!\u201dYi Yun spit out a mouthful of water. This water wasn\u2019t clear, but cloudy. It was mixed with Yi Yun\u2019s impurities that resulted from his body cultivation.\u201cEh?\u201dThe girl who had saved Yi Yun did not reveal any expression of aversion, but was one of surprise. As a Desolate Heaven Master, she knew immediately what it meant by spitting out such water.After Yi Yun woke up and recovered his vision, he had trouble opening his eyes from the bright sunlight.(Author notes: Some people might say there are plot holes in the story, such as why don\u2019t the people in the vast wilderness eat vegetables or fish. For this, please don\u2019t consider from the point of view of modern Earth. In ancient times, many people ate Guanyin clay, and exchanged their children for food. Even in the China of the 1950-1960s, people had experienced famines for 3 years. Many had died, and people can also ask, why didn\u2019t they eat fish or dig for worms? Why didn\u2019t people eat the locusts when there\u2019s a locust plague?\uff1f Were people from ancient times silly, and didn\u2019t know how to eat those?)(People from ancient times weren\u2019t silly. If they were willing to exchange their children for food, what else could they not eat? Cocooned\u2019s family was located near the seas and mountains. The fish in the seas were much more than in the lakes. There were even mushrooms and rabbits, but yet we still starved. Cocooned\u2019s mother had experienced the famine. According to her, during the starvation period, there wasn\u2019t even grass growing on the mountains. Why? First it was dry, and secondly, all the grass roots were uprooted and eaten. It was extremely hard to hunt for rabbits. As for fish, going to the ocean to fish needed a boat and nets. Commoners did not have that, and even in the shallow seas or lakes, if you did not rear the fish specially, there would be few fish. Since it was originally few, after fishing, it became even fewer. This resulted in the cost to fishing to become extremely high. So for a person like Cocooned, if I were to fish, the small fish I capture might be less than the energy I expended. Not to mention catching insects as it expended energy faster, and was equivalent to suicide.)(In this book, the setting of the vast wilderness is even more barren that many places on Earth. Even the land was described by Cocooned, such as littered with black ironstone, which caused farming to be extremely difficult. And from the food production capabilities of ancient China, the production quantity is pathetic. There was no such thing as genetic modified grains or combiners. As for other details, Cocooned feels that explaining it one by one will make it seem rife with nitty-gritty details. A small lake with such low number of fishes that it will lose you more energy to catch it than not doing anything, frogs without poison would have been eaten clean early on. When people become hungry, nothing really matters be it insects or worms. Using a lake and a frog pond to rear a tribal clan with a thousand households is quite impossible. Cocooned tried to cut down on those details, but has resulted in controversy. So I decided to explain it in one detailed paragraph.(Also some people asked why didn\u2019t Yi Yun hunt. The book has explained, only in the Purple Blood realm could a person have the ability to hunt fierce beasts. Some may ask what do fierce beasts eat? Although Cocooned thinks Xuanhuan books don\u2019t need to delve into all the unknowns, but Cocooned had planned an entire setting for this world, and tried to construct it without any loopholes. As the story progresses, it will be slowly explained.)(I\u2019m thankful for everyone\u2019s opinions. And I would accept any constructive criticisms.)(After explaining with a thousand characters, I\u2019m also drunk. I won\u2019t go into such details in the future. I sincerely hope people will think more and doubt less. It isn\u2019t because there are plot holes, but because Cocooned didn\u2019t want to go into too much nitty-gritty details. And some might miss things that were written. Thank you everyone.)\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was washed clean, without a spot marring it.In the vast wilderness, this clothes were what the poor wore.A rich kid would only wear linen clothes when an elderly relative had passed away. This was to indicate an impoverished state, also known as putting on mourning apparel.The girl in front of him did not look like a poor kids in terms of temperament or looks; yet, she wore linen clothes.And with her slim figure and jade like skin; after wearing the linen clothes, it gave an impression of a fairy having descended to the mortal world, hiding in the mountains.\u201cYou\u2026You are\u2026\u201d Yi Yun had doubts, this girl was definitely not from the Lian tribal clan, could she be an outsider?Yi Yun looked at the sky and it was already late in the morning. When he entered the water, it was in the middle of the night. Did he stay in the water for a whole night?Suddenly, Yi Yun realized something with a great shock!He had stayed underwater for an entire night, which was beyond the capabilities of a normal person.Although Yi Yun had been in a trance like state, but he knew that the Purple Crystal\u2019s cool energy flow had maintained his bodily functions, allowing him to not die of asphyxiation.The Purple Crystal was his biggest secret.Why would this girl be at the plunge basin at this time? Did she know how long he had been in the water for?Thankfully, the girl\u2019s next words dispelled his worries.\u201cWhy were you floating on the water? Were you drowning?\u201dFloating on the water?It seems like when the girl appeared, he was already floating.Yi Yun heaved a sigh of relief, and cupped his fists saying, \u201cThank you for Miss\u2019 saving, eh\u2026\u201dYi Yun then realized that there was a fat elder behind this girl. The elder\u2019s head was full of silvery white hair, and did not look young. However, his skin was extremely fresh and bright. Not only did he lack wrinkles, it was ruddy.Yi Yun thought of a phrase \u201cred amidst white, exceptional in might\u201d out of nowhere.Yi Yun felt a chill. This phrase was used to describe beautiful girls, but using it to describe an old man was ridiculous.Yi Yun realized the old man was looking at him cheekily, as if he was very interested in him.His eyes were originally small, and his face was plump. This laugh had nearly caused his eyes to disappear, but that pair of eyes seemed to be able to see through Yi Yun.Yi Yun suddenly had a feeling of having nowhere to hide, and that feeling was extremely uncomfortable.Was he\u2026able to see the Purple Crystal in my heart!But at the next moment, Yi Yun realized he had overly worried. The fat elder\u2019s gaze did not stay at his heart, but said with deep meaning, \u201cYoung lad, you may be young, but you have many deep thoughts!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Yi Yun shivered. What did the old man mean by that?\u201cYou were not drowning, yet you thanked us. We didn\u2019t even save you, but you still took advantage of the situation for your benefit. Are you hiding something? Your expression seemed to be in a panic just a while ago.\u201dHaving said that, the fat elder smirked as if he had caught on to something.Yi Yun\u2019s heart skipped a beat!At this time, the fat elder\u2019s hand had already rested on Yi Yun\u2019s shoulders. This made Yi Yun worried. F**k, I hate it when people pat me on the shoulders! It nearly cost him his life the last time Lian Chengyu did it!\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand, I\u2019m not interested in the little secret your body has.\u201d The fat elder said jovially. What a joke, as an elder of esteemed status, why would I harbor thoughts of the secret a ten plus year old child residing in a small tribal clan in the vast wilderness would have? A dysphemism would be like an emperor snatching the belongings of a small beggar.How could that happen!Of course, these were the thoughts of the fat elder, but in the eyes of Yi Yun, he felt the elder\u2019s smile was\u2026extremely wretched.\u201cI\u2019m just curious\u2026you seem to be\u2026oh\u2026\u201d The fat elder\u2019s expression changed, \u201cYou can actually reach such a level?\u201dThe fat elder\u2019s words gave Yi Yun a slight treble.Things had happened to suddenly. Yi Yun had just floated up from the water only to meet this old and young duo, and had not been able to check his own physical condition. After checking, he realized his cultivation was\u2026huh? Why is it still at the fourth level of mortal blood, Meridian realm?His cultivation had not improved, but deep down, something was different.\u201cWhat is going on. Previously I had absorbed herbal essence from a huge pile of herbs, and with a tiny amount of desolate bones energy, I could go from a weakling to the realm of opening up my Ren Du Er Mai. Last night I had sucked dry all the desolate bones essence, and succeeded in completely digesting it. I thought I would be able to surge into the legendary Purple Blood realm, but even if I did not reach it, I should be at the peak of Qi Gatherer, but why am I stuck at the Meridians realm?\u201dHaving finished an entire piece of desolate bone, it\u2019s too disappointing to be still at the fourth level of Mortal Blood! This was the energy Lian Chengyu needed to break through into the Purple Blood realm.Could my natural talent be that bad? But\u2026what did the fat elder\u2019s words mean, saying \u201cactually\u201d reach such a level?Was breaking through to the Meridians realm an unbelievable feat for a warrior from a small tribe?The fat elder looked with uncertainty at Yi Yun, mumbling, \u201cCleared Meridians, Dragon Pulse, Tempered Body, Bone Blood as One. It can\u2019t be. This kid is born from the Cloud Wilderness, and should be from the Lian tribal clan, it would be impossible to have a Tempered Body, Dragon Pulse?\u201dThe fat elder looked at the dull clothes and torn old shoes Yi Yun wore, and guessed his background. Even if a disciple of a big tribe had came to the Cloud Wilderness for training, they would wear linen clothes, but it would be new; it would be different from Yi Yun, who had clearly worn those for years.\u201cCleared Meridians, Dragon Pulse, Tempered Body, Bone Blood as One?\u201dYi Yun did not know the meaning to the fat elder\u2019s words, but he could tell it was something good!It seemed he had unknowingly obtained a great benefit?\u201cMaster, you say this lad has a Tempered Body?\u201d said the surprised young girl upon hearing the fat elder\u2019s words.It seemed like this assessment was something out of the ordinary!\u201cYeah\u2026if it was an elite from a family with long heritage, it is of no surprise accomplishing it. But for a young poor child in the vast wilderness to accomplish a Tempered Body is very rare!\u201dThe fat elder could tell that Yi Yun did not know the meaning of such a state, and explained to him, \u201cAlthough there are five levels to Mortal Blood, only the first four levels have anything to do with training the body. The fifth level, Qi Gatherer is an intermediary stage between Mortal Blood and Purple Blood.\u201cReaching the fourth level isn\u2019t hard, but to train to the extreme, such that every inch of body reaches the state of Tempered Body is not easy. Such a person not only has cleared all his meridians, their meridians are also stronger than a normal warrior\u2019s. They would have a strong life force, as if there was a dragon dancing within his body! And when the tempering of the body is complete, the bones, flesh and blood are perfectly one. A strike would cause the bones and blood to shout out as one!\u201dThe fat elder\u2019s explanation enlightened Yi Yun. No wonder even after finishing more than half the desolate bones\u2019 energy, he had still no improvement. All the energy was used to reach this Tempered Body state!His improvements in his training had been fast, and Yi Yun knew the principle of haste makes waste, so having risen through the levels at those speeds might not have been a good thing!But having accidentally gone into deep sleep underwater, he had removed any latent problems!\u201cAi, your constitution is extremely normal,\u201d said the old man as he squinted his eyes. Compared to Zhang Yuxian, his ability was much higher.The method Zhang Yuxian had used to test Yi Yun\u2019s talent had obtained the \u201ctalent\u201d of the Purple Crystal.As for this old man, he could tell Yi Yun\u2019s true talent with his bare eyes. Yi Yun was stunned, this fat man had clearly reached the realm of opening \u201cHeaven\u2019s Eye\u201d!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even just two months ago, this body was so weak that it could not even hold a chicken. The fat elder was already very euphemistic by saying \u201cextremely normal\u201d.Yi Yun was worried, if the fat elder had opened Heaven\u2019s Eye, could he not see what lies within his heart\u2026\u201cNormal constitution, born poor, yet\u2026\u201d The fat elder pondered. He looked at the plunge basin behind Yi Yun, and a thought flashed in his mind.He touched all over Yi Yun\u2019s body, giving him goosebumps.What\u2019s this old man doing, doesn\u2019t he know it was improper to touch between men!\u201cI understand now. This kid must have eaten some treasured food, and trained your body in the deep pool. The treasured food\u2019s violent energy was neutralized by the cold pool water. As such, you accidentally tempered your whole body, allowing you to reach such a state!\u201dThis old man\u2019s words made Yi Yun speechless. This old man was too good, although his guess was not fully accurate, he was in fact very close to the truth.\u201cTo be able to obtain such an achievement at this age sure isn\u2019t easy. Although it\u2019s because you had some luck in eating some treasure, as for in the future\u2026I doubt there will be more. But, it\u2019s still not easy!\u201dThe fat elder\u2019s words made Yi Yun roll his eyes. Was this a compliment or an insult!\u201cHey kid, I guess it must be fate that you met me\u2026\u201d said the fat elder as he reached into his chest, as if he was taking something.Yi Yun\u2019s eyes lit up, is this the early indications of a pie in the sky? Could it be that the old man had appreciated him, and was planning on giving him some technique manual or desolate bones essence? Even magical pills would do!The fat elder\u2019s hand was thick and fat. He wore a gaudy jade ring on his thumb. It was unlike the dry look normal elders would have.Having grabbed something, his fat fist was clenched tight. Like a white steamed bun, he placed it on Yi Yun\u2019s palm and released gently.Huala, Huala!A few bronze coins fell into Yi Yun\u2019s hands. The bronze coins were still warm from the fat elder\u2019s heat.Bronze coins?Yi Yun\u2019s mind was filled with embarrassment and depression.\u201cTake this and buy some sweets.\u201d The fat elder smiled as he waved his hands, with an air of generosity. The linen clothed girl beside him smiled mildly. They had treated Yi Yun has a child.\u201cWhat the f**k!\u201d Yi Yun looked at the twenty bronze coins in his hand, with a thousand \u201cf**k your mother\u201d running through his head.In this world, mortals do use gold, silver and bronze as currency. But in the Cloud Wilderness, gold and silver was only an auxiliary form of payment. The real currency was food, armor and weapons.This old man was obviously an expert, but he was still required to carry around some currency in this world.Silver bullions were a large denomination in the mortal world. It was a essential to have bronze coins for the typical inn or food stall.So it was not a surprise the old man had bronze coins.But\u2026But to experts, not only bronze coins, but even gold and silver was of little value to them. If you wanted to give, at least give a few golden ingots!Yi Yun was speechless.Actually having such thoughts of hooping to get something out of nothing was an embarrassing. As the saying goes, \u201cpoverty acquaints men with strange bedfellows\u201d.With his training resources spent, he was still in the Meridians realm. Although having a Tempered Body was great, but without being in the Purple Blood realm, he did not dare to hunt on the vast wilderness. Without hunting, how was he going to eat? Am I supposed to just eat grain porridge?And even for grain porridge, Jiang Xiaorou had always left the grains for him, while she just drank the porridge water.If Yi Yun were to starve, he would also cause Jiang Xiaorou to starve.Yi Yun felt ridiculed, but he he still collected the bronze coins. He might as well have taken it. After all, if he gave it to Jiang Xiaorou, she could exchange it the tribe or other people for some food.Indeed, there was no pie in the sky.Also, the fat elder only considered him a child; hence, giving him some bronze coins for sweets was to amuse himself.Although he had a Tempered Body, as his constitution was average, he was nothing special since he had reached that state through treasures.He was small, poor, and lacking in strength. He was also total strangers with the old man, why would the old man give him any benefits?He just found it fun to play with him, and was teasing him.\u201cI say elder, where are you going?\u201d Yi Yun tried to make conversation.There was no harm getting to know the old man after all.\u201cWe are going to the Tao tribal clan.\u201dThe fat elder did not bother keeping it secret.\u201cTao tribal clan\u2026\u201d Yi Yun knew the Tao tribal clan was a large clan near to the Lian tribal clan, and was the owner of the Lian tribal clan!The Lian tribal clan\u2019s manufacturing of weapons and armor were supplied to the Tao tribal clan.This old and young duo were obviously people of stature. They had the ability to cross the Cloud Wilderness without any hesitations; it was admirable.Yi Yun suddenly recalled that when talking to the Lian tribal clan, Zhang Yuxian had mentioned that something had happened in the Cloud Wilderness. He had also mentioned that several VIPs would pass by the Lian tribal clan, preventing the Lian tribal clan Patriarch from any neglection.From the looks of it, this old man and young girl were VIPs!The fat elder was already planning on leaving. But just before he took a stride, he suddenly felt hungry. He looked at the sun and rubbed his fat double chin saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to eat something. The scenery here is not bad. There\u2019s a mountain and the water is clean. Let\u2019s eat here.\u201d\u201cEat?\u201d Upon hearing that word, Yi Yun suddenly felt\u2026hungry, very hungry.Having eaten porridge for two consecutive months, he had been using herbs and the desolate bones essence as energy sources, but he had digested all the energy he had absorbed last night in the deep waters.It was as if Yi Yun\u2019s body was empty on the inside.\u201cHey, disciple, let\u2019s eat.\u201d the fat elder called to Lin Xintong.Lin Xintong noded and looked at Yi Yun, saying \u201cLittle brother, why don\u2019t you join us?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Yi Yun was stunned. He was exploding with happiness. He felt that the girl\u2019s voice was extremely touching, \u201cThat\u2026You don\u2019t have to do that\u2026\u201dAlthough Yi Yun had said that, he was already finding a spot to sit.This old man and young girl must be of exceptional stature, the food they eat can\u2019t be that bad?Any dish would be very conducive for cultivation!The fat elder was planning to light a fire; however, seeing that Yi Yun was planning to drag out his stay, he scorned with disdain. But since his disciple had already invited him, he could only accept it.He touched the jade ring on his right hand and pulled out three defeathered pheasants like a magician. He pierced them using a pole and placed it by the side of the fire.The old man\u2019s jade ring was like Doraemon\u2019s pouch. In a short while, he took out a bunch of bottles and jars filled with spices.Yi Yun was envious. He had initially brushed the old man\u2019s ring off as a magical performance, but the item was a treasure that could hold the largest items.Looks like this was similar to the legendary \u201cinterspatial rings\u201d.\u201cHehe, count your lucky stars, kid. Not many people have tasted my culinary skills!\u201d Saying this, the old man rubbed his hands and began grilling a pheasant.Only then did Yi Yun realize that this was no ordinary pheasant. It looked like a pheasant, but within it was tremendous amounts of energies. This was because Yi Yun could see the light dots floating from the pheasant. This energy was very pure, easily causing envy.Yi Yun felt his tongue salivating. It was good stuff!He had not eaten meat in two months, so having seen this plump pheasant which consisted of pure energy, how could he not salivate?He could not wait to roast the pheasant and slow it down his stomach.But very quickly, Yi Yun felt depressed when he saw the old man\u2019s method of roasting.The old man\u2019s \u201cculinary skills\u201d were\u2026too terrible to watch!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 - As a glutton with principles, no compromisesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48: As a glutton with principles, no compromisesThe fat elder was holding up the pheasant, but he was placing it too close to the fire, and his rotating speed was too slow. Roasting food with a naked fire was unlike grilling in a barbecue eatery. A barbecue eatery uses specialized grills that are easily lit. Its flame is uniform and most importantly, it is smokeless.But for firewood, the fire is not uniform, and the smoke is thick. This smoke was the ash from the unburned wood, and would rise up with the flames, sticking onto the pheasant\u2019s skin. So in a while, the pheasant in the old man\u2019s hands were already burned black. It wasn\u2019t overcooked, but was covered with a layer of ash. It not only affected the texture, but it would taste bitter.Although the old man wiped oil every now and then, it was unable to change the situation of a layer of ash growing thicker. From the way the old man did it, it was clear it was a matter of time before it was overburned.Using firewood to grill meat was a difficult job. Even a barbecue eatery\u2019s experts might not be able to do it well, but the old man was even worse.This was understandable, after all, what sort of position did this old man have? Time was precious, so he need not prepare food for himself.His culinary skills were naturally nothing flattering, furthermore grilling meat with firewood was extremely difficult.\u201cThis is practically the destruction of Heaven\u2019s property!\u201d As a glutton, eh, no, as a connoisseur who enjoys researching delicacies, Yi Yun could no longer endure.As the pheasant was almost done roasting, the old man sprinkled various spices, and offered the blackened roasted pheasant to Lin Xintong.Yi Yun felt that there was no spot one could get a bite in!But it seemed like Lin Xintong did not mind. She said \u201cThank you master\u201d, accepted the grilled pheasant and took small bites at it. Although her lips were pink and tiny, after eating such a roasted pheasant, her lips were colored black. This scene made Yi Yun\u2019s lose all expression on his face.It was a great offense against food culture.The old man treasured his disciple, so the roasted pheasant was naturally left for her. As for Yi Yun, there was no doubt he would be last. But Yi Yun was still grateful. If this pheasant was sold, its price would be expensive, even someone like Lian Chengyu would not be able to afford it.After he finished grilling one pheasant, the old man began grilling a second one.As the first was given to Lin Xintong, the old man had grilled it with extra care, but since the second one was for himself, it looked even worse.However, the old man was still very pleased with his work. After he finished grilling both pheasants, he took out a jug of wine from his ring. He began eating the roasted meat savorily and drinking his wine with pleasure. After finishing it, he had a look of enjoyment, and his white beard was curling with satisfaction.He then had a sudden thought and looked at Yi Yun, saying lazily, \u201cThat\u2019s for you. You can roast it for yourself. I won\u2019t be serving.\u201dWhat the\u2026Yi Yun was speechless; although he did not expect the old man to roast a pheasant for him, but the old man had previously said, \u201cNot many people have tasted my culinary skills!\u201dWhen Yi Yun heard those words, he believed that the old man would roast a pheasant for him, but from the looks of it, that was no longer the case!Yi Yun wasn\u2019t very confident about roasting it himself. Although he had done research on food, he was after all a modern man, he could easily cook a tender and crisp roasted chicken easily with a barbecue pit and smokeless coal.But it was hard for him to do it with firewood. There was no way of blocking the ash from the firewood, and no matter how much he turned the pheasant, the ash would still end up on the pheasant meat.\u201cI say, do you have a wok?\u201d Yi Yun asked extremely politely. As a glutton with principles, he was not willing to compromise no matter how hungry he was! This was the first time he had seen meat in two months, not to mention it was high grade meat!\u201cI do.\u201d Saying that, the old man took out a pot from his ring.Although the pot was made of an unknown material, it was well made and of appropriate size. Yi Yun was very satisfied.Yi Yun began to busy himself. He began identifying the spices the old man had taken out. He was surprised at the complete assortment of spices and oil, sauces and salt. There were even some plant spice that resembled green onions and parsley.\u201cThat wine, can I borrow it?\u201d, asked Yi Yun again.\u201cEh?\u201d Wine? You want to drink two cups with old me?\u201d smiled the old man as he passed the wine to Yi Yun after recovering from a momentary shock. This kid actually appreciated wine?Although he was stingy, but he was eager to make alcohol buddies as only then was there meaning in drinking.Although he didn\u2019t like the kid in front of him, Yi Yun was better than nothing. After all, Lin Xintong did not drink alcohol, so he had been drinking alone for one whole year.\u201cMaster!\u201d Lin Xintong was a bit speechless, \u201cHow can you give kids alcohol?\u201dBut they never expected that after Yi Yun had dried the pheasant, he had poured the wine, spreading it evenly, not missing the pheasant abdominal cavity.\u201cKid, what are you doing?\u201d The old man stared as his beard flared up. This was a thousand year old wine. As a wine enthusiast, he could not endure the waste of his alcohol.\u201cI\u2019m cooking.\u201d a surprised Yi Yun answered matter-of-factly.I must say, this wine sure is good. Its aroma is sweet. I wonder what sort of treasure was it distilled from. I believe drinking one gulp of this will do wonders for cultivation!\u201cCooking? Wine can be used for cooking?\u201d The old man repudiated.After some hesitation, Yi Yun understood.The culinary methods in this world was very different from Earth\u2019s.Even during the period when food culture was at its peak in China, all the cooking techniques were very simple in ancient times.During the Tang and Song dynasties, the basic cooking methods was steaming or boiling. Be it vegetables or meat, they were mixed with salt, covered under a lid and eaten once it was cooked.As for stir-frying, quick-frying, blanching, smoking, or cooking with alcohol, etc, these methods of cooking could only be developed after material wealth was improved.Each region had different food cultures. About eighty percent of Chinese cuisine were unique.Even the most simple stir-frying of vegetables was a product of China in the entire world. Although it sounds incredible, that is what is it.In the entire Earth, the most complex cooking techniques belonged to the Chinese, with no near rival.In this world, leaving out the vast wilderness, the hard labor lives people led were too tough, so there was no energy or materials left for food experimentation.As for the rich cities, the rich were experts. They were focused on their martial arts, arrays, and the techniques for refining desolate bones, so there was no time to research cooking.Only the servants of large clans could research on this. These people made good meals, and through experience, accumulated some cooking skills. But in such a small area, there was a limit to culinary skills. Even in America, many might not know that alcohol could be used for cooking.Yi Yun glazed the pheasant\u2019s body with oil and soy sauce. He poured wine into the abdominal cavity and sprinkled some spices that resembled spring onions and cilantro. Yi Yun had tasted the spice, and with his gluttonous talent, he knew that it wouldn\u2019t be lacking compared to spring onions or cilantro.Next was the crucial point, Yi Yun used a clean coarse cloth to wrap the pheasant. He then poured large amounts of salt into the pot, and buried the pheasant in it. After completely covering the pheasant, he sealed the pot and began steaming it.The fat elder looked at Yi Yun with suspicion. He used so much salt and wrapped up the pheasant? Won\u2019t it be super salty!?Have the poor kids of this tribe not eaten salt?Even if they lacked salt, it wasn\u2019t meant to be eaten this way. It was a speechless turn of events. The fat older scoffed at the kid\u2019s eccentricity.He carried on eating his roasted pheasant, but Lin Xintong had stopped eating and watching the pot Yi Yun had placed above the fire with curiosity.Slowly, the pot began to emit a fragrance. The fragrance was not obvious. If these people were not martial artists with keen senses, they would not have smelled it.Could something with such a light scent be delicious?The fat elder had already finished his roasted pheasant, and began licking his thick and short fingers. At this moment, Yi Yun opened the pot, and used a ladle to brush away the hot salt, and took out the pheasant.A savory salt-baked pheasant was completed.The moment the salt seal was broken, a fresh savory smell was emitted, making Yi Yun ready to eat.Yi Yun was surprised that he was able to prepare the meal to his fullest capabilities. Of course, the main reason was the pheasant which was full of energy within its meat. It was much better than the bred chickens on Earth.And the wine, which was brewed from some treasure. Just some yeast and a few hundred years was enough to create the ambrosia of the gods.With the two combined, Yi Yun was able to produce a salt-baked pheasant of quality that reached unprecedented heights.\u201cEh?\u201d, flared up the old man\u2019s beard as his eyes suddenly rounded up.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - I want one itemPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: I want one itemYi Yun could no longer wait. He poured the sauces he had prepared earlier and tore off a pheasant leg and bit down.The skin was crisp and the flesh juicy. The meat was tender, and oil oozed out with each bite. His mouth was full of fragrance.It had to be said that the fat elder\u2019s unknown pheasant was absolutely delicious. It was no wonder that even after roasting it to such a pathetic state, he was still able to enjoy it.Besides, the meat included a stream of pure energy. As it entered Yi Yun\u2019s stomach, this energy spread throughout Yi Yun\u2019s body, giving him a sense of warmth that was indescribably comfortable.The old man\u2019s wine was also extremely special. After baking in salt, the alcoholic taste had not evaporated. It had seeped into the pheasants flesh, giving it an intoxicating aroma.The wine contained even purer energy, refreshing Yi Yun\u2019s entire body till his pores opened.Lin Xintong looked curiously at Yi Yun. Just from the smell and appearance, it was easy to guess that it tasted great.This kid was at most twelve and he has such skills?\u201cSister Fairy, do you want some?\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s words were extremely sweet. He knew that the girl\u2019s stature was extraordinary. The old man had treated her as the apple of his eyes, so although Yi Yun didn\u2019t know her name, there was no harm calling her Sister Fairy.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong hesitated, but seeing Yi Yun tear off an untouched drumstick for her, she was unsure what to do.After hesitating a moment, she accepted it and took a small bite.It was indeed delicious!In comparison, this would make her master\u2019s \u201cBlack Charred Pheasant\u201d unappetizing.The girl took out a handkerchief, wiped her mouth and thanked him with a smile.She had never tried such a way of cooking and the taste was very unique.Although Lin Xintong lead an austere life, and was not obsessed with food, but having been out in the wilderness for training, and having been eating the bitter \u201cBlack Charred Pheasant\u201d daily, she had reached her limit.Although the girl appreciated it, she did not exaggerate in her praise. But the fat elder was different. He was a greedy glutton. Despite him reaching the state where he could avoid grain many years back, he had never succumbed to it. He made sure to have four meals a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper.Usually, he would be supplied with food and drink at home; it tasted good, and was sufficient to satiate his taste buds. But now with him out with his disciple, it was tough on him. He was already sick of eating ash barbecue continuously.His greed had led to him salivating, but he could not lower his status to ask from Yi Yun. As Yi Yun did not seem to have any intention at giving him some of the pheasant, the fat elder was unhappy. This kid was such an ingrate, did he forget who gave him the pheasant and wine?\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you could cook. I have tasted all the world\u2019s delicacies, so I am definitely an authority when it comes to taste! Come on, kid, I\u2019ll appraise you, and see how good is your culinary skills. I\u2019ll give you pointers if there\u2019s any room for improvement.\u201d As he said that, a greasy fat hand stained with soot stretched before him. He had not even wiped his hands from eating the roasted pheasant!Yi Yun wanted to avoid by instinct, but for some reason, although the fat hand\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t fast, he was unable to evade it. In the end, a small portion of the pheasant was teared off. Two cream of the crop wings were gone!Damn it!Yi Yun cursed in his heart. But at this time, the fat elder had already bit down, as he looked sardonically at Yi Yun, which read, \u201cYou think you could avoid my moves with your little abilities?\u201dAs he bit down, the grease exploded and fragrance filled his mouth. The fat elder\u2019s eyes lit up!The meat was of course delicious, but the most important thing was the taste of alcohol.In fact, the old man had eaten lots of delicious delicacies, but this was the first time seeing such an approach.Having the alcohol absorbed into the meat, it made it even tastier!He was not only a glutton, but also an alcoholic. It had never crossed his mind that alcohol could be used in this way. Alcohol and pheasant, two distinct and delicious tastes when combined could be so unbelievable!In contrast, the roasted pheasant he previously made was only fit for dogs!Although the old man had already finished a pheasant previously, and the unknown pheasant was extremely large in size, but having learned the Elephant Swallowing Technique, Yi Yun knew that the meat was extremely resistant to digestion. A normal person could survive on a drumstick for days without going hungry.Having eaten one and a half, the old man had no indications of being full.Although he looked refined eating the pheasant, the old man\u2019s speed was surprisingly fast. He finished half a pheasant in about a minute, leaving only a pile of bones.The bones, even the delicate rib bones were eaten clean, putting a dog to shame.The old man was not bothered about Yi Yun\u2019s surprised gaze, and calmly wiped the oil off his mouth saying, \u201cThe taste is passable. If you improve further, you will catch up to my roasted pheasant.\u201dYi Yun nearly choked upon hearing the old man\u2019s brazen claims. What sort of person was he? It felt like his stature was extraordinary, but why was he so shameful?The old man pretended not to notice Yi Yun\u2019s despising glare and looked at the salt baked pheasant in Yi Yun\u2019s hands saying, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you eating, are you full?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Yi Yun was shocked, he quickly shook his head and attacked the salt baked-pheasant in his hands.What a joke. If he was slower by a second, or even in a blink of an eye, the pheasant in his hands could have turned to a pile of bones.Besides being tasty, the meat was great nourishment for the body. Yi Yun felt his originally empty body fill up with energy in a short while. It made his blood begin to stir, and made him grow stronger.Could this pheasant be a descendent of some ancient bird desolate beast?Yi Yun came to an acceptance that with rich people eating this kind of foods daily, their strength was bound to increase at rapid paces.He was initially feeling joyous from completing his Tempered Body, but he had already calmed down.His starting point was considered low. Even if he made a meteoric rise in a small tribe, but in a big tribe, it would have been nothing spectacular. He still had a long road ahead.\u201cHey, from what I see, you have some culinary skills, and it can be considered fate that we got to know each other\u2026\u201d Saying that, the fat elder touched his ring.This was the second time Yi Yun heard these words, and was already immune to it. He calmly wiped his mouth, waiting for the fat elder to take something out.\u201cHehe, Kid, take this to buy some sweets,\u201d said the fat elder as he took out two golden ingots from his ring. It looked like it weighed half a pound.This was the first time Yi Yun was seeing golden ingots. Back on Earth, he had only seen gold plates displayed in the glass cases of banks, but they were not this big.Yi Yun could not help taking another glance.\u201cCome, I still have over a twenty chickens. You can cook it, and I\u2019ll give you these two gold ingots. Then, you can buy lots of sweets,\u201d said the old man happily. Although he did not admit verbally, he knew that his culinary skills were nothing compared to Yi Yun. Yi Yun\u2019s salt-baked pheasant, especially combined with the alcohol and the meat fragrance had made the fat elder\u2019s mouth water.Upon hearing this, Yi Yun curled his mouth. In the Cloud Wilderness, gold ingots were only pleasant to the eye, but they were of no use.On Earth, these two large gold pieces would have been enough to buy a lifetime\u2019s worth of food. But in this world, food was very expensive, especially in the Cloud Wilderness. Even with gold ingots, one might not be able to buy anything. If he were to use gold to exchange with Lian Chengyu for food, it would be throwing himself to the wolves.\u201cI don\u2019t want gold,\u201d said Yi Yun who was unmoved. This old man had initially given him bronze coins, and now he gave gold. It was clear he was treating Yi Yun as some kid who got lucky, and not someone who practiced martial arts. \u201cSir, don\u2019t you know that the outcome would be disastrous if a kid carries gold into the streets?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d choked the fat elder. Thoughts such as even if Yi Yun couldn\u2019t use it, he could have given it to his parents floated into the elder\u2019s mind.Lin Xintong who was by the fat elder\u2019s side looked at Yi Yun with surprise. The principle of an innocent man gets into trouble because of his wealth was simple, but as a twelve year old child, he was not only unmoved by the gold, but he said it as a matter of fact. It was pretty impressive.\u201cThen what do you want?\u201d said the fat elder as he kept the gold.\u201cI only want one item from you Sir,\u201d Yi Yun said it slowly and calmly as he looked the fat elder in the eye.The fat elder said with interest, \u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cLittle me can tell that Sir is some extraordinary person. You must be someone of a high standing and exceptional status, with\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, cut the flattery.\u201d The fat elder looked at Yi Yun with a despicable look. This kid sure was odd.\u201cOh\u2026I\u2019m not sucking up to you, I\u2019m just expressing my admiration towards you. You can have all that and admired by many, including me, because\u2026Sir you have the strength!\u201d\u201cIn this wilderness, those with strength will be honored by others!\u201d\u201cSo little me will make a request with great courage for one item, that is\u2013strength!\u201dYi Yun said those words with confidence. Although he had said it slowly, it entered straight into the ears, giving the fat elder a shock.Lin Xintong blinked her pair of beautiful eyes and looked at Yi Yun with surprise. What Yi Yun had said was very simple, but when her master had asked him what he wanted, he had said those words to express his desire of becoming strong. This was unlike how kids speak without thought.These words were unlike that of a child.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - The fat elder\u2019s vile interestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50: The fat elder\u2019s vile interest\u201cYou want me to take you in as a disciple?\u201d flashed his eyes, as the fat elder wiped away his hippy gaze, changing it to one that exerted pressure!Yi Yun held his breath and looked into the fat elder\u2019s eyes, and said slowly while shaking his head, \u201cYou\u2019re asking me if I want to be taken in as your disciple, it\u2019s pointless since the decision is not made by me. My wishes are not important. If you wanted to take in disciples, I\u2019m sure many elites would come to your feet, allowing you to choose. Even if they begged you on their knees, it would be useless.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d The fat elder was surprised by Yi Yun\u2019s words once again. This kid, although he was greedy, he knew how to push his limits!This was extremely rare!Some people did not know how to obtain the greatest benefits, and they did things mediocrely and trudged through life without aim. These people were undesirable.As for others, they were greedy without an understanding of their standing. By being presumptuous, they would eventually lead themselves to self-destruction. This was described by the saying; \u201chuman beings die in pursuit of wealth and birds die in pursuit of food.\u201d Such people were even more undesirable.As for this twelve year old kid, to have such a scheming mind, and went against the flow, but yet knew his place and had a sense of propriety. It was indeed not simple to possess such qualities.This kid could tell that he did not want to accept him as a disciple, so he had not insisted.\u201cKid, I appreciate you. You guessed right, I can\u2019t take you in as a disciple. I\u2019m indeed very interested in your culinary skills. But culinary skills are just a pleasure for the mouth. But for me to take in a disciple is a huge matter. To be honest with you, I have been looking for a suitable successor all these years, but for you\u2026From your constitution, it\u2019s not good, so you lack the qualifications. Although what I say may sound harsh, but it is the truth\u2026\u201dYi Yun was not affected by it and said calmly, \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026It\u2019s good that you understand. You are much smarter than kids your own age. You can try taking a scholastic exam, and become some minor official. When that happens, you will not worry over food anymore.\u201dIn the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, the real government officials were experts. As the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom was under military jurisdiction, be it a general or district magistrate, they were all martial artists at the very least! Those who could study, but not do martial arts, could at most be an advisor or a minor official like a clerk.Seeing that Yi Yun was obviously not listening, the fat elder carried on, \u201cAs for practicing, the mind isn\u2019t unimportant, but the key is a person\u2019s talent.\u201d\u201cIn this world where resources are valuable, a warrior\u2019s resources are the various treasures and desolate bone relics! In a large tribal clan, there are limited desolate bone relics, and only the ones with most talent would be prioritized.\u201d\u201cThose with talent will improve a lot from absorbing a desolate bone relic, as for those without talent, the same desolate bone relic will only improve their strength by a tenth. And the further one goes, the harder it gets to improve one\u2019s strength. At that point, no family will be able to afford it!\u201dAfter hearing the fat elder\u2019s words, Yi Yun understood it firmly. He had some idea about cultivation matters from Jiang Xiaorou, but only after listening to this elder that he understood it clearly.In a situation with limited resources, talent was indeed important.Lian Chengyu had the ambition to break through to the Purple Blood realm was naturally because he had talent.If he lacked talent, even with the entire Lian Clan Herb Mountain and the desolate bones, Lian Chengyu would never have been able to encroach into the Purple Blood realm territory.Yi Yun knew his conditions. He was just an average youth. He was a normal mortal to the bone, and had no relations with martial families, so how could he have the talent to practice martial arts?But thinking of his absorbing of the herbs\u2019 and the desolate bones\u2019 energy the past few days using the Purple Crystal, his cultivation speed was indeed fast. This was all clearly the credit of the Purple Crystal.With the Purple Crystal deep within his heart, every heart beat would spread energy to each and every part of his body, improving his fitness. This method of absorption was much more efficient than other warriors who used their stomachs to absorb energy.After understanding these, Yi Yun\u2019s thoughts became clearer as he raised his head looking at the fat elder saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need to be taken in by you as a disciple.\u201dSince he had already indicated his position, Yi Yun did not want to insist. Actually, even if the old man had wanted to take in Yi Yun as a disciple, Yi Yun would have to think very carefully. After all, his body had a huge secret. If he did not carefully think of the special characteristics of the Purple Crystal Origins, his master might discover the secret and the consequences would be unthinkable.\u201cWhat I want from Sir is a miracle medicine! Be it fierce beast essence, desolate beast meat, herbs or even desolate bones!\u201dAfter hearing those words, the fat elder laughed, \u201cYou sure know how to take a mile from an inch. You thought well, exchanging a desolate bone relic for some chicken that was provided by myself?\u201dThe desolate bone relics stored in his rings were all of high quality. To exchange them for a few dishes was no trifling matter.\u201cI guess you aren\u2019t willing to listen to me,\u201d shaking his head in disapproval at the kid that cannot be taught. \u201cYou still want to go down the path of martial arts. It was not easy getting by reaching a state of Tempered Body, but you have never had proper martial arts cultivation. Do you even know any cultivation technique? Do you know any fighting technique? Do you have a soul cultivation technique? Without a master or any manual, are you planning on reaching the Purple Blood realm by self-teaching?\u201dAfter a barrage of rhetorical questions, Yi Yun remembered it all, cultivation technique! Fighting technique! Soul cultivation technique!Although there was plenty he did not understand, they were not important. Without question, he needed to obtain those by himself!As for the Purple Blood realm that the fat elder said\u2026The Purple Blood realm was not Yi Yun\u2019s goal. Yi Yun knew that there were many higher realms beyond the Purple Blood realm.Since he had received the mysterious Purple Crystal card, how could he just become a Purple Blood Warrior, and drift in life as someone in a small tribe of the Cloud Wilderness?Of course, his was not able to mention his goals, or people would think he has mad.Yi Yun said, \u201cI really haven\u2019t had contact with fighting techniques and soul cultivation techniques. But as for cultivation techniques, I have practiced one known as the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019!\u201c\u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019!\u201d flashed a flicker of surprise across the fat elder\u2019s face. \u201cYou actually know this set of fist techniques? This \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 is considered as the top cultivation technique of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. Even to me, I think there are many merits to this set of techniques. It\u2019s a classic! If so, you have a master who taught you this?\u201dAlthough the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 had been opened to the public by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, it was rare for a poor kid in the Cloud Wilderness to be able to learn it.The fat elder was shocked to learn that Yi Yun knew a bit of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.\u201cI don\u2019t have any master. I secretly learned it when people in the tribe were practicing it!\u201d\u201cSecretly learned\u201d, shaked the fat elder\u2019s head.Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist may be the foundation, but it\u2019s not easy. From his lack of foundation, how could this kid learn anything even if taught properly, whatmore learning it secretly?Secretly learning was equivalent to imitation. It was difficult to understand the key points.Besides, what sort of good master would there be in such a backwater poor village in the Cloud Wilderness?The person who taught this kid the technique probably was just a dabbler. How good can his \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d be?A mediocre master, and with the kid secretly learning, he must have learned some superficial tricks and thought he was good.It wasn\u2019t the case of the fat elder looking down upon the people of the Cloud Wilderness, but the people of the Cloud Wilderness had limited knowledge; they did not know how big the outside world was or how many experts were there.\u201c\u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 can be learned secretly? Do you know Tendons like Bowstrings? Do you know Thunder Within Bones? Can you punch out a tremor?\u201d asked the fat elder. Those who had learned the basics of martial arts could easily display \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, but they were all superfluous. They did not know the essence of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.Yi Yun cupped his hands saying, \u201cI\u2019m lacking but I know a thing or two about Tendons like bowstrings and Thunder Within Bones!\u201dThunder Occurring in the Nine Clouds, Surprise Bow Drops Flock was the key result of the set of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, so how could Yi Yun not know? He could already create snapping sounds in his tendons, scaring the birds in the forest before reaching the Meridians realm!Now he had completely opened up his Meridians, his Ren Du Er Mai was opened, and he had a Tempered Body! Yi Yun felt the energy within him trashing like the ocean waves. If not for the sudden appearance of the fat elder and the girl in white, Yi Yun would have done a round of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 to see the progress of his cultivation.\u201cHaha! What a good know a thing or two!\u201d The fat elder was clearly not convinced of Yi Yun\u2019s accomplishments. \u201cSince you\u2019ve said that, I do want to see what sort of Thunder Within Bones you have reached!\u201dAs the fat elder laughed, he had the sudden vile interest of wanting to teach Yi Yun a lesson. He turned his head and said to Lin Xintong, \u201cXintong, during this tour to the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, I gave you the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 for you to roughly look through, didn\u2019t I? For this cultivation technique, I guess you had also casually practiced it for about half a month. Although you didn\u2019t work hard at it, there has to be some minor accomplishment!\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you spar with this kid and give him some pointers?\u201d\u201cRight, you should suppress your level too. Lower it to the level of the third level of Mortal Blood, Thunderous would do. Don\u2019t hurt this kid.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, she had heard the entire conversation between Yi Yun and the fat elder.She could not believe that her master would be so bad to want her to fight with a child!She was already seventeen, and although she had Yin Meridians that prevented her from clearing her meridians, but at her current stage, she was far from what Yi Yun could measure up to. After all, she was a genius as she had excellent perception and had an excellent constitution, so her cultivation had not been seriously affected.Even by lowering her level to the third level of Mortal Blood\u2019s Thunderous, it was already a form of bullying.She knew that her master had the intention to tease Yi Yun, and to show off in front of a person from the Cloud Wilderness. It made her unsure to laugh or cry, for an esteemed Desolate Heaven Master wanted to show off in front of a starving kid from the Cloud Wilderness. It was as if he was behaving more and more immature as he aged.Besides, he even said\u2026Words like \u201cgave the Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist for me to \u2018roughly\u2019 look through.\u201dWords like \u201calso \u2018casually\u2019 practiced it for \u2018about half a month\u2019.\u201dWords like \u201cdidn\u2019t \u2018work hard\u2019 at it, there has to be some minor accomplishment.\u201dThese words filled with hints of bullshit, what the heck?Lin Xintong looked at her master helplessly saying, \u201cMaster, although I don\u2019t focus on \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, but about a year ago, we came to the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. I managed to have some interaction with the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 for almost half a year. In this half year, besides focusing on my \u2018Fairy Maiden Heart Sutra\u2019, I would also seriously look at \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, not as you said, casually practiced for \u2018about half a month\u2019, and didn\u2019t work hard at it\u2026\u201dLin Xintong emphasized the words \u201chalf year\u201d and \u201cseriously\u201d exposing the fat elder\u2019s lies with no mercy. She was always a serious girl and did things meticulously. Hence, she did not slack off even for a secondary skill like \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.With that, no matter how thick the old man\u2019s skin was, his face flushed red, and he awkwardly coughed laughing, \u201cOh is it? It\u2019s been half a year? Ai, I\u2019m getting old. Time just flies by, and my memory fails me. I thought it\u2019s only been half a month\u2026\u201dThe fat elder\u2019s words made Yi Yun roll his eyes. As the saying goes, the more shameless one is, the more invincible they are. Remembering half a year as ten days. With such divine memory, how do you remember how to walk with your legs, and how to eat with your mouth?\u201cAlright, let\u2019s cut to the chase. That who, you said you have practiced the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, show it to us! If you can maintain it for the time needed for three breaths, then I\u2019ll believe you know a thing or two about \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. Then I\u2019ll give you some miracle medicine.\u201dThe fat elder quickly changed the subject. Although his act of bragging had been uncovered, his skin was extremely thick, so he recovered quickly, pretending none of whatsoever had happened.He did not think Yi Yun could persist under Lin Xintong, even in her suppressed Thunderous realm state, for more than the time needed for three breaths.This was a battle of achievements, cultivation techniques, fighting techniques and battle experience, traits that could not be covered up by a lucky use of some treasure to obtain a Tempered Body.\u201cGood! I\u2019m lacking in talent, and need to obtain advice from Sister Fairy. I hope I\u2019ll receive pointers from Sister Fairy!\u201d Yi Yun took a deep breath. This was his first time sparring with an expert!He was just planning on aiding his digestion after a sumptuous meal. Besides, he knew his opponent was extremely powerful!What was inconceivable to Yi Yun was that despite knowing his opponent was extremely powerful, his heart was full of anticipation and excitement.Was he born to be a warrior?\u201cSince you want to, then alright\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong stepped off the large rock as her clothes fluttered in the wind. Her toes landed softly on the ground, like a butterfly, she did not cause as much as a speck of dust to fly up.\u201cMy name is Lin Xintong.\u201d Lin Xintong walked towards Yi Yun as she introduced herself.\u201cYi Yun!\u201d Yi Yun said his name preventing the occurrence of the fat elder saying \u201cthat who\u201d from happening again.Yi Yun walked to a clearing, and distanced himself about 10 yards opposite from Lin Xintong and faced her!In the green mountains, with an abundance of ancient pine trees, the wind blew across the rustling folds of pine trees.Not far from the two were piles of weird rocks, and a thousand-foot waterfall! As the silvery water raced down the canyon drainages, it caused slight tremors as it impacted the huge rocks.This was Yi Yun\u2019s first battle upon arriving to this world!And it was the first battle ever since he began practicing martial arts!His opponent was an otherworldly maiden. Although she looked weak and frail, seeing her standing among the green mountains, Yi Yun could only think of a phrase\u2013Still as a virgin(, move as a running rabbit).This girl be it her looks or her heart was extremely quiet.But Yi Yun had no plans on showing mercy. He knew that he did not have the qualifications to show mercy.Lin Xintong held her hands and stood there with her skirt fluttering in the wind. She said coldly, \u201cI will suppress my strength to the third level of Mortal Blood. You first!\u201dLin Xintong was very modest but Yi Yun licked his dry lips saying, \u201cLadies first\u2026It\u2019s better you be first!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t because he was showing humility, but since he had never battled before, he did not know the procedures when an expert makes his first move. So he was preventing himself from doing something foolish, or the fat elder would snigger again.Yi Yun was planning to see Lin Xintong\u2019s moves to gain confidence. When that happened, he could draw a tiger with a cat as a model, preventing him from being that terrible.\u201cThen I\u2019ll make my move, watch out!\u201dLin Xintong did not give way and suddenly she moved! Her body was like a flash of white light, sending a palm at Yi Yun\u2019s chest!\u201cWhew!\u201dA clear sound emitted from Lin Xintong\u2019s body. This was the sound produced from training the bones using \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. This sound was unlike the thunder from the sky, but a sound issued from her leap. The sound was extremely mesmerising!Yi Yun contracted his pupils. This girl in white\u2019s speed was too fast. She had covered a distance of ten yards in a blink of an eye to be in front of Yi Yun.Her palm\u2019s five fingers were white and slender, but to Yi Yun they were like five sharp swords!Up close, Yi Yun was able to see the soft textures on the young girl\u2019s fingers!Yi Yun thought he had no way of escaping such speed, but in that moment, his mind was extremely calm. It was as if the surroundings had suddenly slowed down. Yi Yun\u2019s Ren Du Er Mai had closed up to form one cycle, with his brain\u2019s channels cleared, his senses were keen, and thinking sharp. This caused his reaction to be faster than his previous self by more than ten times!In this split moment, Yi Yun\u2019s mind flashed as he recalled the Dragon Dancing the Nine Heavens stance from \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. With a roar, he leaped up like a flying dragon. And with the thousand foot waterfall as a backdrop, he flew!\u201cKa-cha!\u201dThe stone that Yi Yun was standing on had been shattered by Lin Xintong, and the blast sent stone chips flying! !Wow\uff01Yi Yun\u2019s pupils contracted. The black ironstone under his feet could not withstand a blow from Lin Xintong!It was unimaginable that her weak-looking hands could shatter stone that easily.\u201cEh?\u201d Seeing Yi Yun jump up high as if he had spread his wings flying, the fat elder was surprised.This kid has good reactions!\u201cI didn\u2019t guess he could last a round, but since he has dodged the first, it\u2019s unlikely he can dodge the second. With him in midair, he has no way of dodging the next attack. And this was just the time of one breath. There are two more breaths left, looks like it wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all to finish in the time it takes to take three breaths!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yi Yun could feel the water from the distant waterfall leaving a coolness on his face.\u2018I can actually jump that high?\u2019It was needless to say that Yi Yun had no battle experience. After obtaining a Tempered Body, his fitness had increased by leaps and bounds. But he had never had the chance to test it to see how much it had improved before meeting Lin Xintong and the fat elder.At this moment, Lin Xintong dipped her toe into the ground, and like a swallow flew up into the sky!Facing a Lin Xintong who was rushing towards him, Yi Yun was very calm. Imperceptibly, the cool Purple Crystal in his heart had moved, sending energy to his entire body.From Yi Yun\u2019s perspective, everything had became slow. The wind that blew seemed to pass him knowledge about his opponent.Clenching his fists, Yi Yun borrowed the strength of gravity and charged downwards!At that moment, the tremendous strength within Yi Yun surged out! With his meridians opened up and his Tempered Body, Yi Yun\u2019s body was like a simmering volcano that had suddenly erupted.Commanding from atop, Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain!Yi Yun roared with something that didn\u2019t sound human. It was a roar that resembled a tiger, causing fear among all the beasts!Yi Yun no longer dodged, after all there was no way to dodge in the air. He suddenly stretched out his arms and made a tiger claw pose and went straight down, coming in contact with Lin Xintong\u2019s palms!Yi Yun who had previously practiced \u2018Fierce Tiger Descends the Mountain\u2019 of the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d had previously used it against black ironstone, and it could shatter the rock.But today, it was to grab Lin Xintong\u2019s slim hands!Of course, Lin Xintong\u2019s hands were more terrifying. Her hands were capable of shattering rock as if they were tofu.Seeing Yi Yun rushing down, Lin Xintong was also extremely surprised, he actually dared to go against her head on? It\u2019s indeed true that newborn calves are not afraid of tigers!\u201cHey, disciple, don\u2019t maim him!\u201d shouted the fat elder. \u201cActually it\u2019s fine maiming him, but the problem is the kid will make us pay his hospitalization bills!\u201dThe fat elder\u2019s words had already been drowned out by the sounds between the two. They had crossed each other in the sky!\u201cBoom!\u201dA loud clap rang, as the shock wave radiated outwards. Yi Yun only felt a large strength surge towards him, causing his insides to toss and turn!As for Lin Xintong, it was as if she was blown up by the shockwave as she rapidly swirled her body.As she flew back, Lin Xintong had a strange feeling. At the moment they crossed palms, she felt a warmth from Yi Yun\u2019s palms that flowed into her body.This warm flow was inconspicuous, but it had entered her broken meridians silently before disappearing.As she carefully experienced it, Lin Xintong felt that her meridians had undergone some transformation, but yet it didn\u2019t seem so too. What happened, was it an illusion?Before she had time to think carefully, she realized that the Yi Yun who had experienced her heavy blow was not only uninjured, but had already stabilized his body while retreating.His body was upside down as he flew towards the waterfall.\u201cPeng!\u201dYi Yun was like a carp falling into the water. He crashed through the waterfall and stepped on a slippery stone behind the watery curtain!Although the waterfall\u2019s flow was from a thousand feet, and was a tremendous force, Yi Yun was able to stand firmly on this rock. He then squatted on the rock and pushed off!He raised his head, as his shining eyes shone through the white water curtain and shot towards Lin Xintong like a pair of swords!\u201cHuh!?\u201d Lin Xintong was surprised. He could actually withstand her blow without harm? A kid at the Meridians realm could actually have such a strong body?\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d The fat man stumbled. He had wanted his disciple to go easy, yet from that strike, there was not much mercy involved. Although she had suppressed her level, it was not something the kid should have been able to withstand!Before the fat elder could think it through, Yi Yun had already charged forward from that rock.\u201cSplash!\u201dYi Yun went through the waters of the waterfall.The water curtain\u2019s strength was horrifying, but Yi Yun was good at swimming, so he rushed through the indomitable waterflow, and using the strength of the waterfall, he increased the strength of his charge. From afar, the linen clothed Yi Yun was like a water dragon dancing in the waters!\u201cBoom!\u201dAt that moment, Yi Yun\u2019s body produced a thunderous sound, similar to the thunder from the sky!Thunder Occurring in the Nine Clouds!Yi Yun twisted himself in the air, and bringing his foot to his hip, he bent his body like a bow, as his right fist shrank to his ribs, he mercilessly shot out his punch like an arrow!\u201cPeng!\u201dJust like a strongbow, it was a sound that entered deep into the ears of all present!This punch had consolidated all of Yi Yun\u2019s momentum and strength. It had caused an infinite mist to cloud around him, giving the impression of an ocean surging forward!Lin Xintong was shocked, this was the strength of the youth?This thunder-like bone crackle and the twang that came from his tendons, were they produced by his body?In that moment of shock, Yi Yun was already before Lin Xintong!Lin Xintong could feel the tremendous wind that accompanied the fist. She could tell immediately the strength of the fist as it was the ultimate achievement a Meridians realm could reach.In a tenth of a blink of an eye, Lin Xintong had striked. She was still at a cultivation level of three, one less than Yi Yun.But the strike was not that of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, but her main cultivation technique: \u201cFairy Maiden Heart Sutra\u201d!Lin Xintong\u2019s hands were like a lotus as she gently pointed like a fairy adjusting her sleeves.This strike had a magical soft power to it, and was the exact opposite to the extreme strong force of the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201dHardness and Softness were opposites! Lin Xintong and Yi Yun crossed fists once again!Originally a finger colliding with a fist would result in bone fractures, but that was farther from the truth.From afar, this strong Qi blast was like a hammer hitting a soft Qi wall.The Qi wall deformed drastically, but it had managed to take on that tremendous Qi blast\u2019s attack!\u201cBoom!\u201dWith a loud burst, the Qi wave exploded at the last moment.Lin Xintong\u2019s flinched as she retreated three steps back!As for Yi Yun, he flew backwards by more than ten feet. His clothes were torn and his chest was surging with blood as his face flushed from the blood.Boom!Yi Yun stepped on a boulder. His entire body was hurting, and it seemed like his innards had been completely misplaced. All he could see was stars.So powerful\u2026Yi Yun was impressed. This was an expert who suppressed her strength to one level below himself.Also he had stored up his energy by devoting his momentum and strength. He had used all his tricks, yet the other party had only hurriedly striked. The distance between the two were too great.And the results of the sparring. The other party had retreated three steps, and was fine. But his body\u2019s blood was in turmoil and had suffered minor injuries.This girl was horrifying.Just as Yi Yun was amazed, Lin Xintong was even more surprised. She looked at Yi Yun with a startled and uncertain look and finally said, \u201cThis match was lost by me.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53 - Gift of a bookPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53: Gift of a bookYi Yun struggled to stand up. He adjusted his torn clothes and wrily smiled, \u201cSister Fairy, please don\u2019t ridicule me any further. It\u2019s clear I lost. The attack I used was all my strength, yet you returned a blow at the key moment, sending me flying. It\u2019s clear who lost.\u201d Yi Yun was convinced, but the girl shook her head saying, \u201cMy level is much higher than yours, so it\u2019s totally unfair to battle against you, even if I suppress it. I had originally agreed to use \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 to spar with you, but I was forced by you to use my \u2018Fairy Maiden Heart Sutra\u2019 at the last moment.Lin Xintong was an honest person. Having agreed on using \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, she had violated the rules by using another attack, so she had naturally lost.She also did not explain to Yi Yun why she had lost her concentration during the battle.When she had crossed fists with Yi Yun for the first time, she had felt a strange energy stay within her body and the energy had even seeped into her broken Yin Meridians. However, she did not feel it when they crossed again for the second time.Lin Xintong was also unsure if it was just an illusion.If not for losing concentration after the first crossing, she would not have been forced by Yi Yun to use her \u201cFairy Maiden Heart Sutra\u201dUpon hearing Lin Xintong\u2019s words, Yi Yun was surprised. This girl sure was special. Any expert like her would be a proud daughter of heaven, and would never admit to losing to a kid from the vast wilderness. It was after all something hard for such proud people to accept.But this girl had admitted she had lost, even though in his eyes she had not lost.He turned his head and looked at the fat elder. Yet he saw the fat elder pulling at his beard with a horrible expression.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d The fat elder saw Yi Yun looking over and was pissed. He was shocked for how could a plebeian from the Cloud Wilderness be so powerful?To have such power in the Meridians realm, he would not even be considered weak among the elites of a large family clan.He had clearly learned \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d secretly, but yet he could display Tendons like Bowstrings, Thunderous Bones. It was practically the same as having mastered the essence of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, not \u201ca thing or two\u201d.What the hell is this? The fat elder had originally said that Yi Yun will be defeated within the time it takes to take three breaths. But till the end, not only had the time passed, even Lin Xintong had admitted defeat!No way we\u2019re losing, we clearly won, alright!The fat elder was extremely upset. Was his estimations wrong? This kid had only an average body constitution, and used some treasure to reach the state of Tempered Body, how could he practice a cultivation technique to such a level?Maybe he had excellent perception?In practicing cultivation techniques, besides a person\u2019s constitution, one had to have perceptivity.The importance of perceptivity was just second to constitution. A person with poor perception would learn everything slowly, so even if they had a good constitution, they were destined never to reach a higher realm since there were plenty of things in the martial world that could only be understood, not taught, especially for bottlenecks which could only be overcome by oneself.In terms of perceptivity, Yi Yun was indeed not bad. On Earth, Yi Yun was good at his studies and had developed intelligence at an early age. Hence, the poor kids of the vast wilderness could not be compared to him.Together with having tunneled into this strange world and Yi Yun having led two lives made his soul even stronger.And with the Purple Crystal in his heart, that coolness was providing energy to his soul, and nourishing Yi Yun\u2019s spirit continuously.When he cultivated \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, he had added some of his own understanding unique to him, creating a situation of necessary success with the ripe conditions.Seeing the old man\u2019s face wrinkled like a peach seed, Yi Yun could not help himself from laughing, but he did not dare to express it on his face, or the old man might explode.\u201cThis is for you!\u201dLin Xintong grabbed something from her interspatial wristband and threw a green light towards Yi Yun.Yi Yun caught it and realized it was a book.The green book\u2019s cover was made of golden silk. Its paper quality was great, and it was well made, making it great to the touch.On the book cover wrote five words: \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d!The five words were written with flair, making it look imposing.This was the manual to \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d!Yi Yun was happy. He had been secretly learning \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, but as the fat elder said, there had to be holes in the process of secretly learning techniques. Besides, the members of the warrior preparation camp had poor perceptivity, so Yao Yuan had not taught everything about \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, and had only taught the first nine moves. For the remaining moves, Yi Yun did not know a thing.So Lin Xintong giving him this manual was of timely help!Yi Yun could not stop touching the green covered book. He found that the book possessed a faint fragrance, making it very seductive.\u201cEh?\u201dYi Yun curiously flipped the manual and realized that the manual consisted of pictures of people in various poses. Beside it was the mantras with notes by the side.The notes were written with another color, and the font was small. The handwriting was very beautiful and had a mysterious smell associated with it. It was most likely the girl\u2019s handwriting.These notes were clearly added on later and belonged to the owner of the manual.Yi Yun was shocked, this had to be Lin Xintong\u2019s handwriting.With Lin Xintong\u2019s level of training and her understanding of martial arts, her notes for \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d would be extraordinary. If he could read it from cover to cover, it would give him great inspiration.This was the insight Lin Xintong had obtained. And according to her, she had been reading this manual seriously for about half a year.She had to be carrying this manual close to her all the time.Yi Yun suddenly realized the value of the book. Although \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d had been made public by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, the book was not valuable, but with Lin Xintong\u2019s notes, it was no longer the same.\u201cSister Fairy, this book is too valuable. I can\u2019t have it. These notes are insights from your own understanding\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I already remember all my notes. I have read this \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 from cover to cover. It would be useless to me. With it, you might be able to get some inspiration.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yi Yun accepted the book upon seeing Lin Xintong\u2019s insistence. He had really wanted it. It wouldn\u2019t only be some inspiration, but a life saver. With this book, he could master the entire set of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d.As Yi Yun felt guilty accepting the book, the fat elder made an ill-timed sound. \u201cBah, if you want it, just say so, stop acting.\u201dYi Yun choked upon hearing that. This old man was really sarcastic with his words. This had to be a form of revenge. The fat elder and his disciple Lin Xintong had characters that were opposite extremes. It was unknown how they managed to get along so well.\u201cAlright, stop looking at me. You have proven your strength. I would accept that you know \u2018a thing or two\u2019 about Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d said the old man as he stroked his beard. It was an affirmation of Yi Yun\u2019s strength.\u201cPreviously, I said that if you could last the time needed for three breaths, I would give you a miracle medicine. I\u2019m a person who doesn\u2019t go back on his promises\u2026\u201d saying that the old man touched his ring and took out something. It was neither a desolate bone or desolate bone relic, but a black charred head!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was unknown how such beautiful scales were blackened.Its head had three horns, sharp as a sword. It had sharp canine teeth and two long and thin feelers. It didn\u2019t look hideous, but even seemed to possess some dignity.Although it was already dead, its two green eyes still seemed to possess a cold killing intent, giving a chilling feeling.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dYi Yun did not know why for besides the killing intent he felt coming from the eyes of a dead fierce beast, he also felt a faint sense of unreconciliation.\u201cIts called a Chi Lin beast!\u201d came a faint voice. It was not the fat elder but Lin Xintong.To Yi Yun, Lin Xintong\u2019s voice was soft and gentle like a pearlbush flower.Yi Yun was slightly stunned as he took a look at Lin Xintong. Ever since he had met them, Lin Xintong had been extremely quiet except when they sparred. She had never cut into his conversation with the old man.Lin Xintong said, \u201cChi Lin beast is a desolate beast. Although its desolate bone quality is not low, a Chi Lin beast\u2019s strength is quite weak among other desolate beasts. Chi Lin beasts are special. A small portion of them would suddenly die at the prime of their life.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Yi Yun dazed a moment. Suicide?Lin Xintong carried on, \u201cRumor says that Chi Lin beasts have the blood of the Fire Qi Lin. If they light up their body\u2019s meridians, they can transform into a real Fire Qi Lin amidst the fire.\u201d\u201cBut the current Chi Lin beasts have descended by an unknown number of generations. Even if they really were the bloodline of the ancient Fire Qi Lin, they would be extremely rare. So most normal Chi Lin beasts would just lead a normal life for a few hundred years before they die of age.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026some Chi Lin beasts do not share similar thoughts. From the moment they were born, they would search and swallow all sorts of fire elemental items. They would even swallow fire and gather a large amount of fire energy within their body till their bodies cannot take it. They would then explode into Chi Lin flames!\u201d\u201cThese Chi Lin beasts would then undergo the baptism of fire. In that fire, they will search for their ancestor\u2019s Fire Qi Lin bloodline.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026they only have one outcome, and that is to burn to their deaths, without any exception\u2026\u201d\u201cSometimes I guess that they probably know it clearly that it is impossible to awaken their ancestor\u2019s bloodline within themselves. But they would still not hesitate to do so, because although they could live their lives peacefully for hundreds of years, they would rather ignite a Chi Lin flame within themselves at their prime and die in the fire.\u201dLin Xintong\u2019s voice grew faint. The Chi Lin beast was a desolate beast she knew for a very long time.She felt like a Chi Lin beast. Having been born with Yin Meridians, she was unable to break her curse. To be able to connect her broken meridians, she had to be like the Chi Lin beasts who aimed to awaken their ancient Fire Qi Lin bloodline.It was as hard as ascending to heaven, and was equivalent to bringing destruction on herself.Was she to choose the life of a normal Chi Lin beast, and live an ordinary life for hundreds of years before dying, or to choose to be the brave ones among the Chi Lin beasts, to attempt at breaking the confines of their destiny, without worrying about sacrificing their lives?Actually Lin Xintong had already made up her mind in her heart\u2026Hearing Lin Xintong\u2019s words, Yi Yun was silent.Born to search for flames and choosing the fire elemental items that were the hottest. Using them as food till they burned their bodies, and eventually dying within the flames.Even if they knew they had no chance of transforming into a Fire Qi Lin, they were willing to chase this shiny dream at the expense of their life.Because they were not willing to live amongst the weak. It could be summarized with a phrase that is: \u201cUnwilling to stay ordinary! \u201cYes, unwilling to stay ordinary. Yi Yun too was unwilling to stay ordinary. But he did not know that the gentle and weak Lin Xintong in front of him shared similar thoughts.\u201cSir, are you using the Chi Lin beast to encourage the younger generation, or are you advising the younger generation to not be overconfident to the point of burning one\u2019s own fingers?\u201d asked Yi Yun suddenly.The fat elder grunted in reply, \u201cYou think too much. What\u2019s the point of encouraging you with your constitution? I can at most tell you not to be overconfident. In this world, there are plenty who practice martial arts. Many have brought destruction on themselves. In order to obtain more resources they have gone out into the wilderness by themselves without knowing themselves and ended up in the stomachs of wild beasts!\u201dAlthough the fat elder had a vile tongue, his words had sincere advice within. Yi Yun humbly said, \u201cI\u2019ve been educated.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Seeing Yi Yun\u2019s attitude, the fat elder was very satisfied. \u201cThe book Xintong left you is too good for you. Read it well. Although I think you have a poor constitution, your perceptivity still meets the mark. As for your \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, it\u2019s so-so. Read Xintong\u2019s book, and your strength should improve.\u201dBetween the lines, the fat elder\u2019s words were purposely disparaging towards Yi Yun, but Yi Yun could tell that they were words of encouragement, so he humbly accepted the advice.\u201cAi, such a pity.\u201d The fat elder shook his head and changed the subject. \u201cOh, kid you may not know, but if you were to sell this book in an ancient clan, and say that it has notes made by Xintong, I have no idea how many young masters will be willing to make a high bid for it. To these young masters, Xintong is\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dLin Xintong grumpily interrupted the fat elder. For a particular reason, she was indeed the pursuit of many sons of the big families in an ancient clan. If not for her master taking her in as a disciple, she would have already been betrothed.After all, although Lin Xintong had excellent talent, due to her Yin Meridians, her power was limited, so her life span was just a few hundred years only.A big family clan was very utilitarian. Everything was done for the family\u2019s interest. Clearly betrothing her would obtain the support of another family, which further pushed the interests of the family clan.\u201cForget it, forget it.\u201d waved the fat elder\u2019s hand. He changed topics and said, \u201cHey kid. This Chi Lin beast\u2019s head is yours. Chi Lin beasts are a bit special. After it dies, the Yuan Qi within its body will slowly emanate. It could do this for ten years. So if you were to hide this head properly, you can still absorb its Yuan Qi without refining it. It will depend on yourself how much you will be able to absorb.\u201dFrom the fat elder\u2019s point of view, Yi Yun was not capable of refining the desolate bones. Also with Yi Yun\u2019s foundation, it was unlikely he would be able to digest the Chi Lin beast\u2019s head. Letting the energy emanate out and slowly absorbing it was the best method.Of course this method was too slow. How could the sons from huge family clans wait ten years?\u201cKid, although I\u2019ve already told you. I can guess that you will still want to go out into the vast wilderness to gain experience. No matter. I\u2019ll write you a protective charm. When you reach the peak of Qi Gatherer, this protective charm will be activated. It can protect your life once. If one day we were fated to meet again, and you had not used the protective charm, you can use it as a gift to me.\u201d\u201cEh? Why are you looking at me in that manner?\u201d The fat elder asked as he noticed Yi Yun\u2019s eyes filled with suspicion.Yi Yun did not expect that the old man was offering to give him some benefit. The sun must have risen from the west.But if he offered to give something, was it trustworthy?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Su JiePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: Su JieJust as Yi Yun was pondering over it, he saw the fat elder take out a tattered piece of yellow paper. This yellow paper resembled the paper used in the 80s in China, ones which villagers used as toilet paper. But this charm was more tattered than those toilet paper.The charm\u2019s paper quality was world\u2019s apart from the paper of the \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d manual Lin Xintong had given him,Under the questioning gaze of Yi Yun, the fat elder stuck his fat finger into his mouth and licked it. He used his finger as a pen and began drawing on the charm paper with his saliva.\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201dThe fat elder gave the charm paper to Yi Yun saying, \u201cKeep it well. My charm is worth a fortune. You lucked out. Why are you giving me that expression? You don\u2019t have to shed tears of gratitude.\u201dYi Yun accepted the charm speechlessly. The saliva on it was a mess, and from the looks of it, the saliva was drying up soon.Yi Yun gave a constipated look. Although he didn\u2019t doubt the old man\u2019s strength, he was afraid that the old man was pulling a prank on him. After all, this charm\u2019s purpose was to protect his life!If at the moment he was about to lose his life, such as being cornered by a desolate beast, he would pull out that piece of charm, but if it didn\u2019t do a single thing\u2026That scene was too perfect. Yi Yun could not bear to think about it any further. It could be expected that the desolate beasts with intelligence would have thought that Yi Yun was being considerate by leaving a piece of toilet paper. When they wanted to take a sh*t after digesting Yi Yun, they could use this piece of paper to wipe their ass!\u201cAlright, whatever that should be given has been given. Quick make the dishes for me!\u201d The fat elder took out a large number of pots and pans from his ring, and laid it before him in a pile noisily.This made Yi Yun sigh with emotion. A person of high stature could do anything, and even had such a inventory space. Even when out traveling, he would bring with him seven to eight pots.He was not in a hurry to make his salt baked chicken so he cupped his fists and asked, \u201cMay I know the name of this honorable elder?\u201dHaving gotten to know him, and received plenty of kindness from him, Yi Yun still did not know the old man\u2019s name.\u201cHeh, My name\u2026\u201d the old man paused and seemed to reminisce, \u201cit\u2019s been a while since someone called me. Since you want to know, I\u2019ll give you a stamp.\u201dAs the old man said it, he suddenly took out a seal-like object from his ring and stamped that piece of toilet paper.In a while, faint light was emitted, leaving a red stamp on the piece of paper.In the stamp wrote two words: Su Jie.\u201cSu Jie?\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s mind whirled. This name sure is special. \u201cJie\u201d indicates calamity, or disaster. For parents to name a child, they would usually choose a lucky name, and would seldom choose \u201cJie\u201d for a name.\u201cFor today\u2019s kindness, this junior will remember it.\u201d Yi Yun said it sincerely for he knew although old man Su had a vile mouth and was greedy and stingy, he had still helped him. And he had definitely not helped him solely for a few rounds of \u2018salt-baked chicken\u2019.Yi Yun parted with old man Su. Before parting, Yi Yun wrote the recipe for the salt-baked chicken and wrote a few methods of cooking that used alcohol for old man Su. There were good cooks in the world who could follow the recipe and create a delicious dish for old man Su to enjoy. This was the only way Yi Yun could requite the favor.And before old man Su left, he gave some ingredients to Yi Yun. After all, the life in the wilderness was too tough.And it was so. As the sun slowly set, old man Su and Lin Xintong carried on their training journey. When they turned their heads, Yi Yun had already disappeared into the mountains. All that was left were the clouds that seemed to burn in the sky.\u201cMaster, do you think highly of him?\u201d Lin Xintong asked. After Yi Yun had finished his salt baked chicken, she had sparred with Yi Yun for a short while. But the strange feeling that happened to her dried up meridians did not occur again, disappointing her.It was likely just an illusion.Old man Su shaked his head, \u201cI don\u2019t think highly of him, I just appreciate him.\u201d\u201cHis perceptivity shocked me and he had good luck, but\u2026I can\u2019t think of anyway to fix his weakness of having a poor constitution. If he wants to cultivate to a higher realm, he would need massive amounts of resources. It will be too hard!\u201dIn this world, there were many who aspired to be a warrior. There were as many as the sand grains of the five Ganges Rivers, but how many of those succeeded?\u201cPerhaps, this world will have a miracle\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong mumbled to herself. It seemed like she was referring to Yi Yun, but also seemed to be referring to herself.Old man Su was stunned when he heard that but stayed silent.Yes, a miracle\u2026He was a Desolate Heaven Master and was extremely demanding about taking in disciples. He wanted them to have excellent constitutions and with exceeding talent in the arts of desolate bones. It was too hard. He had searched for hundreds of years, and had seen uncountable numbers of offspring from the big family clans before accepting Lin Xintong as his disciple.But although he was extremely satisfied with his disciple, she was cursed with Yin Meridians, wasting the potential excellent constitution she had for practicing martial arts.It was such a ridicule.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026We may never meet him again. We won\u2019t stay long in the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. When we leave the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, this kid might not even have stepped out of the Cloud Wilderness. Even if he does step out of the Cloud Wilderness, it would be hard for him to step out of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom in his entire life. The Tai Ah Divine Kingdom is too big.\u201dOld man Su felt a sense of regret. The kid had high aspirations, but he was born in the wrong place and lacked the needed constitution for practicing martial arts. It was depressing.\u201cNever meet again?\u201d Lin Xintong went into a trance as she remembered the weird feeling she had when she crossed with Yi Yun for the first time. Her dried up meridians did seem like they had been activated.However, the events that followed proved that there was a 99% chance that it was just an illusion, but Lin Xintong was not willing to give up even a tiny bit of hope. Maybe her master would be able to give some explanation?\u201cMaster, I have something I need to tell you\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong suddenly blurted out.\u201cOh? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Old man Su said with a solemn expression as he slowed down his footsteps.Lin Xintong described her feelings in great detail. Hearing her words, old man Su was surprised, the dried up meridians were activated? What could be the reason?He couldn\u2019t help stroking his beard as he went into deep thought.Old man Su had spent the past few years researching Yin Meridians in a bid to cure it, but he had failed time and time again. But because of his research, few could match old man Su\u2019s understanding of Yin Meridians.Yin Meridians were terminated Meridians, and unable to hold any energy, just as a dry well cannot produce water. But from what Lin Xintong had just said, she had a mild energy flow within her meridians when sparring with Yi Yun!Even if it was an illusion of Lin Xintong, old man Su took it seriously.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Tao tribal clan first. I have already made an appointment with the Jin Long Wei\u2019s division leader and had asked him to gather intelligence about the Purple Clouds\u2019 Birth. After I receive the information, we can discuss this in detail!\u201dOld man Su\u2019s main reason for his coming to the Cloud Wilderness was for the Purple Clouds\u2019 Birth. He wanted to know if there was any treasure that had sprouted in the Cloud Wilderness, and if he could use it to defy fate by joining up Lin Xintong\u2019s terminated meridians!As for Yi Yun, it could have been an illusion that Lin Xintong had experienced.

In the Lian tribal clan, about seven children and a few women stood around Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house. These kids were about eight years old. The eldest was about the same age as Yi Yun. Every one of them wore rags and their bodies were dirty. In their hands were cow dung, as they threw it one after another at Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s door.\u201cSplat! Splat! Splat!\u201dThe dirty cow dung exploded upon contact with Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s door, giving rise to a strong stench.Behind the child was an old women dressed in long black robes, looking like a witch. She began dancing as if she was in an epileptic shock and chanted weird phrases.\u201cAll gods are my brothers, all bodhisattvas are my sisters, all the diseases and disasters, stay away from me! Demons and ghosts, hasten and leave! Bewitching evil spirits, show yourself! Ah Ah Ah\u2026Wu Wu Wu\u2026Ah Ah Ah\u2026\u201dUsing the mouth which had few teeth left, she kept wailing like a ghost, as if she was experiencing an orgasm.As the old woman\u2019s voice reached its climax, the children around became more excited and threw the cow dung.The cow dung was obtained from the Lian tribal clan\u2019s cattle. There was always a large pile in the farms, so they could obtain a large amount.The villagers wanted the cow dung to exorcise evils.The news of Yi Yun bleeding from his seven orifices had spread throughout the Lian tribal clan.Deaths in Lian tribal clan were nothing new, but to die so horribly was something that grabbed the attention of the people.And at noon, the Lian tribal clan had suddenly released information saying that Yi Yun had died from a mysterious disease! It was a kind of plague!Suddenly the entire Lian tribal clan exploded in activity!Numerous people began spreading the news and in two hours, the news had been spread throughout the tribe!Plague!It was an extremely fearsome word in the vast wilderness. Plagues were terrifying, as it killed more than famines.Typically, a plague could easily wipe out an entire tribe.In ancient China, there was the possibility of escaping a plague, but in the Cloud Wilderness, having a plague was equivalent to a death sentence. There was nowhere to run. Escaping to the vast wilderness would only result in being eaten by fierce beasts.The citizens of the vast wilderness were terrified of plagues to the bone!The medical facilities in the vast wilderness were backward, be it herbs or doctors, they were small in number. But in the face of a plague, they would not sit there doing nothing to await death.As such, the citizens of the vast wilderness \u201cinvented\u201d several methods to counter the plague, and one of the most common ones was the \u201cwitch exorcism\u201d.A witch would \u201cDance to the Gods\u201d in order to drive out the plague. As for its effectiveness, it was unknown.This may sound ridiculous, but in the vast wilderness filled with ignorance, this sort of phenomenon was common, and was regarded as the Truth. In Earth\u2019s ancient times, there were all sorts of witches around the world, and they were all strikingly similar.Besides, the citizens of the vast wilderness believed that cow dung or dog blood could be used to drive away evil. Dog blood was too rare because it would have long been drank by the tribal people to stave off their hunger.But cow dung was common, so they used cow dung to throw at Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house. They threw it at the walls and doors to seal the plague, preventing it from spreading.Because of this, these self-proclaimed \u201cbrave\u201d kids threw with great strength. They felt they were warriors of the Lian tribal clan, fighting a war with the plague and the evil!\u201cThat place isn\u2019t covered yet!\u201d A leader among the kids said as he pointed, and a large heap of cow dung flew over.\u201cSplat, splat, splat!\u2019The cow dung exploded. This wall was close to the window, and Jiang Xiaorou had only stuck a piece of paper across the window. In the Lian tribal clan, paper was expensive, but the windows could not be left uncovered, for it would be too cold in the winter. Without the paper blocking the window, the wind would not be kept out.Jiang Xiaorou had spent the whole day putting up this thick window paper, bit by bit, as she hoped to ensure that she and her brother could enjoy a warm winter.But now.\u201cPa!\u201dWith a snapping sound, a pile of cow dung had broken through the window paper, flying into Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house.As the pile of cow dung hit the floor, it made the entire place filthy.Jiang Xiaorou was sitting by the bedside looking grim.When the news of her brother broke, she was of course the first to hear it. But she did not believe it to be true, for her brother had been able to survive repeated catastrophes without dying.This time, they said that her brother was dead. And even two men claimed that Yi Yun had jumped off a cliff tens of meters high with his last breath. Such a drop could even kill cats!Brother\u2026jumped into the river\u2026to his death\u2026These words circled Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s mind like a curse. It was unknown how she managed, but she was totally dazed.She could not believe that her brother was dead. She knew that Yi Yun had undergone change in the past few days. He had greater abilities, became stronger, and after practicing martial arts, he had became even stronger.How could such a strong brother die?Jiang Xiaorou could not believe it, she had pinned all hopes on Yi Yun!But no matter how much Jiang Xiaorou believed in Yi Yun, Yi Yun\u2019s disappearance was a fact\u2026Especially with the rumors of Yi Yun contracting the plague, Jiang Xiaorou was afraid, afraid that Yi Yun had really been infected by the plague, and was worried that he would spread it to her, hence drowning himself.\u201cPa!\u201dAnother clump of cow dung was thrown in, hitting the dining table. The only two bowls in the house were immediately dirtied by the cow dung, unable to be used ever again.However, Jiang Xiaorou did not even take a glance.The siege on Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house with cow dung had lasted for an entire afternoon.Even with the sun setting, the operation had still not concluded.\u201cCover it tightly! This lass and that dead imp are jinxes. We should have never accepted them into our tribe!\u201d Outside of the broken window came a women\u2019s mean voice.This woman was tall and her face long. Her cheekbones were raised and her sleeves were rolled; she looked like a shrew.Even the poor citizens were categorized in classes. Those who had Lian as their surname in the Lian tribal clan were afforded better treatment. They would sometimes enjoy special privileges in the tribe, after all, they shared the same surname as the Lian tribal clan\u2019s leaders.The women who spoke had Lian as her surname. Her name was Lian Cuihua. She was known as Aunt Cuihua.In fact, her aggressive posture this time leading a group of people to throw dung at the walls was ordered by Lian Chengyu.Lian Chengyu wanted to stir up a storm, and he naturally found a person to \u201ccare for the children\u201d among the people, so that she could fan the flames.\u201cI think we might as well burn the house, to prevent any filthy things from coming out. Do you know, Da Tou\u2019s father saw the kid turn sick with his own eyes. He even said that not only did the kid get infected with the plague, he had been possessed!\u201d\u201cAt that time, Da Tou\u2019s dad touched the kid, and it felt like a snake had bit him. It\u2019s no simple matter! Think about it, this little bastard has such a cheap life, cheaper than a dog, how could he have been chosen by Lord Zhang? And to think he was said to be a martial arts prodigy, how is that possible? Lord Zhang may not know, and you may not know! He was a good-for-nothing, no different from a beggar. He was weaker than a wench. A martial arts prodigy, my foot!\u201d\u201cOnly was he possessed can we explain how a good-for-nothing could suddenly become so powerful. It was because he was possessed! When the ghost was within him, he was strong, but with the ghost gone, he died!\u201d Lian Cuihua said it with a queer voice, depicting the story of Yi Yun of days past as a living zombie.In the past day, Lian Cuihua would say the same spew whenever she met anyone. This was of course taught to her by Lian Chengyu.As Lian Chengyu could not do it himself, he allowed Lian Cuihua to spread the rumors. By using possession to explain Yi Yun\u2019s apparent talent, many of the people were willing to believe it.After all, the Yi Yun they knew could not have been a martial arts prodigy.Doing so could retain Lian Chengyu\u2019s absolute authority. He was the most talented person in the Lian tribal clan, and no one could match him!This would make the tribe believe that only through him Lian Chengyu, could they be led towards glory.\u201cWhat Aunt Cuihua says makes sense.\u201d\u201cSo he was possessed. I already said that weakling Yi Yun could not be more talented than my Er Dan.\u201dA few women echoed her as they shared the Lian surname, and was the foundation of the Lian tribal clan.However, in the room, Jiang Xiaorou turned a deaf ear to all of this.Yun-er, where did you go?Why aren\u2019t you back?Jiang Xiaorou was in a daze. Although she knew her hopes were slim, she still refused to believe that Yi Yun had died.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - Lian Chengyu\u2019s evil motivesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57: Lian Chengyu\u2019s evil motivesAt this time, the Lian tribal clan Patriarch compound.Zhao Tiezhu ran in, and excitedly reported the situation of Yi Yun\u2019s house to Lian Chengyu.\u201cYoung master Lian sure has the best plans. Yi Yun\u2019s house is now totally covered with dung, hahaha!\u201dZhao Tiezhu laughed and Lian Chengyu just replied with a silent, \u201cehm\u201d as he waved his hands saying, \u201cLeave, and occasionally pay attention to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house, and report to me anytime.\u201d\u201cYes, yes. This little one will be going,\u201d Zhao Tiezhu accepted his orders as he bowed while retreating out of the house.Zhao Tiezhu was in a good mood. He felt that Lian Chengyu was beginning to grow fond of him, for he was giving him tasks to do.After Zhao Tiezhu left, Lian Chengyu calmly poured a cup of tea for himself. He then filled another cup to the brim.At this time, from inside the backroom came out a yellow robed elder.He laughed as he picked up the tea cup Lian Chengyu had filled, and took a sip.This elder was the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch.\u201cChengyu, you have done well regarding this matter. I\u2019ve really grown old,\u201d shook the elder\u2019s head. For the past few months, every matter of the Lian tribal clan was dealt with by Lian Chengyu.Lian Chengyu had used the strong men to refine the desolate bones, worrying the yellow-robed elder, since there would be deaths caused by the refinement of the desolate bones. And with the starvation, it was a matter of time before the people began to riot.Even if Lian Chengyu used the Blood Thinning Pill to draw out the potential of those people\u2019s lives, and stabilize their condition, it was an unsustainable method as it overdrafted their life force. In a few days, those people would grow sick again and die.When the matter was exposed, the Lian tribal clan would come under unprecedented pressure!If not handled properly, it would cause a riot amongst the people. It would cause loss of lives, and could affect the refinement of the desolate bones. The consequences would be disastrous.But the yellow-robed elder could not believe that Lian Chengyu had pushed all the blame to the dead Yi Yun before the illness broke out.If so, even if the strong men who were refining the desolate bones died, no one would become suspicious, they would all believe that Yi Yun had initially contracted a strange illness and had been possessed.Yi Yun spread his strange illness to the other men who were refining the desolate bones. This illness would later become an epidemic plague.Also Yi Yun\u2019s possession would give an ominous omen to the tribe.At that point, the people would believe that Yi Yun had caused the deaths of everyone.As such, the people would only hate Yi Yun and not hate Lian Chengyu. And there would be new strong men willing to carry on refining the desolate bones, and everything would be perfect.This was the main reason for Lian Chengyu\u2019s direction of the matter. It could be said as killing two birds with one stone. Not only would he be able to affirm himself as the number one genius in the tribe with absolute authority, he could also ensure the smooth refining of the desolate bones.\u201cIt\u2019s just some small tricks. Grandpa has thought too highly,\u201d said Lian Chengyu casually. \u201cBased on the Frost Python\u2019s toxin, and the effects of the Blood Thinning Pill, in about three to five days, those who were refining the desolate bones would die. At that time, the people would be angry. They wouldn\u2019t just simply throw dung at Yi Yun\u2019s house, they would probably directly burn the house down.\u201dAs Lian Chengyu said it, he took a sip of tea and gently wiped his mouth with a handkerchief. His movement was extremely graceful. He was the only person in the Lian tribal clan who continuously maintained the style of an aristocrat.He was born in the Cloud Wilderness; although the young masters of the Cloud Wilderness had a higher standing, but which of them followed the aristocratic style? But Lian Chengyu was different, he had learned the manners of the aristocrats from Yao Yuan, and ensured that he followed those protocols all the time.Because he thought that he was fated to one day be one of the upper class, and even be among the upper echelon of the Kingdom, and attending the banquets of the Kingdom.He did not want to be ridiculed by the upper class people as a Cloud Wilderness brat.He wanted people to know that although he was born from the Cloud Wilderness, he could also do everything equally well!\u201cIt\u2019s such a pity I didn\u2019t get to see Yi Yun\u2019s corpse with my own eyes\u2026\u201d Lian Chengyu said with thoughts in his head.\u201cHaha, Chengyu, you worry too much. Do you think the kid can still survive under such conditions? Besides the lack of a cure for the Frost Python toxin, simply falling several tens of meters down a cliff would have broken a person\u2019s body. Furthermore, the East River\u2019s flow is extremely fast. There is even a waterfall downstream, so even the best swimmers would either die from the fall or from drowning.\u201dThe Patriarch was not worried one bit.Lian Chengyu nodded his head, \u201cYes\u2026Grandpa is right. Yi Yun just began practicing martial arts, and hasn\u2019t even reached the Valiant realm. There\u2019s no chance he can avoid that.\u201dLian Chengyu placed his teacup down. Yi Yun may be dead, but his sister was still around. After this disaster, and having her house plastered with cow dung, and burnt down, she would have nowhere to go. She was even hated by everyone in the Lian tribal clan, except himself, who would be willing to have her under their wings?When he thought of that, a smile formed on Lian Chengyu\u2019s lips.This girl would fall into his hands sooner or later. Letting her suffer a little would temper her attitude, making her more docile. Whatever he said would be what it was.\u201cYi Yun-ah, Yi Yun. You made me lose face in front of Lord Zhang, killing you and then enjoying your sister can only be considered fair.\u201d\u201cWith you dead, I\u2019m actually saving your sister. In the future, she will obediently listen to me. You can rest easy in the netherworld. And when I make my meteoric rise, I will let her be one of my concubines, and will not abandon her.\u201d\u2026It was finally dark, but the few \u201cbrave\u201d children were still extremely dedicated. They did not leave even in complete darkness till the entire pile of cow dung was thrown. Not only Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s door and walls had been smeared, even the foundations were buried in a small pile of dung.\u201cWell done!\u201d Lian Cuihua clapped her hands. She had originally wanted to touch the boys\u2019 heads as an encouragement, but she realized they were dirty and retracted her hand. \u201cCome to Aunt Cuihua tomorrow, Aunt Cuihua will give you sweets to eat.\u201dThese sweets were of course from Lian Chengyu. In the Lian tribal clan, sweets were a rare thing.When the kids heard that there would be sweets, their eyes lit up.\u201cAlright, alright, we will carry on throwing cow dung tomorrow, will there be sweets then too?\u201d\u201cYes, of course there will be,\u201d laughed Lian Cuihua. \u201cNot only will there be sweets, by throwing the cow dung, you have driven the evil away, saving everyone!\u201d\u201cYes, we saved everyone!\u201d said a bigger child proudly.\u201cWe are heroes!\u201d another child echoed. Children at this age all had dreams of being heroes. They wanted to be a warrior that flew through the skies for that would be very impressive.At this time, there were a pair of dark eyes in the grass watching all this.These were Yi Yun\u2019s eyes!He had figured the details of what happened from the conversations of the children and villagers. Thus, Yi Yun had also guessed this was planned by Lian Chengyu.He clenched his fists and a sense of killing intent flashed in his eyes!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Such a move was too vile. And with the intelligence of the villagers, there was no way for them to see through it!How would they know about the pill that could overdraft their vitality? How would they know that desolate bones had toxins that could kill when refined?There were many among them that had not even heard of desolate bones just two months ago.The poor had led lives that suffered from starvation and the cold. Besides food, they had no way of accommodating anything else in their brains. Even if you explained it to them word for word, they might not be able to understand.\u201cDamn it!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s eyes turned cold. If he showed himself, it would be the same as declaring war on Lian Chengyu!Yi Yun knew his hand, his cultivation was still at the Meridians realm, but it had reached a Tempered Body, Dragon Pulse state.As for Lian Chengyu, he was at the doorstep of the Purple Blood realm, and was at the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm. If not for Yi Yun, Lian Chengyu breaking through into the Purple Blood realm would have definitely been a done deal.Yi Yun did not have confidence fighting with a Tempered Body in the Meridians realm versus Lian Chengyu who was bordering on the Purple Blood realm.In the Lian tribal clan, besides Lian Chengyu, there was also the Patriarch and the instructor Yao Yuan!The three of them were at the fifth level of Mortal Blood, Qi Gatherer. He would be fighting against three!Yi Yun was not worried about the Patriarch, but as for Yao Yuan\u2026Yi Yun did not know Yao Yuan\u2019s true strength. He had previously reached the Purple Blood realm, but he had dropped from that realm.Not only Yao Yuan\u2019s level was greater, but Yao Yuan would have much richer battle experience than Yi Yun.As for Yi Yun, besides the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, he had never learned any other offensive martial skill, and did not know any movement skills.In terms of fighting skills, Yi Yun was lacking. He was in the beginning stages in terms of martial arts.So Yi Yun calmed down and began making plans.\u201cLian Chengyu, I will make sure you die in agony!\u201d Yi Yun clenched his fists tightly. He was originally from Earth and had tunneled into this strange world where power ruled supreme. Yi Yun had previously not wished to murder anyone directly, but after today, he was determined to kill Lian Chengyu!Lian Chengyu had harmed Yi Yun twice secretly, but Yi Yun had never been so mad to such a degree. Lian Chengyu should have never ever done this to Jiang Xiaorou.His sister was alone and helpless; as a fifteen year old girl, she had to face the entire tribe\u2019s accusations!And when those strong men die from their illness, Lian Chengyu need not do anything to push the blame onto Yi Yun. At that time, what would the families of the victims do to Jiang Xiaorou? It was the unthinkable!If at this time, Lian Chengyu appeared and wanted to do anything to Jiang Xiaorou, she would have no way of resisting!Yi Yun picked up a pebble and threw it at Lian Cuihua\u2019s face from the grass.\u201cPa!\u201dThis pebble smacked Lian Cuihua right in the face.\u201cOuch!\u201d Lian Cuihua screamed as she crouched down. She covered her face in pain. Her face had turned blue-black.\u201cWho the f**k dare hit me?\u201d Lian Cuihua angrily said. The children around her immediately shook their heads, saying it had nothing to do with them.Yi Yun did not give any killing blows. Although he had the urge to kill the mean women, he knew that if he did anything to Lian Cuihua, this would arouse the suspicion of Lian Chengyu.He would remember Lian Cuihua\u2019s debt. In a month, in at most a month, he will collect the debt with interest. The insidious woman will pay the price.\u201cAh!\u201d At this time the boy beside Lian Cuihua jumped up clutching his buttocks, \u201cWho hit me?\u201dThis child was the ringleader of the children.\u201cIt\u2019s not me!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also not me!\u201d Many people hurriedly clarified, distancing themselves from the matter.But at this time, the screams began to sound out one after another. Yi Yun\u2019s hands were tremendously fast. The pebbles he shot out were well guided and properly controlled. The moment the pebble hit the child, it would bounce off and disappear into the night. This prevented the children from knowing what they were hit by, nor did they know where the pebbles came from.\u201cWhat is it!?\u201d The children knew something was wrong.It was already late in the night, and they were doing the heroic job of \u201cridding evil\u201d. They began to break into cold sweat after being hit by mysterious objects.\u201cThere\u2026There are ghosts!\u201dAn unknown child shouted, and with that the rest of the children were scared white, and they scattered in a blink of an eye!Lian Cuihua was even more afraid as she tumbled as she ran away.The village was especially afraid of the supernatural such as demons and ghosts.After the children scattered, Yi Yun surveyed the surroundings to ensure there was no one before heading to his house like a ghost, jumping over the wall.The courtyard was filled with cow dung, but Yi Yun had already reached the Meridians realm, and was had achieved a Tempered Body, so he was the same as a Kung Fu master. With one breath, he had crossed the entire sea of dung.Yi Yun crossed the yard without sullying his shoes.He pushed the void, and a gust of wind blew forward pushing the door open, and Yi Yun stepped into the house.Right in front of the house was the stove. There was no light, so it was pitch black.But in the bedroom, the window had been smashed through by cow dung, letting in some moonlight. Yi Yun could clearly see Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s thin figure under the moonlight.Her face, her shoulders gave people the urge to give her infinite love.\u201cWho!?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou had descended into grief and anxiety after Yi Yun disappeared. But she was still extremely alert. The moment she heard noises, she would grab the arrow by her side!Jiang Xiaorou was a unyielding girl, she constantly strived to become stronger, but her living circumstances made her have given her the thoughts that \u201cwithout a man in the house, life would be sad\u201d.With her brother around, her life revolved around him. Without her brother, she had lost her spiritual column of support. And a girl living alone in the vast wilderness would be bound to be the subject of bullying.Also Yi Yun had previously warned Jiang Xiaorou that Lian Chengyu coveted her, so Jiang Xiaorou had never separated from the arrow for the past day.\u201cSis, it\u2019s me\u2026Yun-er\u2026\u201d Yi Yun said with a trembling voice as he looked at the house filled with dung. Seeing Jiang Xiaorou in the middle of the mess, he could only feel a lump come up his throat, urging him to cry.Jiang Xiaorou was stunned. In the darkness, she used the moonlight to see Yi Yun\u2019s face. Although it was blurry, how could she not recognize that familiar outline?\u201cYun-er! !\u201d Jiang Xiaorou ran forward with tears in her eyes and embraced Yi Yun tightly!\u201cYun-er, you\u2019re fine. As long as you alright, as long as you are alright!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s voice was urgent. She used all the strength in her two arms to hug Yi Yun, afraid that the moment she released him, Yi Yun would disappear.With Jiang Xiaorou hugging him tightly, Yi Yun could feel her shaking body and her rapid heartbeat. Yi Yun could feel a warmth at his neck. It was Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s tears.\u201cSis, I\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d\u201cI know\u2026I knew from the beginning,\u201d cried Jiang Xiaorou as she said. Although she said she knew, she could not rest assured.She was not bothered by the insult of having the walls plastered with cow dung, nor was she bothered by the curses of that mean woman. The only thing that mattered to her was if her brother will return.Now, it had finally happened after a long wait!\u201cLet\u2019s go. Sis, we need to leave this place. We can no longer stay in this village!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s sudden words were a bolt in the blue for Jiang Xiaorou who had been going through a roller coaster of emotions. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stay here, where can we go? Are you saying to go into the Cloud Wilderness?\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Leaving the tribal clan meant that there would be no source of food, so going into the Cloud Wilderness was the same as sending them to their deaths.\u201cWe can go to the back mountains. Bring all our food, we will build a treehouse in the back mountain and stay there for a month!\u201dYi Yun had already planned it out. He could not be seen, and there was no way he could stay in the Lian tribal clan anymore. The best solution was to hide in the back mountains.The back mountains were vast, and did not have any herbs. Few would go there normally.\u201cTo the back mountains? What will happen when our food runs out? Where can we go then?\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t finish it. Sis Xiaorou, take heart,\u201d as Yi Yun smiled. He had obtained a lot of meat from the old man. It was sufficient for several months. And in a month, the Kingdom\u2019s selection would happen, so Yi Yun was not worried one bit.At that time, he would settle the debts clearly! Lian Chengyu, Zhao Tiezhu, Lian Cuihua and all those that bullied him will meet their just deserves!Yi Yun helped Jiang Xiaorou gather their belongings. In fact, it was only a bag of food and the bed in the inner room that had not been sullied by the cow dung. All the bowls and plates had been caked in cow dung, and were no longer usable.\u201cOh? There\u2019s someone.\u201d Yi Yun hid himself and with the moonlight, he saw a few people gently pushing the yard door, and walked into the dung-filled courtyard.It was the Aunt Wang, Uncle Zhou and their daughter Zhou Xiaoke from next door.Aunt Wang had often lent Yi Yun food. Yi Yun had previously given them a large portion of bacon he had received to Aunt Wang.Aunt Wang\u2019s daughter Zhou Xiaoke was about the same age as Yi Yun, and had followed him all around when they were young. Back then she would often be covered in mud from her exploitations, but now she was much quieter and had the temperament of a young lady.\u201cLittle girl Jiang, Aunt is here to give you your meal. You haven\u2019t eaten a whole day\u2026\u201dThe courtyard was filled with cow dung, and troubled Aunt Wang. She did not know what illness Yi Yun had contracted. He was a perfectly good child that was chosen by Lord Zhang a few days ago. And the villagers had said he had finally amounted to something and his family had struck gold.But in a few short days, it was all gone with one word?Heaven sure was blind.Aunt Wang was dismayed that there was no light coming from the house.\u201cHave Sis Xiaorou and Brother Yi Yun gone?\u201dFrom outside came Zhou Xiaoke\u2019s sad and shaking voice.Yi Yun peered through the window and saw a young girl the same age as him standing by the door. She had a round face like an apple, and her face were in tears.Yi Yun sighed, even in this poor and emotionless Lian tribal clan, there were still people like this Aunt, and a young girl who still remembered him\u2026When he was chosen by Zhang Yuxian, the villagers had began to curry favor him, but it wasn\u2019t anything. When everyone thought that he had died from a plague, they condemned him. This was the truth that beared in their minds.Yi Yun gave a wink to Jiang Xiaorou.Jiang Xiaorou understood and said, \u201cAunt Wang, don\u2019t come in. I\u2019m already sleeping. There isn\u2019t any place for you to step on, and\u2026Jiang Xiaorou didn\u2019t say anymore. Aunt Wang sighed for she knew Jiang Xiaorou was worried about the plague infecting her. She could only clear a spot and left the items by the door.\u201cLittle girl Jiang, I\u2019ve made a bowl of soup noodles for you. I\u2019ll place it here. You can also use the bowl. I\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201dIn a poor village, it was easy to have evil people, but hard to have kind people as the notion of giving an inch and he\u2019ll take a mile prevailed. Yi Yun had given Aunt Wang some bacon, and Aunt Wang had brought some soup noodles. In this period, soup noodles were a rare item.Aunt Wang knew that Jiang Xiaorou had no chance of eating since noon. As her house was bombarded by cow dung, how could she make a meal?Aunt Wang placed the soup noodles down and said, \u201clet\u2019s go.\u201dAunt Wang pulled the tearing Zhou Xiaoke and together with Uncle Zhou, closed the yard door, and left the yard.Uncle Zhou was a dull man, and did not speak a word. He had some strength, allowing their family to get by.After Aunt Wang left, Yi Yun came to the yard and brought the bowl of hot soup noodles in. This soup noodles was different from those from Earth. It was handmade. Each short and thick noodle had the imprints of Aunt Wang\u2019s.\u201cIn the future, I\u2019ll repay them. Those who harmed me, I\u2019ll remember it. Those who were good to me, I\u2019ll remember it.\u201dYi Yun said that in his heart and brought Jiang Xiaorou away into the mountains.\u2026Deep in the night, Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou came to the back mountains. This was a spot Yi Yun had specifically chosen. It was well hidden and near a water source. There was also a large tree, suitable for building a treehouse.It was already deep in winter, and the chill in the mountains were worse. White frost bits crystallized on the rocks. Each breath blew out a white mist.Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s face was red from the cold. She shrank her body and kept rubbing her hands as a thin layer of goosebumps appeared on her skin.Even a strong man, not to mention a fifteen year old girl, wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in the deep mountains for one winter night. They were bound to catch a chill the second day after sleeping.They only had one bedding, which was not enough back home; now in the cold mountains, it was even worse.\u201cYun-er, it\u2019s too cold. We won\u2019t last more than a few days,\u201d Jiang Xiaorou was confused. They had left their house in a spur. Although the house was in shambles, it could still keep out the cold. How were they to survive in the mountains?The future seemed to be dark.How could they survive?Yi Yun laughed, \u201cSis Xiaorou, don\u2019t worry.\u201dYi Yun went to the back a huge boulder and took out a pile of firewood.When he separated from old man Su, the sky was still bright. He could not return to the village, so he had roughly prepared a temporary foothold. The firewood was also prepared at that time.\u201cYun-er, you\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiaorou was surprised. At this time, Yi Yun had sparked the fire starters, setting the wood on fire.In a moment, a flame began burning as hot air began to rise. The frost on the surrounding rocks began to melt and Jiang Xiaorou felt some warmth.In such desperate times, a tiny bit of warmth gave Jiang Xiaorou hope.\u201cSis, look at what this is,\u201d Yi Yun laughed as he took out a big bag from behind the boulder and unwrapped it. Jiang Xiaorou took a curious look and when she saw its contents, she was stunned.In the bag was food, there were meat, vegetables and even wild fruits!The meat accounted for a large proportion. They were all cut up with their fur removed. They were all fresh meat and when put together would weight more than two hundred pounds!\u201cYun-er where did you get that from?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou looked with disbelief at Yi Yun.Meat was rich in fat and was a high calorie food. In poor environments, meat was a life saver.\u201cSis Xiaorou, don\u2019t ask. I\u2019ll promise you that in the future, I\u2019ll ensure a comfortable life for you. Our tough days are over. Whoever bullied us, we will return it a hundred times!\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s voice carried a hint of killing intent. After training for two months, just like his strength, Yi Yun slowly became more and more ruthless and resolute.In this world, the strong preyed on the weak, there was no rule of the law. Using the values from Earth to interact with others was the same as courting death.Now, if not for the Purple Crystal\u2019s help, he would have long been forced to the wall.\u201cSis Xiaorou, look well! Today, I\u2019ll let Sis Xiaorou eat the most delicious foods!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the dark night, her eyes were sparkling.She felt that everything that happened that night was like a dream.\u201cSis Xiaorou, you just have to wait to eat.\u201d Yi Yun began to focus. He had prepared uncountable number of meals in his life, but he had never focused as much effort as this one meal!Yi Yun had received an entire set of cooking apparatus and condiments from old man Su. He had even obtained some of the vintage wine. It was sufficient for him to fully express his culinary skills.Water was added to the pot with the processed ingredients, together with the meat, seasoning, flavoring, soup stock ,oil\u2026.Yi Yun was meticulous in his every step.And he did many dishes simultaneously. As he a dish was being cooked, he was already preparing another.The cutting board was a cleaned tree stump. The knife also came from old man Su.After obtaining a Tempered Body, Yi Yun\u2019s strength increased. His knife work was superb. The ingredients were cut as thin as the wings of dragonflies and his speed was unrelenting.By the side, using the fire\u2019s illumination, Jiang Xiaorou was stunned by Yi Yun\u2019s knife work.When did her brother become so powerful?In order for Jiang Xiaorou to eat a good meal, Yi Yun had made a few dishes that needed complex steps. Even on Earth, these dishes needed Yi Yun\u2019s care and attention as it required many steps, and he was not a professional chef. A mistake or two would make the dish lose its perfection.But now, with Yi Yun reaching the Meridians realm, his brain\u2019s channels had been cleared and energy entered his brain making his thinking sharp. So he was able to do three dishes simultaneously without missing a beat in the steps needed for each dish.With one dish done, it was ladled out, and another dish was prepared. It was all done with clockwork.And Jiang Xiaorou had already completely froze. The aromas that attacked her nostrils opened up her appetite.Jiang Xiaorou seldom saw a few pieces of bacon, so when could she have the chance to see such top class cuisine?Yi Yun\u2019s dishes were all made of the best desolate meat. From old man Su\u2019s stature and gluttony, he would not keep anything less than desolate meat. And even among the desolate meat, only the finest were kept.Besides, the various condiments old man Su had left behind were all expensive items. So Yi Yun was able to fully express his skills, and finishing dish after dish.Jiang Xiaorou looked at the delicacies that lined the tree stump. It felt like she was in a dream.Was all this real?Just a while ago, she was worrying over food and their future, but now, she was faced with a table of delicacies. Was all these made by her brother? Could she really eat all the food?\u201cSis Xiaorou, quickly eat it. The wind is cold. The food will cool down soon.\u201dYi Yun took a bowl of steamed meat that was as clear as crystal and said, \u201cThis is called steamed pork belly, Sis Xiaorou try it.\u201dOn Earth, normal pork belly tasted great when made into steamed pork belly, but using desolate meat for steamed pork belly made it even better.Yi Yun picked a piece of steamed pork belly and served it to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s lips.It was always her feeding Yi Yun, but today, the roles were reversed. Jiang Xiaorou was not used to it and her face turned red as she opened her mouth to take a small bite. The moment the meat entered her mouth, it melted into an aromatic and delicious flavor. It was not greasy and with the faint flavor of rice, it was extremely memorable.Jiang Xiaorou could not believe that there was something that delicious in this world.People who have been starving for extended periods of time would find a bowl of soup noodles a delicacy, what\u2019s more, this dish could rival even the best dishes on Earth with the excellent desolate meat.Jiang Xiaorou felt as if her tongue could no longer move. It was too delicious. The taste was something she had never tried before, nor had she ever thought about it.When she was young, Jiang Xiaorou came from a wealthy family but she was still young then. She was only obsessed with snacks and did not learn to appreciate food. Having only interest in sweets and having never starved, she never knew that fish and meat was that delicious.\u201cHongshao Rou, salt-baked chicken, scalded vegetables, desolate bone vegetable soup!\u201d Yi Yun introduced his dishes one by one. Old man Su had left behind some vegetables, so he had fried it with some meat.China\u2019s traditional cuisine with the ingredients from the strange world made the taste even better. Even picky as he was with his food, the glutton Yi Yun felt it was perfect.Jiang Xiaorou ate it so fast that she almost swallowed her tongue. Eating such a meal was the same as a dream.And the dishes would give a strong warm feeling when it entered the stomach. This warmth spread throughout their bodies giving them extreme comfort!This was the desolate meat reforming their bodies.Desolate meat was something the poor in the vast wilderness could rarely eat. If they could eat it daily, their bodies would be strong and would not succumb to illnesses!Even the vegetables left behind by old man Su was something good for the body, and normal people would never have the chance to eat it.The siblings ate ravenously and in fifteen minutes, they had swept away the delicacies on the tree stump like a typhoon.It was hard to believe that Jiang Xiaorou was just a while ago desperate, hungry and cold and filled with despair, but in a short period of time, she was full from eating. And with the energy within the food, she felt warm.Only after experiencing hunger would one know that delicacies were such blissful objects.At this time, Yi Yun had already began constructing the tree house.With his Tempered Body, Yi Yun had great strength, so it was simple for him to build tree house.\u201cYun-er, what had happened the past few days?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou saw Yi Yun busying himself, and felt like she was still in a dreamy hallucination.The events of the past hour were too amazing.\u201cOh, I met an unscrupulous man by the surname of Su. He saw that my constitution was surprisingly good and gave me some pointers. He also gave me some good items. It\u2019s roughly that. Sis Xiaorou, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m different from the past. In the future, your life will only get better and better.\u201dThe tree house was completed, but it was cold and moist in the mountains, so sleeping in the tree house would be too cold.Although there was a fire nearby, and it was warm, it needed constant attention for it could not burn throughout the night, so they would still be cold.Seeing Jiang Xiaorou rubbing her ears occasionally, Yi Yun smiled and descended from the tree house. In a short while, he brought up the Chi Lin head.The Chi Lin had a rich amount of fire-elemental energy. Placing the head in the tree house was like having a small heating stove. In a short time, the tree house had warmed up.Yi Yun had brought in too many surprises this night, so Jiang Xiaorou decided against asking.Although she had to lie down on the tree house\u2019s wooden planks, she had never felt more secure than today.Having eaten a meal, quenched her thirst, having a warm home and with Yi Yun by her side. What other thing in this world was more blissful than this?\u201cYun-er, I\u2019m so afraid this is all a dream\u2026\u201dJiang Xiaorou felt that everything was unreal. She feared sleeping, afraid that if she closed her eyes and opened them, she will find herself in that cold empty house with nothing but dirty cow dung, and the bad news of Yi Yun having died from an illness\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s not a dream. Sis just sleep, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d Yi Yun sat on a log bed beside her and held Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s hand.After feeling the heat from Yi Yun\u2019s palm, Jiang Xiaorou obtained a peace of mind.This warm touch allowed the tiredness to overwhelm her. Although she was unwilling to sleep, slowly she lost consciousness and fell asleep. This day, she had first learned of Yi Yun\u2019s death, and then besieged by the villagers. She had been terribly frightened and her emotions were marked by big ups and downs, so she was totally exhausted.Jiang Xiaorou entered dreamland and a blissful smile appeared on the corners of her mouth\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even when Jiang Xiaorou was sleeping, Yi Yun did not rest . He used the Purple Crystal Origins in his body to absorb the energy from the Chi Lin beast\u2019s head.Chi Lin beast was a desolate beast, and when Yi Yun had just broken into the Meridians realm, he had absorbed the Frost Python\u2019s Power of Desolates, and due to a lack of experience, he had sucked up too much power causing him harm. He had nearly burst his meridians.This time, Yi Yun had learned. He carefully controlled the energy intake into his body, and from the speed, he knew that the Chi Lin beast head could last him a month.In one month, he would pass the warrior selection and obtain new resources.As the night got deeper, Yi Yun who had absorbed enough energy quietly left the tree house.He was like an agile monkey crossing through the woods, and had quickly reached a clearing.Under the clear sky and moon, was a youth in linen clothes. He sat under a tree and rested his back on the tree trunk. With the moonlight, he began flipping through the pages of that green ancient book with perfect focus.A yellowed leaf escaped from one of the old tree\u2019s branches and slowly fell upon one of the opened pages, but the youth brushed it away gently and returned to his dedicated reading.Although it was dim at night, but after reaching the Meridians realm, Yi Yun could clearly see in the night as if it were the day.\u201cSo Dragon Dancing the Nine Heavens is not only that one move. There are three others, making the entire set have four moves\u2026\u201dLooking at Lin Xintong\u2019s \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, the many questions Yi Yun previously had were gradually cleared.Back then when Yao Yuan was teaching the warrior preparation camp members, under the consideration that the members had poor learning abilities, he had simplified all the moves. Only the simplest of moves out of the entire set of moves were taught.Now with the entire set of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, he had filled in all the gaps.\u201cOh? Miss Lin wrote here that although \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 is ingenuous, it is after all a basic fist technique, and one should not be limited by the routines of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. If one were to be focused only on the routines of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, then in one\u2019s entire life, one would only reach the completed realm of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, but not improve any further.Lin Xintong\u2019s words startled Yi Yun. He immediately focused on what Lin Xintong had noted.Lin Xintong\u2019s handwriting was elegant and each tiny word was soft and beautiful, but the content was majestic. Yi Yun could only feel the shocks from it!In Lin Xintong\u2019s notes, the highest realm one could reach with \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was the peak of Purple Blood realm.This was the so-called \u201ccompleted\u201d realm, but was there anything left to practice any further?Sorry, there\u2019s none!At this point, unless one obtained an even higher grade cultivation technique could they reach an even higher realm, for example the \u201cTai Ah Sacred Technique\u201d. If one had the ability to obtain it, then one should definitely use it.But a problem will arise. The \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 previously learned was totally different from the \u201cTai Ah Sacred Technique\u201d. Between the two, there was not much that could be inherited.The \u201cTai Ah Sacred Technique\u201d was created by the founding emperor of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, while the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was unexpectedly obtained by one of the descendant emperors. They did not have the same heritage.If two different systems were used together, there would parts that could not be blended together into perfection.On Earth, this would be like a high school student choosing to do mathematics for the college entrance exams, and upon entering college, quit mathematics to study history.This doesn\u2019t mean that he would not be able to learn anything. A talented person could easily still become a famous historian. But no matter what, the mathematics learned prior was a waste for when researching historical articles, was there differentiation one could use?When changing techniques, there would be a problem, after learning the \u201cTai Ah Sacred Technique\u201d, then the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 would be useless. Its use was only to breakthrough Mortal Blood, and push him to the peak of Purple Blood!Just like a high school student learns mathematics only to obtain a college acceptance letter.This meant it was a waste of resources. A warrior\u2019s time was extremely precious. Practicing martial arts was a fight against the heavens. To break through to a higher realm, one needed to keep striving and not waste time!Lin Xintong was a person who went against the heavens; she wanted to accomplish an impossible miracle, so how could she afford such waste?Lin Xintong\u2019s method was to go beyond the routines and completely understand the routines and cater it for use only for herself!So forgetting routines is also known as \u201cassuming formlessness\u201d, an important step for walking your own martial path!Based on one\u2019s martial arts foundations, one could find a path to reach a high level of martial arts. The techniques learned along the way, no matter if it was basic, intermediate or advanced, would be completely understood and merged into one\u2019s own understanding of martial arts.As such, it will not be a waste.When Yi Yun saw such a note, he had a sobering feeling.Yes, routines have limits, but martial arts is without limit!In ancient China, Mengzi had said, \u201cIf you believe everything you read, you better not read.\u201d A real sage would read the basic \u201cThree Character Classic\u201d, \u201cHundred Family Surnames\u2019 or advanced four great books, and even the hundred schools of thought.All these countless classics would be integrated into their knowledge before they write out their beautiful articles!I want to be a sage, I want to be a martial art sage!Yi Yun vowed, and began studying even harder at the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 that Lin Xintong had annotated.Without saying, this was the advantage of birth. Lin Xintong was born in a large family clan, and had much interactions and perspectives, so it was extraordinary.Yi Yun had only practiced martial arts for two months, but even if his perceptivity was high, he would not even be able to reach Lin Xintong\u2019s dust trails.Experience was only gained by a non-stop accumulation of learning. Even a sage had to begin from babbling as a child.Yi Yun used two hours to finish reading \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 from cover to cover. He pondered over it and received a huge enlightenment!\u201cI too cannot rely on Miss Lin\u2019s understanding. Everyone has different understanding of things. Many things can only be understood but cannot be described. I need to have form my own opinion.\u201dIt was a must to understand the opinions of others, but he could not just rely on them.Yi Yun carefully kept the manual and jumped onto a large rock.His body was filled with the fire elemental energy of the Chi Lin beast. Ever since he broke into the Meridians realm, the biggest advantage was to be able to flexibly control his body\u2019s energy.The Chi Lin beast energy he had absorbed in the tree house had been sealed within his Dantian. Now, Yi Yun began to open up his Ren Du Er Mai, and he felt a surge of heat within his body.The heat flowed along Yi Yun\u2019s Ren Du Er Mai, and cycled again and again. Slowly, Yi Yun\u2019s body was burning hot, as if he had been drinking a large pot of wine in a hot spring!Using this strength, Yi Yun began displaying \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019!With the Chi Lin energy rushing to his head, Yi Yun could feel his spirit fully relax. His body began to move freely without thought, as if it moved on instinct.Such a dissociated state was the best state for learning martial arts.It had to be said that although Yi Yun\u2019s constitution was not good, his perceptivity and intelligence was far greater than children his age. Even the elites of the large tribes would pale in comparison to this Yi Yun who had led two lives.From the fourth Mortal Blood realm to the fifth Mortal Blood realm, besides eating treasures, another critical step was to gather the Yuan Qi into his body!And this was in fact the most difficult step!The warriors in the vast wilderness could fly, lift tens and hundreds of cauldrons, level off mountains.This energy, where did it come from?Would eating gruel, vegetables and tea provide that energy? It\u2019s obviously impossible!Using the knowledge from Earth, energy was conserved.To make a horse run, one had feed the horse grass. It was the same for warriors; for a warrior to move a mountain, you had to provide him with the energy to move the mountain!So when warriors train their body, be it some treasure, beast meat or desolate bones, it had to be continuously consumed, as the warriors\u2019 energy consumption was dependent on the food.But upon reaching the Qi Gatherer realm, warriors would not just rely on the consumed food to provide energy, they could also absorb the energy from the surroundings to complement their bodies.When warriors attain an even higher cultivation, they could topple the mountains and overturn the seas. At this time, the main source of energy was not from food by the energy from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.After two rounds of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, Yi Yun felt his body heating up. His body was drenched in sweat. To completely go through the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 properly was an extremely laborious one.The energy Yi Yun absorbed were depleted in two rounds. This energy would then settle within Yi Yun\u2019s body, nourishing his body\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62 - ScapegoatPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62: ScapegoatAt this time, the Lian tribal clan Patriarch compound.\u201cWhat!? This bitch Jiang Xiaorou had ran off?\u201dUpon hearing the news, the teacup in Lian Chengyu\u2019s crumbled!\u201cPa!\u201dThe hot tea splattered, giving Zhao Tiezhu a shock.He did not know why Lian Chengyu had worked up such a temper. In fact, Lian Chengyu had an inferiority complex but was also a proud man. In front of the large tribe\u2019s elites, he had to be inferior, but in front of the poor people of the Lian tribal clan, he would not allow anything that was detrimental to his pride.For example Jiang Xiaorou, although Lian Chengyu wanted Jiang Xiaorou, he had never expressed such a desire in front of his subordinates. It was like an emperor taking a liking to a small court girl. He would only visit, but never chase.How could a cheap commoner be worthy of his pursuit?That was the reason why Zhao Tiezhu did not know about Lian Chengyu\u2019s designs on Jiang Xiaorou. Even now, he was still at a loss, why would Lian Chengyu be so angry with Jiang Xiaorou running away?\u201cLeave!\u201d Lian Chengyu waved his hand. His expression was gloomy. I did not expect the bitch to be that stubborn, willing to die than to be possessed by me!One of the reasons Lian Chengyu was so angry was because he coveted Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s exceptional temperament and looks.The second reason why was the key reason. Lian Chengyu, having lived in the resource poor Lian tribal clan, had always been able to get anything he wanted. But he had to bend over just to obtain a discarded piece of resource from a large tribal clan. This accumulated to the point of him having an extreme desire in his heart.He wanted to obtain things that did not belong to him, and if it belonged to him, no one could touch it.To Lian Chengyu, Jiang Xiaorou belonged to the Lian tribal clan, so she was exclusively his.It was alright if he couldn\u2019t obtain the things of others, but the things in the Lian tribal clan was his and his family\u2019s. So there was nothing that made him angrier than her escaping!\u201cThis bitch might already be dead.\u201dA fifteen year old girl had to have a lot of courage to escape into the vast wilderness alone as it was equivalent to suicide.And to send men to find her was impossible. The vast wilderness was so large, who would know which direction Jiang Xiaorou escaped to?And sending dozens of his men from the warrior preparation camp would probably lead to some deaths. It was not worth it.Very soon, Lian Chengyu received a second piece of news.The men who had taken the Blood Thinning Pill had finally fallen ill! Actually the time for them to fall ill had already been delayed from Lian Chengyu\u2019s original estimate.They were all extremely weak and each cough coughed up blood.These ill men were all the pillars of their family. They had originally hoped to earn some additional food for their family by refining the bones.But now, the pillar was gone!These few days, because of the lack of food, there were already a few people who had died of hunger and cold.The first who died were the ill and the elderly.The families with able-bodied men could barely make do, but without their men, their days ahead were unimaginable!And for this, the Lian tribal clan upper echelon no longer came forward to provide assistance. They did not hand down food because Lian Chengyu had decided that these people would not last long, and had lost their value.With the meagre amounts of food left in the tribe, they still had to carry on recruiting able-bodied men to refine the desolate bones.Of course, after the best batch of fit men were maimed, the second batch were a bunch of mediocres. But it didn\u2019t matter since the desolate bones were almost done refining.Despite the Lian tribal clan\u2019s upper echelon being so cold and heartless, the people were left in the dark. They did not know the truth, because it was all Yi Yun\u2019s fault.The desperate family members of the able-bodied men came to the Lian tribal clan Patriarch compound, hoping to be given some food, and hoping they could obtain a Blood Thinning Pill that had \u201csaved\u201d their men\u2019s\u2019 lives.Of course in the eyes of the family members, that was a life-saving \u201cmiracle drug\u201d.But the Lian tribal clan upper echelons dismissed this requests. There were limited numbers of Blood Thinning Pills, and since it overdrafted on a person\u2019s life force, why would they waste it on these people who had no chance of surviving?As a spokesperson, Zhao Tiezhu arrogantly stood on a dais and gave a disdainful glance at the family members of those able-bodied men.He was once a member of the poor, but now Zhao Tiezhu felt he was no longer poor. He had escaped the realm of the poor, and was different from the ant-like inferior creatures.He was now a subordinate of Lian Chengyu. When Lian Chengyu becomes a Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior, or even a \u201cKingdom Knight\u201d, he would be one of the servants of a Kingdom Knight!You know how great is a Kingdom Knight? A watchdog of a prime minister\u2019s house was equivalent to a grade three official, when that happens, Zhao Tiezhu would be able to have multiple wives, and become successful! How could he mix with these scrounging poor?\u201cWhat are you making a din for? What are you making a din for? You bunch of bumpkins still want a miracle drug to save lives. How many of these miracle drugs do you think our tribe has? Do you know the cost of refining a miracle drug?\u201dZhao Tiezhu looked despicably down at the ragged bunch of women and children.But seeing that they had been stunned by his words, he felt like he was now a person of the upper echelon, \u201cIf I were to say it bluntly, all you bumpkin lives added up would not be enough to exchange for a miracle drug!\u201d\u201cYou want food? You want miracle drugs? Give up hope!\u201d\u201cThe tribe has previously saved your men\u2019s lives once, and you still expect a second? It was your men who got infected by the plague accidentally. It has nothing to do with the tribe. Too bad for your luck? If you want to blame, blame it on that kid Yi Yun. It was he who got infected and spread it to you. That bastard, even in death he is harming others!\u201dZhao Tiezhu had the ulterior motives to fan the flames.And at this time, someone with a mean voice rang, \u201cSoldier Zhao is right, it\u2019s all because of that jinx Yi Yun!\u201dThis was Lian Cuihua\u2019s voice. She had been mixed within the crowd and had waited for the opportune time to steer public opinion.\u201cAlso that Jiang Xiaorou that seductress! Our Lian tribal clan had kindly accepted that troubled family, giving them food and a place to live, and not only did they not repay us, they even brought disaster on us!\u201d\u201cFellow villagers, if you want to blame, blame those two jinxes!\u201d Lian Cuihua shouted at the top of voice, and the family members of the able-bodied men were unable to tell right from wrong in their state of desperation.Besides, the truth was too complicated for them, making it too hard to understand.Now with that bitch Jiang Xiaorou gone, she had absconded to avoid punishment! Let\u2019s burn their house! Let\u2019s make sure that she will freeze to death even if she returns! Starve to death!\u201d\u201cBurning their house is also a form of exorcism, let\u2019s go fellow villagers!\u201d Lian Cuihua took off her tattered cloak and jumped up the stage only with a top and began waving her coat, as if it were a small flag.People had a tendency towards mass behavior, so they were easily led.Besides, in their hearts, it was really Yi Yun who had caused their able-bodied men to collapse, causing them to have desperate times ahead. They were most likely going to starve or freeze to death.Under Lian Cuihua\u2019s instigation, the people besieged Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house again.These people were either really angry, or simply following the herd. There were some who did not have the heart to do so.But the outcome did not change, ten torches were thrown towards Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s dilapidated hut filled with cow dung.The flames reached the sky.The crackling sounds were like the cries of the demons. As the tongues of the flames leaked the sky, thick black smoke rose, dying the beautiful red sky black\u2026\u2026From a distance, Lian Chengyu was watching this scene without expression. Burning Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house was not enough to appease him, it only mattered if Jiang Xiaorou was found.He calmly said to the Zhao Tiezhu who was standing behind him, \u201cSend down the order, do not affect the desolate bones refinement. Also, when out hunting, if you find Jiang Xiaorou, bring her to me. There will be a reward!\u201d\u201cYes, Young master Lian. I will guarantee that it will be done!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu accepted the order before leaving.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 - Qi Gatherer RealmPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: Qi Gatherer RealmIn the back mountains of the Lian tribal clan, Yi Yun could see the rising black smoke from afar. He could not see the position of the fire, but he could guess what had happened.He only sneered and said nothing.He was planning to bring Jiang Xiaorou out of the vast wilderness, so it was alright burning the house!Yi Yun closed his eyes and began expirating the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.Once his meridians were opened, he could expirate.Expirating was the absorption of Heaven Earth Yuan Qi. After completing one circulation, the energy would be discharged from the pores and subtly transform the body and was a cumulative process.And having opened up the meridians, they would be the channel for the flow of Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.Lin Xintong\u2019s meridians were dried up, so the biggest problem was not being able to expirate the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, unable to freely use the energy in her body.But even under such restrictions, Lin Xintong could still obtain her present day martial arts achievements. It was an amazing feat.Yi Yun did not know this and he was sitting in a trance like state, and began expirating the Yuan Qi.Expirating may seem simple, but it was not. It was a process that tests talent.A person without talent would never be able to enter a trance like state. They would feel like time passes extremely slowly. After twenty hours, or even a day or two of cross-legged sitting and expirating, it would be too boring. Most people would lose their patience after doing this boring thing for long periods of time.Especially the hyperactive children would not be able to endure this.But, if one could reach the trance like state, then the concept of time will be lost. In a blink of an eye, several days would have passed. And the person expirating would feel like he had just taken a nap.As for Yi Yun, he was currently in such a state.Yi Yun\u2019s constitution was that of a normal person. But his soul was different from others. He had extraordinary perceptivity and Yi Yun had the Purple Crystal hiding within him.The Purple Crystal was a divine artifact that was related to energy. A person\u2019s body has \u201cSpirit\u201d, \u201cQi\u201d and \u201cSoul\u201d. In the flesh was \u201cSpirit\u201d, while the soul was about the \u201cSoul\u201d, as for the energy, it was \u201cQi\u201d.By using the Purple Crystal to gather Qi, Yi Yun could do it easily!The speed at which he absorbed the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi or the circulation speed within his meridians were far faster than a normal person.As such, Yi Yun had completely forgotten the concept of time.From sunset to late at night, from late night to dawn\u2026The mountain was chilly, and Yi Yun\u2019s clothes were wet from the chilly air. A layer of white frost had already crystallized on his hair.Yi Yun had previously warned Jiang Xiaorou not to look for him, and to wait without worry in the tree house.There was plenty of food in the treehouse which Jiang Xiaorou could prepare when she was hungry.After sunrise, the sun rose in the vast wilderness. It was a beautiful picture as the golden sun climbed up with difficulty. The horizon appeared to be coated gold by the sunlight. The entire mountain had seemed to been revived as they welcomed the baptism of the golden sunshine.Yi Yun remained motionless. His young face greeted the rising sun as if many light dots were jumping on his skin.After sunrise, it was midday, followed by evening and into the night!Yi Yun had sat there meditating for a day and a night without taking in a single grain.He was like a piece of rock that never moved. But if you had Yi Yun\u2019s vision, you would see numerous light dots flying towards Yi Yun, covering his entire body.His body\u2019s meridians had became crystal clear from the flowing golden light. Under the light, it was as if he had turned transparent.Yi Yun could even see the insides of his body, where the shining meridians formed a perfect meridian graph.This was a mesmerizing scene.Slowly the lights Yi Yun could see grow thicker. His meridians were becoming brighter and brighter and his body was getting hotter!In Yi Yun\u2019s mind, various images appeared. They were the moves of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 playing out like a movie in his mind.It was as if Yi Yun was cultivating himself in a spiritual world, and he kept doing each stance of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 without tire.Behind Yi Yun were the shadows of a dragon and tiger, each taking a side.Yi Yun\u2019s condition became more and more mysterious. He could feel that his body was being pressed and his cells were continuously compressed, and solidified. His bones became heavy and his blood had became similar to mercury.After Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist, Yi Yun began practicing the Elephant Swallowing Technique!The Elephant Swallowing Technique was not a fist technique, but a set of moves and this set of moves was extremely mysterious, even more so than \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019!Elephant Swallowing Technique was extremely high in energy consumption. Under the situation of a body\u2019s energy being drained, the body would reach a state of absorbing energy from the external world where it welcomed all.Yi Yun was now like a sponge, and he was in the energy ocean freely absorbing its power.After the Yuan Qi accumulated to its maximum and Yi Yun having performed Elephant Swallowing Technique and Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist for the umpteenth time\u2013\u201cPeng!\u201dSuddenly, Yi Yun heard something explode in his body. A raw and sweet breath surged up Yi Yun\u2019s throat, and with a open of his mouth, \u201cWah\u201d, he had vomited a large mouthful of black blood!This mouthful of black blood was extremely thick and sticky. After vomiting it out, Yi Yun felt full of energy, like nectar raining down his head, drenching his whole body.He opened his mouth and the nectar would enter his mouth!This was not an illusion. It was his tongue feeling it, because even Yi Yun\u2019s saliva tasted sweet like nectar. Swallowing a mouthful made him extremely relaxed and comfortable!Yi Yun knew that he had reached the fifth level of Mortal Blood, Qi Gatherer!Qi Gatherer realm was the transitionary border between the Mortal Blood realm and the Purple Blood realm, the process where a person\u2019s body could shrug off their mortality!\u201cWonderful! It really feels wonderful!\u201d Yi Yun suddenly opened both his eyes. His eyes flashed like lightning and his gaze would shoot out like lightning, piercing through darkness.He jumped up and looked like a tiger living on the rocks!Having reached the Qi Gatherer realm, Yi Yun felt his body full of energy. He casually lifted his right leg and stomped down!\u201cBoom!\u201dThe black ironstone by his feet was stomped open by Yi Yun\u2019s foot.Seeing the cracked piece of rock, Yi Yun was very satisfied.\u201cMy strength is many times stronger than when I was in the Meridians realm! Not even a thousand pound cauldron, lifting even a five to six thousand pound cauldon would be no problem.With his strength reaching six cauldrons, or six thousand pounds, it was no wonder the rock was shattered as a six thousand pound object would cause the same damage when dropped from a height..If that six thousand pound object had reduced its size to that of a fist, it would be terrifying.And with Yi Yun\u2019s \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, the fist would be way stronger than his body\u2019s strength by several times.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I haven\u2019t even mastered half of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 yet, and already have this strength. When I finish the eighteen stances of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, I will be able to easily exceed ten thousand pounds. At that time, even a hundred shi divine bow would be as easy as shooting marbles, sending the arrow flying thousands of feet, piercing steel plates! If I had this strength in Earth\u2019s ancient times, I could win a war by myself.\u201d In ancient times, when two armies clashed, if an arrow could be shot to tear the opponent\u2019s General apart, the battle would have been won.Thinking of this, Yi Yun felt his stomach. He was hungry.\u201cI\u2019m sure a glutton.\u201d Yi Yun was speechless, after all there was nothing he could do about it. A warrior were bound to have large appetites. Even the energy needed to stomp the black ironstone to pieces was the amount that could last a normal person for days.A warrior upon reaching the Qi Gatherer realm would have strength above one cauldron. If the warrior wanted to improve, he would have to work hard at cultivating.Using one cauldron of strength to cultivate had naturally high energy consumption. And to replenish the energy was to eat more!Yi Yun endured his hunger and practiced a Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist. He really had the strength to easily shatter rock. It was now comparable to the destructive power of Lin Xintong in her suppressed state.\u201cThe Qi Gatherer is indeed not the same! But, I must not be too obsessed with \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. As Miss Lin said, although this fist technique is exceptional, but it still just a basic cultivation technique!\u201d\u201cBut, I can\u2019t look down on it because it\u2019s a basic cultivation technique, on the contrary, I should work even harder, refining it to perfection, until I can step beyond the routines, integrating \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 fully, digesting it till it becomes my own method!\u201d Yi Yun was thinking of this and activated his technique and flew through the woods. Like a cat, he jumped back to the tree house.In the treehouse, Jiang Xiaorou was still sleeping. But she had not been sleeping soundly. She was lying by her side and a slender thigh peeked out from the blanket, and had tightly clasped the blanket. At the same time, her small hand was grabbing to a corner of the blanket, and her face was pale, with eyebrows frowning. From her wrinkle-free forehead, a line of perspiration appeared.Yi Yun knew that Jiang Xiaorou was having a nightmare. A fifteen year old girl having suffered a catastrophe and have experienced emotional swings would still feel insecure, even though everything was now over.Yi Yun walked lightly to the wooden bed, and lay down beside Jiang Xiaorou. He hugged her from the back and softly whispered into her ear, \u201ceverything will be alright, I\u2019ll always be by your side.\u201dYi Yun\u2019s words were like magic. Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s frowned eyebrows relaxed and she no longer grabbed her blanket rightly. The corners of the mouth started curling, and a calm smile appeared.Yi Yun gently pulled a corner of the blanket and covered himself, sleeping with his clothes on. He had been practicing martial arts for two months and had almost not have any sleep every night. Tonight, in this tree house, it was a space that belonged to Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou. He decided that he would take the night off, accompanying his sister.In the darkness, Yi Yun could see the faint light dots that emitted from the Chi Lin heat. They were like little flies, flying towards him slowly.Yi Yun had broken through to the Qi Gatherer realm, so his body was extremely hungry. With an energy source, the Purple Crystal would stream all the energy to strengthen his body.After eating the energy, although it could do the same as making him full, it could not compare to the eating of delicacies\u2026As Yi Yun thought about it, he became more determined. He wanted to leave the Cloud Wilderness and walk towards the unknown world, and become a peerless expert. By reaching the peak of the martial world, he could be able to see the magnificent scenery!Slowly, Yi Yun fell deep into sleep.Even in his sleep, the Purple Crystal in his heart carried on pulsating with his heart, replenishing Yi Yun\u2019s energy.\u2026In the Lian tribal clan, faint cries could be heard deep into the night.This was due to the able-bodied men who had fallen ill from refining the Frost Python desolate bones.Supposedly, these people would not have been able to last five days before dying.However, it had already been seven days, and they were still hanging on their last breath.They had been eating porridge daily, yet they did not die.They didn\u2019t have any strength, and were bed-ridden. They had dark eye circles, and no trace of blood could be seen on their faces.This was actually the after-effects of eating the Blood Thinning Pill. The Blood Thinning Pill overdrafted a person\u2019s life force, causing the blood to thin, and making the person bedridden. But besides the after-effects of the Blood Thinning Pill, there were not much of an after-effect from the Frost Python toxin.Supposedly, the Frost Python toxin\u2019s after-effects were even worse, and was enough to take all their lives.But, no one paid attention to this.Because in the Lian tribal clan, they were preparing a huge celebration. This celebration was to celebrate the completion of successful refining the desolate bones.This was an event that would determine the tribe\u2019s future, so with people being superstitious in the vast wilderness, how could they not hold a celebration?Happiness always comes suddenly. As the preparations were beginning, Lian Chengyu received great news that the Frost Python desolate bones had already been refined into desolate bones essence!Upon receiving the news, Lian Chengyu was pleasantly surprised, \u201cwhy is it so fast? It\u2019s earlier than the forecast by ten days!\u201dAccording to the technique\u2019s manual, another ten days to completely refine the desolate bones essence would be its best prediction.\u201cHahaha! It\u2019s so fast! Chengyu, Grandpa congratulates you!\u201d As the laughter traveled over, the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch slowly walked in. His face was full of joy. He was indeed happy. With the desolate bones refined, Lian Chengyu could break into the Purple Blood realm and after being selected by the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, his achievements would allow even his pets to ascend heaven.As Lian Chengyu\u2019s grandfather, he had played a huge role in it. He could follow Lian Chengyu into the city to live a comfortable life. Although he was the Patriarch, he was sick of the poor life and was already planning to destroy the Lian tribal clan.It would be great in the city. The people there were rich and he could get a few concubines and peacefully enjoyed the comforts of his remaining life.\u201cGood! It\u2019s too good!\u201d Lian Chengyu was excited. The displeasure of Jiang Xiaorou being missing had long been forgotten.Compared to the Desolate bones relic, what was women?In the future when he made his meteoric rise, would he have any lack of women?\u201cHow are the preparations for the celebration?\u201d asked Lian Chengyu.\u201cIt happened too suddenly, and the celebrations aren\u2019t prepared. I will get people to prepare it overnight. Tomorrow, we will kill our livestock to honor the heavens. Chengyu, the tribe\u2019s hope now rests on you.\u201d said the Patriarch as he patted Lian Chengyu on the shoulder. He had placed all hope on Lian Chengyu.\u201cTomorrow, good. Tomorrow will be the day!\u201d Although Lian Chengyu could not bear the wait to eat the desolate bones essence, he knew that to achieve greatness, he had to sharpen his mind!Patience was extremely important.Lian Chengyu had been waiting for years, so he was willing to wait another day.He knew that he had struggled with great difficulty to obtain the desolate bones relic. In order to adjust his mental state, he had to calm himself down before eating it. Only then will it achieve maximum effect, allowing him to break into the Purple Blood realm!That day many of the tribal elders prayed in the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch compound.As for Lian Chengyu, he was served by four maidens, taking care of his every need.These four maidens were about sixteen years old. They were all slim, but their skin was rough and had looks inferior to Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s. However in a small tribal clan like the Lian tribal clan, they were one of the prettiest.If it was a normal day, Lian Chengyu would have s*x with these maidens, but today his mind was as still as water, as he conditioned his mental state.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Two strong men would carry it, and another strong man will use all his strength to blow through it.The deep baritone echoed over the Lian tribal clan and could be heard miles away.\u201cThe auspicious hour has come!\u201d shouted Zhao Tiezhu at the top of his voice.Such a grand celebration by the Lian tribal clan attracted all the tribe\u2019s people, as long as they could get off the bed; even a one year old child would be carried here by his mother.The venue was packed to the brim!\u201cDong! Dong! Dong!\u201dThe drummer began beating the drum. It began slow but became more rapid as time went by. The worn cow skin covering the drum seemed like it could hardly withstand the large force.\u201cKill the animals!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu shouted again. His face was ruddy and he was in high spirits. To be the celebration\u2019s master of ceremony was such an honor!The members of the warrior preparation camp led the only head of cattle in the Lian tribal clan over and slaughtered it.The Lian tribal clan had originally three heads of cattle, but with the shortage of food, two of them were slaughtered to make bacon. Most of it had been given the upper echelon of the Lian tribal clan, and small amounts of it had been given to the able-bodied men who refined the desolate bones as a reward.Now, even the last head of cattle was killed. It was equivalent to the burning of bridges. Without the cattle, it was even harder to farm in the village.The land of the wilderness was filled with black ironstone. To open up a land for agriculture was extremely difficult. Members of the warrior preparation camp like Zhao Tiezhu would pale in comparison to a cattle if they were to try to plow the land. Lian Chengyu was stronger than a head of cattle, but would Lian Chengyu pull a plow?With the head of cattle dead, the blood was collected. The tribe\u2019s witch came and wiped the blood all over her body and began dancing like an epileptic.That\u2019s right, this witch was the same witch as the one who joined the villagers in throwing cow dung at Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house. In fact, there was only one witch in the Lian tribal clan.\u201cFinally the bones have been brewed, it\u2019s great. Now Young master Lian can become a Purple Blood Warrior!\u201d Lian Cuihua said proudly among the crowd. As her voice was loud, many people heard her.\u201cI heard that if Young master Lian were to be chosen by the Kingdom, he could bring us into the big city to lead a good life.\u201d\u201cWill our future change for the better? It may not matter to an old man like me, but my kid is just over ten years old, if he could leave this shithole, it will be great\u2026\u201dThe people of the vast wilderness only concerned about their future life. With the cattle slaughtered, herb mountain picked dry, and the grain warehouse empty, it could be said that the Lian tribal clan had spent everything, and were now penniless.If they met with failure, the consequences would be unthinkable.\u201cCould something go wrong regarding this matter\u2026\u201d a middle-aged man asked uncertainly. He was afraid.\u201cPui! Pui! Pui! What are you saying, of course nothing will go wrong!\u201dThe people began to discuss. They were very hopeful about Lian Chengyu breaking through to the Purple Blood realm and participating in the Kingdom\u2019s selection.\u201cMama\u2026will we get some meat?\u201d As people looked forward to the future, a three year old girl in her mother\u2019s bosom asked as her eyes stared at the beef that was placed in the cauldron to cook. She could not stop swallowing her saliva.\u201cDon\u2019t speak rubbish. That\u2019s a tribute to the gods, how can they give it to you?\u201d the woman jumped as she quickly covered the girl\u2019s mouth\u2026The ceremony lasted for two hours before it ended. Lian Chengyu, wearing a grand robe with silver armor came to the stage.Today Lian Chengyu was in high spirits!In front of Lian Chengyu was a jade box and it was covered by a piece of red silk.Lian Chengyu took a deep breath for the time has finally come. It was time to realize his ambitions and aspirations!He slowly pulled the silk away to reveal the item inside the jade box. In it was a desolate bone essence the size of a fist!This desolate bone essence was an item that had cost all his family\u2019s assets!The look of the desolate bone essence did not look good. It was mud brown in color and its looks could not be compared to the peanut sized crystal-clear desolate bones relic.This was understandable. They had used a backward technique to refine the desolate bones essence. They had brewed the energy within the Frost Python desolate bones in Li Fire water, and evaporated the Li Fire water, crystallizing it to obtain the desolate bone essence.How could something made that way look pretty?Even though it didn\u2019t look good, in Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyes, it was the most exquisite work of art in the world!It was related to his future, related to all the hope he had placed on the item. Lian Chengyu calmed his mind and took up the desolate bone essense with both hands and ate it.The fist sized desolate bone essence was like a ball of mud, even the texture was no different from eating mud.The taste was self-evident.But Lian Chengyu was not willing to waste it. He was careful, without missing a bit. He even licked his fingers clean.He was nervous. This was the first time eating a desolate bone essence. The energy within it might be violent but his body constitution was not bad, so he should be able to withstand it,\u201cThe ceremony is over! Everyone, out!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu shouted loudly. The members of the warrior preparation camp began to chase the people away, in order not to affect Lian Chengyu.Lian Chengyu would break through to the Purple Blood realm on the altar blessed by the tribal witch!Although they were being chased away, these people did not go far. They looked from afar to see the situation on the alter.All they saw was Lian Chengyu sitting cross-legged. He had began to regulate his breathing in a bid to break though.But\u2026The expected heat rush that would spread throughout his body, giving his body an exploding feeling did not happen.Instead, his diaphragm was clam. It was as what he just ate was a normal mud ball.Oh?What\u2019s the matter? Lian Chengyu frowned.Could there be a delay before the desolate bone essence would kick in? Do I need to wait a little longer?Lian Chengyu began to patiently wait, and wait.\u201cStay calm. You need to calm down. When the desolate bone essence releases its energy, it will be like a surge. Although my body has a solid constitution, but when the surge happens, it might be hard to bear. I need to calm my heart and grit my teeth, upon withstanding this surge, I would be like a phoenix rising from the ashes and soar into the sky!\u201d Lian Chengyu had this thought and calmed his heart and mind down.However, fifteen minutes passed\u2026There was not the slightest reaction from the desolate bone essence that had reached his stomach.This was the first time Lian Chengyu ate a desolate bone essence, so he did not know how long it would take to show its effects. He thought that maybe the desolate bone essence was not easily digested, so it would be slow\u2026Maybe\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As the matter was of great importance, he was afraid something wrong had happened.Why hasn\u2019t the desolate bone essence reveal its effects after such a long time?When he bought the desolate bone, he had carefully checked it. The desolate bone had no traces of having been refined before. And in the beginning of the refinement process, there was the appearance of the Frost Python toxins that was recorded in the books. It had caused a group of able-bodied men to fall ill. That meant that the desolate bone was genuine.Did something wrong happen during the refinement process? Thinking carefully, it couldn\u2019t be. There were many of his men who were watching the refinement process, and he had checked on the process every now and then, how could there be a problem?Lian Chengyu was no ordinary person. After a deep round of pondering, he calmed down quickly and said to himself,\u201cMud can be solidified after a rain; but jade amber has to be buried for millions of years to be nourished by the land.\u201d\u201cSweet corn can be harvested in a year; but an immortality pill needs to be subjected to millions of years to absorb the essence from the surroundings.\u201d\u201cAn unscrupulous charlatan can write a fist technique book in three days; but the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s founding emperor had to train for ten thousand years to create the \u2018Tai Ah Sacred Technique\u2019!\u201d\u201cA mud block will be smashed with one stomp, but a jade amber will become a piece of art handed down for generations; Sweet corn will become become the waste of humans, but an immortality pill could create make a king a god; a charlatan\u2019s fist technique manual can only be used to cheat a fool of his money, but the \u2018Tai Ah Sacred Technique\u2019 will be spread down for ages, sought after by warriors!\u201d\u201cTo accomplish greatness, patience must be honed. If I cannot endure these few minutes, how can I accomplish greatness!\u201dLian Chengyu began thinking and his expression turned calm.But, one hour passed\u2026Lian Chengyu still sat with a calm mind. His words had been repeated to himself an uncountable number of times.Two hours passed.Lian Chengyu\u2019s forehead started to ooze sweat.Four hours passed.Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyes were blood red, his fists clenched tightly, with his nails lodging deep into his flesh.Six hours!Zhao Tiezhu and the rest were already aching in their feet. As for the people crowding around Lian Chengyu, waiting for him to soar into the sky and bringing them into the city had already stretched out their necks till they became stiff.Eight hours, the sun had set. Lian Chengyu had been sitting there in his silly meditation the whole day.How could this be? How could this be?How could this be! !Lian Chengyu shouted in his heart. Veins looking like earthworms appeared on his forehead making him look hideous.Seeing Lian Chengyu in this state, Zhao Tiezhu and company began to rouse themselves. Even the Lian tribal clan Patriarch was staring widely with full attention.They knew this was probably the legendary explosive power of the desolate bones!Because the energy was too strong and Lian Chengyu was at his body\u2019s limits, would the veins rise up. If something inadvertent happened, it could cause Lian Chengyu\u2019s veins to explode!In history, there was no lack of warriors who ate the desolate bones essence greedily, but instead of absorbing it, they only ended up blowing up their bodies.\u201cEveryone Step back, no one is to interrupt. Anyone who makes a step forward, kill!\u201d The Patriarch issued his command. This was Lian Chengyu\u2019s most crucial moment, if anyone were to disturb Lian Chengyu, he might be receive damaged to his meridians, destroying hopes of breaking through. When that happened, it would not be enough to grind the person to death.Ten hours.The sky was totally dark and the moon was high in the star-filled sky.But the Lian tribal clan upper echelon and the members of the warrior preparation camp had not left. The tribe\u2019s witch and doctor were all awaiting orders. They had just ate a few bites for their meals.The witch would kneel down to pray from time to time, continuing on her ceremony, blessing Lian Chengyu.At this time, Lian Chengyu who was meditating suddenly made a loud roar!\u201cAh\u2013\u201dThis roar was deep but loud. It was like the angry roar of a beast, soaring to the ends of the skies!\u201cBoom!\u201dThe altar Lian Chengyu was sitting on cracked open. This was caused by Lian Chengyu\u2019s energy.\u201cYoung master has broken through! Young master has broken through!\u201dSeeing such a display, Zhao Tiezhu leaped up in joy.The members of the warrior preparation camp got up to cheer and celebrate.The Patriarch only stroked his beard and revealed a happy smile. Only the warrior preparation camp instructor Yao Yuan looked curiously at Lian Chengyu. His eyes were puzzled because why did Lian Chengyu\u2019s roar contain a deep sense of irreconcilability and hate?Zhao Tiezhu signalled to the people behind him, it\u2019s meaning was to shout with him\u2013\u201cCongratulations Young master, congratulations Young master! With Young master\u2019s Purple Blood completed, he will unify the wilderness! Young master to live for many generations, life as long as the skies!\u201dThe members of the warrior preparation camp began shouting in unison.They had practiced this chant for very long. This was planned by Zhao Tiezhu in secret. Zhao Tiezhu, who was a master of sucking up, would never have passed up this opportunity.It had to be said that the members of the warrior preparation camp were much stronger than the average person. Having practiced this chant, the sound was loud and could be heard from ten miles away.As such, everyone in the Lian tribal clan knew that Lian Chengyu had broken into the Purple Blood realm!For the past few days, Lian Cuihua had been deliberately spreading the news, so even a granny whose teeth were all dropping off knew what the Purple Blood realm meant.It was an best of the best of the best among all the experts. The Zhang Yuxian who came a few days ago to the Lian tribal clan was in the Purple Blood realm.Now Young master Lian can\u2019t be that much weaker than Zhang Yuxian\u201cYoung master Lian has broken into the Purple Blood realm, we will have a good life in the future.\u201d\u201cYes, Young master Lian had previously said it, we will all be brought into the city.\u201d\u201cYou may not know, but back then when Young master Lian was born, the entire sky was lit red. It\u2019s obvious Young master Lian is a star that descended, and not someone ordinary!\u201dPeople discussed animately because they had been yearning for a life of ease. The sufferings and hunger they had endured was no longer important.As long as Lian Chengyu broke through, then all sorts of good things would come. They did not seek prosperity, but as long as they a stable life, they would be thankful.The people were kept afar, but the members of the warrior preparation camp had already circled Lian Chengyu, and were chanting even louder.\u201cYoung master to live for many generations, the wilderness will be unified!\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2019s prowess is unparalleled, life as long as the skies!\u201dAll they could chant were those few words, but at this time Lian Chengyu\u2019s face was pale. His eyes looked at the surroundings in an unfocused manner.\u201cPuah!\u201dA mouthful of scarlet fresh blood spit out from Lian Chengyu\u2019s mouth like a red fountain, spraying all over the floor!Zhao Tiezhu was kneeling right in front of Lian Chengyu, and that mouthful of blood had sprayed onto Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s face, drenching him crimson.Zhao Tiezhu was dumbfounded, he just stood there dazed.The other members of the warrior preparation camp were dumbfounded too, what\u2026what\u2026happened?\u201cChengyu! Chengyu!\u201dThe Patriarch jumped in shock and flurriedly rushed over and supported Lian Chengyu, \u201cDoctor, call the doctor! !\u201dThe tribe\u2019s only doctor had been waiting by the sidelines all this time. He was old and did not know any martial arts. His legs were aching from the long standing. Seeing Lian Chengyu vomit blood suddenly, his face turned pale. He ran over, but because he legs were not stable, he had tumbled and crawled to Lian Chengyu\u2019s side.When he measured Lian Chengyu\u2019s pulse, he could only find that his pulse was in utter disorder, and was unsure of the matter.At this time, Zhao Tiezhu opened his mouth and waved, \u201cEveryone, rest assured. Young master must have just broken through, causing his pulse to be unstable. He vomited out black blood, it\u2019s known as Marrow Cleansing, I guess you don\u2019t know about it. Marrow Cleansing requires the vomiting of the impure black blood in the body.\u201dAs he said that, Zhao Tiezhu wiped the blood of his face. For a moment, Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s face was as red as the dancing witch.The people around looked at Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s face and gaped. They did not know what to say, nor did that know how to break the silence.After wiping the blood off his face, Zhao Tiezhu was still calm and said, \u201cSoon Young master will recover and when that happens for many generations, the wilderness will be unified.\u201dIn Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s heart, Lian Chengyu was a god.What could happen to a god? Besides, Lian Chengyu had just broken through to the Purple Blood realm, so a little imbalance was normal.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Having lived to a ripe old age, he was able to tell with his own abilities. He worriedly asked, \u201cDoctor, how is he?\u201d The Lian tribal clan\u2019s barefooted doctor\u2019s knowledge was originally limited, so he was unable to tell.This quack began to panic and was utterly dumbfounded by the question of the Patriarch.What did he know?\u201cThe situation\u2026I can\u2019t really tell, I\u2019ll write a prescription to the Young master. The Young master\u2019s foundation is solid and he\u2019s strong, he\u2026he should be fine\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you sure he\u2019ll be alright? Could it be that because the Young master broke through, leaving his body weak, was the backlash in his vitals caused by the Yuan Qi? As such, he should recover soon, right?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The quack did not dare guarantee this. His forehead was filled with sweat, but he composed himself with a sigh, \u201ceverything will depend on the Young master\u2019s future conditions. Let him take the prescription and have a good night\u2019s sleep. Tomorrow we should be able to tell, tomorrow.\u201dThe quack had just said a bunch of crap that was as good as not saying anything. As for Yao Yuan, he frowned and walked to the side of the Patriarch and whispered a few words into his ear.\u201cWhat did you say!?\u201dAfter hearing Yao Yuan\u2019s words, his heart skipped a beat, \u201cYou say Chengyu failed to breakthrough!?\u201dThe Patriarch hushed his tone for this matter of was of great concern. He did not want this to spread.\u201cHmm\u2026 it should be a failure to breakthrough, resulting in a counter flow of energy against him. It might have been due to anger that resulted in this\u2026\u201d Yao Yuan had chosen his words wisely in order to not agitate the Patriarch.But those words still made the Patriarch dizzy.\u201cHow could it be?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu who was extremely calm turned anxious upon hearing Yao Yuan\u2019s words.But Yao Yuan gave him a stern look, shutting Zhao Tiezhu up.He knew that Yao Yuan\u2019s experience was extraordinary. Yao Yuan had previously broken into the Purple Blood realm before, so what he said could not be bunk, so it had to be the truth!Young master Lian really failed in his breakthrough?Seeing Lian Chengyu\u2019s barely breathing, unconscious self, Zhao Tiezhu could no longer deceive himself.\u201cChengyu ah\u2026\u201d The Patriarch suddenly seemed to age by eight years as he stumbled to pick up Lian Chengyu.Seeing the crowd approaching, the Patriarch hurriedly said in a hushed tone to the surrounding people, \u201cChengyu\u2019s failure to breakthrough is to be kept confidential\u2026 It cannot be announced\u2026\u201dThe Patriarch\u2019s voice was weak. Be it the refinement of the desolate bones or the breakthrough of Lian Chengyu, it was a high profile and great event.Such an event of great importance was tied deeply to the prestige and reputation of the leadership.If the tribe were to know that Lian Chengyu had failed to break through, in spite of all that was put in to obtain the desolate bone essence, including the lives of the weak and the old, what would the tribe think?What sort of prestige would be left, how were they to rule the clan in in the future?Besides, all the cattle had been slaughtered, the herb mountain was picked dry, and there were no more stored rations left. Under such a situation, if the tribe were to know that Lian Chengyu had not only failed to break through, but even vomit blood, wouldn\u2019t they revolt?They were all hoping for Lian Chengyu to bring them good days ahead!\u201cCarry Chengyu into the courtyard. Unrelated personnels are not to come close!\u201d The Patriarch said in a harsh tone carrying a sullen expression.\u201cThen\u2026 Then what should we say to the tribe people?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu asked puzzledly.\u201cSay that Chengyu had broken through to the Purple Blood realm, but he had received some injuries from the violent energies of the desolate bones. He will need to be nursed back to health for a few days!\u201dThe Patriarch decided to cover up the secret, and everything had to wait till Lian Chengyu had recovered.\u2026As the Lian tribal clan were in a frenzy, and the mess the tribe\u2019s upper echelon was in, the culprit, Yi Yun was building a fire in the back mountain. Oh, he was grilling chicken wings.Yi Yun sang as he grilled.This was a parody of a song in \u201cFlirting Scholar\u201c, where Stephen Chow was caught eating chicken wings when he was supposed to be on his deathbed.\u201cI love chicken wings. I love grilled chicken wings the most! I love Hong Shao chicken wings the most!\u201dThis was a comedic song without any sense and poor rhythm, but Yi Yun still sang it very happily.Although using firewood to grill meat was difficult, it could not deter a glutton\u2019s desire for barbecue.Soon, Yi Yun\u2019s chicken wings were smelling good. Drop after drop of grease dripped into the fire as it roared in response.\u201cIt\u2019s complete!\u201d Yi Yun cut the meat on the grilled chicken wings and sprinkled some seasoning. \u201cSis Xiaorou, try it.\u201dYi Yun gave Jiang Xiaorou the first chicken wing that finished grilling.\u201cBe careful, it\u2019s hot,\u201d Yi Yun warned. To Yi Yun, Jiang Xiaorou was the most important person in the world.\u201cYou little kid, beginning to warn your elder sister now?\u201d Jiang Xiaorou gave Yi Yun a stare. In the past, Jiang Xiaorou would make porridge for Yi Yun; and because she was afraid Yi Yun would scald himself, Jiang Xiaorou would always cool the porridge by blowing at it, warning him, \u201cSlowly eat, be careful, it\u2019s hot.\u201dA simple phrase yet it sounded very sweet.Yi Yun made sure that the chicken wings he grilled were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Although there were some black spots, it was harmless.Jiang Xiaorou opened her mouth and took a tiny bite. It was really tender and juicy, making it extremely delicious.\u201cSo delicious!\u201d Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s face was glowing. What happier thing could happen besides circling a fire and sharing delicious chicken wings with her brother?\u201cYun-er, you should eat too.\u201d\u201cOh, of course. It took me a great deal of research to find a firewood that doesn\u2019t give off black smoke!\u201dYi Yun smiled. Yi Yun\u2019s progress had slowed down the past few days, and was no longer breaking through into new realms every few days.The Qi Gatherer realm was a demarcating line. Cultivation progress upon reaching it would slow down. A person without talent will be stuck at this bottleneck for life, never to improve.Yi Yun had already absorbed half of the Chi Lin\u2019s head\u2019s energy.Yi Yun had further deepened his understanding of the Purple Crystal. He could now control the speed at which the Purple Crystal could absorb energy.Back then, when Yi Yun first broke through to the Meridians realm, he had nearly burst his body due to an unrestricted flow of incoming energy within his opened meridians.Now, Yi Yun could control the speed of absorption of the Purple Crystal, so he would no longer make the same mistake again.\u201cThe energy in Chi Lin\u2019s head is much richer than the energy in Lian Chengyu\u2019s desolate bones. It should be able to last another ten days or so; by then, it would be almost time to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection\u2026\u201dAs he thought about it, he suddenly heard a faint sound in the distance.After reaching the fifth stage of Mortal Blood, Yi Yun\u2019s senses were keen, so he could easily hear the sounds from afar.\u201cSis Xiaorou wait for me.\u201d Yi Yun said before jumping down the large tree with ease. In the distance, what he saw made him gasp.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Using the light, Yi Yun could see the troops were made up of huge beasts marching through the mountains. Atop the beasts were people holding torches.\u201cIt\u2019s the Jin Long Wei\u2019s beasts, it\u2019s the Jin Long Wei army!\u201dWith a glance, Yi Yun could see about eighty behemoths; one wouldn\u2019t need to go into detail about such a troop\u2019s battle prowess!Among them, the behemoth leading the pack flew a flag banner on his back.That flag was golden yellow in color, and on it was a beautiful dragon (Jin Long).This was the flag of the Jin Long Wei!When he had parted with Lin Xintong and old man Su, Yi Yun had asked regarding the Kingdom\u2019s selection. He also knew that the Jin Long Wei had purposely created an extremely detailed map of the Cloud Wilderness.Of course, old man Su did not tell Yi Yun anything about the two occurrences of the purple cloud phenomenon that happened in the past few months. If he did, Yi Yun\u2019s thoughts would run wild.\u201cThey are finally here. For this troop to enter the Cloud Wilderness, it has be for the Kingdom\u2019s selection! I guess it\u2019s about time!\u201dThe Cloud Wilderness was extremely broad, and the small tribes were numerous. To organize the Kingdom\u2019s selection, they could not go to every tribe to hold the examination. Hence, they would gather all of the candidates in one of the large tribes, set a particular standard and collectively assess them.The destination for the Jin Long Wei was the Tao tribal clan. They had decided on the Tao tribal clan\u2019s land as the examination center for the Kingdom\u2019s selection. The Tao tribal clan controlled an area that spanned several miles in diameter. The biggest tribes had hundreds of thousands of households, which was equal to a million people.In the Cloud Wilderness, the population census was based on the number of able-bodied men, as this number was most meaningful. Able-bodied men were the main labor force, and also the leading warriors in battle. To reflect a tribe\u2019s real strength, including the old and sick would make it meaningless.An able-bodied man had a wife, parents and a few children. As for the families without able-bodied men, like Yi Yun and Jiang Xiaorou, they wouldn\u2019t even be considered a \u201chousehold\u201d, so when a population census is made, Jiang Xiaorou will not be included in it.For a large tribe, a \u201chousehold\u201d was about six to seven people, so with hundreds of thousands of households, it would be about a million people.In the Cloud Wilderness, to have a tribe consisting of a million people was quite amazing.\u2026Cloud Wilderness, Tao tribal clan\u2014The Tao tribal clan had survived in the Cloud Wilderness for more than a thousand years. As they had a long history, they were able to form a martial art heritage they could call their own.As for a small tribe like the Lian tribal clan, they had no fences surrounding them, but for the Tao tribal clan, strong sturdy fences circled them..These wooden fences were made of thick circular logs placed side by side. Each was over ten meters high. These logs were obtained from a particular tree in the vast wilderness. Its body was extremely dense and solid and wouldn\u2019t rot even after a few hundred years of experiencing the elements.For the Tao tribal clan to able to last all these years, the key reason was due to the tribe\u2019s wonderland\u2014Tao mountain. Desolate beasts avoided wonderlands, and only live in the \u2018Desolate Lands\u2019; hence under the Tao mountain\u2019s protection, few desolate beasts appeared in the area controlled by the Tao tribal clan.Also, the Tao tribal clan had no lack of Purple Blood warriors or warriors at the peak of the Purple Blood realm. Not only that, the Tao tribal clan had a precious ancestor weapon, even if a strong desolate beast mounted an attack, with the ancestor weapon as the core, the numerous Purple Blood warriors could create an array, giving them the power to battle.Because of these reasons, the Tao tribal clan had lasted for many years, and had grown in strength.But a strong and large tribe would not be able to compare to the large entity like the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. The comparison would equal to that of a pebble at the foot of a mountain, or a dust speck at the under the roots of a tree. It was not worth mentioning.At this time, the Tao tribal clan had received the news. At high noon, the Jin Long Wei would arrive. The Tao tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch and a large number of tribal elders were there to receive them.At high noon, the Jin Long Wei arrived punctually as mentioned.The leader of this convoy from Jin Long Wei was a man in red armor. He was the Jin Long Wei\u2019s Red-shirts leader, Zhang Tan.\u201cThe Tao tribal clan is honored for life to have Thousand Households Zhang to grace his presence here!\u201d Seeing Zhang Tan, the Tao tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch immediately came forward to receive him in an extremely deferential manner.In the Jin Long Wei, the Red-shirts leader commanded a thousand people, so they were commonly addressed as Thousand Households. Of course the \u201cHouseholds\u201d refer to able-bodied men.In the armies within the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, the Jin Long Wei did not have any females. Women formed their own troop.A typical Thousand Households was nothing, but a Thousand Households of the Jin Long Wei was not the same. To the Tao tribal clan, this sort of person was not someone they could afford to offend.\u201cThese are our tribe\u2019s new generation of aspirants. Come, greet the Thousand Households!\u201d The Tao tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch said that as he waved his hand. Behind him were a hundred young warriors with ages ranging from thirteen to the twenty years of age. They greeted Household Zhang in unison.These people were all the next generation of elites from the Tao tribal clan; and they were participating in the Kingdom\u2019s selection.The Patriarch had hoped that by getting the young warriors to greet Zhang Tan, one or two of them would catch the eye of Zhang Tan, allowing them more chances of nurturing.But it was a pity, Zhang Tan had absolutely no interest. In fact, the Jin Long Wei\u2019s officers were extremely elitist. Having come from the Kingdom\u2019s capital, it was rare for them to appreciate a warrior from the Cloud Wilderness. It wasn\u2019t because they looked down on them, but because the warriors of the Cloud Wilderness were inadequate.From Zhang Tan\u2019s point of view, the reason for the Jin Long Wei to come to the Cloud Wilderness was to investigate the phenomenon that appeared in the Cloud Wilderness. As for the Kingdom\u2019s selection, it was just a matter of convenience, and there was no expectations to discover any prodigies in the Cloud Wilderness.Zhang Tan took a slight glance at the group of youths in front of him and said with a business-like attitude, \u201cThe reason for my trip is for official business, so there\u2019s no need for extravagance! Enter the city!\u201dZhang Tan waved his hand and the Jin Long Wei directly moved in.The young warriors of the Tao tribal clan were originally full of anticipation, and had prepared for it meticulously; but having waited for the day to come for the Jin Long Wei to arrive, they were ignored.With this, the young warriors were depressed.\u201cThis Thousand Households Zhang, he totally looked down on us!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too much. Our Tao tribal clan is the biggest tribe in the region. Although we are located in the wilderness and are poor in resources, but having grown up in the wilderness, we have grown up experiencing battles and seeing blood. How could those greenhouse flowers stand up to our real fighting experience?\u201d\u201cSoon it will be the selection, we will make the Jin Long Wei officers know that they were wrong. We may not do well, but our Tao tribal clan\u2019s first young master is about to complete a Tempered Body, and reach a state of \u2018Dragon Pulse\u2019. In this warrior selection, he will definitely shine!\u201d These young warriors discussed in private with a defiant tone.The Tao tribal clan\u2019s first young master was named Hu Ya and was well known throughout the tribe. This was because he was extremely close to reaching the state of Tempered Body. In the vast wilderness, it was extremely hard to reach a Tempered Body state.Zhang Tan led the Jin Long Wei straight to their encampment. After a short rest, he changed and left alone in the middle of the night.Without any followers and without anyone noticing.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This girl was the girl, Lin Xintong that Yi Yun had the chance to meet. And the old man she addressed as master, was of course old man Su.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Old man Su knitted his \u200bbrow in \u200bconcentration as his fat finger tightly squeezed a chess piece, indecisive of his next move.He had used various excuses to avoid the last eight chess matches, he had once again, been forced into a corner by Lin Xintong. Seeing that his king was about to abdicate, and he did not have any way to get out of his predicament.\u201cKe Ke\u2026Xintong, your chess skills have improved and resemble my skills of the past. Looks like I have to get serious\u2026\u201d The old man Su brazenly said it made Lin Xintong snigger, but all she did was to urge her master to make his next move.Lin Xintong seldom smiled, only in front of old man Su would she display the small liveliness a young girl would normally display. In Lin Xintong\u2019s mind, old man Su was both her master and grandfather.At this time, a voice came from the door,\u201d This lesser commander, by order of the Emperor is here to deliver a letter to Grand Master Su.\u201d\u201cAh? There\u2019s a guest,\u201d said old man Su as if his savior had arrived. \u201cNot playing anymore, not playing anymore. A guest is here. Xintong, bring the pot of tea here.\u201dWith that old man Su, used his fat arms to swipe across the chessboard, messing up all the chess pieces.\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong was speechless and said with humor, \u201cYour tea disciple had already prepared the tea. Master had been too focused on the game that you didn\u2019t drink it.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Old man Su looked at the teapot on the table as he blinked speechlessly.Fortunately, the Jin Long Wei\u2019s Thousand Households Zhang had entered the yard and cupped his hand, saluting old man Su.\u201cThis lesser commander, by order of the Emperor, is here to deliver a letter to Grandmaster Su. May Grandmaster Su look over it.\u201d As Zhang Tan said it, he placed the letter on the chess table politely. It was a red letter with a seal rune on it.Old man Su\u2019s main reason for being at the Tao tribal clan was to wait for the letter that Zhang Tan brought him.He took the letter and with a serious look on his face casually said, \u201cZhang Tan, right? You\u2019ve worked hard. Have some tea.\u201d Zhang Tan paused for a moment and glanced at the teacups on the table.He was a careful person. He could see that the tea was drank while old man Su and Lin Xintong played chess, and it was most likely brewed by Lin Xintong.Lin Xintong was a person of great stature that many elites from the big families chased after. She may one day be betrothed to a prince of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom and become a princess, and may one day become empress.As a Thousand Household of the Jin Long Wei, Zhang Tan would be courting death to drink tea brewed by a future empress!Although it was unlikely, Zhang Tan had to consider the big picture as a Jin Long Wei Thousand Household when dealing with all kinds of people.He immediately replied, \u201cThank you Grandmaster Su for the offer, this lesser commander still need to return to report, so I\u2019ll not drink.\u201dZhang Tan followed etiquette to the letter, and was proper with his words, but old man Su was a person with no fixed place of abode, so even the Kingdom\u2019s royalty would have to treat him with courtesy. He was not mindful of the etiquettes of the world, nor was he interested in it.\u201cAlright, you can leave then.\u201d Old man Su waved his hand and waited till Zhang Tan left. He tore up the wax and with a few hand gestures released the seal.After that, old man Su took out something inside the envelope. It was not a letter full of text, but a diagram.When Old man Su took out the diagram, an ancient beast ghost image rose up before disappearing. It was like a curl of smoke.Seeing this diagram, old man Su\u2019s eyes lit up. It was as if he was a poor vault guard seeing treasure.He said to himself, \u201cThis Cloud Wilderness might really have some treasure! If Marquis Wenyun could not do it himself and needs my help\u2026 Looks like the Kingdom\u2019s search for treasure was not in vain!\u201d\u201cMaster, what\u2019s the matter with the diagram?\u201d asked Lin Xintong, who was pondering on the side as she looked at the ancient beast ghost image that had already dissipated.She could not tell uncover the mystery from the diagram, but could feel its mysticism.Old man Su said, \u201cThis diagram is something that was passed down from ancient times. I do not know if it\u2019s related to the Purple Clouds\u2019 Birth, but even it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s something quite good! Xintong, don\u2019t worry. I will search to the ends of the world just to find a way to join up your broken meridians.\u2026Ever since Lian Chengyu failed to break through into the Purple Blood realm, the Lian tribal clan had quietened down. There were no more grand scenes of hundreds of people on the mountains picking herbs, nor were their strong men fanning the fires in the grain-sunning ground.The news that Lian Chengyu was injured had been covered up. All the people had believed that Lian Chengyu had broken into the Purple Blood realm, and had increased his strength by leaps and bounds!Now, all they had to do was to wait for the Kingdom\u2019s selection; Lian Chengyu would become a Kingdom warrior and bring the Lian tribal clan to a better life.This day, the sky was dotted with snow as the clouds hung low. A large eagle was flying in the skies of the Lian tribal clan.This eagle had a wingspan of over ten meters, and its flight picked up a gust of wind, causing the snow to dance in a chaotic manner.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dHow could the poor of the Lian tribal clan have ever seen such a big eagle?\u201cIs it a fierce beast? Or could it be a\u2026desolate beast!?\u201dSeeing such a large eagle had panicked the people. Typically under the protection of a wonderland, normal fierce beasts or desolate beasts would seldom encroach into the vicinity of a tribe.But those were under \u201ctypical\u201d conditions, there could be instances when fierce beasts or desolate beasts would charge into the wonderlands that hosted people, resulting in a mass murder.That had the same meaning as genocide. There were numerous small tribes in the entire Cloud Wilderness, so it was of no matter if a few small tribes were to collapse.If it was really an attack by a desolate beast, it would be a tragedy for the Lian tribal clan!As the people panicked, the large eagle suddenly dropped something that began burning in the sky.\u201cPeng!\u201d A large explosive sound resulted in a row of text appearing in the sky.Each of these words would have taken half an acre of land if they were placed on the ground. In the sky, this allowed anyone in the entire region of the Lian tribal clan to see it clearly.\u201cIn three days at noon, the Jin Long Wei will send ambassadors to the Lian tribal clan and take with them ten warriors to the Tao tribal clan for the selection. Those who pass the selection will become the Kingdom\u2019s warriors, members of the Jin Long Wei! The ten people have to be below the age of twenty-eight. They are to be chosen from those who had passed the preliminary examination and up to be decided by the tribe!\u201dSeeing the large row of text, everyone paused. The Kingdom\u2019s selection, the Kingdom\u2019s selection is finally beginning!After all these days of waiting, and all that they had sacrificed, it was here! The day they had been waiting for was here!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He recalled that the large eagle was known as a Divine Wind Eagle, specially bred by the Jin Long Wei.These Divine Wind Eagles were fed with fierce beast meat from a young age, and possessed a very high intelligence, and due to their speed and agility, they were able to fly in the vast wilderness.Previously, when the Jin Long Wei made the maps, they had already indicated all the locations of the small tribes. Now, the members of the Jin Long Wei had sent the eagles to all the small tribes to convey the news about the Kingdom\u2019s selection!This large row of text was left burning in the sky for an hour before it slowly dissipated.In the back mountain of the Lian tribal clan, Yi Yun was leaning on a large rock looking at the words while munching on a blade of grass.\u201cTen people\u2026decided by the tribe!\u201d Yi Yun began to ruminate over the meaning of the words. Obviously the Jin Long Wei were planning to hold the warrior selection in the Tao tribal clan. For such a small clan like the Lian tribal clan with only ten places, the process would be simpler if the tribe chose the ten people themselves!\u201cChosen by the tribe? Heh!\u201d Yi Yun sneered for it was obvious that the ten places would be taken up by Lian Chengyu and the rest of the most reliable members of the warrior preparation camp. As for Yi Yun, he was considered a \u2018dead person\u2019 in the tribe. No matter what selection method was used, Yi Yun would not be chosen.Yi Yun spit the blade of grass in his mouth and a thought came to him, \u201cThree days later at noon\u2026I\u2019ll get my spot by myself!\u201d\u2026At the same time in the Lian tribal clan\u2019s courtyard, snowflakes were slowly falling. Lian Chengyu was lying on a soft animal skin by a fire, as he squinted at the large words in the sky.Ever since he failed to break through to the Purple Blood realm, Lian Chengyu had been lying in bed for several days. His face had been pale, and was lacking in blood all those days. It gave of the feeling of a weak scholar.Because he was physically weak, he had been lying on a chair piled with soft animal skin. He was carried around in and out of the house, and was served by maidservants everywhere.At this time, Lian Chengyu was surrounded by four maidservants who were awaiting orders. They were about seventeen years old. They were either holding a plate of dried cured meat, fruit or a pan of charcoal.The day was cold and the four maidservants had been standing in the snow for four hours.They were far from the fire, so they could not enjoy its warmth. Their faces, ears and hands were all red from the cold. Because of the snow, their linen shoes were wet trapping their numbed feet in a ice cavern-like environment.But still they stood their tall and straight without moving. They held the items in their hands properly, even though their arms had long turned numb.A few maidservants bit on their lips as they were almost about to faint. They desperately held on because they knew if they moved, their outcome would be miserable!All these days, they had been waiting on the sickly looking Lian Chengyu, and he was prone to mood swings, making him very terrifying!Three days ago, a maidservant beside Lian Chengyu had accidentally spilled the porridge on the animal skin rug when she was bringing the porridge over. As a result, Lian Chengyu broke her four limbs and tied her in the firewood chamber for two days and two nights without providing food and drink.That maidservant was probably almost dead by now.But no one dared to give her a glancing look, nor did anyone dare to give her anything to eat or drink.In the past when Lian Chengyu beat or scolded people, he would not go as far as taking their lives, but now, in the eyes of these maidservants, Lian Chengyu had become an evil beast. The most terrifying thing was that his face showed no trace of killing intent before he killed.He could be laughing one second, and in the next second he would pull out a knife to stab you blind, cut your tongue and crucify you before placing you into an urn.\u201cChengyu, the examination will begin in three days!\u201d At this time, a person had walked into the courtyard. It was a middle-aged man dressed in green.In the entire Lian tribal clan, there were only few who could address Lian Chengyu as \u201cChengyu\u201d. It was mostly the elders of the Lian tribal clan, as for the only qualified outsider, it had to be the warrior preparation camp\u2019s instructor, Yao Yuan.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d Lian Chengyu answered weakly. He had never expected that he would be in such a state.With the desolate bone essence failing to work and his failure of breaking through to the Purple Blood realm, Lian Chengyu had received too great a shock!He had accumulated all of his home\u2019s assets, spent all his fortune, and burned down bridges just for that one bet, but when the time came, it was relentlessly destroyed.His seventeen year life had practiced martial arts for a decade for that one dream, and just as he made the final step towards success with the Kingdom\u2019s selection, he had completely failed!The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. It was evidenced by Lian Chengyu\u2019s angry vomiting of fresh blood at the altar.\u201cChengyu, you had been triggered by anger, causing you to injure your meridians. This is not a light injury and will need plenty of rest.\u201d During this period, you must not use martial arts, nor should you circulate your body\u2019s energy. It\u2019s best you do not even move, or there might be permanent damage.\u201d Yao Yuan said that as he glanced thoughtfully at the four maidservants by Lian Chengyu\u2019s side.Lian Chengyu wrapped his body within the animal skin rug and said, \u201cI got it. Instructor Yao, look at my body, do you think I\u2019ll be completely fine when the selection begins?\u201dYao Yuan answered, \u201cYou have already recovered plenty. You should be fine in another four to five days. The Jin Long Wei will escort you to the Tao tribal clan, and settle you in. They will have to prepare the examination area, which will take a day or two. By the time of the examination, you would have recovered to your prime condition.\u201d\u201cAlright, that\u2019s good.\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s voice was very calm but when he spoke, his eyes flashed with a cold glare that would palpitate one\u2019s heart!It was a combination of venom, loath and hate towards the world.It was hard to tell what the impact of the failure to breakthrough to the Purple Blood realm had done to Lian Chengyu\u2019s psyche.He seemed to hate everything around him.Why did I have to go through all these tribulations, and cross this bumpy road?Why did Heaven steal my last chip?If there was a Heaven, I curse you to oblivion! If there was a God, I curse you to be struck by lightning!Seeing Lian Chengyu\u2019s demeanor, Yao Yuan did not know what to say. He just comforted him, \u201cChengyu, don\u2019t lose heart. You may have failed to breakthrough into the Purple Blood realm, but you still have a high chance of passing the Kingdom\u2019s selection. The Kingdom\u2019s selection is mainly to see your potential, not how high your current cultivation is.\u201dHe did not purposely hide his words from the maidservants, for these four maidservants knew better than to go around gossiping.\u201cYes, I know. Instructor Yao, I will have to trouble you to choose nine people from the warrior preparation camp. At that time, they will accompany me to the Tao tribal clan.\u201dEven after hearing Yao Yuan\u2019s consoling words, Lian Chengyu was still not in high spirits. He had not only planned to pass the Kingdom\u2019s selection, but he planned to shock and awe, gaining the attention of the Jin Long Wei\u2019s high brass, allowing him to be knighted as a \u201cKingdom Knight\u201d, or even become a Jin Long Wei Hundred Household or Thousand Household.But now, it was no longer guaranteed that he would pass the selection. It was impossible for him to make progress in a short time.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 - Nine spotsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 71: Nine spotsThe way to choose the remaining nine was to have a fighting match!It was a fair, simple and direct method.In all these years, the Lian tribal clan had led an unexciting life, for all they did were search for food. This fighting match was a rare event!How could the villagers miss it?So, on the day the fighting match began, all the villagers that could come, came. They were there to see the men from the warrior preparation camp fight.With tough and boring lives, the villagers were extremely excited to be able to watch the lively fighting match. Among them, the children were the most happy, even more so when bacon was given out.The fighting match was scheduled to happen late in the morning and held in the square in front of the Lian tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch compound. But, even before daybreak, the fighting grounds were already filled with people looking for a good spot.Children were riding on their fathers\u2019 necks, and with a favorable spot faced the stage.Many children were about the same age as Yi Yun, and wouldn\u2019t be considered young. How often would you see such old children ride on their father\u2019s neck? They would have been mocked, but today, no one could care less.The children were rubbing their fists and knuckles, hoping they could have been the ones fighting on stage. This fighting stage was extremely stimulating for them.They had always dreamed to become a member of the warrior preparation camp. It was so prestigious!The crowd grew bigger. Even the trees, houses, and roofs were packed with people.In this world, most people\u2019s eyesight were good, so they could clearly see everything that happened on-stage from afar.Late in the morning, the members of the warrior preparation camp appeared. They were all wearing a warrior uniform, something they seldom wore. So the green clothes they wore looked new. Although, it wasn\u2019t much better than the linen clothes Yi Yun wore, it was pretty impressive in the eyes of the people of the Lian tribal clan!One by one, the high spirited members of the warrior preparation camp entered. When they surveyed the surroundings, they felt that they had proven their value in life today. They had been training all those years just for today.\u201cIt feels great! Today I\u2019ll be able to show my face!\u201d thought a short man of about twenty years old. His face was radiant with vigor.By his side was a perverted comrade. He glanced at the girls surrounding them as if stripping them off their clothes saying, \u201cThis time I\u2019ll show my prowess, letting all the bitches in this village see, see how much vitality I have. In the future, when I shake my pinky, all these girls would be running to me.\u201dLife was tough in the village, so besides eating, men had only one other primal pleasure. As the old Chinese saying goes, \u201cFood and sex!\u201dThe basic human nature comprised of the need to eat and the need to have s*x. These were natural instincts animals had when they came into this world.For today\u2019s fighting match, the men from the warrior preparation camp had specially slaughtered two dogs.They had planned to celebrate after the match by eating meat and drinking alcohol.These two dogs were the hunting dogs reared by the village. But it\u2019s alright, the Kingdom\u2019s selection was soon. They would be leading good lives soon, what use was there for a hunting dog?\u201cLook, it\u2019s Young master Lian!\u201d With the loud shout, a sudden uproar emerged from the crowd. Everyone looked over and indeed, out from the Patriarch\u2019s compound came two men carrying a rattan chair.Lian Chengyu was sitting on that rattan chair with a animal skin rug draped over him. His eyes were squinted as if he was asleep.Behind him were the four maidservants. In their hands were the stove and a fruit plate. They looked like they were being extremely careful.\u201cYoung master Lian, it\u2019s really Young master Lian!\u201d The villagers immediately became excited; ever since Lian Chengyu had \u201cbroken through\u201d to the Purple Blood realm, his prestige in the Lian tribal clan had reached unimaginable heights.Everyone had placed their hopes into Lian Chengyu leading them into the city to lead a better life. It could be said that Lian Chengyu was now the spiritual pillar of support of the Lian tribal clan!The people began to fervently worship Lian Chengyu, as he was now the absolute king in the tribe. Anything he did would obtain the unconditional support of the Lian tribal clan. Whoever he wanted dead, a word without reason was sufficient to make the people be his murdering tool. Whichever girl he wanted, with a word, the people would wash her clean and deliver her to Lian Chengyu\u2019s bed.For the past few days, Lian Chengyu had been a recluse, preventing the people from seeing him. How could they not be excited when they finally saw him?Many seventeen year old girls were flushed with excitement. It was indeed true that the girls of the vast wilderness worshiped the strong, but compared to a rough, dark-skinned man like Zhao Tiezhu, a pretty boy was much better.In the hearts of the girls of the wilderness, the most ideal match would be someone like Lian Chengyu who was both strong and extremely handsome.These few days, Lian Chengyu had already became the dream lover of many girls in the Lian tribal clan.\u201cBegin.\u201d Lian Chengyu said lightly. He clearly did not care whatever happened on-stage. What a joke, it was the brutes from the warrior preparation camp. To him, they were all a bunch of straw bags. Even if they trained for another hundred years, they would not even be able to touch the Jin Long Wei\u2019s gates!It was clear to the the people that he was haughty and that he even had a faint disdainful look. But to the group of girls, it made him even more charming, making them worship Lian Chengyu even more.They all flocked to this grand match, yet Young master Lian could not even be bothered with it. This was the difference in outlook.\u201cRound, start!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu shouted at the top of his lungs. Ever since he got closer to Lian Chengyu, he was the unspoken leader of the warrior preparation camp.In the past few days, he had enjoyed the benefits of the Lian Clan Herb Mountain because he had managed to get the herbs that Lian Chengyu rejected. This caused Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s strength to increase a lot.In a situation with scarce resources, whichever member of the warrior preparation camp had the most resources, they could cultivate the fastest!Because he was afraid the others would be jealous, he had secretly used the drugs. He had also hid from others that his strength had increased by leaps and bounds.Even Zhao Tiezhu did not know how much his strength had increased. He wanted to test it out on stage, for it was a place that gave Zhao Tiezhu the chance to flex his muscles!\u201cHehe, after hiding it for so long, when I go on stage, I\u2019ll amaze the world with a single brilliant feat!\u201d After having a significant increase in strength, Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s ambitions had grown. He had already planned to be the number one henchman of Lian Chengyu, and no one was to vie with him.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 - The pinnacle of Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s lifePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 72: The pinnacle of Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s lifeTranslator:CKtalonEditor:CKtalonMatches in the vast wilderness did not have many rules. The way it proceeded was simple; a person will stay on the stage and he would be attacked by others in a duel fashion. Whoever had the capability, could go up.Eventually when no one went up on stage, then the person standing in the arena would win a spot. He would then be able to take a wooden board that symbolized his victory.Such a system might sound chaotic, where it was possible for two similarly-matched warriors to engage in a brutal match, or by tag-teaming, causing the warrior who was hoarding the stage to run out of energy. However, the people of the warrior preparation camp did not bother to think too deeply into that. Simple and rough was their style.Originally, neither Yao Yuan nor Lian Chengyu could be bothered with this meaningless matches. Yao Yuan had given Zhao Tiezhu the authority to decide on the rules, but for a boor like Zhao Tiezhu, was it possible for him to come up with reasonable and fair rules? If the rules were too complicated, the people competing wouldn\u2019t understand.When the match began, Zhao Tiezhu was first on the stage!He was unable to reel in his patience, for he had waited long for this opportunity where he could display his hidden strength.The arena was a hundred feet wide. Zhao Tiezhu stood in the middle of the arena and began making poses to showcase his muscles, \u201cCome! Who wants to spar with me?\u201dZhao Tiezhu began shouting. Likewise, the onlookers began shouting too.They did not expect that it would begin with an expert duel. Zhao Tiezhu was famous, together with his high profile way of doing things, everyone knew that Zhao Tiezhu was one of the top ten experts in the warrior preparation camp.\u201cHehe, Brother Zhao, I\u2019ll spar with you!\u201d A strong man jumped into the arena. His surname was Sun and he was of average strength in the warrior preparation camp. He was not Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s match, but he was on good terms with Zhao Tiezhu. He was a pal who could share in the meat with Zhao Tiezhu on the occasional successful hunt.He could tell that Zhao Tiezhu wanted to parade himself, so he had gone on stage to complement him.The people of the warrior preparation camp had trained together for a long period, so all of them knew each other\u2019s standing. They knew that Sun knew he would not be within the top nine spots, so he might as well give Zhao Tiezhu a favor.\u201cHaha, good, Brother Sun, come on!\u201d Sun and Zhao Tiezhu both had aggressive attitudes. In the arena of the vast wilderness, there was no messy etiquette. The match began once you came into the arena!Since everyone was watching, the both of them fought with their best.The members of the warrior preparation camp indeed had large strength. As for fighting skills and techniques, then that was too much. Their sparring was similar to a Hong Kong action film, where the motions were slow, punches always landed and out of nowhere, they would grab each other in a twist.Sun was not Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s match even before his power had increased. Hence, in a few rounds, Zhao Tiezhu had grabbed his waist, pinning him down in the arena.The two had fought without any style for as they fought, they realized all the fist techniques and stances they had learned before were not easy to use. In the end, grabbing each other and rolling on the ground was most pragmatic!Whoever had the greater strength won.This was also the logic of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. In the popular mixed-martial arts competitions like the UFC in America, the person who was able to twist the arm or crush the other party\u2019s neck would obtain victory, albeit the awkward looking moves.\u201cGood!\u201d The audience shouted. Although Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s movements were not elegant, it was a great pleasure in the eyes of the Lian tribal clan clansmen. They were easily excited just seeing wrestling.After Sun, another person went up on stage to spar with Zhao Tiezhu but he had also lost to him.After two matches, Zhao Tiezhu status was even better for the more he fought, the more courage he gained.\u201cHaha, who else is coming up?\u201d shouted Zhao Tiezhu glowing. It was as if he had drunk a jar of rice wine.The people could tell that Zhao Tiezhu would obtain one of those warrior spots today.A man jumped up the stage and said with a low muffled voice, \u201cBrother Zhao, let me have a shot with you.\u201dWhen this person went on-stage, it immediately drew cheers.\u201cIt\u2019s Zhang Dali! Zhang Dali was naturally born strong. At fifteen, he could lift a 100-kilogram rock weight. It\u2019s unknown how strong Zhang Dali is now!\u201dIn the Lian tribal clan, the names of the leading members of the warrior preparation camp were also widely known.When Zhang Da Li could lift 100 kilograms of rock weights at fifteen, he had become famous in the Lian tribal clan.There was a high chance Zhang Dali would be among the nine selected ones.With Zhang Dali and Zhao Tiezhu, this match of strong versus the strong caused the crowd to erupt.\u201cDali, haha, good! I\u2019ve long wanted to spar with you, come!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu eyes lit up. A year ago, he was weaker than Zhang Dali by a bit, but this year he had a substantial change in his strength. He had been yearning to find a strong opponent to test his strength out!Zhang Dali leaped onto the stage and was separated from Zhao Tiezhu by thirty feet. Without any etiquette, they rushed towards each other with a roar.Both men were stout, so it was as if two bulls were charging towards each other.\u201cPeng!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu and Zhang Dali collided into each other without any gaudy display. People could hear the sounds of flesh and bone colliding, scaring them white.Such a collision if it directed onto their bodies would have broken their bones.The battle between Zhao Tiezhu and Zhang Dali was obviously much more aggressive than Sun\u2019s battle from before.Both men\u2019s strength measured about 350 kilograms, more than twice a tier-one male. Such a disparity in strength ensured that even if a dozen tier-one men attacked Zhao Tiezhu, he would still be able to easily down them.\u201cTiezhu well played!\u201d In the crowd, Lian Cuihua was shouting at the top of her voice. As she had recently been roped in by Lian Chengyu to do some \u201cjob\u201d, she had been close with Zhao Tiezhu, and soon they were an item.Thinking of the Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s vigorous prowess from the previous night, Lian Cuihua could not help feeling a lustful desire.Hearing the people cheer and with Lian Cuihua\u2019s support, Zhao Tiezhu seemed to gain some inexplicable strength and began lashing out a storm. But, Dali did not wish to be outdone; with his huge strength, he still had a big advantage.The essence of a typical fight among the members of warrior preparation camp was a battle of strength. This was also why lifting stone rollers was their leading performance and the way to gain bragging rights.After wrestling on the ground for a long time, Zhao Tiezhu finally managed to suppress Zhang Dali. He was held down and could no longer move.The main reason why Zhao Tiezhu was able to suppress Zhang Dali was due to him eating lots of herbs causing his fitness to increase along with prolonged stamina.He had won this match due to his stamina!Zhang Dali had been suppressed till he was a bit asphyxiated. He did not understand how Zhao Tiezhu was able to be like a tireless bull, how did he have an unexpendable amount of energy?It has to be said that although the average member of the warrior preparation camp had great strength, their arms would still be sore after lifting a 250-kilogram stone roller eight times. It was not easy to be like Zhao Tiezhu, who become stronger the more he fought.Zhang Dali gasped for air as he asked, \u201cYou\u2026you can\u2019t have broken through to the Vigor realm, have you?\u201d\u201cHahaha, almost!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu began to brag. Most of the members of the preparation camp were in the Valiant realm, and Zhao Tiezhu was far from the Vigor realm. How could it be easy to be at the stage of Breathes in like a Snake, Out like an Arrow?Zhao Tiezhu had just a bit more endurance, but if he stayed in a poor place like the Lian tribal clan, he most likely would never be able to break through to the Vigor realm.The surrounding commoners knew what the Vigor realm meant. After all, the kingdom\u2019s selection had been known for a long time, and Lian Chengyu had long announced what was the Purple Blood realm.Under the false information by the ruling class of the Lian tribal clan, the people had all believed that Lian Chengyu had entered the Purple Blood realm. To the ignorant commoners, they felt that the Purple Blood realm was as powerful as a deity in Heaven.If Zhao Tiezhu was said to be a bull, then Lian Chengyu was a terrifying desolate beast. The gap between them was heaven and earth.The more they felt Lian Chengyu\u2019s strength, the more hope they had that Lian Chengyu would bring them into the city. At the same time, they felt that by following Lian Chengyu, it would be an honor to become a servant under him. In this chaotic world, people did not think about freedom. To those who could not fill their stomachs, freedom was an extravagance and a joke. All they wanted was to follow a good master and to be satisfied with a meal.\u201cHahaha!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu broke into a laughter. He was very pleased with the present scene. He also knew that there was no way he would be able to pass the kingdom\u2019s selection but to be able to show off, Zhao Tiezhu felt like he had reached the pinnacle of his life.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How can I win against you? Just now the punch you sent out had a ring in your joints. Isn\u2019t that the Thunder something, and bow shooting down flock realm or something?\u201dAll kind of methods of kissing ass was used by this young warrior by the name of Dongzi. He understood that to survive in the warrior preparation camp, he had to grab on to someone great, so that when the meat was handed out, he would receive more.\u201cHahaha! It\u2019s \u2018Thunder in the nine clouds, Surprise Bow Drops Flock!\u2019. This phrase had taken a long while for Zhao Tiezhu to memorize before he could spout the mouthful.He was still a light-years away from that realm, but looking at Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s expression, it was as if he had already reached that state.Noticing that no one in the audience was willing to face him, Zhao Tiezhu felt there was no need staying pretentious and said loudly, \u201cif no one is coming up on stage, then I\u2019ll gladly accept this spot!\u201dOriginally, Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s rules were like so, if no one dared to face the person in the arena, then that person would take a spot away. This was how the nine spots were chosen.No one had any disagreements because they were convinced of Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s strength.\u201cIs there anyone in disagreement?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu deliberately slowed down the speed at which he collected the wooden tablet. It was akin to the feeling of an auctioneer counting down in order to tease for higher bids.To Zhao Tiezhu, this was just another of his pretentious acts, but no one expected that, just as he asked that question, a voice came from the crowd, \u201cYou sure are detestable, why can\u2019t you just take the wooden tablet? Do you need to act in that infuriating manner, asking people to go against you? If so, then I\u2019ll fulfill your wish and go against you.\u201d\u201cWho? Who?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu was just about to finish his perfect act, but someone had actually jumped up to oppose him!And in between those lines, he had accused him as being detestable!?That\u2019s right, everyone could tell that Zhao Tiezhu was just putting on a pretentious act. He had used it to announce to the entire Lian tribal clan that he was the strongest in the warrior preparation camp, but who dare to speak out?\u201cWhoever who said that, come out here. I want to see who is sick of living!\u201dZhao Tiezhu had already considered the Lian tribal clan as his, if Lian Chengyu was a tiger, then he was the jackal henchman of Lian Chengyu. How could he tolerate being hit in the face in his own territory?But, if someone were to step forward now, he could set an example, establishing his authority!He had decided that he would kill the person who had caused trouble in front of everybody!In the lawless vast wilderness, there was nothing wrong with the strong killing the weak; furthermore, it was in the arena, thus making it even more justified.Thinking of this, Zhao Tiezhu swept through the crowd with his bloodthirsty eyes.Zhao Tiezhu was looking for the person who had said those words, but the person was hidden within the sea of people and not coming forward.After about the time taken for ten breaths, someone had pushed through the crowd to the forefront of the stage.The people gave way as they saw a small-sized kid walk out to the front of the stage, and leisurely climb up the stage.This small-sized kid only reached Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s chest and was dressed in rough linen clothes. His clothes were clean but tattered, with several large patches.Seeing this body size and posture, question marks filled the brains of the crowd. Was this child the person who called out?The people had originally thought that the person who called out was some warrior with a lot of confidence in his strength, and he was most likely a member of the warrior preparation camp, but unexpectedly, it was a child! Does he not want to live?It was no wonder he could not be seen earlier, because he was short and was hidden below the crowd!\u201cYou\u2026how could you\u2026\u201d Zhao Tiezhu was shocked at the child in front of him, \u201cYi Yun!? You aren\u2019t dead?\u201dYi Yun\u2019s back was originally facing the people, so many had not noticed. Now, they could see clearly that the person on stage was none other than Yi Yun.\u201cBrother Yi Yun! It\u2019s really brother Yi Yun!\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s neighbour Aunt Wang and her daughter Zhou Xiaoke were in the audience. Zhou Xiaoke, having seen Yi Yun alive, was pleasantly surprised, but seeing the immediate scene, she worried for Yi Yun.At this time, Zhou Xiaoke grabbed Aunt Wang\u2019s rough hands tightly with her heart in her mouth.\u201cKiddo Yun is still alive, but why would he go up the stage now to antagonize this dangerous person?\u201dAunt Wang was worried as she did not know what Yi Yun was doing.And at this time, Yi Yun who was standing on stage, slowly turned his body towards the animal skin chair in the Lian tribal clan\u2019s courtyard, where a frail Lian Chengyu was sitting!The other party\u2019s eyes were like bullets shooting at him!Lian Chengyu was motionless in his seat, yet the four maidservants around him could not help but shiver.They could feel that Lian Chengyu had suddenly turned into a ferocious beast!How many times was it? Yes\u2026, it was the third time!Lian Chengyu placed the teacup in his hand down, and carried on staring at Yi Yun.The first time, Yi Yun was resurrected after falling down while picking herbs.The second time, Yi Yun had escaped after being attacked secretly by Lian Chengyu.The third time, after being poisoned by both the desolate bone\u2019s frost toxin and the Blood Thinning Pill, and bleeding from his seven orifices and falling down a big cliff, he still survived.Lian Chengyu\u2019s eyelids began to jump. The way he looked at Yi Yun was like a poisonous snake looking at its prey with traces of ruthlessness and greed.\u201cHis body has a secret!\u201d Lian Chengyu believed that Yi Yun had a treasure that protected his life. Although he did not know what the treasure was, it was of no matter, because the treasure would soon be his.After killing Yi Yun, he would obtain the treasure. He could then slowly examine it and eventually figure out its usage.When he thought of this, Lian Chengyu slowly regained his composure.His expression was calm on the surface, but within his body was excited and hot blood. He gently licked his lips, flashing eyes that thirsted for blood.Good! Very good! The Heavens are finally fair to me for once!The Heavens may not have given me a glorious family background, nor had it given me the resources needed for practicing martial arts, and it had even cut me off just as I was about to break through into the Purple Blood realm!But today, you have given me a chance, sending this treasure that can protect one\u2019s life right to me.As the ancient saying goes: if you do not grab an opportunity presented to you, harm will fall unto you!If I were to ignore the object that the Heavens give me, it will invite future disaster. I, Lian Chengyu is not sure a stupid person.Surprisingly, this kid named Yi Yun as a starving little slave can have such a blessed live\u2014no, it should be said that I have a blessed life. By killing him, I\u2019ll get the treasure. Whoever had the treasure in hand, whoever had the blessed life!Many thoughts flashed within Lian Chengyu\u2019s mind. A grinning Zhao Tiezhu had already began walking towards Yi Yun without any orders from Lian Chengyu.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 - Brutally Attacking Zhao TiezhuPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: Brutally Attacking Zhao TiezhuTranslator:CKtalonEditor:CKtalon\u201cThose words were from you?\u201d Zhao Tiezhu sneered. He was curious why Yi Yun had not died after falling down a cliff that was tens of meters high. He did not believe anyone could be that lucky and had used some trick to give the men refining the desolate bone a false impression.Zhao Tiezhu had originally thought that a warrior with some means had challenged him, so he could use overwhelming strength to kill the other. But unexpectedly, what faced him was this useless little monkey, Yi Yun.With this, he was unable to show off. How could killing a little monkey that only reached his chest be show worthy?What Zhao Tiezhu was thinking was the method to which he could use to kill Yi Yun, one that would make Yi Yun most uncomfortable and afraid.\u201cOf course it was me. Wasn\u2019t what you just said nonsense?\u201d Yi Yun held his arms behind him with an expression that was clear. Did you need to ask such a retarded question?\u201cAh!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu looked at Yi Yun as if he was a retard. He could not understand if Yi Yun had crushed his brain in the door, for Yi Yun should have been envisioning the fate that awaited him. \u201cLittle bastard, to offend me today, you are dead meat. Obediently kneel down and kowtow to me a hundred times, before burrowing under my crotch. Do you want to do it yourself, or should I make you do so?\u201dZhao Tiezhu grinned while Yi Yun looked at him as if he was retarded, \u201cI\u2019m here today to get a spot, not to listen to your nonsense.\u201dWith those words, the entire audience were stunned.The people realized that by going up on stage, Yi Yun was not purposely antagonizing or making Zhao Tiezhu unhappy, but to fight a match to obtain a participation spot for the kingdom\u2019s selection!Heavens, with his size, is he crazy?He had just trained for a month, and was just slightly older than twelve years of age, how was he to compete with Zhao Tiezhu?\u201cBrother Yi Yun\u2026\u201d In the crowd, Zhou Xiaoke was having a heart-wrenching moment. Did Brother Yi Yun know how strong Zhao Tiezhu was?To the people of the Lian tribal clan, the members of the warrior preparation camp were like a group of tigers. No ordinary person was their match, what more a kid like Yi Yun.\u201cHahaha!\u201d Zhao Tiezhu convulsed with laughter as if this was the funniest joke he had ever heard in his life. \u201cLittle bastard, have you gone mad? Don\u2019t tell me that you believe you can defeat me after learning some skill from Lord Zhang, so that you can represent the Lian tribal clan at the kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201dAs Zhao Tiezhu said those words, the members of the warrior preparation camp roared with laughter.\u201cBrother Zhao cut the crap with this kid. He\u2019s nothing. Just because he\u2019s one lucky fuck to get chosen by Lord Zhang, he thinks he\u2019s invincible!\u201dMany people echoed this. At that moment, a mean female voice sounded, \u201cBrother Tiezhu, break the kid\u2019s legs and hang him up!\u201dThe person was none other than Lian Cuihua. How could Yi Yun forget her shrill voice?The person who led the villagers to besiege Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s house with cow dung was this Lian Cuihua.Yi Yun sneered and took a deep glance at Lian Cuihua.\u201cWhat the f**k are you looking at, you little bastard? Do you think you can afford to look at me? Look anymore, and I\u2019ll dig out both your despicable eyes!\u201d Lian Cuihua was domineering as she said, \u201cBrother Tiezhu, slaughter the little bastard!\u201dAs she said that, Lian Cuihua even sent a flirtatious glance at Zhao Tiezhu.Zhao Tiezhu was obviously empowered by that flirtatious glance and laughed heartily. \u201cKid, I guess you have not recovered from your sickness. Your mind still isn\u2019t straight. A little slave like you who can\u2019t even find food in the mud plains wants to join the kingdom\u2019s selection? Today I\u2019ll take off your head to be used as a urinal!\u201dWith that, Zhao Tiezhu charged at Yi Yun.His face showed a facetious expression as he stretched out the two steel-like arms of his to grab Yi Yun\u2019s head. He was not just saying, and was really planning to twist Yi Yun\u2019s head off!Zhao Tiezhu had great strength, so how could a normal kid withstand his grab?Yi Yun stayed motionless and with a firm stance stretched both his arms to grab Zhao Tiezhu. It was the same move as Zhao Tiezhu!Yi Yun\u2019s hands were totally out of proportion compared to Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s large hands.Seeing the idiot Yi Yun to dare stretch his hands out, Zhao Tiezhu grinned and grabbed towards Yi Yun\u2019s hands. He had changed his mind. He wanted to crush Yi Yun\u2019s hands!The four limbs clashed and a snapping sound rang!Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s face froze!His lips twitched as he looked unbelievably at Yi Yun\u2019s hands and his. His two large hands within Yi Yun\u2019s small hands had been mangled. Fresh blood trickled down without pause. Besides his thumb, all his other eight fingers were twisted in weird angles and completely broken.His hands had been brutally crushed by Yi Yun!Ah!A loud heart-wrenching scream came out of Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s mouth!Yi Yun looked coldly at Zhao Tiezhu, \u201cWho did you say was the slave? In this world, the weak are enslaved as slaves, the strong are regarded as lords. Whoever was stronger could dominate everything. I\u2019ll tell you who the slave is today.\u201dAfter saying that, Yi Yun took a step forward and a simple knee struck Zhao Tiezhu in the chest.\u201cPeng\u201dWith a thud, Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s burly body flew up like a torn sack with Yi Yun\u2019s knee strike. His sternum bent inwards, with an unknown number of broken ribs.He fell heavily to the ground, with blood seeping out from his mouth. His body was twitching with a broken spine.This sudden scene shocked everyone present.Their expressions had been from seconds past, completely frozen.What\u2026was this?Yi Yun had crushed Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s hands and sent him flying with a knee!Yi Yun\u2019s small and thin body and Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s burly body were in sharp contrast, giving an extremely strong visual impact!Was this a dream?Lian Chengyu, who had been sitting in his animal skin chair all along, suddenly stood up and stared at Yi Yun with a pair of shining eyes.Yi Yun, a herb picking slave who did not normally have food to eat was no different from a beggar. Such a person would be no cause for concern in the Lian tribal clan.But, he was able to maim Zhao Tiezhu in a brief moment!Where did his martial arts come from?Could it be that after practicing martial arts with Zhang Yuxian, he was able to grasp martial arts in a month\u2019s time, allowing him to beat Zhao Tiezhu?How could this be possible!?Lian Chengyu clenched his fists so tightly his nails pierced his palms.The audience were silent. For a long moment, no one uttered a sound, as they had yet to come round.Even Zhou Xiaoke, who had been worried for Yi Yun, stared at him with her two large dark eyes. She was totally stunned, is this real? That devilish-looking, tower-like Zhao Tiezhu had been defeated by Brother Yi Yun!Yi Yun returned to his normal stance and casually straightened the tattered clothes he wore.This was Yi Yun\u2019s first act of violence.Previously, Yi Yun\u2019s punches would land on boulders. They were extremely hard, causing pain to his fists. But today, it landed on a human\u2019s body, all he felt was a hardness after softness. Having maimed a person directly, Yi Yun did not find it unacceptable. He had already grown accustomed to the new survival rules of this world ever since he crossed into this wild world.He knew clearly that if he were a compassionate person or a monk who did not have blood-stained hands, he would be taken advantage off.Yi Yun gently moved his ten fingers before turning his head towards Lian Cuihua.\u201cYou previously said that you would break my legs and hang me up? And to dig out my eyes?\u201d Saying this, Yi Yun slowly walked towards Lian Cuihua.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - Dog\u2019s Blood over FacePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75: Dog\u2019s Blood over Face\u201cWhat\u2026What do you want to do?\u201d Seeing Yi Yun walk over, Lian Cuihua screamed. \u201cYou little bastard, you contracted the plague, do you plan to spread it to the people?\u201d Lian Cuihua was not someone to be trifled with. Seeing Yi Yun suddenly becoming so terrifying, she quickly thought of Yi Yun contracting the plague, and began shouting, hoping to be reinforced by the crowd.\u201cMy fellow folks, this little bastard must have been possessed after he died, or he would not be so powerful. Have you forgotten he was possessed? Right!\u201d Lian Cuihua suddenly thought of something and quickly squeezed through the crowd.\u201cMove away, move the f**k away!\u201dRunning out, and when she returned, she had a wooden bucket in her hand.Looking at Yi Yun, an insidious smile flashed across her face.\u201cLittle bastard, you can be so smug because I let you be. Just because you were possessed by those filthy things, it makes you invincible? See how I kill you!\u201d Saying that, Lian Cuihua splashed the contents in the wooden bucket at Yi Yun!Inside the wooden bucket was blood-red liquid, and a stench emanated from it.It was dog\u2019s blood!Before the match, the members of the warrior preparation camp had slaughtered two hunting dogs, and had prepared to have a feast after the match.After slaughtering the hunting dogs, the blood was stored in the wooden bucket. In it floated the dog\u2019s\u2019 intestines, fur, heart and lungs. And all these were thrown towards Yi Yun!The people of the Cloud Wilderness believed that dog blood was capable of exorcism.The filthy spirits could not be stand the sight of the dog\u2019s blood, and if splattered with dog\u2019s blood, would melt away.A Chinese phrase \u201cdog\u2019s blood over face\u201d had that meaning. Cursing a person to the point of \u201cdog\u2019s blood over face\u201d was the same as a possessed person with dog blood over them. It meant they would stay immobile and remain speechless.Lian Cuihua genuinely believed that Yi Yun had been possessed to be able to maim Zhao Tiezhu, so as long as the dog\u2019s\u2019 blood covered him, the evil spirits would burn away, leaving a small chicken-like Yi Yun, who would be helpless against her.Lian Cuihua was dying to chop off Yi Yun\u2019s limbs and hook him up to burn. As long as she accused him as being possessed, it was easy to encourage the people to burn him at the stake.The people exclaimed seeing the bucket of blood spilled.At this moment, Yi Yun\u2019s eyes flashed a murderous intent.For a woman like Lian Cuihua who did not know any martial arts, Yi Yun would not have bothered with her, but she had previously attacked Jiang Xiaorou.Furthermore, he now knew how vicious this women was.Some people were venomous to the bone. These kinds of people did harm to the world, whether they knew martial arts or not, whether they were a woman or not.\u201cPeng!\u201dA loud explosive crack sounded. Without seeing Yi Yun move, the bucket of dogs\u2019 blood had already exploded right in front of Yi Yun\u2019s eyes!Although the blood splattered everywhere, not one drop landed on Yi Yun\u2019 body.On the other hand, Lian Cuihua was covered with the dogs\u2019 blood!\u201cAh!\u201dLian Cuihua shrieked. Her hair was gone and she kept screaming, \u201cYou monster, you little beast, you bastard! Ke Ke Ke\u2026\u201dLian Cuihua was unable to say anymore because Yi Yun had her by the neck!Lian Cuihua\u2019s tongue hung out, and her eyes went white as her limbs twitched.\u201cSave\u2026save me\u2026\u201d The urge to survival empowered Lian Cuihua to barely say those words.At this time, the surrounding people had frightenedly backed away.They did not dare to attack Yi Yun. The commoners of the vast wilderness were the type that bullied the weak and feared the strong, and had a strong inclination of servility. In front of an expert, they would unconsciously obey, while in front of a weakling, they will display their foul abusive side, turning into monsters. This was depicted by their attack on Jiang Xiaorou.Lian Cuihua was finally afraid. As she looked at Yi Yun, her eyes were filled with fear.She still did not understand how Yi Yun had suddenly become this strong. It seemed like he had not been possessed\u2026because a possessed person would not be able to avoid the dog\u2019s\u2019 blood. A possessed person seeing dog blood was akin to a mouse, frozen stiff from seeing a cat.\u201cYou\u2026You want to\u2026beat a woman? Ke Ke\u2026Ke Ke\u2026\u201d Lian Cuihua found it hard to open her mouth, as her voice trembled.Yi Yun laughed, \u201cI have never hit a woman.\u201dSaying that, Yi Yun loosened his grip slightly.Lian Cuihua was able to breath a sigh of relief and managed to muster some courage, \u201cQuickly let me go, and ask for forgiveness from Young master Lian, he might still let you go. You may have turned strong, but can you beat Young master Lian?\u201dLian Chengyu was a god to the Lian tribal clan.He had absolute authority!These days, under the propaganda from Lian Chengyu, the people knew that about the various stages before the Purple Blood realm; in the past Lian Chengyu was at the peak of the fifth level of Mortal Blood, and Zhao Tiezhu was at the first level of Mortal Blood, and the gap between the two was like heaven and earth.Although Lian Cuihua was afraid of Yi Yun, she recalled that she had been of service to Lian Chengyu, so with him backing her, would she need to be afraid of the little punk?If Lian Chengyu made a move, he would easily crush Yi Yun.Thinking of this, Lian Cuihua became braver. She felt that Yi Yun letting her go was a display of him wising up.\u201cGo kneel before Young master Lian to admit your mistakes or he will tear off your skin. Do you think are so powerful just because you had defeated that loser, Zhao Tiezhu? Zhao Tiezhu compared to Young master Lian is like a worm. And you are just a slightly bigger worm!\u201dLian Cuihua shouted, thinking she could frighten Yi Yun. However, she genuinely believed all that she said, for Lian Chengyu as a Purple Blood realm warrior has unfathomable strength!As for the loser, Zhao Tiezhu who couldn\u2019t beat a child, he might as well die. Lian Cuihua would not reminiscence old times with a cripple.Hearing Lian Cuihua\u2019s threats, Yi Yun simply laughed and gave her a slap without warning.\u201cPa!\u201dWith that, Lian Cuihua\u2019s body flew from Yi Yun\u2019s slap.She tumbled three and half times mid-air before landing on the ground heavily, with the heaven and earth revolving around her!Lian Cuihua was stunned from her beating. Blood spit out from her mouth, like a trampled fish.Lian Cuihua struggled a bit and with her shaking hand touched her left cheek. She found her left cheek completely deformed, a bloody mess!She felt something in her mouth, and with a spit, out came more than ten blood-stained teeth.The left side of her teeth had been knocked out by Yi Yun!\u201cUh\u2026Uh\u2026\u201d Lian Cuihua looked at Yi Yun wanting to say something. But her tongue was destroyed and her face deformed; she could not say a single word. Even when looking at Yi Yun, her eyes would lose focus if her pupils were to dilate.She moved her lips with great difficulty, making out a distorted sound. This sound had longed changed. But Yi Yun could still understand. If he guessed correctly, Lian Cuihua had questioned him having never beaten a woman before.\u201cDid I say so?\u201d Yi Yun countered. Lian Cuihua barely blinked her eyes.Yi Yun rubbed his hands and said, \u201cOh\u2026What I said was in the past, in the future, I won\u2019t do so anymore. People who deserve a beating will receive one.\u201dIt was alright if Lian Cuihua had scolded Yi Yun, but she should have never bullied Jiang Xiaorou.Yi Yun found it hard to imagine how Jiang Xiaorou managed to survive the day when she received the news of his disappearance and the cow dung besiegement by the group.In this strange world, Jiang Xiaorou was his closest relative. He did now allow anyone to hurt her.Just as Yi Yun finished his words, Lian Cuihua spewed a mouthful of blood and passed out.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - The Desolate Bones are Poisonous!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76: The Desolate Bone was Poisonous!Translator:CKtalonEditor:CKtalonNo one had expected the arena contest to have such a turn of events\u2014Yi Yun\u2019s sudden appearance, the maiming of Zhao Tiezhu and the beating up of Lian Cuihua.In the vast wilderness, medical procedures were extremely backward. 99% of such injuries would lead to infection, and without antibiotics, the moment they became infected, they would have no chance of surviving.Even if he survived, Zhao Tiezhu had been crippled off his ability to practice martial arts or work; even getting down from the bed would be a problem.As for Lian Cuihua, she was disfigured. Of course, to Yi Yun, Lian Cuihua\u2019s looks before being disfigured was terrible. But without her half her set of teeth, Lian Cuihua would have trouble eating grain or vegetables. In the vast wilderness, unless someone gave her something to eat, she would most likely starve to death without anyone taking care of her.Be it Zhao Tiezhu or Lian Cuihua, the future that awaited them would be a tragic ending.After Yi Yun maimed Zhao Tiezhu and Lian Cuihua, there was total silence.Previously, the family members of those who had been infected with the \u201cplague\u201d hated Yi Yun to the bone, but now they were scared stiff.Yi Yun noticed these people and even recognized them as the children who had attacked Jiang Xiaorou a few days ago.One of the woman\u2019s facial expression changed. She immediately shielded her child and said with a trembling voice, \u201cBack then\u2026Back then it was instigated\u2026instigated by Lian Cuihua to burn your house\u2026\u201dMany of the people in the Lian tribal clan knew that with Yi Yun returning strong as ever, he would definitely settle the issue of the burning of his house and the besiegement of Jiang Xiaorou.Yi Yun took a few steps forward.The woman\u2019s face turned even whiter, \u201cThrowing\u2026Throwing the cow dung was instigated by Lian Cuihua. We\u2026We\u2026\u201dThe children who had thrown the cow dung were about Yi Yun\u2019s age, and some of them even looked stronger than Yi Yun. Typically, the child would not notice a child like Yi Yun, but today, he was scared stiff.\u201cYou really think that your men got infected with the plague because of me?\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s words were injected with Yuan Qi, so it could be heard a few kilometers away. This made everyone hear it clearly.Everyone was stunned. This was news released by the upper echelon of the Lian tribal clan, how could it be wrong?Also, they could not comprehend something; Yi Yun had been infected with the plague. He was possessed and he fell down a cliff dozens of meters high, how could he not die?Also, how was it possible for him to beat Zhao Tiezhu?Even till now, many villagers could not believe that Yi Yun had maimed Zhao Tiezhu in two moves. They knew Yi Yun had practiced martial arts with Zhang Yuxian.But he had only practiced it for a month, how could he be stronger than Zhao Tiezhu who had been practicing for decades?\u201cOur\u2026Our men\u2026what\u2026is it?\u201d The woman asked with a shiver and at this point, Yi Yun could see by the side of his eyes that Lian Chengyu had already stood up. Both his eyes were like a venomous snake staring at him.Coldness, killing intent and greed!All the properties a snake would possess were contained within!Yi Yun knew that Lian Chengyu was threatening him. But he met Lian Chengyu\u2019s gaze and said without fear, \u201cThe desolate bone was poisonous. Your men died because of the desolate bone refinement. It has nothing to do with me!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s voice was transmitted far, and everyone heard it crystal clear.In a moment, the villagers exploded!The desolate bone was poisonous!?Our men died from refining the desolate bone!?The villagers were at a loss and began to flurriedly discuss.Today, if it was a weak Yi Yun who said it, no one would have believed him. On the contrary, they would burn him at the stake, in the name of exorcising the evil spirits.But now, Yi Yun had a formidable power backing him. What he said might sound crazy and incomprehensible, but some people would subconsciously believe in it.This was what strength could bring!A person\u2019s strength not only determined their position or dignity, it also affected the words they said.An expert\u2019s words were as good as gold, and each word had its oomph.A weakling\u2019s words were the same as the sounds of farts, no one would care about it!The present Yi Yun was relying on his strength to stand in the arena, or as a twelve-year-old child, how was he to show his might?Lian Chengyu sneered and remained quiet. At that moment, a yellow-robed elder stood up.\u201cEmpty words!\u201dThe elder with a harsh voice was naturally the Patriarch of the Lian tribal clan.\u201cYou kid, how dare you instigate the masses with your wagging lies? The desolate bone was bought using all our savings, and with the help of our tribe, we managed to refine it successfully after weeks! How could it be poisonous!?\u201d\u201cThis desolate bone essence has been eaten by Chengyu; if it was poisonous, the first person to be poisoned would be Chengyu!\u201dThe Patriarch remained extremely dignified. He had gained an air of authority after being in charge of the Lian tribal clan for all these years.Even though Yi Yun had the strength, whatever Yi Yun said would not have the weight compared to the Patriarch.Besides, the Patriarch\u2019s words were very reasonable.The desolate bone was bought by the tribe at great expense to be refined for Lian Chengyu. If it had poison, it would have been equivalent to the tribe spending a great deal just to harm Lian Chengyu?\u201cThe Patriarch is right! My fellow folks, don\u2019t believe the kid\u2019s words!\u201d\u201cHow can you trust the words of a twelve-year-old child?\u201dIn the crowd, several people shouted. These people were the people who had Lian as their surname. They had mutual interests as the Lian tribal clan\u2019s upper echelon, and some of them were similar to Lian Cuihua. They were the eyes on the ground for the Lian tribal clan upper echelon, responsible for whistleblowing and the spreading of rumors. By doing so, the upper echelon would give them extra food.Seeing some of the villagers having doubts, these people said, \u201cYou think that little monkey is strong? Compared to Young Master Lian, he\u2019s nothing!\u201d\u201cSo what if he beat Zhao Tiezhu, Zhao Tiezhu is just like us, normal mortals. As for Young Master Lian, he has already reached the Purple Blood realm. Do you even know what the Purple Blood realm is? Lord Zhang that previously came to our village was also in the Purple Blood realm, and he was almost the same as a god in the sky!\u201dBack then everyone knew that Zhang Yuxian rode a behemoth, and he had brought down a large tree with a simple chop. The power of the Purple Blood realm was terrifying. In comparison, beating Zhao Tiezhu in wrestling was nothing.\u201cYi Yun may seem strong to us, but compared to Young Master Lian, he\u2019s nothing worth mentioning! Only Young Master Lian can lead us to a good life. It can\u2019t be that you choose to believe this kid over Young Master Lian!\u201dPeople began to shout once again.It had to be said that having ruled the Lian tribal clan for so long, the ruling class was deep-rooted. For Yi Yun to say a few words to affect their standing would be very hard; furthermore, Yi Yun had no proof.Also, the entire tribe\u2019s efforts had been invested in Lian Chengyu, and Lian Chengyu had \u201cnot failed to disappoint the masses\u201d. He had \u201cmade greater breakthroughs\u201d in his strength, and had \u201cachieved\u201d the Purple Blood realm.With all their hopes on Lian Chengyu to change their lives, how could they stop believing Lian Chengyu and instead believe a twelve-year-old childlike Yi Yun?It was the same even if Yi Yun defeated Zhao Tiezhu!Yi Yun had already expected this and it did not matter to him. He did not hope to overturn Lian Chengyu with just words; he simply wanted to plant a seed of doubt within the people.The vast wilderness was a world where power ruled supreme. Ever since time immemorial, it has been so!Would a victor need to provide proof? It was superfluous because the strongest victor\u2019s words were the rules, the law, and the truth.Experts did not need more words to explain themselves. Others would subconsciously believe in it and eventually really believe in it.By making his appearance today, Yi Yun was already mentally prepared to have a direct conflict with Lian Chengyu.He knew that Lian Chengyu would not break through to the Purple Blood realm with that energy-less desolate bone \u201cessence\u201d.Lian Chengyu was at the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm, while he was in the beginning stages of the Qi Gatherer realm, but at the same time had reached the realm of Dragon Pulse.He was confident of this battle!However, Yi Yun was still worried about Yao Yuan. He did not know Yao Yuan\u2019s strength.He waited for Lian Chengyu to make his move, and at the same time secretly observed Yao Yuan.But surprisingly, Lian Chengyu had no plans to make any moves and was just looking at him with a dark look!Today, Lian Chengyu would not be making any moves!Yao Yuan had already warned him that he had hurt his heart due to the anger he experienced.If he ignored his injuries and made a move, it was possible, but he would never recover to his peak at the kingdom\u2019s selection in a few days!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was his life\u2019s top priority! With no room for failure!\u201cInstructor Yao, what do you think of his strength? Thunderous? Meridians?\u201dTo be able to easily cripple Zhao Tiezhu, and even crush his fist, Lian Chengyu was sure that Yi Yun was above the third realm of Mortal Blood and his strength was above a thousand pounds. Lian Chengyu was not sure, however, if Yi Yun had opened his Ren Du Er Mai.Yao Yuan said, \u201cWe have all underestimated Yi Yun. I\u2019m not sure of his strength, but one thing I know is that his intelligence and thinking far exceeds that of a twelve year old child. Whoever goes against him, if they treat him as a child, they will only lose badly.Yao Yuan\u2019s words subtly referred to Lian Chengyu. Lian Chengyu had difficulty dealing with this for he had never imagined that the day would come when he would be compared to a child.But he had to admit that in the past few clashes with Yi Yun, he had been played by him!\u201cThis kid has been playing the sucker. He knew all along that I had intentions of killing him, but he pretended to not know, making me careless! At such a young age, how could he be so scheming?\u201d Lian Chengyu was in disbelief, Yi Yun was a problem!\u201cInstructor Yao, my body is not in the condition to do anything today, could Instructor Yao catch this little bastard for me?\u201d Yao Yuan turned silent upon Lian Chengyu\u2019s request.Yao Yuan had also guessed that Yi Yun must have met with some fortuitous event, such as eating some treasure while picking herbs, allowing him to have a rapid increase in strength.This was the only explanation, and with this, it was reasonable that he had survived the fall into the East River.As for this treasure, it had to be able to neutralize the Frost Python\u2019s toxins, so it could be said that the treasure was more valuable than the Frost Python desolate bones.But what could they do?The treasure had already been eaten by Yi Yun. To extract it out would be difficult. Even if it were to be extracted, Yao Yuan did not have any coveted thoughts about it, since he had been wounded by an enemy, cutting off his meridians, preventing him from proceeding further along the martial path.Yao Yuan\u2019s status was simply a long term guest in the Lian tribal clan, and not Lian Chengyu\u2019s henchman.Yao Yuan said, \u201cChengyu, years ago, I owed your dead grandfather a favor, promising him that I would protect the Lian tribal clan, and teach you martial arts, but I never said I would help you kill, nor did I say I would aid you in your evil ways. I knew about your refining of the desolate bones, but I didn\u2019t butt in, because I know this world is one where the strong preys on the weak. Sacrificing the weak to gain achievements is still understandable. But to want me to attack a child, a child who has a talent for martial arts, because you are jealous? I cannot agree because of this reason.\u201d\u201cAlthough you will not listen, but I will give you a word of advice either way. You have to be broad-minded. If you want your life to be good, you will need to have some tolerance. If you are too ruthless and extremely self-centered, and intolerant with others, sooner or later, it will destroy you.\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s words made Lian Chengyu frown. Since ancient times, good advice is a shock to the ear; as for Yao Yuan\u2019s words, Lian Chengyu had already found them shocking to his ears.\u201cInstructor Yao, what is the meaning of this? All these years, I have honored you as a teacher, but today, you are helping an outsider?\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s words were filled with anger.Yao Yuan shook his head, \u201cAll these years, I\u2019ve seen you grow up. I know all about your thoughts, I just do not want to see you committing mistakes one after another.\u201d\u201cBesides, although it is hard for anyone below the Purple Blood realm to match my strength, I have no confidence in capturing Yi Yun!\u201d Yao Yuan\u2019s words surprised Lian Chengyu.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Was Instructor Yao admitting that this kid had the ability to match Instructor Yao? If so, wouldn\u2019t he at least be in the Qi Gatherer realm, similar to me? \u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d Lian Chengyu found it preposterous. No matter what lucky event Yi Yun had encountered, he could not have such a high cultivation speed.\u201cI also think it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Yao Yuan sighed. \u201cBut did you not consider that with this child\u2019s intelligence, and his level of cultivation, he wouldn\u2019t know the differences in the realms below Purple Blood? Your cultivation level and mine aren\u2019t a secret, yet he still dared to appear here. This proves that he has the confidence to confront you, and the ability to escape without any injuries.\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s words provoked Lian Chengyu and he rebuked, \u201cIf Instructor Yao were to give it a shot, he would not be able to escape without any injuries!\u201dYao Yuan said, \u201cI have similar thoughts. I too feel that he should have died after being poisoned by the desolate bones\u2019s frost toxin and falling down into the East River, yet he still came back to life.\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s words made Lian Chengyu speechless.Indeed, he had believed that Yi Yun should have died, but today, he was standing in front of him. He even maimed Zhao Tiezhu!This was no doubt a public slap to his face.Yao Yuan said, \u201cHis strength might be in the Thunderous or Meridians realm, but he might also have some method to preserve his life, like a treasure that will protect him.\u201d\u201cA twelve year old child with such mental capabilities and strength, if you were to make him your enemy, unless you killed him, he will no doubt seek revenge on you in the future.\u201d Originally, Yao Yuan had wished to prevent Lian Chengyu from sinking any deeper. But now if he failed to kill Yi Yun, he would have to take on the risk of a revengeful Yi Yun; this gave Yao Yuan less reason to attack Yi Yun.\u201cI got it.\u201d Lian Chengyu took a deep breath. His expression was horribly gloomy. Because of Yao Yuan\u2019s refusal, he now held a grudge!With Yao Yuan not making any moves, and him unable to make any moves, the only person who could rival Yi Yun was his grandfather, the Lian tribal clan Patriarch.To have the Patriarch attack a kid under the watchful eyes of this many people was inappropriate.The fact was that Lian Chengyu could not guarantee that his grandfather would be able to handle Yi Yun. This was because the Patriarch was old and feeble. In the Mortal Blood realm, people used their muscles and body to fight, so age would severely affect their battle strength. The older they got, the worse it became.Although the Patriarch was in the fifth stage of Mortal Blood, the Qi Gatherer realm, his frail body would make it difficult to even fight a fourth stage Mortal Blood warrior. Besides, Yao Yuan had said that Yi Yun might have some hidden card.After considering all the possible outcomes, Lian Chengyu realized he was in an extremely awkward situation.He had been smacked in the face by Yi Yun publicly, yet he could do nothing to him!At least, not before he recovered his strength!\u201cDamn, if I were not injured, I would rip that little bastard\u2019s skin off!\u201d Lian Chengyu was pissed. He had never thought that the day would come when he could not do anything to a person he treated as an ant days before!Yao Yuan stayed silent, while everyone present was looking at Lian Chengyu.Lian Chengyu needed a way to get out of the predicament!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - PedestalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: PedestalLian Chengyu looked at Yi Yun with a scathing look.\u201cI just need a few days to recover and when that happens, I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ll get revenge for what happened today! I want to let you know what it means to lead a living death!\u201dIf he had been overwhelmed by an expert, it would be no matter. But now, a person who seemed weaker than him was provoking him and undermining his authority; yet because of his injuries, he could not do anything about it. How could he not be angry?\u201cYi Yun!\u201d Lian Chengyu said with reluctance. However, Lian Chengyu knew that he could not do anything. If he fought with Yi Yun, even if he won, it would affect his chances at the Kingdom\u2019s selection that was days away, and that was not a price he was willing to pay.\u201cMy Lian tribal clan has suffered for hundreds of years in the Cloud Wilderness. Our ancestors ate grass roots and tree barks as they slowly developed our clan into what we are today.\u201d\u201cFinally, in my generation, I have practiced martial arts for a decade and never slacked off in my cultivation, even during the famine years. The only reason was to bring the Lian tribal clan out of the wilderness and into the city, letting the tribe prosper!\u201d\u201cBut now\u2026 Just as I have invested all of my assets into saving the tribe, you come out here to spread rumors, to bewitch the people and falsely accuse me. Do you want the people of the Lian tribal clan to live forever in misery?\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s words were spat right back at Yi Yun, creating a public debate.Lian Chengyu and Yi Yun stuck to their own arguments.Yi Yun said that Lian Chengyu had refined desolate bones that contained toxins, causing the deaths of the people, while Lian Chengyu said Yi Yun was framing him! Both sides were diametrically opposed to each other!However, in this debate, the people undoubtedly believed in Lian Chengyu; after all, Lian Chengyu had extremely high standing in the Lian tribal clan, while Yi Yun was just a child.Hearing the speech, Yi Yun could guess the sentiments of the tribe members, and could not help recall a fable from Earth.During the primitive periods, a group of cavemen worshipped a shadow. The shadow could grow bigger and smaller. It looked like a god, so the cavemen would worship the shadow every day.However, a clever caveman did not believe in \u2018god\u2019. With great effort, he managed to climb to the top of the cave one day. He then realized that the god the people worshipped was just the shadow of a rock being cast by the sunlight.The clever caveman told his tribe the truth, he did not want them to worship the shadow, because it was just the shadow of a rock and not a god.In the end, no one believed the clever caveman, but they became scared. The clever caveman was eventually burned at the stake because of his blasphemy against the god. After that, the cavemen carried on worshipping the rock\u2019s shadow.Yi Yun felt that his current situation was exactly that of the fable.He was the clever caveman, while Lian Chengyu was the shadow.The current Lian Chengyu who was trying to save the tribe, had cut all the roads of retreat and had managed to \u201csuccessfully break through\u201d into the Purple Blood realm, was a god in the Lian tribal clan!Everyone, be it the Lian tribal clan upper echelon, the members of the warrior preparation camp or the commoners, had all placed their hopes on Lian Chengyu, hoping he will bring change into the tribe, leading them out of poverty and hunger.People who lived in hardship would tend to be religious. They needed an emotional support, allowing them to escape from reality and believe in a brighter future. Only then, would they have the courage to keep living.As for Lian Chengyu, he had undoubtedly taken that spot. He was the tribe\u2019s leader, and an idol for many youths in the tribe. He was the perfect dream lover in all the girls\u2019 hearts.As long as Lian Chengyu passed the Kingdom\u2019s selection, he would be the savior of the Lian tribal clan!As for Yi Yun, he was just a twelve year old child. He didn\u2019t have much prestige or authority, so it was difficult for him to topple Lian Chengyu.Besides, Yi Yun had no evidence. Even if he did, it was likely that no one would believe in him because if Lian Chengyu was toppled, it was tantamount to shattering the poor people\u2019s spiritual hope, telling them that they would forever live in darkness. Who would allow that?If Yi Yun hadn\u2019t maimed Zhao Tiezhu, and used his strength to stand his ground, he would have been burnt at the stake by the angry crowd like the clever caveman.Seeing that the people were clearly on his side, Lian Chengyu was pleased. The only thing that annoyed him was that, even with the support of the people, he still could do nothing to Yi Yun.\u201cYi Yun, I acknowledge you as a genius, and you have acceptable talent for martial arts. It was probably some fortuitous event that allowed you to get to this stage!\u201dLian Chengyu emphasized the word fortuitous, because he was extremely jealous of Yi Yun. What gave Yi Yun the right to have a fortuitous event, but not him?Although he was jealous, Lian Chengyu had to act as though having a fortuitous event to obtain increased strength was not showing one\u2019s true strength. It meant that only by taking a short cut could you reach this stage, but I had worked hard using my own strength to obtain it.Lian Chengyu\u2019s meaning was quickly understood by his henchmen. They said, \u201cNo wonder. This kid could beat Zhao Tiezhu, it\u2019s because he took a shortcut!\u201d\u201cHe may have eaten some treasure, but I heard that with these treasures, although it can quickly increase your strength, your fundamentals will be shaky, and you will eventually meet a bottleneck. It\u2019s like pulling up a seedling in the mistaken hope of helping it grow!\u201dThe henchmen gave a look of understanding, of course their boss was the strongest, and as for Yi Yun\u2019s strength, it was just short-lived. Besides, Yi Yun wasn\u2019t that strong, he had only defeated Zhao Tiezhu, and that didn\u2019t count for anything.The crowd was swayed as they felt the reasoning of these henchmen reasonable. This was the only way they could understand how Yi Yun\u2019s strength had increased by leaps and bounds.Lian Chengyu carried on, \u201cTo be able to reach this stage, it was not easy indeed. I\u2019ll pardon you, so you should join hands with me, to work hard together to make the Lian tribal clan prosper!\u201dLian Chengyu said it with dignity.Lian Chengyu\u2019s henchmen and the idolising fans in the crowd began to cheer.\u201cYoung master Lian understands the principles of right and wrong and the tribe is really fortunate to have him!\u201d Some people clapped and shouted with joy.\u201cYoung master Lian is so magnanimous, Yi Yun discredited Young master Lian, but yet Young master Lian didn\u2019t blame him, he even wanted to put Yi Yun in an important position. If Yi Yun knew any better, he should assist Young master Lian.\u201dThe talk on the ground was easily swayed, what\u2019s more, the words of the henchmen were totally reasonable.After all, Lian Chengyu had broken into the Purple Blood realm, so passing the Kingdom\u2019s selection was a sure thing.As for Yi Yun, although his talent seemed good, he had not practiced martial arts for long and obtained such strength from a fortuitous event. He was roughly at the third state of Mortal Blood, so it was unlikely he would pass even if he participated in the Kingdom\u2019s selection.In the future when Yi Yun grew up, if he was willing to help Lian Chengyu, he would be a great help to Lian Chengyu, allowing the Lian tribal clan to take off.These were the thoughts of the majority, however, Lian Chengyu and Yi Yun had no such thoughts\u2026\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Arrival of the Selection\u2019s AmbassadorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: Arrival of the Selection\u2019s AmbassadorYi Yun ignored the comments of tribe members and Lian Chengyu\u2019s henchmen. He was surprised that Lian Chengyu didn\u2019t make a move against him to right the malicious slander against himself. What could be the reason?Yi Yun noticed that Lian Chengyu was pale. Could he have experienced a Kundalini crisis, which had hurt him?But even if Lian Chengyu did not make a move, there was still Yao Yuan!Yi Yun did not know the reason why Lian Chengyu hadn\u2019t made a move, and he ignored the doubts of the people.In fact, it suited Yi Yun that Lian Chengyu didn\u2019t make a move today. His strength had grown exponentially in a short time, so in time, he would exceed Lian Chengyu. When the time to exchange blows came, there was no reason to fear Lian Chengyu, Yi Yun would, without any doubts, win. Even if Yao Yuan intervened, Yi Yun would have nothing to fear!Yi Yun\u2019s appearance today was simply to obtain a qualifying spot at the Kingdom\u2019s selection. It was sufficient enough to reach this goal.\u201cYoung master Lian, you said to join you to make the Lian tribal clan prosperous. If so, do you plan for me to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201d Yi Yun asked with a faint smile. Lian Chengyu frowned. He knew he had no reason nor did it make sense to publicly reject him. The Jin Long Wei would be here the next day, and Yi Yun had proven his strength in front of the tribe.The Jin Long Wei\u2019s purpose of holding the Kingdom\u2019s selection was to select the strong, whoever was strong or had potential would be recruited. They would definitely accept Yi Yun\u2019s participation, as all he had to do was display his strength in front of the Jin Long Wei\u2019s ambassadors. Lian Chengyu had no power to decide who was going to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection, because it wasn\u2019t organized by the Lian tribal clan.\u201cOf course! But Yi Yun, your cultivation period has been short. I\u2019m only letting you participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection so you can broaden your horizons. With that experience, it will help you in your future growth.\u201d\u201cYou might not know how difficult the Kingdom\u2019s selection is. In a region that spreads out a thousand miles, of all the tribes within this region, only twenty will be chosen! Among the twenty, about three-quarters of them will come from the Tao tribal clan, which is the biggest in these lands!\u201dThe Tao tribal clan had the people and the resources; Lian Chengyu\u2019s Frost Python desolate bones were obtained from the Tao tribal clan!Besides resources, the scholarship of the Tao tribal clan was outstanding. The elites of the younger generation from the Tao tribal clan were under the tutelage of Purple Blood warriors in the middle, late or even peak stages. They even had a heritage of cultivation techniques. How could a small tribe compete with the Tao tribal clan?Hence, with a quota of only twenty people, the spots left for the small tribes were just three or four! To choose three or four from dozens of small tribes was a pathetic ratio!Lian Chengyu carried on, \u201cThe Tao tribal clan is a behemoth, their population is hundreds of times bigger than our Lian tribal clan! Some of the young elites of the Tao tribal clan have even reached the Purple Blood realm! Especially the three young masters of the Tao tribe, they are even more famous! To compete with them, as a person born from a small tribe, is impossible. As for the Kingdom\u2019s selection, if you are not at the fifth stage of Mortal Blood\u2019s Qi Gatherer realm, you can forget about it.\u201dEven Lian Chengyu, who had failed to break through to the Purple Blood realm, was facing a lot of pressure.Mortal Blood was impossible to compete against Purple Blood. They could only compete with the people who were in the Mortal Blood realm. And just reaching the fifth stage of Mortal Blood was a mediocre entry ticket.\u201cWhen I pass the selection, I\u2019ll assist you. If you can achieve a lot, it will be a good thing for the tribe.\u201d Lian Chengyu said this extremely reluctantly. He naturally did not want Yi Yun to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection, because it meant that during the selection, there was no way he could attack Yi Yun.Also, Yi Yun\u2019s growth was too quick, even if Yi Yun had obtained his strength from some lucky object, his growth was so quick that it even worried Lian Chengyu. Lian Chengyu did not like things to be beyond his sphere of control. Lian Chengyu wanted to remove Yi Yun as soon as possible, especially when Yi Yun was in an unprepared state. Lian Chengyu was still worried about the item that was protecting Yi Yun\u2019s life.Killing Yi Yun meant that the treasure would belong to him!\u201cThen, I\u2019ll thank Young master Lian for his \u2018guidance\u2019!\u201d Yi Yun emphasized on the word \u2018guidance\u2019 with a thick hint of sarcasm.\u201cBut, Young master Lian, you don\u2019t look well. Are you not feeling well?\u201d Saying that, Yi Yun took a few steps forward.Lian Chengyu was alarmed. Yi Yun had suspected that he was injured!\u201cInstructor Yao!\u201d Lian Chengyu shouted angrily.Yao Yuan sighed and transmitted words into Yi Yun\u2019s ears silently, \u201cLittle brother, today I will not go against you. That\u2019s because I respect you as a young warrior, do you need to be so difficult?\u201dYao Yuan\u2019s words made Yi Yun stop. He didn\u2019t know how to transmit words silently, so he could only look at Yao Yuan and cup his fists.That was the reason why Yao Yuan didn\u2019t make any moves. Although Yao Yuan was one of the ruling class in the Lian tribal clan, he had a strong sense of chivalry, and didn\u2019t play a part in Lian Chengyu\u2019s vile actions.\u201cInstructor Yao is right, little me gives his thanks. Little me extremely admires Instructor Yao as a person. Little me will go ahead first. See you tomorrow at noon!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s words were polite to Yao Yuan. In fact, Yao Yuan was Yi Yun\u2019s first master. He had taught him the most basic cultivation technique \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, although Yi Yun had learnt it secretly.Yi Yun squeezed through the crowd and headed towards the Lian Clan Herb Mountain after saying those words.He was worried about Jiang Xiaorou\u2019s safety, so he didn\u2019t expose the treehouse\u2019s location. He planned to jump down from the chasm of the herb mountain into the East River and going with the flow down to the waterfalls. As such, no one would be able to guess where he stayed.\u2026The next morning, Yi Yun opened his eyes as he finished meditating.The day had finally arrived. Today, the Jin Long Wei ambassador would come to the Lian tribal clan to bring them to the Kingdom\u2019s selection!\u201cYun-er, just do your best, but don\u2019t insist on it. You are still young and have plenty of time ahead of you. Our days will become better and better, so don\u2019t do things out of spite, as for acting on impulse\u2026\u201d\u201cI got it Sis Xiaorou.\u201dKnowing it was the day of Yi Yun\u2019s departure, Jiang Xiaorou had been advising Yi Yun. Hearing these heartwarming words he said, \u201cSis Xiaorou, you have to be by yourself in these few days. I have prepared all the food for you. Don\u2019t wander around.\u201dYi Yun had guessed that he could not bring Jiang Xiaorou into this foray to the Tao tribal clan for the Kingdom\u2019s selection. He was just an unimportant candidate, and had to sit on one of the mounts the Jin Long Wei had. It was impossible for him to bring someone along.Thankfully the Lian tribal clan\u2019s back mountain was extremely broad. To hide Jiang Xiaorou was easy. Also Lian Chengyu would be leaving the Lian tribal clan to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection, so it eased Yi Yun\u2019s mind. As long as Jiang Xiaorou hid herself, the back mountain was very safe as there were no beasts there.Finally, as a last measure of protection, Yi Yun gave the protective charm old man Su had given him to Jiang Xiaorou. That yellow tattered pulp, that was comparable to toilet paper had been kept by Yi Yun all this while. The only hope he had was that old man Su was not pulling a prank on him.To pull a prank using a defensive item, that old fool would be extremely wicked.Yi Yun left. He was like an agile antelope, and moved towards the Lian tribal clan with great speed!When Yi Yun came to the Lian tribal clan, the entire top brass of the Lian tribal clan had came out to receive the Jin Long Wei ambassadors.The Jin Long Wei ambassador came punctually at noon.He was a large man with ashen black skin. Riding on a standard issue Jin Long Wei mount, he arrived at the Lian tribal clan with a commanding aura.\u201cWho will be participating in the Kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201dThis ambassador\u2019s words were short and sweet, with bold undertones.The ten people including Yi Yun and Lian Chengyu stepped forward.\u201cGet on!\u201d The ambassador waved his hands and cut to the chase. As such, the ten candidates mounted the ambassador\u2019s mount.Although the mount was tall, with ten people on it, it became extremely crowded. The Jin Long Wei ambassador sat on the spacious back of the beast, while the rest sat on the sides, practically shoulder to shoulder.Of course, Lian Chengyu was given more room by the other eight members of the warrior preparation camp. As henchmen, they needed to ensure their master was comfortable. That was the duty of a henchman.With limited space, and Lian Chengyu enjoying a large amount of room, Yi Yun naturally did not have much room. He was squeezed in the middle of two men, but Yi Yun was not bothered by it.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Triumphant return! Young master is sure to win! Triumphant return!\u201d The members of the warrior preparation camp began to shout their slogans once more.Hearing the chants, Yi Yun felt ashamed. He was speechless at the retardness of the warrior preparation camp\u2019s members.The people also began to shout a few words.\u201cYoung master Lian, the entire tribe are depending on you.\u201dThere were old men kowtowing on the ground. Also, the only witch in the village was dancing in her epileptic manner again.\u201cMy people, don\u2019t worry. I will not let you down.\u201d Lian Chengyu stood up from his spacious spot and clasped his hands, first to the left, then to the right, in an amiable manner.It had to be said that Lian Chengyu was charming, together with his long white robe, he looked extremely elegant. He had the bearing of a large tribe\u2019s young master. Combined with his self-confidence and friendliness, it was extremely charming to young girls.Many young girls in the tribe were awe-struck by Lian Chengyu. Blushing, they shouted, \u201cYoung master Lian, we will wait for your return!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, when I can enter the city to build my own ground, and establish my family clan, you can all accompany me, and become the first batch of citizens of my Lian family clan.\u201d Lian Chengyu\u2019s confidence words made the villagers flush from excitement, as if they had just drank a bottle of wine. As for those girls, they were red from dreaming of being a personal maidservant of Lian Chengyu, or even a servant in the bed.To be able to follow Young master Lian was a great joy.Many young girls had such thoughts as they were smitten. Yi Yun was apathetically watching by the side, for he knew he would not receive any sending offs. Suddenly, he heard a timid voice, \u201cBrother Yi..Yi Yun, you must work hard, Xiaoke\u2026Xiaoke will wait for your return\u2026\u201dHearing this voice, Yi Yun was stunned. He looked over and saw a little girl dressed in old clothes looking at him nervously. Those watery pair of eyes exuded a million words of meaning. She was Aunt Wang\u2019s Zhou Xiaoke.Among all the young girls sending off Lian Chengyu, to shout Yi Yun\u2019s name by herself took a lot of courage.\u201cXiaoke.\u201dYi Yun beckoned Xiaoke over. Seeing how this little girl\u2019s face glowed, he found her adorable. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll return safely.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Zhou Xiaoke nodded her head with force.\u201cKiddo Yun, it\u2019s alright if you don\u2019t pass the selection. Don\u2019t be discouraged for you are still young. You are just twelve!\u201dAunt Wang was shouting by the side too. As she shouted, she took out a vegetable dumpling from a basket, \u201cKiddo Yun, I made this vegetable dumpling. Have it along the road.\u201dSeeing the vegetable dumpling that was made with little grain, Yi Yun was touched. He came down from his seat and accepted the vegetable dumpling. In return, he stuffed a cloth bag into Aunt Wang\u2019s hands, \u201cAuntie, open it up only when you are back home.\u201dSaying that, Yi Yun did not wait for Aunt Wang\u2019s response before jumping back onto the behemoth\u2019s back. And at this time, the Jin Long Wei ambassador began to lead the beast forward.Seeing Yi Yun\u2019s figure grow smaller into the distance, Zhou Xiaoke continued to wave.A few women surnamed Lian looked disdainfully at Aunt Wang\u2019s family saying, \u201cYou sure have a good relationship with that kid!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business!\u201d puckered Zhou Xiaoke\u2019s small mouth.The women let out an unbridled laughter, \u201cThis little lass sure got smitten! That kid Yi Yun thinks he\u2019s one of the main participants, to think he followed Young master Lian to participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection. Did he even consider his own strength? Young master Lian is just too nice a person.\u201d\u201cSo what if he takes the kid with him? Young master Lian is just taking him to experience life, and use him for his own purposes. In the future, he will just be another henchman. Do you really think the kid will pass the selection?\u201d These Lian women completed each others\u2019 sentences with ease and delight.They were surnamed Lian, and was the part of the same family as Lian Chengyu, and had the same bloodline as the Lian tribal clan. As long as Lian Chengyu struck it big, they would receive great benefits.With the end of their suffering beckoning, how could they not be happy!As the Lian women ridiculed Zhou Xiaoke, Aunt Wang was shocked as she touched the cloth bag Yi Yun had passed to her.After freezing for a moment, she swallowed a mouthful of saliva before carefully putting the cloth bag away, keeping it close to her body.She ignored those mean women and quietly pulled Zhou Xiaoke home. Only after latching the door did Aunt Wang take the cloth bag out. She placed it carefully on the table in the main room.\u201cMom, what did Brother Yi Yun give?\u201d Zhou Xiaoke asked curiously.Aunt Wang\u2019s hand were trembling. At that moment when she touched the bag, there were many people, hence, she was afraid to open it up. But while holding it, she could feel the texture and smell the smell of something she thought that was impossible to get\u2026She took in a deep breath and unwrapped the cloth bag layer by layer\u2026Moments later, Zhou Xiaoke was stunned. As for Aunt Wang, even after being mentally prepared, her heart still skipped a few beats.What appeared in front of both of them was a roasted chicken. It was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. It was golden glazed and fragrant!\u201cThis\u2026 This is\u2026\u201d Zhou Xiaoke began to swallow mouthfuls of saliva. \u201cBrother Yi Yun gave this?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Kiddo Yun gave us this\u2026\u201d Aunt Wang was gawking at the chicken in disbelief. How did Yi Yun manage to get this roasted chicken? Also looking at this roasted chicken, it was cooked with exquisite culinary skills. The smell of the skin was familiar with Aunt Wang. It was honey, she had picked some in the back mountains by chance a long time ago!Honey roasted chicken, how did Kiddo Yun get this?Aunt Wang was in disbelief, but at this moment, Zhou Xiaoke\u2019s saliva was dripping down to the table. She eagerly looked at the roasted chicken asking, \u201cMom\u2026 Can I eat it?\u201dAunt Wang laughed and touched Zhou Xiaoke\u2019s head, \u201cKiddo Yun\u2019s chicken was given to you for eating.\u201dSaying that, Aunt Wang tore a chicken leg and stuffed it into Zhou Xiaoke\u2019s tiny hands, \u201cQuickly eat it. We can eat the rest when your dad returns.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Zhou Xiaoke hurriedly took a bite. The moment the chicken flesh entered her mouth, Zhou Xiaoke felt she was floating in the sky. The chicken flesh was too delicious. She had never eaten something so delicious in her life before\u2026Brother Yi Yun is so good.Thinking of this, Zhou Xiaoke\u2019s heart was filled with happiness.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yi Yun could only shake his head with regret. The people of the vast wilderness were easily cheated.They were simple but not kind, on the contrary, they exhibited all the evils and ugliness; maybe, that was human nature\u2026Yi Yun stopped thinking about it as he looked at the scenery hurling past him. Feeling the wind from the behemoths galloping forward, Yi Yun could not help but say, \u201cVast wilderness, here I come!\u201dThis was the first time that Yi Yun stepped out of the Lian tribal clan and into the large vast wilderness. He would learn what the real vast wilderness was like outside the Lian tribal clan\u2019s protection!The fast behemoth left a huge footprint with each step and could travel a few thousand kilometers each day. They felt violent tremors while sitting on the behemoth\u2019s back, so without a certain strength, it was unbearable. A person\u2019s bones could break just by sitting on it for a day.Even the warrior preparation camp\u2019s members were finding it hard to endure.As for Yi Yun, he was standing on the behemoth, holding onto the reins, and enjoying the scenery.As the behemoth ran out of the protective area of the Lian tribal clan, Yi Yun could finally see the real vast wilderness!The Cloud Wilderness was extremely vast, without any traces of humans. There were forests everywhere and the landscape looked primal.Actually, Yi Yun did not know if they were called forests. These forests were different from the primal forests on Earth.The primal forests on Earth were hot and humid, and the forest floors were covered with dead leaves and twigs. The forests were dense, and under the trees were shrubs. Such a forest would be extremely difficult for a person to walk through, what more a huge behemoth.But in the vast wilderness, the trees were far apart from each other, allowing the behemoth to run through the woods at full speed. The trees were ridiculously tall, reaching a hundred meters, or even hundreds of meters, to the point of exceeding the clouds!And such trees grew on the extremely barren land. Everywhere in the vast wilderness was boulders, hills, and deserts!There were even trees that rooted themselves into black ironstone!A huge boulder growing a divine tree that went up hundreds of meters was a grand sight!But this was not a rare sight because this was found everywhere! There was little soil in the vast wilderness and its surface was littered with rocks. 90% of the trees had no choice to but to grow in these rocks.These rocks were rough all around, and there were steep cliffs everywhere, making it hard for even monkeys to climb!The mountain peaks, protruded isolated peaks or the mountain ranges that were thousands of meters high, were considered short. It was common to see ten thousand meter tall mountains which had snow-covered peaks that never melted in thousands of years, making them as strong as steel!In between the mountain peaks, it was full of lofty cliffs that had bottomless canyons\u2026This was the vast wilderness which hid fearsome desolate beasts that could swallow a warrior in one gulp. Even without them or fierce beasts, any typical warrior would not be able to cross the vast wilderness because the path was too difficult to take.Climbing cliffs, leaping across chasms and facing the blizzards, avalanches and the invisible ice caverns on the tall mountains\u2026Even a Purple Blood warrior would find it difficult to get past these lands.The Jin Long Wei\u2019s behemoths were huge. They could easily run on such rugged paths as if they were plains. The behemoth followed a chasm path, which was the passage used to travel between the Tao tribal clan and Lian tribal clan.Halfway through the journey, the behemoth passed two large mountains, and Yi Yun finally saw the Tao tribal clan he had heard so much about.The buildings were lined up like fish scales. The streets were filled with people and they were lined with bustling stores.In the middle of the Tao tribal clan, there stood a tall building and a tower.In the Tao tribal clan, those who could stay in the tower were all Purple Blood warriors, for they were the protectors of the tribe.\u201cYou will stay here.\u201dThe Tao tribal clan had prepared accommodations for the participants from the small tribes.Around the Tao tribal clan was dozens of small tribes. Ten people came from each tribe, as for the Tao tribal clan, their young promising candidates numbered more than all the small tribes\u2019 participants put together. There were over a thousand people taking part in the selection.The prepared accommodations for the participants were divided into three large areas.It was obvious the construction quality differed greatly among the three areas. The first area was made up of individual small buildings. Each small building was exquisitely built. It resembled the villas from Yi Yun\u2019s previous life.The second area was made up of neat rows of large houses. Although less luxurious than the small buildings, they were still made with brick and looked extremely comfortable.Then there was the third area which was made up of makeshift wooden huts. The wooden huts were shaky and the furnishing was simple. There were only a table and four beds in each hut. With four to a room, it resembled the college dormitories from Yi Yun\u2019s past life.The first area was prepared for the offspring of the Tao tribal clan, where they could each enjoy a small building.The second area was prepared for leaders of the small tribal clans like Lian Chengyu. Each person stayed in one of those spacious tile-roofed houses.The third area had the most people and was the place where the \u201cfollowers\u201d like Yi Yun and the members of the warrior preparation camp would stay. Each leader of the small tribes would participate in the kingdom\u2019s selection, so they would bring their men along since there were ten spots.To others, these followers were not different from slaves. Although they too were here to participate in the kingdom\u2019s selection, the difference between slaves and their master were huge. How could they stay in the same place?In this different world, there was a rigid concept of hierarchy, which was similar to ancient China.When Yi Yun came to his own residence, he saw his three other roommates. They were about fourteen years old, not much older than him.They too wore linen clothes but the clothes looked new. They must have prepared new clothes for the kingdom\u2019s selection.In the vast wilderness, there were plenty of suffering people!\u201cTime to go out and see how the geniuses of the vast wilderness are like.\u201dWith this thought, Yi Yun left the wooden hut.The Tao tribal clan was large. This area was originally used to gather the tribe. For the Tai Ah Divine kingdom\u2019s selection, it was not a simple arena match for the examiners would set up all sorts of hurdles to test the participants on various aspects. As for the specific topic, it was still unknown.In front of the residential area, Yi Yun saw a familiar face: Lian Chengyu.But Lian Chengyu was together with several young elites. They surrounded a youth who had red lips and gleaming teeth. He was dressed in white and was about fourteen years old. He was fair-skinned and looked just like a girl. He was extraordinarily handsome.Lian Chengyu, who was always arrogant, displayed a humble smile on his face. He stood together with the young masters of the other tribes, discussing the kingdom\u2019s selection.\u201cLian Chengyu, the people you mentioned are not even worth mentioning.\u201d The fourteen-year-old child was extremely overbearing as he said, \u201cThis kingdom\u2019s selection has about a thousand participants, but in reality, about 90% of them are followers or slaves pulled here to fill the spots. Removing these slaves, how many are there left? If you wanted to count properly, there isn\u2019t more than a hundred people!\u201d\u201cThese hundred people would only seem strong to commoners, but to me, even the specially cultivated heir of a small tribe is nothing to me! As for you, you barely make it. This selection is actually pointless!\u201d The child who said those words was absolutely overbearing.Yi Yun was shocked upon hearing those words. Who the hell was that person?The person had even said those overbearing words loudly, making it be heard by people all around!A large number of them were also included in his reprobation. These people as described by the child were either slaves or poultry.\u201cF**k, who the hell is the kid?\u201dA large man could no longer hold it in and was about to rush to the youth in white to beat him up, but he was stopped by the people around him.\u201cDo you want to lose your life! He\u2019s the Tao tribal clan\u2019s third young master, Tao Yunxiao!\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 - He Really CamePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82: He Really Came\u201cWhat third young master?\u201d asked the man who was at a loss.\u201cYou don\u2019t know? He is the Tao tribal clan\u2019s third young master. An elite carefully nurtured by the Tao tribal clan! The first young master is eighteen years old, and his cultivation level has reached the middle stage of the Purple Blood realm. The second young master is sixteen and has just broken into the Purple Blood realm, as for the third young master, he\u2019s the youngest and just reached fourteen, but his cultivation level is already at the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm! Most people are saying that he will break through into the Purple Blood realm before fifteen years of age!Breaking into the Purple Blood realm at fifteen years of age?Hearing these words, everyone gasped. The angry man no longer dared to say anything. He was twenty-five, and just at the third stage of Mortal Blood, how could he go against him!Even Lian Chengyu could hardly keep up his facade after hearing Tao Yunxiao\u2019s arrogant words. His talent which he was proud of had been criticized with a \u201cbarely make it\u201d.F*ck, if not for the desolate bones refinement failure, I\u2019d be in the early stages of Purple Blood!From the Mortal Blood to the Purple Blood, the former was considered mortal, while the latter was considered to have exceeded mortality. It was two different concepts.If everything had went well, he would be in the early stages of the Purple Blood realm at seventeen. To be able to receive such results from a poor tribe would be something to be proud of. This Kingdom\u2019s selection would no longer be a question. Would he need to listen to this kid\u2019s bragging?Tao Yunxiao patted Lian Chengyu on the shoulders saying, \u201cI think you are smart. Follow me in the future. You must break into the Purple Blood realm early. To not have done so by seventeen, It\u2019s a bit slow\u2026\u201dTao Yunxiao touched a tender spot; although Lian Chengyu was extremely aggrieved, he could do nothing but say, \u201cThank you for your appreciation. I will definitely work harder and break through into the Purple realm soon.\u201dLian Chengyu still did not know the reason why he had failed to break through. The Frost Python desolate bones that was given to him by the Tao tribal clan did not have problems. The strong Frost toxins and the able-bodied men who fell sick after refining the bones made it clear. So what could be the problem?Lian Chengyu could never understand it, for he had never eaten a desolate bone essence before, nor did he know what would happen after eating a real desolate bone essence. He lacked experience, so it was not easy to tell what had went wrong.\u201cEh, this kid\u2026\u201d It happened that Tao Yunxiao noticed Yi Yun.As the children in the vast wilderness suffered from malnutrition, their body development was slower. because of this, Yi Yun\u2019s body was still extremely tiny, and he stood out in the crowd.Tao Yunxiao had originally believed that at the age of fourteen, he would be the youngest person to participate in this Kingdom\u2019s selection. Unexpectedly, he saw someone even younger in the square, so he paid special attention to Yi Yun.\u201cHe can participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection at such a young age?\u201d Tao Yunxiao frowned. He had wanted the honor of being the youngest participant in the Kingdom\u2019s selection. But from the looks of it, he had no chance to get that honor. At best, he would get the honor of the youngest chosen member of the Jin Long Wei.\u201cYoung master Yunxiao, that kid is called Yi Yun. He\u2019s from my Lian tribal clan and has some talent for martial arts. He was lucky and had some fortuitous event, giving him some strength. As Young master Yunxiao knows, our Lian tribal clan is lacking in resources and is unable to groom much talent, so I brought him here to experience the world.\u201d Lian Chengyu mentioned upon noticing Tao Yunxiao\u2019s gaze.\u201cI see.\u201d After listening to Lian Chengyu\u2019s explanation, Tao Yunxiao lost interest for this kid as he was not noteworthy.He wanted to pay attention to the true heroes of this era, and not the self-proclaimed elites of the vast wilderness.For example\u2026Tao Yunxiao turned his head and squinted at a tall tower in the distance.That tower was about two hundred feet tall with twelve stories. It was colored in dazzling purple gold.\u201cYoung master Yunxiao, what are you looking at?\u201d Lian Chengyu traced Tao Yunxiao\u2019s gaze and looked towards the tower. That tower looked especially special. \u201cWhat sort of person is on that tower?\u201d\u201cNo ordinary girl!\u201dLian Chengyu did not expect those words from Tao Yunxiao. Tao Yunxiao had enjoyed success from a young age, and grew up in an environment where he was treated as a star. He had never stepped out of the Tao tribal clan, and had never undergone tribulations, but he was regarded as one of the top prodigies of the Tao tribal clan. With such life experience, could he not be arrogant?Besides, he was a fourteen year old child and was at the age where he felt highly self-important and dreamed of being a hero.To say that the girl was no ordinary girl meant that she was extremely dazzling.\u201cIs she joining the Kingdom\u2019s selection too?\u201d Lian Chengyu asked. For such an extraordinary girl, he was naturally interested. If he could get to know her and win her favor, she would be able to greatly aid him in his journey.\u201cThe Kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201d sneered Tao Yunxiao, \u201cI already said she was no ordinary girl. What does it mean to be extraordinary? You have talent that makes people jealous of you, unfathomable strength, and a mysterious background that intimidates anyone! How could such a person participate in the Kingdom\u2019s selection? Even the Thousand Households of the Jin Long Wei has to be extremely polite to her. You think the Jin Long Wei dares to take her in even if she wants to join the Kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201dTao Yunxiao rebutted with a rhetorical question, shocking Lian Chengyu. Was it that exaggerating?To Lian Chengyu, the Jin Long Wei was already incredibly powerful; for such a powerful army, it\u2019s Thousand Households had to be respectful to this girl, then what sort of identity did she have?\u201cTsk!\u201d Tao Yunxiao showed some disdain upon seeing Lian Chengyu\u2019s dazed expression. \u201cSo what if she\u2019s of noble birth, it does not mean anything! There were many ancient emperors who were commoners before they eventually thrived! Today\u2019s Kingdom\u2019s selection is just my first step. In the future when my strength grows, I\u2019ll leave the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, and become famous all over the world. When that happens, I would be noticed by the power behind that extraordinary girl. Eventually she will be betrothed to me, then wedding her would be no wonder!\u201dTao Yunxiao expressed his monologue with confidence. Lian Chengyu was stunned. He had already believed his ambition was great, by being able to get a named rank in the Jin Long Wei, he would be knighted in the Kingdom, and thrive.But Tao Yunxiao was planning to leave the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. The huge Tai Ah Divine Kingdom could not hold him in!Whether it meant to be young and crazy, or that new born calves were not afraid of tigers, it was the best way to describe the fourteen year old Tao Yunxiao!Yi Yun had took this all in from the side. There was no such thing as the most arrogant, but only someone more arrogant. Tao Yunxiao, does your mother know about your arrogance?As for the extraordinary girl in the tower, the one that the Jin Long Wei\u2019s Thousand Households had to be respectful to\u2026Yi Yun squinted his eyes and looked towards the purple gold tower.And he did not know that at this moment, someone was looking right back at him from the tower.Lin Xintong was standing by the tower\u2019s window, and her eyes could distinguish Yi Yun through the crowds in the busy street.Her eyesight was extremely good, and even at such a distance, she was able to see Yi Yun\u2019s face clearly.\u201cMaster, he really came,\u201d Lin Xintong smiled. Old man Su had said that they would likely not meet Yi Yun again after going their separate ways at the Lian tribal clan\u2019s back mountain.But the youth had given Lin Xintong\u2019s Yin Meridians a magical feeling.Although it was like grasping at shadows, to think that that special feeling could heal her of her Yin meridians was a crazy thought. However, old man Su did not want to leave anything to chance, so he had stayed in the Tao tribal clan to wait for the kid to come knocking.A young child who reached the Meridians realm was definitely a first-rate genius in the vast wilderness. How could such a genius miss the Kingdom\u2019s selection?\u201cLet\u2019s see how this kid performs at the selection.\u201d\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 - Testing your Spirit!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: Testing your Spirit!A day later, all the participants from the small tribal clans within a thousand miles slowly arrived at the Tao tribal clan. After a night\u2019s rest, the Kingdom\u2019s selection was officially started!The selection\u2019s venue was a flat wasteland just outside the Tao tribal clan\u2019s city.This flat wasteland covered a large area. Its surface was littered with black ironstones, as if they were specially paved tiles.More than a thousand participants, who split up into their own tribal clans, lined up neatly on the wasteland.In the middle were the young elites of the Tao tribal clan. They numbered about six hundred people and had more participants than all the small tribes combined! Not only were they large in numbers, the quality of their cultivation was excellent. Even those who were pulled in to fill the numbers were stronger than the Lian Clan\u2019s warrior preparation camp members.Yi Yun noticed that right in front of those people stood the Tao tribal clan\u2019s third young master, Tao Yunxiao.As for the first and second young master, they did not make an appearance. According to the rules of the Kingdom\u2019s selection, the first assessment was a preliminary round. It would eliminate those who lacked strength. As for those who had already reached the Purple Blood realm, there was no need for them to participate in the preliminaries as they could just participate in the final selection rounds.In fact by reaching the Purple Blood realm, it was a guaranteed spot in the Jin Long Wei. The final selection round was just going through the motions. A Purple Blood warrior before the age of twenty-eight, even if they were in the early stages of the purple blood realm, they already proved their talent; hence, they were well-qualified to be a member of the Jin Long Wei.In the entire Tao tribal clan, besides the first and second young master, there were seven other Purple Blood warriors who were below the age of twenty-eight. Hence, nine spots in the Kingdom\u2019s selection had already been reserved for these nine people.Over a thousand people had to vie for the last eleven spots!A group of cavalry horses galloped forward, leading them was the Jin Long Wei\u2019s Thousand Households, Zhang Tan.He was also the examining officer of the selection in the Tao tribal clan.Zhang Tan gently reeled in the reins and dismounted the horse, \u201cNow, I\u2019ll announce the rules of the first preliminary round!\u201dZhang Tan was direct with his no nonsense attitude. He did not even introduce himself before jumping straight to the point, \u201cThe selection\u2019s first round is to test your Spirit!\u201d\u201cSpirit?\u201dThe participants were stunned. They were guessing that the preliminary would be a test of strength or something similar as it was the simplest and easiest. But to test Spirit? What is Spirit? How does one test it?\u201cSpirit is your morale, and it\u2019s also your resoluteness! A person with great Spirit would be able to deal with matters decisively. They would be daring, and never retreat in the face of adversity. They would charge forward with determination regardless of any temptations!\u201d\u201cOn the path of learning martial arts, there are several obstacles! There are many mysterious areas that are life threatening; and without Spirit and resoluteness, you would not dare enter into these areas.\u201d\u201cWhen facing a strong desolate beast in battle, Spirit is required to protect the human cities. It is insufficient to only have power. When facing a primordial desolate beast in battle, if you were to be timid, you would not be able to display a half of your true strength. How would you be able to fight?\u201d\u201cOne step on the path to breaking through the realms is to defeat the demons within one\u2019s self. You need to have the momentum and the will to break through everything. On the path to becoming a peerless expert, you will face endless temptations. Many forces will try to draw you to their side by granting you riches, treasure and beauty, hoping to corrupt you, and then eventually, they will exploit you! If you were to indulge in these temptations, without being resolute, that would be the end of your martial arts path!\u201d\u201cSo the future of a warrior is not talent, but Spirit!\u201dUpon hearing Zhang Tan\u2019s monologue, Yi Yun understood it deeply; having great Spirit is a quality that every accomplished person should have!The heroes of ancient China were all focused on one goal and they surged forward through tribulations. Adversity and temptations had all failed to hinder them!This Spirit was known in ancient China as \u201caura\u201d!The people who could read a person\u2019s aura would see an accomplished person have a purple halo above their head. A person with this halo would be known to have the aura of the Son of the Heavens. In novels, it is known as having the aura of a conqueror.In summary, to have the aura of the Son of the Heavens means they have the power to accomplish great deeds!Zhang Tan carried on, \u201cTo determine your Spirit, it will be a holistic test. A simple test will not be able to accurately assess you. Now, all of you circle around me. The closest person has to be at least fifty steps away from me!\u201dWith that, the crowd began to move. A crowd of a thousand people without any unified direction, not to mention the vagueness of Zhang Tan\u2019s orders, made the scene chaotic.Seeing this situation, several people including Tao Yunxiao and Lian Chengyu began to display their leadership qualities.\u201cThe people of the Tao tribal clan, hear my command. We shall hold hands and form a circle around Thousand Households Zhang, and then spread out.As the Tao tribal clan had the most number of people. By holding hands and forming a circle, they could avoid the confusion.Several other tribes began to follow suit.\u201cYi Yun, what are you idling there for? Go across, can\u2019t you see that there\u2019re few people there?\u201d Lian Chengyu shouted at Yi Yun. He felt that maintaining order in the chaos was also a way to showcase his Spirit. If he did it well, he would gain the attention of the upper echelon of the Jin Long Wei.This was an opportunity for him.Yi Yun was after all, a member of the Lian tribal clan. If Yi Yun did not obey his orders and ran amok, it would make him lose face and make him appear incompetent.Yi Yun looked coldly at Lian Chengyu and said, \u201cJust take care of your lackeys.\u201dYi Yun\u2019s words made Lian Chengyu turn cold, \u201cI\u2019ll see how long you can stay arrogant. You may have talent in martial arts, but in this test of Spirit, how could a follower like you, who is poor and always hungry, have any?\u201dSpirit was the ability to achieve great things, only a person with leadership qualities could possess it. As for the Lian tribal clan, who was the leader? It was clear!\u201cLet us try it and we\u2019ll find out who has more Spirit\u201d shrugged Yi Yun. \u201cAlso, Young master Lian, how\u2019s your injury? It won\u2019t affect the test of Spirit later, will it?\u201dYi Yun was great at targeting people\u2019s weak spots and ridiculing them about these weak spots.Lian Chengyu\u2019s failure to break through to the Purple Blood realm and his anger at this failure that caused him to cough up blood, was his most depressing and disgraceful memory.Lian Chengyu\u2019s face fell when Yi Yun mentioned it.\u201cLittle bastard, I\u2019ll see how long you can be this arrogant! You will eventually fall into my hands and then I\u2019ll let you know what it means to lead a living death!\u201dAfter saying it in a hushed tone, Lian Chengyu turned and walked away..Yi Yun chuckled and was not bothered by Lian Chengyu. He moved with the crowd and he would occasionally glance at Zhang Tan. He saw Zhang Tan retrieving a black box, which exceeded three meters in length, from his interspatial ring.This black box was made entirely of black iron and its surface was covered in ancient, mysterious looking inscriptions.When all the people had finally formed a circle around Zhang Tan, he coldly said to the crowd, \u201cthe preliminaries are about to begin. I will give you all a word of advice. Do not push it, if you think you are lacking in Spirit, stand further away to prevent injury.\u201dNo one moved after listening to Zhang Tan\u2019s words. In fact, a few people, including Tao Yunxiao and Lian Chengyu, moved forward a few steps, to demonstrate their Spirit.Zhang Tan smiled and opened up the box. From the box, he took out a three-foot-long black object. It was a curvy spiked spine. The spiked spine was helical and looked like a scimitar.Yi Yun could tell that the black object was the horn of a huge beast.After Zhang Tan took out the horn, it began floating slowly upwards, defying gravity.This was the object to test one\u2019s Spirit?Everyone was confused and was unsure how the assessment would proceed. Weirdly, they felt a sense of unease while in front of the horn.This feeling of unease sunk into their hearts\u2026\u201cI will say it once more. Those people who lack confidence, stand back or this test might kill your confidence. It might even prevent you from practicing martial arts ever again.\u201d Zhang Tan said solemnly.A few of the Jin Long Wei members by his side retreated and left Zhang Tan alone. With a few light taps, blinking runes appeared around the horn!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Back when he received the Chi Lin head from old man Su, old man Su had done something similar.After desolate bones were obtained, to prevent the loss of energy, people would seal it up with an arcane technique. They would only unseal it when they were going to refine and use it.\u201cThat horn must be the horn of a desolate beast!\u201d thought Yi Yun. If it was a desolate beast, it had to be an impressive one. Because as the seals were removed, colorful light dots appeared from the horn!These light dots could only be seen through Yi Yun\u2019s pairing with the Purple Crystal.The energy contained within the horn made Lian Chengyu\u2019s Frost Python desolate bones pale in comparison!\u201cSuch strong energy, I wonder which desolate beast the horn belongs to.\u201d Yi Yun was startled and uncertain, and he realized the participants beside him had all began to turn nervous.Some of them were worse and had turned pale. Fear could be seen in their eyes as if they saw something terrifying.The seals were lifted one after another by Zhang Tan\u2019s quick fingers!As more and more colorful light dots appeared in Yi Yun\u2019s vision, more and more participants began to tremble!Suddenly, Zhang Tan stopped. His gaze swept through the people surrounding him, speaking with a hush voice, \u201cIt begins, the first test, the test of your Spirit!\u201dWith this, Zhang Tantore off the last seal by waving his hand.The moment the seal was removed, Yi Yun saw a bright light pillar shoot up into the sky like a sword stabbing the clouds!\u201cThis is?\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s expression changed and took several steps back!As for the participants around Yi Yun, their faces were ashen, full of cold sweat and their knees went soft, causing them to collapse kneeling on the ground!There were even some who had trouble breathing as their teeth chattered. They could only feel an immense invisible force encasing them, causing them to be frightened out of their wits.Those that could still stand had retreated with their trembling bodies. After retreating about ten meters, they turned around and ran!\u201cSuch a strong desolate beast!\u201d Yi Yun was shocked. At this time, he realized that the light pillar had formed a phantom image!This phantom image was not only seen by Yi Yun, but by all the participants.It was huge and had robust limbs. Its body was burning with blue flames like a huge white tiger, but was infinitely more terrifying.Everyone held their breath when the huge phantom beast appeared.The beast was unrestrained but stared at everyone with great killing intent! It was as if it were to charge forward at anytime, beginning its wanton killings!Those who couldn\u2019t bear it, like the members of the warrior preparation camp, were scared silly. A man that had the strength to lift 500 lbs who previously ridiculed Yi Yun had collapsed onto the ground, his wet pants stained with the stench of urine.\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026Don\u2019t eat\u2026me.\u201d He seemed lost in an illusion as he trembled to crawl out of the area.As Zhang Tan said, this test could destroy a person\u2019s wits, preventing them from ever having the confidence to practice martial arts and to amount to anything.But then again, even if they had been scared out of their wits, they would not have gone far due to their lack of talent.Yi Yun stood motionless and felt a chill. He held in his breath as he saw the energy light dots from the phantom image slowly float towards him!Even such a fierce and terrifying bones would have its energy absorbed by the Purple Crystal after having its seal removed!Noticing that the Purple Crystal was going to consume all the energy from the horn, Yi Yun\u2019s face turned solemn. He immediately began to interface with the Purple Crystal to slow down the absorption rate.Not long ago, Yi Yun had absorbed dry the energy within the Frost Python desolate bones, and nearly broke his meridian channels. Hence, having learnt his lessons, he felt that to absorb all the energy from this unknown horn that had many times the energy of the Frost Python desolate bones would likely blow up his body.As Yi Yun was focusing to deal with the surge of energy, a large number of participants around him had been eliminated.As Zhang Tan said, they lacked the Spirit, so they were unable to withstand the terrifying aura. Such people would never be able to exhibit their full strength when entering a mysterious land or while battling a desolate beast, and were nothing but a bunch of trash.Of course, out from the trash appeared strong warriors!About four hundred people could handle the pressure. And out of those, another hundred could easily cope with it.It was to the point that tens of people including Lian Chengyu and Tao Yunxiao were able to laugh in the face of such adversity.Tao Yunxiao took a glance at the people around him, and only felt disdain. It was so unsightly to see those bunch of good-for-nothings exhibit such ugly expressions in front of the desolate beast\u2019s aura.He was not surprised to see Lian Chengyu standing firmly where he was.But\u2026Oh?Tao Yunxiao noticed that not far from Lian Chengyu stood Yi Yun. A twelve year old child was very noticeable in the crowd.Yi Yun was surprisingly still standing there. Besides him being in a daze, there were no signs of discomfort.Tao Yunxiao was surprised. Didn\u2019t Lian Chengyu say previously that this kid had just increased his strength by eating some treasure? How could he withstand the fierce pressure of the desolate beast\u2019s aura?\u201cInteresting.\u201d Tao Yunxiao only smiled. He knew that this was just the beginning. Although Yi Yun had attracted his attention, it was just a cursory notice. Tao Yunxiao did not see Yi Yun as a competitor. In fact, Tao Yunxiao did not treat anyone below the Purple Blood realm as a competitor.He was thinking of how to show off in the Kingdom\u2019s selection, and how to attract the attention of the upper echelon of the Jin Long Wei. Suddenly, he noticed that high in the sky, there was a blur. It was a white boat drifting over.An airship?Tao Yunxiao was slightly stunned. He had previously read about airships in books, but this was the first time he had seen one.An airship was extremely fast. It also contained extremely precious cargo and passengers. To have an airship, it would make it easy to travel in the vast wilderness.But in the entire Tao tribal clan with a hundred thousand households, they could never afford such an airship.Not just buying it, even if an airship was given to the Tao tribal clan, they could not use it, because the power source of the airships came from desolate bone essences!If they had desolate bone essences, the Tao tribal clan would have given it to their young geniuses to eat, how could they afford to use it to power an airship?To be able to sit in an airship was an extremely expensive affair!As for the person residing in the Tao tribal clan who owned an airship\u2026That person\u2019s identity could be easily guessed, it was the mysterious girl in white!Tao Yunxiao did not know her name and had only seen her side view from afar.But this did not prevent Tao Yunxiao from having thoughts of love and conquest about the girl.A strong girl with a mysterious background, who had Thousand Households Zhang\u2019s respect, would of course arouse the interest of the arrogant Tao Yunxiao.If he could conquer this girl, then it would be proof of his strength. And secondly it would be a perfect way to satisfy his ego; as an extraordinary man who would leave the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, how could he not have a mysterious, extraordinary girl as his partner?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - NoteworthyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85: Noteworthy\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the extraordinary girl to be watching the Kingdom\u2019s selection preliminaries. Who is she here for? Could it be me?\u201d Although he felt it was impossible, but who else in the preliminaries besides him was worth paying attention to?The likes of Lian Chengyu were nothing compared to him.Upon thinking of that, Tao Yunxiao grew excited. Whether if she was here to see him or just to soak in the atmosphere, he wanted to put in greater efforts to shine in the selection, winning the attention of that extraordinary girl!To shine, standing there was insufficient.Noticing that, Zhang Tan understood Tao Yunxiao\u2019s intentions.Releasing the seal was just the first step. To pass the preliminaries, they had to march forward despite the horn\u2019s tremendous pressure.Zhang Tan shouted, \u201cA bunch of wimps! It\u2019s only the horn of a dead desolate beast, and yet you are unable to handle it! Besides wasting the food and creating waste, what are you doing living in this world? If you can\u2019t handle it, get lost, for you are not suitable for practicing martial arts!\u201d\u201cI shall now announce the goal of the preliminaries. Using your own strength, you must walk towards the horn and when you reach a distance of twenty steps from this horn, you must be able to stay there for the time it takes for ten breaths. For every ten steps you move forward, the pressure will double. Whether you are a mule or a horse, that will be decided. It begins now!\u201d Zhang Tan\u2019s words echoed in a ten mile range. Zhang Tan was only a few feet away from the horn, and under the pressure, he was still able to convey his words loudly. Just based on this, it was extremely admirable.\u201cI wonder what state Zhang Tan is in, maybe\u2026 he has exceeded Purple Blood\u2026\u201d thought Lian Chengyu. He then began to open up his strides and walked towards the horn!As he was walking forward, Lian Chengyu glanced at Yi Yun.Lian Chengyu was still surprised that Yi Yun was able to stand there. It was surprising that a poor little bastard could withstand the pressurizing aura of the horn.This troublesome kid has that much Spirit?Lian Chengyu was not pleased. Besides having good talent in martial arts, he was lucky, this luck allowed him to meet some fortuitous event, improving his strength rapidly.Now the kid even had Spirit. Could he be destined to achieve great things?Lian Chengyu was unwilling to accept that. He felt that he himself was the true Son of the Heavens in the Lian tribal clan. How could that troublesome slave Yi Yun have luck that could compare with his luck, luck that had been accumulated from many generations in the Lian tribal clan?With those thoughts, Lian Chengyu carried on walking towards the horn. He wanted to prove that, not only could he be within twenty steps, but he could be be within fifteen, ten steps or even be able to touch the horn!Lian Chengyu began to speed up his pace as he forced his way forward in a bid to prove himself!But after taking about ten steps, Lian Chengyu felt that the pressure emitted by the horn increased by a lot!That desolate beast phantom image in the air gave out a terrifying force that felt extremely realistic. Both its eyes seemed to be able to see through people\u2019s minds. Its tusks seemed to have torn apart countless warriors.This desolate beast phantom made Lian Chengyu unable to face it.\u201cIt\u2019s fake! It\u2019s just an illusion!\u201d Although Lian Chengyu told that to himself, but no matter how he tried to convince himself, a chill still came to him.This was similar to a person who is afraid of ghosts and going to the bathroom late at night. Although he will keep telling himself that there\u2019s no such things as ghost, he would still a feel a chill. If a black cat were to suddenly leap out, or a sudden cold gust of wind blew, it would scare him out of his wits.Lian Chengyu had taken fifteen steps forward, but Tao Yunxiao\u2019s progress was much faster, having entered the thirty step range.Upon entering the thirty step range, Tao Yunxiao felt the pressure for the first time.\u201cWhat sort of desolate beast horn is it? It\u2019s so powerful!\u201d Tao Yunxiao frowned. He surveyed his surroundings and found himself to be the first. This pleased Tao Yunxiao, for if he were the first to enter the twenty step radius, he would be the person with the greatest Spirit in the preliminaries!But this was understandable. Spirit was a person\u2019s boldness, resoluteness, self-confidence, and it also included strength.A person\u2019s Spirit might be strong, but they could be weak.But a strong person would naturally have great Spirit!Tao Yunxiao raised his head to the airship and a smile appeared on his lips.\u201cBeauty, are you looking at me from up there? First place is mine! Although it is as easy as picking one\u2019s own pocket and nothing worth mentioning, this is just the beginning. As time goes on, my light will shine brighter!\u201dTao Yunxiao began moving forward without fear and with a most gallant posture!Up in the sky in the airship, a girl in white was holding a teapot. The way she poured and drank the tea did not emulate the etiquettes of the nobles, but it still looked extremely elegant.Her every move seemed to be of the greatest elegance.The girl in white looked out of the window from her side, but did not notice Tao Yunxiao\u2019s gallant posture. She was here today only to see Yi Yun.Facing the pretty girl was the exact opposite, a wretched fat elder busily filling his mouth with salt-baked chicken.This salt-baked chicken was of course made by Yi Yun. As the fat old man ate, he also drank wine. He did not use a wine cup, but just drank directly from a wine flask, flooding his greasy mouth with alcohol.\u201cSo how is it, has the kid passed yet?\u201d The old man was vague. In this opinion, the Kingdom\u2019s selection was nothing of great importance. If not for Lin Xintong\u2019s Yin Meridians having a tiny reaction, he would not have bothered coming here.\u201cNot yet, he has been staying still\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong frowned slightly, what was he doing? Why was he idly standing there?Lin Xintong did not believe this test was able to trouble Yi Yun. Although she was not optimistic about Yi Yun\u2019s martial arts talent\u2026.no, to be accurate, Yi Yun had no martial arts talent.But with Yi Yun\u2019s Tempered Body and Dragon Pulse, to be able to go within twenty steps of the beast horns would not be a difficult matter, unless he did not have a shred of Spirit.Although she met Yi Yun by chance, Lin Xintong did not know why she could not bear to see Yi Yun performing poorly at the Kingdom\u2019s selection. It might be because having her Yin Meridians activated, Lin Xintong subconsciously hoped that Yi Yun was no ordinary person. To her, it was hope, even if there was the slimmest of chances that he could help her join up her terminated meridian channels.\u201cHahaha, is this kid a coward?\u201d Old man Su wiped the oil from his mouth and stuck his neck out. All he saw was Yi Yun foolishly standing there.\u201cOh, this kid is dully watching a show!\u201d Actually, even if Yi Yun was timid, old man Su would not have been surprised since Yi Yun was just a child. He had never seen such a large desolate beast phantom image. For an ordinary child not to wet their pants from fear was pretty good.But to old man Su, he felt that Yi Yun was no ordinary child.\u201cThis will get interesting. The thing Zhang Tan took out is a horn from an ancient desolate beast \u201cFierce Divine Tiger\u201d Marquis Wenyun killed in the Cloud Wilderness. It was about about three meters in length originally, but a Desolate Heaven Master had carved it, reducing its size to what it\u2019s like now. Marquis Wenyun then used this as the Jin Long Wei sixth division\u2019s commander\u2019s seal.\u201d\u201cThe Jin Long Wei\u2019s commander seals are usually in the hands of the generals, to control the troops. Seems like ever since the Purple Clouds\u2019 Birth in the Cloud Wilderness, the six division\u2019s reckless general Yan Menglong joined in the fun. So this commander\u2019s seal was used as a prop by the reckless general for this Kingdom\u2019s selection.\u201dIt\u2019s was apparent that old man Su was on good terms with Marquis Wenyun, so he knew well about the matters of the Jin Long Wei.\u201cI want to see the kid embarrass himself. If he were to perform well and overcame all obstacles, I can\u2019t even be bothered. It\u2019s fun only if he embarrases himself though!\u201d Old man Su derived pleasure from the misfortune of others, so upon hearing those words, Lin Xintong was speechless. She did not understand how he could be happy if Yi Yun were to really perform badly.Yi Yun was indeed especially unique among the crowd.Those that could withstand the desolate beast\u2019s pressure, would have long begun walking towards the horn; as for those who couldn\u2019t withstand it, either they were paralyzed on the ground or tumbling away.But for Yi Yun, he remained motionless, because he was focusing on absorbing the Divine Tiger\u2019s desolate bones\u2019 energy.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - Moving towards the HornPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86: Moving towards the HornAt this moment in time, the horn\u2019s energy had entered Yi Yun\u2019s body, putting tremendous pressure on it! The energy contained within the horns was not ordinary. It contained an aura of unspeakable evil and blood-curling arrogance!\u201cBoom!\u201d Yi Yun felt his vision tremor, as if a white tiger-like desolate beast was standing on a mountain roaring, and under its feet were ten thousand beasts succumbing to it!The suppressor of these beasts was no ordinary beast, but an existence that was above the fierce beast grade. Some large beasts were much stronger than Purple Blood realm human warriors.This white tiger-like desolate beast had a respectable status as a beast king. During its life, it had conquered large territories, winning it infinite glory. Even in its death, its remnant horn still possessed such awe-striking power!It seemed like it was this evilness and blood curling arrogance that put immense pressure to the participants, causing their misery!Yi Yun repeatedly took in deep breaths. His face pale, for he realized the energy he had absorbed seemed to have a life of its own. Although it was suppressed by the Purple Crystal without a fight, the energy upon reaching his body was still extremely proud. It surged within his meridian channels causing Yi Yun pain!He had to gather up all his strength to withstand the pain. Even so, he still felt an immense pain. The heat within his body made sweat appear on his forehead, as his body trembled!Yi Yun felt as if he had dropped into a cauldron of fire. His fists tightened as he clenched his teeth. Blood even seeped out along the edges of his mouth!Whereas at this moment, Tao Yunxiao had finally reached a position within twenty steps from the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s horn. Members of the Jin Long Wei proceeded to draw a circle at this spot. Tao Yunxiao was the first participant to cross into the region.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m indeed the first!\u201d Tao Yunxiao glanced at Lian Chengyu who still needed at least five steps.But Lian Chengyu\u2019s progress was considered good. Many of the other heirs of the smaller tribes could not compare with Lian Chengyu.There were also some elites that had been nurtured by the Tao tribal clan who were still short of a few steps from that circle.As for Yi Yun, he was no longer noticed by Tao Yunxiao. This was because Tao Yunxiao only looked at the ones closest to him.\u201cCompared to these people, there\u2019s nothing to be proud of even if I became first. I need to walk another ten steps, and eventually hold the horn within my hand!\u201dWith this thought, Tao Yunxiao looked up to the airship.\u201cWait and see, see how far I can go forward!\u201dPast the twenty step radius, it became much harder to move forward as Tao Yunxiao felt immense pressure.At this time, Lian Chengyu had already walked into the circle. \u201cI passed. This is my Spirit, and the ability to accomplish great things in the future! Very good, even if I wasn\u2019t first, nor within the top three, the people in front of me are all elites of the Tao tribal clan. The only person to have such Spirit from a small tribal clan is me!\u201dLian Chengyu was pleased with himself. Coming out from a small area like the Lian tribal clan, he had little resources to enjoy, so his ambition was limited. To obtain such results made him proud of himself.Lian Chengyu took a glance at Yi Yun. He wanted to see how far Yi Yun had progressed.With that glance, he was stunned as Yi Yun was standing motionless on the same spot.Not only that, Yi Yun\u2019s face was red, and he was sweating profusely. A thin blue vein had appeared on his forehead as if there was a blue line buried under his skin.Yi Yun looked as though he had been chasing wild horses for days.\u201cHow can he be that weak?\u201d Lian Chengyu was stumped. He had originally believed that Yi Yun\u2019s Spirit would barely make it. Although Yi Yun was incomparable to him, Yi Yun should have been able to enter the twenty step radius, or at least the thirty step radius.But from the present situation, he seemed no different to those losers who had been scared out of their wits. Besides being able to maintain his standing position, he seemed to be at his limits in every aspect.Facing the facts, Lian Chengyu sneered to himself, \u201cI thought this kid was so capable that he could be arrogant. It looks like forcibly standing up without kneeling down is his limit. To think I thought he would be a future threat. What a joke. So what if he has good luck, he has a worthless background. That\u2019s all he amounts to. That\u2019s right, how is it possible to find a Son of the Heavens in a group of beggars? All the luck accumulated by the Lian tribal clan had been used to support me. There cannot be another person who will threaten my status!\u201dWith this thought, Lian Chengyu no longer cared about Yi Yun and proceeded walking towards the horn.The participants with considerable power began crossing the twenty step boundary and started walking past it.All of them wanted to show what their limits were. At the same time, they wanted the upper echelon of the Jin Long Wei to notice them, and nurture them for greater achievements in the future.At this moment, Lin Xintong who was in the airship could no longer understand Yi Yun.Could Yi Yun not withstand such a degree of pressure anymore? Not only could he not withstand it, his whole body was sweating as if he could no longer stand.\u201cMaster, what\u2019s up with him?\u201d Lin Xintong asked. Old man Su took a side glance as he was curious what the kid was doing. He can\u2019t be that bad?No one knew what Yi Yun was experiencing with the Purple Crystal\u2019s energy trap.Every pore of his was burning. It was as if knives were moving through his meridian channels. Yi Yun had never felt such pain from absorbing energy with the Purple Crystal. This was because the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s energy was too difficult to overcome.Under the extreme pain, Yi Yun found it unbearable. But at the same time, he was extremely excited. Due to the violent flow of energy entering his body, he felt his vessels and meridians becoming stronger; his bones and organs were also being tempered by this violent energy, becoming even stronger.His body was transforming!His cultivation was rapidly increasing!Originally, Yi Yun was just at the beginning stages of the fifth level of the Mortal Blood realm, but slowly he felt his strength consolidate, and his base grow solid. He had gradually reached the middle stages and even making steps towards the peak of the fifth level of the Mortal Blood realm!If he reached the peak of the fifth level of the Mortal Blood realm, Yi Yun\u2019s cultivation level would be no different from Lian Chengyu\u2019s! Combined with his Tempered Body, Dragon Pulse, defeating Lian Chengyu would be an easy task!The rapid increase in strength made him excited. It made Yi Yun\u2019s determination firmer. Even under the meridians-ripping pain, he carried on enduring!He wanted to break through to the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm in one sitting!But Yi Yun felt there was something lacking to push his body to the limit. To compress all the energy into his body, it seemed like there was a lack in pressure.He wanted to push himself to the limit, only then would he shine.Biting his teeth, Yi Yun began to take steps forward towards the horn!He planned to be close to the horn, using the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s immense pressure to train his body, and forcing him to break through, all the way to the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm!\u201cMaster, he\u2019s moving.\u201d Lin Xintong\u2019s eyes lit up, but old man Su was still frowning. He may have moved, but such a state didn\u2019t seem like he would pass. I don\u2019t want you to steal the show, but don\u2019t make me ashamed\u2026Oh? That\u2019s not right\u2026Old man Su suddenly realized something and looked towards Yi Yun with a surprised look.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked like he was destined to be much slower than the rest. Most of the heirs of the small tribal clans and the elites of the Tao tribal clan had come within twenty steps of the horn.There were some who were struggling, trying their best to pass the twenty step mark.\u201cThis little slave actually began to move. But in such a miserable state, he can\u2019t go far.\u201d After one glance, Lian Chengyu did not take any further notice. He raised his head to look at the large desolate beast phantom image in the sky. He bit down his teeth and wiped the sweat from his brow as he carried on moving forward.The closer they were to the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s horn, the greater the pressure became. For Lian Chengyu, each step became more difficult than the last.He saw that he was about twelve steps away from the horn, and knew that upon reaching the ten step radius, he would receive an intense increase in terrifying pressure. Without any mental preparation, he would not be able to withstand it and be forced backwards by the energy.Some of the elites of the Tao tribal clan had failed because of this.And among the people, the only person to successfully enter a ten step radius was Tao Yunxiao!Lian Chengyu had to admit that Tao Yunxiao beat him both in terms of strength and Spirit.As a fourteen year old child, Tao Yunxiao was absolutely arrogant, but such arrogance was also a manifestation of Spirit!At this time, the slowest Yi Yun had approached the twenty step radius.\u201cMaster, he\u2019s about to pass soon.\u201d Lin Xintong said. Old man Su pinched his beard and said, \u201cPassing the Kingdom\u2019s selection\u2019s preliminaries would be nothing even if you were to pass it, but\u2026\u201dOld man Su focused his mind and looked carefully at Yi Yun, \u201cThis kid is doing something\u2026\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lin Xintong was stunned.\u201cHis strength is increasing!\u201d Old man Su said without rhyme or reason, \u201cFrom the moment he began moving towards the horn, his cultivation level had been slowly increasing, strange\u2026\u201dOld man Su stroked his chin and his incredible eyes could easily see every inch of Yi Yun\u2019s body from high in the sky. By observing Yi Yun\u2019s body condition, he had realized that Yi Yun\u2019s energy within him was undergoing change.If not for the mysterious Purple Crystal that exceeded old man Su\u2019s comprehension, he would have been shocked for uncountable number of light dots were flocking to Yi Yun like birds following a Phoenix.Twenty steps!Yi Yun finally stepped into the twenty step boundary and passed.Every person who stepped into the twenty step demarcation line would catch the attention of the crowd. Yi Yun was no different.A few members of the warrior preparation camp had already retreated to over a hundred steps away to a \u201csafe distance\u201d. Seeing Yi Yun qualify, they were displeased.This kid could not hold on and each step looked like he would tumble, yet he qualified!Heaven was unfair, this punk\u2019s Spirit was stronger than all of them!Buzz\u2014\u2014Buzz\u2014\u2014At this time, Yi Yun\u2019s accumulated energy had reached it\u2019s maximum. The Purple Crystal in his heart would absorb the energy and compress it with each pulsation.Yi Yun\u2019s started to spit out blood as his blood vessels began to rise up as if they were about to explode!Just a bit more, just a tiny bit more!Yi Yun gritted his teeth and as he was just about to take another step, the Fierce Divine Tiger in the sky stared at them all with its large amber eyes!\u201cRoar\u2014\u2014\u201dThe long roar of the Fierce Divine Tiger, which comprised of a large amount of energy from the horn, was like a volcano eruption, surging up into the sky!\u201cAh!\u201d Lian Chengyu let out a scream. The sudden change in pressure was too much for him. He felt like he had been rammed in the chest by a jackhammer. With a snort, his body flew backwards!Fierce Divine Tiger got its name because its roar was extremely fearsome, enough to scare the heavens!This was only the phantom image of the Fierce Divine Tiger. If it was a mature living Fierce Divine Tiger, a roar would be enough to kill an army of a thousand people!Many of the elites of the Tao tribal clan experienced the same thing as Lian Chengyu. With the sudden burst of the imposing aura, they were not prepared and failed to react in time, resulting in them flying backwards.Those who were already at their limits immediately vomited out blood and could no longer move forward.As for Tao Yunxiao, his strength and confidence were showcased. Although he had retreated backwards and his face ashened, he was only down on one knee and did not collapse!\u201cGood! Good! Exhilarating! I must conquer you today!\u201d After wiping the blood off his lips, his eyes lit up with excitement. No one was competing with him anymore. The person to defeat was himself.Just as Tao Yunxiao wanted to stand up and move, he heard a bone crunching sound behind him!\u201cKa Ka Ka!\u201dIt was the clear cracking sound of egg shells cracking which was alarming!\u201cHuh!?\u201d Tao Yunxiao turned his head suddenly to search for the source of the sound.He saw a youth drenched in sweat, as if the youth that had been fished out of the water, and the youth was crouching on the ground, while his muscles were jumping and shaking!The trembling of his muscles was not due to the fear caused by the pressure, but the joy of the muscles filled with energy.The energy within Yi Yun\u2019s meridian channels were circulating rapidly. When the Fierce Divine Tiger roared, the pressure had reached its extreme, sending a violent surge of energy through Yi Yun\u2019s body, as if a high speed crash into a wall.The seal on his body\u2019s energy was smashed through in that instant!A whirlpool began to form at Yi Yun\u2019s heart and began sucking in innumerable lights dots to it like a blackhole.\u201cBoom!\u201dWith the explosive burst of energy, the rock by Yi Yun\u2019s feet shattered. He opened his eyes and his eyes flashed like lightning.The peak of the Qi Gatherer realm, I have finally broken through to it!As such, I\u2019m just one step away from the Purple Blood realm!\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with this kid?\u201d From Tao Yunxiao\u2019s insight and observation capabilities, he could not tell what had happened to Yi Yun\u2019s body.As for Zhang Tan who was in the middle of the square, he could feel it. Although he had not reached the point of Opening Heaven\u2019s Eyes, he could tell that Yi Yun had broken through.\u201cThis kid actually used the pressure from the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s roar to break through?\u201d Zhang Tan was surprised but gave an interested look. \u201cInteresting! Interesting! Normal people would find it hard to bear under such tremendous pressure. Each breath felt as long as a day, and could not wait to finish the test early. But this kid actually used this chance to give himself an opportunity. Haha, interesting!\u201dZhang Tan felt that this kid would one day amount to something!Yi Yun clenched his fists and took in deep breaths. he felt every breath was sweet and refreshing. His saliva was like the water from an oasis, nourishing his body with each swallow.Reaching the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm that was just one step shy of the Purple Blood realm, he felt the world appear clearer to him. His perception of the environment had increased further.Not only that, he felt an inexhaustible amount of energy within his body. The rich Heaven Earth Yuan Qi around him was entering all his pores and into his body!A warrior at the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm could easily absorb the energies of the surroundings. Although they had not reached the realm of avoiding grain, they could still survive even with the lack of food.\u201cThis is the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm, it feels great!\u201d Yi Yun clenched his fists and felt an emotion. He turned his head over and he glanced at Lian Chengyu.Yi Yun and Lian Chengyu were separated by a distance of dozens of feet as they looked directly at each other!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If possible, he wanted to cripple Lian Chengyu for life!Little bastard, what the hell are you doing?Lian Chengyu did not know what had happened to Yi Yun; all he felt was that the kid was slightly different. However, he could not tell what was different.\u201cHmph, what are you looking at me for? Why, don\u2019t tell me you want to fight me? You don\u2019t even qualify!\u201d Lian Chengyu forced his voice into a line, sending it into Yi Yun\u2019s ear from dozens of feet away.Yi Yun did not know that little technique. To speak to Lian Chengyu, he had to shout which would make him seem silly.\u201cI need to learn this technique.\u201d Based on the wuxia novels he had read in the past, Yi Yun knew that it wasn\u2019t hard for an expert who had opened up his Ren Du Er Mai to learn.But, being unable to speak didn\u2019t mean Yi Yun had no means of response.He held out his hand and gestured to Lian Chengyu by lifting his pinky. Even in this alternate world, lifting the pinky represented contempt and provocation. Lian Chengyu\u2019s face turned stiff, \u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dYi Yun only sneered and began to ignore Lian Chengyu.Arrogance?That\u2019s right, this was arrogance!Yi Yun was not a low-key person. In the past he stayed under the radar because he lacked the strength and could only endure. Now, he had the strength, and no one in the Lian tribal clan could threaten his strength anymore. At this moment, was there any need to endure anything?\u201cLittle slave, how dare you be so disrespectful to your master?\u201dNot far of, Tao Yunxiao had noticed Yi Yun\u2019s situation. He recalled that Lian Chengyu had mentioned that Yi Yun belonged to the Lian tribal clan. To Tao Yunxiao, such a tribesmen was equivalent to a slave.But a slave dared to raise his pinky at Lian Chengyu. Such arrogance deserved death.Tao Yunxiao belonged to the ruling elite and was of similar stature as Lian Chengyu. So he could not stand the revolt from a slave to his master, because he was a master himself.\u201cKid, you sure are arrogant.\u201d Tao Yunxiao also knew how to force his voice into a line, and had purposely included an aggressive attack within his voice like a needle, pricking Yi Yun\u2019s eardrums.Yi Yun took a glance at Tao Yunxiao. For a person that was arrogant to the extreme, only the world would allow him to be arrogant, and if someone appeared more arrogant than him, that would be a challenge on his authority. He would then be displeased, aiming to destroy the other party.Although Yi Yun did not have hate for Tao Yunxiao like the hate he had for Lian Chengyu. But Yi Yun thought this kid still deserved a good spanking.Yi Yun did not know how to transmit his voice, so he could only extend his small hand and gestured with his pinky to Tao Yunxiao.He was at the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm, and Tao Yunxiao had not broken into the Purple Blood realm, or he wouldn\u2019t have needed to participate in the preliminaries. Since everyone\u2019s cultivation was the same, who was afraid of who?\u201cF*ck!\u201d On Tao Yunxiao\u2019s forehead appeared veins that formed a cross. He never thought that the little slave was so arrogant that he even provoked him!You are courting death!\u201cIt\u2019s indeed true that newborn calves are not afraid of tigers, do you know who am I? Very good! I will make sure you will regret your action for life!\u201d growled Tao Yunxiao.Yi Yun laughed because that phrase was best directed back at Tao Yunxiao.A fourteen year old child, who had never experienced setbacks, did not know his limits.A vast majority of people in the world subconsciously think they are different, even a retard might think the same way too.Tao Yunxiao regarded himself as extraordinary, and a new generation\u2019s master who would eventually step out of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom.Yi Yun ignored Tao Yunxiao, and he started taking big steps towards the beast horn!He had not finished absorbing the energy!The energy that the Purple Crystal absorbed had all been expended for the breakthrough to the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm, so Yi Yun felt his body lacking in energy.In his empty condition, only a fool would not absorb the high quality energy source in front of his eyes.Yi Yun not only wanted to absorb, he wanted to drink his fill!As for the extremely uncomfortable prowess of the Fierce Divine Tiger he had previously suffered from, it was now extremely comfortable for Yi Yun. Also with existing pressure, it made him absorb the energy even more efficiently as it forced the energy absorbed by the Purple Crystal to enter his flesh and blood sooner.Under such a situation, Yi Yun naturally wanted to go closer to the beast horn.Seeing Yi Yun open up his footsteps, Tao Yunxiao made a contemptuous smile, \u201cYou little slave, you sure are stubborn. I want to see how far you can go. Aren\u2019t you going to wipe the sweat from your body?\u201dTao Yunxiao\u2019s words were full of sarcasm, but Yi Yun ignored him.As he began walking forward, although each step was easy, Yi Yun\u2019s speed was not fast as he wanted to absorb the horn\u2019s energy, and also he wanted to use the pressure to strengthen his body.Lian Chengyu had managed to get up after a few moments.It was hard to believe that this rascal did not incur a serious injury and still had the strength to move forward when the Fierce Divine Tiger sent its pressure surge.It had to be say that putting aside the narrow-mindedness and the jealousy, Lian Chengyu had the persistence and perseverance in martial arts.Yi Yun, Lian Chengyu and Tao Yunxiao all began walking towards the beast horn. There were not many people left, only about twelve but they were all still on the ground.Many people had already qualified, but they had been pushed back by the aura previously, and were injured. As such, they had to retreat to a safe distance.Spirit included 20% strength, 20% boldness, 20% determination and 20% fortitude. This was a holistic test on a person. If any aspect was lacking, so long as the person had another aspect that stood out, they could still do well in the preliminary.\u201cThis kid\u2026to actually point his pinky at others, is really arrogant and childish, but\u2026I like it!\u201d Old man Su laughed as he stroke his beard.\u201cMaster, how did Yi Yun suddenly break through?\u201d Lin Xintong was incredulous.\u201cHe broke though under the pressure. Sometimes, warriors would break through their bottlenecks under immense pressure. For example in the face of danger, with their life on the line, some warriors will break through, getting out of the jaws of danger. This is a wonderful ability. Usually such people will have a lot of Spirit, and can easily survive in desperate times, allowing them to go far in the future.\u201dLin Xintong could not believe that Old man Su would say such earnest words because Yi Yun\u2019s constitution was lacking.But from the looks of it, besides Yi Yun\u2019s constitution being bad, in all other aspects, be it perceptivity or Spirit, he fulfilled every requirement of a martial arts prodigy.Could such a person eventually break the shackles of his poor constitution and achieve greatness?Lin Xintong did not know, just like she did not know her if there was that tiniest hope that she could join up her terminated meridians in the future.As Lin Xintong was thinking, Yi Yun had already moved forward by eight steps.Yi Yun\u2019s legs were short, so even after eight steps, he was still far from the ten step radius boundary from the horn.At this point, Lian Chengyu had finally reached that boundary.At the ten step boundary, the pressure would increase again. Lian Chengyu loftily looked at Yi Yun.With a deep breath, he raised his foot to take a step inwards.Boom!Lian Chengyu felt a thick murderous spirit shrouding him, and in a second it was as if he was in the middle of a sea of blood during a slaughter.Lian Chengyu\u2019s body suddenly shook and with a loud roar, his bones began to snap and crackle. Green veins protruded from his neck as he tried to contained that endless amount of bloody and murderous pressure.Peng!Lian Chengyu half kneeled on the ground supporting himself with both arms. His eyes were red and he took in deep breaths. His cheeks were puffed up like a toad, and it was clear that this was his limit. But he managed to step within ten steps of the beast horn!\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded!\u201d Lian Chengyu clenched his fists; even though his nostrils were bleeding, and his body was soaked in sweat and was in a sorry plight, he had still succeeded.He was infinitely excited because he was near the top for the preliminaries!Besides the nine Purple Blood warriors who did not participate in the preliminaries and besides Tao Yunxiao and a handful of Tao tribal clan\u2019s elites, there was no one that matched Lian Chengyu.Based on the rankings of the preliminaries, if he could maintain it, he had no problems passing the Kingdom\u2019s selection!\u201cGood!\u201d Lian Chengyu wanted to laugh loudly, but he had already expended all his energy, so he could no longer laugh.Suddenly, Lian Chengyu realized that Yi Yun had already came to his side.As Lian Chengyu was challenging the pressure that came from being within ten steps, Yi Yun had leisurely walked to the ten-step boundary with his short legs.Lian Chengyu\u2019s mouth showed a trace of contempt. He had undergone the baptism of that brutal murderous surge, and knew deeply of its terror. Even after experiencing endless numbers of real battle, he had nearly been scared out of his wits by that immense murderous intent. Yi Yun was a kid who usually only went up the mountains to pick herbs and dig for food in the mud, how would he able to withstand this extremely real-like murderous surge?Many people in this world might have the talent, but even with talent, they had to train themselves to slowly release their potential.What sort of training could Yi Yun have?Lian Chengyu waited to see Yi Yun suffer a setback. He had just completed an extremely painful task, so seeing someone do it was an inexplicably good feeling.But, many of a time, things do not go as expected\u2026Lian Chengyu saw Yi Yun shoot out his short leg and crossed the ten step demarcation line. He did not even pause in his steps.Just crossing over like that.Crossing over like that.Over like that.Over\u2026Lian Chengyu was stupendous as his eyes stared like a bugeye goldfish in a fishbowl.Not only Lian Chengyu, from not far away, Tao Yunxiao had noticed this turn of events and was stunned silly.How could this be possible!?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was incomprehensible! Was the ten step demarcation line Yi Yun crossed different from the line that others had crossed?Neither Tao Yunxiao nor Lian Chengyu could believe it.But they could not walk to the area that Yi Yun had crossed and examine it because they were finding it difficult just to stand on their spot.Could it be possible that Yi Yun accomplished this feat because he had unparalleled Spirit?This was unacceptable. Even many disqualified participants from far, especially the members of the Lian tribal clan warrior preparation camp were agap and shocked, as if they had just swallowed an egg whole.The invincible Young master Lian Chengyu in their hearts had been overtaken by Yi Yun!Just a few minutes ago, Yi Yun was being pressured by the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s aura causing him to profusely sweat and looking pathetic, how did he suddenly seem to receive Divine help, which allowed him to walk forward with ease?How could this kid have greater Spirit than them?They could not accept Yi Yun\u2019s strength. He had only learned martial arts for a few days and could not have that much strength. How could a twelve year old kid, that grew up in a ravine and had not seen the world, be braver than others, strong-willed and in spite of adversity, forge ahead?\u201cIs there something wrong with the test? Could Yi Yun have found a loophole?\u201d Lian Chengyu could only think that was the reason, and that was the only reason he found acceptable. But seeing Zhang Tan nodding, he knew that his objections would be overruled and Zhang Tan would only end up looking down on him.What the heck?Lian Chengyu could not accept it. Having stepped into the ten step radius, his results were at the top, but Yi Yun, the person who he hated the most, had pushed him down, and he didn\u2019t know what had gone wrong.At this time, Tao Yunxiao began to react and quickly marched towards the horn.The Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s aura was oppressing; it made Tao Yunxiao know that to be one step away from the horn and touching it was impossible.All he wished was not to lose to Yi Yun.But Yi Yun\u2019s steps were more sure, and his steps were something that Tao Yunxiao could not compare with.In fact, if Yi Yun had not been absorbing the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s energy by controlling the Purple Crystal as he walked, his speed would have been much faster.After using the energy of the Fierce Divine Tiger\u2019s horn to break through to the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm, Yi Yun enjoyed the pressure given by the horn\u2019s aura.It was as if his flesh and organs were being pounded by the pressure, and the feeling was fantastic.Seeing Yi Yun catch up, Tao Yunxiao became anxious. He ignored everything and headed towards the horn, hoping to suppress Yi Yun.Because he had overdrafted his body, Tao Yunxiao began to feel his breathing become shallower and he sweated profusely. He was close to his limit.Yet at this time, he could hear the footsteps behind him grow closer!Tao Yunxiao was flustered.\u201cI cannot be overtaken by him, I cannot be overtaken by him!\u201d Tao Yunxiao began crying in his heart as each step he took felt like he was carrying a huge mountain.But no matter how hard Tao Yunxiao tried, he was ultimately unable to change fate, he helplessly watched as Yi Yun walked to his side with his short legs.In contrast to Yi Yun, Tao Yunxiao seemed to be moving in slow motion, and it was comical.As everyone were very close to the horn and were only a few steps away from it, Tao Yunxiao was very close to Yi Yun. They both looked at each other.After exchanging glances, Yi Yun made a bashful smile, said hello and then just walked pass Tao Yunxiao.Tao Yunxiao nearly spit blood!He had been overtaken by someone whose strength was inferior to him, by an inferior, poor villager from a small tribal clan!Tao Yunxiao felt his pride of fourteen years being severely trampled. He could not accept it!Just as Tao Yunxiao lost his concentration, the Fierce Divine Tiger phantom in the sky issued its second roar. It could be said that if it\u2019s not one thing, it\u2019s another.\u201cRoar!\u201d A killing intent spread out like a blood pool from hell; Tao Yunxiao was not prepared and was swept away by this rush of killing intent!His ass hit the ground after tumbling a few times.As for Lian Chengyu, he was sent flying a dozen of steps, and had already been pushed out of the twenty step boundary.As for Yi Yun, during the moment of that roar, Yi Yun had felt the energy in his body accumulate to its extreme.\u201cKa Ka Ka!\u201dThe cracking eggshell sounds erupted again. Yi Yun\u2019s body was cleansed by the energy, and each inch of his body was tempered, tranquilizing him.\u201cPuah!\u201dYi Yun took a few steps back and spit out a mouthful of black blood!This black blood was the impurities within Yi Yun\u2019s body. With every Marrow Cleansing, he flushed out his body\u2019s impurities, and Yi Yun\u2019s body was becoming more and more pure.With his body pure, he laid a good foundation. The day he breaks into the Purple Blood realm, he can directly reach the peak of the early stages of the Purple Blood realm. His body could hold much more energy than other Purple Blood warriors!\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this Kingdom\u2019s preliminaries to turn into a fortuitous event for me. Using it, I have broken through to the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm and just a step away from Purple Blood! I also feel my body filled with energy. I really cannot wait to expend this energy by cultivating!\u201dYi Yun was full from absorbing the energy, and there was no more significance in proceeding further.Besides, he had already overtaken Tao Yunxiao and took first place in the preliminaries!\u201cMaster, Yi Yun took first place.\u201d Lin Xintong only knew Yi Yun amongst all the participants. Besides, her Yin Meridians had some relations with Yi Yun, so Lin Xintong naturally wished for Yi Yun to win.\u201cA grass-root level Kingdom\u2019s selection, and only a preliminary at that. So what if he\u2019s first? There\u2019s nothing impressive about that.\u201d Old man Su curled his lips like he didn\u2019t care, but old man Su was pretty surprised to see Yi Yun break through under the great pressure.If it was just a one off, then it would have been nothing. But if Yi Yun were to break through repeatedly under pressure or while in times of difficulty, then he would be a force to be reckoned with.\u201cToo bad, it\u2019s really too bad. If his constitution was perfect, no, even if it was just slightly below perfect, then he would be a real great martial arts seedling!\u201d Old man Su shaked his head sighing. He still remembered his first meeting with Yi Yun who had said very extraordinary words. Just from the words Yi Yun said, Yi Yun\u2019s Spirit should not be bad.However, there was always one form of regret or another in this world.Lin Xintong had perfect constitution and extremely high perceptivity. In every respect she was impeccable, but due to her Yin Meridians, it had cut off her road to martial arts, and was destined not to go far.Yi Yun had Dragon Pulse, Spirit, excellent perceptivity and great ambitions; however, his constitution was lacking, and it could be his fatal weakness!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His voice was clear and loud; he had no need to inject energy in his voice for everyone to hear him.Only a dozen or more people passed.Over a thousand people had been cut down to few dozen people. This disqualification rate was astoundingly high.The members of the Lian tribal clan\u2019s warrior preparation camp had all been disqualified. They were not the only ones; even some of the weaker participants in the Tao tribal clan had also been disqualified.Being disqualified was nothing, as the members of the Lian tribal clan\u2019s warrior preparation camp were mentally prepared that they would never pass the kingdom\u2019s selection, but Yi Yun had received first place. Was this selection fair?They believed that Yi Yun was of similar background to them, and he had a poor sufferable life. Why did he stand out?People were like this; to people who were hallowed, they could accept that they were resplendent without being jealous. They might even sing their praises, hoping to cling on to them, gaining glory by being a follower.But they could not accept that people similar to themselves or even someone even worse off to suddenly make an uprising and surpass them.Zhang Tan carried on, \u201cIn accordance with the rules of the kingdom\u2019s selection, I will need to ask if you are willing to become a member of the Jin Long Wei? If you agree, you can carry on in the semi-finals of the kingdom\u2019s selection, if not, you can now leave!\u201dZhang Tan\u2019s words were just a formality, but as rules were rules, he had to ask.No one left including Yi Yun as they all wanted to become a member of the Jin Long Wei.Yi Yun had read novels in his previous life where protagonists would pass up the big factions\u2019 pull and all the incentives that came with it and go at it alone.With the support of great fortune, such an approach allowed a person to deserve being cocky. But Yi Yun knew that he was far from that. His strength was just a tiny bubble of no consequence in this world. A single prick would burst it.Besides, be it cultivation resources or cultivation techniques, he could not obtain any by himself. His meals were even a problem.He needed to join a large faction and using the faction\u2019s resources and heritage, he could slowly rise up and eventually become a mighty power.After he managed to reach a certain point of accumulated resources and experience, he would then have the minimum requirements to be cocky, and freely pursue his desires.\u201cYou! What\u2019s your name? How old are you?\u201d Zhang Tan\u2019s fierce and commanding gaze landed on Yi Yun.\u201cGeneral, I am Yi Yun with the age of twelve.\u201d Yi Yun replied without being servile or bumptious.\u201cGood! I shall now announce that you came in first for this preliminary round!\u201d\u201cIn this kingdom\u2019s selection, if you could be selected, and obtain the first spot among the Mortal Blood participants, I will declare you a warrior of the Jin Long Wei\u2019s elite troops immediately!\u201d Zhang Tan\u2019s words spread across the venue, making the people envious and jealous!Jin Long Wei\u2019s elite!Even the warriors of the Jin Long Wei had different hierarchies which resulted in different treatment.For example, Zhang Yuxian who had previously gone to the Lian tribal clan was an elite warrior of the Jin Long Wei.Elite warriors enjoyed extremely great advantages in terms of cultivation resources, cultivation training grounds, cultivation techniques, much more than the regular warriors.Most warriors that get selected by the Kingdom\u2019s selection would usually be designated as normal warriors. Some of the best Purple Blood warriors such as the Tao tribal clan\u2019s first and second young masters could become one of the elite.But now a child who did not even need to shave had been valued greatly by Zhang Tan. Zhang Tan was even prepared to make him an elite warrior. How could they take it in their stride?How strong is this kid? His cultivation level can\u2019t be higher than ours!As for the preliminaries, although the kid had obtained first place, he had suddenly risen to prominence at the end to overtake Tao Yunxiao. There might have been something wrong such as him finding a loophole.Even if there was no problem, even if Yi Yun had a strong Spirit or had an upheaval there and then, so what?Could you use Spirit to kill?The various aspects that influenced Spirit included strength as one of its smaller components. And in the vast wilderness, where people lead insecure lives and the beasts roamed freely, what people valued the most was one\u2019s strength.Fancy stuff like Spirit was just some concept the people of the kingdom\u2019s heartlands created. To the warriors of the vast wilderness, what was Spirit? Could it be eaten?Many people remained unconvinced, especially Lian Chengyu and Tao Yunxiao.Lian Chengyu wanted to stand up and oppose it, but Zhang Tan was too overbearing. A person who had exceeded the Purple Blood realm was far stronger than anything Lian Chengyu could conceive of. In front of Zhang Tan, Lian Chengyu could not muster up the courage.How could a mouse oppose a lion?But, although Lian Chengyu lacked the courage, this did not mean Tao Yunxiao was lacking in courage. In this world, not many people knew their place; after all, Tao Yunxiao was only fourteen. He had not crossed over into a new reality. A fourteen-year-old youth tended to be arrogant so he settled matters in a straightforward manner\u2014doing whatever he wanted to do.Just as Tao Yunxiao was about to open his mouth, a stern voice rang in his ears, \u201cYunxiao, shut up!\u201dTao Yunxiao could easily tell that it was his father\u2019s voice.\u201cFather, I can\u2019t accept it, what the heck is with this kingdom\u2019s selection, why aren\u2019t they examining strength? Wouldn\u2019t it be immediately clear once a test of strength is made? But they had to test such useless things, I can\u2019t accept it!\u201dAfter being exceeded by Yi Yun in the test of Spirit, Tao Yunxiao began to subconsciously belittle the use of Spirit in his words.\u201cIf you are not convinced, then exceed him during the semi-finals!\u201d Tao Yunxiao\u2019s father simply replied.\u201cExceed that kid?\u201d Tao Yunxiao snorted. He would exceed him for sure without a doubt, and would even crush him! \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll exceed the kid. The first place for the kingdom\u2019s selection\u2019s Mortal Blood competition is mine!\u201dTao Yunxiao clenched his fists as he stared at Yi Yun with a strong sense of animosity.At that moment, Tao Yunxiao\u2019s father hesitated for a moment and sent his voice to Tao Yunxiao.Upon hearing it, Tao Yunxiao\u2019s eyes lit up. His voice was trembling with excitement.\u201cFather is what you say true!? Can I really use it? The tribe is no longer concealing it?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s mostly confirmed. A moment of forbearance does not mean that you are weak. Yunxiao, all my hopes rest on you. For this selection, you must live up to my expectations. Not only must you become an elite warrior of the Jin Long Wei, the kingdom\u2019s selection will be the starting point of our Tao tribal clan\u2019s move into the central plains\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand!\u201d Tao Yunxiao clenched his fists with excitement.He had never expected that the Tao tribal clan\u2019s elders had such ambitions. Great! I shall be the person to write a new chapter in the Tao tribal clan\u2019s history books!As for beating Yi Yun in the semi-finals\u2026Yes, with that thing, would it even be a question that I can defeat Yi Yun?As long as the tribe did not conceal it, I will let everyone know what does it mean to be a frog in a well!Tao Yunxiao looked at Yi Yun who was in the crowd. His eyes were full of contempt and ridicule. You might have been in the limelight for the preliminaries, but I will completely crush you in the semi-finals.As for his father\u2019s words, Tao Yunxiao was full of anticipation.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Tao tribal clan\u2019s wonderland was covered with a thick, wide layer of Qi. Hence, in the hundred mile radius of the Tao tribal clan\u2019s wonderland, no fierce or desolate beast would choose to enter. So it was considered a safe place, though that was under normal circumstances.Having absorbed a large amount of energy in the day, he felt his body burning. He could not sleep, hence he was out in the mountain outskirts cultivating!\u201cPeng!\u201d\u201cPeng!\u201d\u201cPeng!\u201dEach move and stance was part of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d. A tree the size of a woman\u2019s waist was broken with one punch from Yi Yun!The more Yi Yun punched, the more excited he became because he felt an inexhaustible amount of energy within his body.After performing the whole set of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 a dozen times, he was still not tired and still full of energy.In the past when he was in the Lian tribal clan\u2019s back mountain, Yi Yun would feel exhausted after performing Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist about five times. But today, he could perform it continuously.As Yi Yun was practicing the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, he could feel the Purple Crystal in his body pulsating with each heartbeat.Each pulsation allowed the Purple Crystal to absorbed the environment\u2019s Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.Yi Yun realized that the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi in the Tao tribal clan was much denser than that of the Lian tribal clan\u2019s back mountain.This was naturally because the Tao tribal clan\u2019s wonderland was of higher quality than the Lian Clan\u2019s Herb Mountain.With a thicker Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, Yi Yun could feel his energy replenishing faster, giving him great comfort.\u201cSo a wonderland has such a magical effect\u2026\u201d Yi Yun finally realized that cultivating in a high grade wonderland had a multiplier effect.And this was only the Tao tribal clan, which is just a medium-sized tribe in the vast wilderness. If viewed from the perspective of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom heartlands, it\u2019s scale was that of a rural village and nothing noteworthy.If it was the big city of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, or the training grounds of the Jin Long Wei base, or even the royal imperial city, it was unimaginable how it would be like cultivating there!In an environment with dense Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, with each cultivation, Yi Yun had entered a \u2018No Law, No Shape, No Void, No Me\u2019 state. It was a magical state as if he was trying to catch something.It seemed like a thought but also an understanding. It had to be important, but whenever Yi Yun was just about to catch it, it would slip away.What was it?Yi Yun chased after that thought but failed time and time again. It was to the point of exhaustion, and suddenly, he woke up from his trance like state.Looking up, the moon was already directly above him, and it was likely three in the morning.In the mountains, the breeze blew. Yi Yun\u2019s body was covered in sweat and he was exhausted.Touching his stomach, he realized the energy he had consumed from the beast horn had been expended, and\u2026he was hungry again.\u201cI sure can eat!\u201d Yi Yun grimaced. As a fifth stage Mortal Blood warrior, the body required energy supplied to it through food, and it was the point when he could eat the most. Besides, his appetite had grown even bigger after practicing the Elephant Swallowing Technique.He did not have a interspatial ring, so he did not bring much meat when he left the Lian tribal clan. He could only eat the standard meals provided by the Tao tribal clan.Even if the Tao tribal clan was rich and food was provided by the Jin Long Wei, the standard meal could not be of sufficient quantity for Yi Yun to digest.If there was a grilled cow in front of him, Yi Yun felt he could swallow it all.\u201cIf I had plenty of desolate beast meat for my meals, my strength will definitely grow faster\u2026\u201d As Yi Yun thought about it, he looked at his surroundings that had turned into a mess.Many of the trees had been split apart by Yi Yun and several black ironstone boulders had been shattered by him. He did not realize that under his trance-like state, he had caused so much damage.\u201cI wonder if I were to fight with Lin Xintong with her third level of Mortal Blood suppressed state, what would be the result? If she were to only use the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, I should be able to easily better her, but if she were to use her specialized skill \u2018Fairy Maiden Heart Sutra\u2019, the result would be unknown.\u201dThinking back to two months ago when he sparred with Lin Xintong. He felt that Lin Xintong had bested him by too much; now with his strength improved, he wouldn\u2019t be that much weaker than the Lin Xintong of old. As he was thinking about that, he felt something and turned around.Just a glance petrified Yi Yun.He gaped for not far from him was\u2026it can\u2019t be!Now, about a dozen feet away from Yi Yun, stood a girl in white up on a pine tree! As the night wind blew, her clothes fluttered in the wind.It was a beautiful picture formed of moon, pine tree, girl and green mountains.Yi Yun was stunned for a while.Lin Xintong!Why was she here?Right, old man Su had said they would come to the Tao tribal clan, but Yi Yun had believed that Lin Xintong and old man Su were only here to train in the Cloud Wilderness, so he would not stay in the Tao tribal clan for long.\u201cYou said, you wanted\u2026to spar with me?\u201d Lin Xintong smiled.Yi Yun was speechless. What was going on, the words he said to himself nearly didn\u2019t sound out, and Yi Yun felt he himself didn\u2019t even hear it.What sort of senses did she have to hear it?Suddenly appearing in front of him at night while wearing white sure seemed like a ghost.Yi Yun was just worrying in his mind when he decided as a man, such a beautiful ghost to appear in front of him was a blessing.\u201cYou have broken through to the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm,\u201d said Lin Xintong calmly, as if stating a fact.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun was stunned for a while for he felt he could not hide anything from Lin Xintong. It was even possible that Lin Xintong had seen him breaking through during the Kingdom\u2019s selection preliminaries.That airship!Yi Yun suddenly recalled that there was an airship in the sky during the Kingdom\u2019s selection preliminaries. Yi Yun had initially thought it was someone like a judge, and did not pay attention.It might be that Lin Xintong was on it.\u201cLady Lin, you saw me participating in the preliminaries?\u201d asked Yi Yun in an unsettled manner. He was extremely conscious about the existence of the Purple Crystal.But upon further thinking, even if Lin Xintong saw the process of him breaking through, she might not be able to tell. It was unlikely she could notice the presence of the Purple Crystal, or even the traces of the Purple Crystal\u2019s absorbing of energy. They were just light dots which she couldn\u2019t see.It was clear that the other party was oblivious when he met old man Su two months ago.\u201cYes, I saw you break through at the preliminaries. You seem different from the rest\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong watched Yi Yun carefully, making Yi Yun uneasy.Upon further thinking, Yi Yun felt that his break through yet again could be explained as the treasure he had previously eaten still had not been fully digested.Actually, Lin Xintong had already noticed that Yi Yun had a secret, but the warriors of this world had too many secrets.Many prodigies had their own fortuitous events.This world had a long history, and many experts had been born out of it. These experts had left behind many opportunites. Some of them were big, some of them small, so obtaining a few was not unusual at all.Lin Xintong had previously explored mysterious ruins, and found some good luck, but some of them were so small that she could not be bothered to collect them.\u201cShall we fight?\u201d Lin Xintong suddenly asked Yi Yun once again.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Another Sparring MatchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92: Another Sparring Match\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun was stumped, are we really sparring? It can\u2019t be, previously it was due to old man Su who fanned the flames making Lin Xintong fight him. Yi Yun could tell that Lin Xintong did not want to fight him back then.Her cultivation level and his cultivation level could not be compared. It would be like an adult bullying a kid.But maybe it was because Lin Xintong did not have any airs, so she did not mind lowering her stature to give him some pointers. Because of this, that battle was fought.But today, what was there to fight? Yi Yun asked puzzledly, \u201cLady Lin, please don\u2019t joke with little me. What\u2019s there to fight between the two of us?\u201dLin Xintong shaked her head, \u201cI don\u2019t like to joke around. As for why I want to battle you, it has to do with a secret of mine.\u201d\u201cSecret?\u201d Yi Yun\u2019s curiosity was aroused. What sort of secret could such an extraordinary girl have?It had to be said as a modern netizen, Yi Yun was quite into gossip. But since she didn\u2019t say, he did not probe further.\u201cBut\u2026my stomach is a bit hungry, I don\u2019t have strength left for the day.\u201d Yi Yun rubbed his stomach with a wry smile.Lin Xintong fluttered down from the pine tree and stood in front of Yi Yun. With a flick of her finger, a light flashed past.Yi Yun catched it without thinking and upon looking at it, it was a red crystal the size of a peanut. It was like crystallized blood and exuded a thick aura of energy.\u201cThis\u2026This can\u2019t be a\u2026desolate bone relic!?\u201d Yi Yun was excited. The legendary desolate bone relics were refined by Desolate Heaven Masters, and worth a fortune. Only the rich and proud could enjoy it.\u201cNo, \u201d Lin Xintong shaked her head. \u201cWith your present strength, if you were to consume a desolate bone relic, you might explode. That\u2019s a fierce beast relic that was refined by me. Usually when the children of large families say they eat desolate bone relics for their cultivation, a large number of them are really eating fierce beast relics such as the one in your hand!\u201d\u201cFierce beast relic\u2026\u201d Yi Yun was stunned but quickly recovered as he understood. Right, there were many times the number of fierce beasts than desolate beasts. In the entire Cloud Wilderness, out of the human\u2019s wonderlands, there were only fierce beasts.These fierce beasts had the power to absorb Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, and through that, they could grow stronger.Killing these fierce beasts could easily allow them to be refined into a relic. Many of these fierce beast relics were consumed by the large family clans.But Lin Xintong said that the beast relic was refined by her. It suddenly occurred to Yi Yun that the girl in front of him was a Desolate Heaven Master, or at least a quasi-Desolate Heaven Master.There was a saying that comparing leads to exasperation. Not only was she of a noble background and extremely strong, she was also a Desolate Heaven Master. Obtaining such achievements at ten-plus years of age sure was exasperating.\u201cYour strength has risen to the Qi Gatherer realm, so I will increase my cultivation level by one, which means I\u2019ll suppress myself to the fourth stage of Mortal Blood to battle you. I will still use the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, but you have to be careful. In the previous battle, I was not serious and because of something, I was distracted during the battle, but this time, I will not be distracted.\u201d Lin Xintong said it faintly. The reason for her distraction during the last battle was naturally due the changes she felt in her meridian channels.Also, Lin Xintong\u2019s meridian channels had some development when she was using \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 against Yi Yun; so this time, she was still going to use \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.\u201cThank you for the lady\u2019s reminder. I will be careful,\u201d Yi Yun was playing with the beast relic in his hand and found that it emitted a tantalising aroma, as if it was an extremely delicious cuisine.Under the moonlike, the relic was red but translucent like a a red crystal.It was indeed a work of art. It was enviable that Lin Xintong could refine such a beautiful fierce beast relic.But no matter how beautiful it was, it had to be eaten because Yi Yun was hungry.He ate it as if he was eating a popcorn, he just threw the beast relic into his mouth.This was the first time he was eating an exquisite food. He realised that the relic was not as hard as he thought it would be, it was chewy and could be crushed with his teeth.As Yi Yun chewed on the beast relic, it was like exquisite wine was gushing out from the relic, filling his whole mouth.\u201cDelicious! Really really delicious! So this is the taste of a fierce beast relic. If I ate this often, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll get addicted! But fierce beast relics can\u2019t replace a proper meal. It\u2019s a totally different sensation from eating a salt-baked chicken.\u201dEating delicacies was an enjoyment, drinking wine was another form of enjoyment, and so was smoking. Although the three were hard to compare, one could not replace the other.With the relic in his stomach, the warm energy from it spread throughout Yi Yun\u2019s body.Yi Yun\u2019s originally empty stomach suddenly filled up as Yi Yun felt the warm energy go wild within his body, making him keen to vent it out.He wanted to really fight a match, immersing himself in battle!Yi Yun looked at Lin Xintong with excitement.Having had his fill, he wanted something to aid in his digestion. With such a high level trainer, how could he not be excited?Although he was at the peak of the Qi Gatherer realm, his strength was naturally great, but that was a flaw. He lacked battle experience that paled in comparison to Lian Chengyu.Lian Chengyu would spar daily with Yao Yuan. With Yao Yuan, a past Purple Blood warrior, he lived a life that dealt with bloodshed. The battle experiences that he taught Lian Chengyu would be extraordinary.As for Yi Yun, he did not know any fighting skills or techniques. All he had was just a Tempered Body, and having only gone through two rounds of true battle, his battle prowess was minimal.Now he could spar with an expert like Lin Xintong, curing him of his weakness.Yi Yun was so excited that he waved towards Lin Xintong to make her move, just short of saying \u2018come at me\u2019.But Yi Yun quickly understood that one shouldn\u2019t get carried away, otherwise one would regret it.Just after he beckoned Lin Xintong to attack, she disappeared from his sight.In a blink of an eye, Lin Xintong seemed to have teleported in front of Yi Yun. All he saw was a blur before he felt a blow on his chest as if a sledgehammer had hit him.\u201cPeng!\u201d Lin Xintong\u2019s palm had hit Yi Yun\u2019s chest. Yi Yun felt as if his bones had deformed and his organs were in turmoil. It was very painful. That girl may look weak, but she was a human Tyrannosaurus!\u201cBoom!\u201dYi Yun crashed into a large tree, breaking it. He saw stars as he struggled to get up. Thankfully, all he ate was a fierce beast relic, if he had eaten something like a salt-baked chicken, he would have vomited everything out.At this moment, Lin Xintong was not looking at Yi Yun but her hands.That mysterious feeling still did not appear from that blow\u2026Was it really just an illusion?Lin Xintong was a bit disappointed as she looked back towards Yi Yun, lightly saying, \u201cYou were too careless. Real warriors constrict their pupils when facing an enemy so they can monitor each and every move of their enemies. Just before I attacked you, your eyes may have been looking at me, but they were not watching my actions but they were watching my face.\u201dWhen Lin Xintong said those words, Yi Yun turned red. This girl\u2019s eyes were really venomous.Even if you noticed that, you shouldn\u2019t have said it out loud!Yi Yun coughed and re-adjusted his mental state and began to seriously look at Lin Xintong\u2019s every move.Yi Yun was indeed too careless previously, looking at Lin Xintong\u2019s face was just a subconscious move. He wasn\u2019t a battle-hardened warrior, so he could not emulate what Lin Xintong said about constricted pupils and the observation of every movement.Lin Xintong may be pretty, but Yi Yun had just met her by chance. He had a favorable impression of her, but did not have any other thoughts.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 - This feeling againPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: This feeling again?Seeing Yi Yun quickly adjusting his mental state and his eyes focused, Lin Xintong gave a satisfied nod. And then, she attacked again! Her speed was as fast as lightning!This time, Yi Yun saw it. He saw the stone by Lin Xintong\u2019s feet break as she stretched out her white as snow palm to his stomach. He could even tell that this stance was the \u2018Fierce Tiger Shatters Jade\u2019 of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.But even then he could not avoid it. Yi Yun had no way of avoiding it, nor even the time to block the attack. He could only subconsciously arch his body to dampen the attack by tightening his muscles to resist the blow!By tightening his abdominal muscles, his resistance to the attack was much stronger. Despite that, Yi Yun still flew backwards and crashed into some rocks. A surge of blood erupted from his throat as he spit out a mouthful of blood.\u201cFast, too fast!\u201d Yi Yun wiped the blood from his lips. A serious Lin Xintong was totally different from the casual Lin Xintong from days ago. And she was still suppressing herself at the fourth stage of Mortal Blood.As a fourth stage against his fifth stage Mortal Blood, how could the gap be that great?Lin Xintong seemed to hear Yi Yun\u2019s thoughts and explained, \u201cTo classify the five stages of Mortal Blood, it is just based on phenomenon, and not a real stage. For example the Thunderous stage just means a person\u2019s bones can emit thunder-like sounds, but\u2026two different warriors who can both create thunderous sounds from their bones, are their strengths the same?\u201dLin Xintong response had cleared Yi Yun\u2019s doubts. Yes, everyone who is at the fifth stage of Mortal Blood was different. Even by suppressing her strength to the fourth stage of Mortal Blood, his fourth stage was a totally different concept.\u201cI understand, take your shot.\u201d Yi Yun knew his strength was inferior to Lin Xintong\u2019s but regardless, an expert had to know how to receive hits before they could deliver hits.If he did not get beaten up, how was he going to accumulate battle experience?But even if he was being abused, Yi Yun did not want to suffer a crushing defeat; he needed to at least regain some of his pride!\u201cPeng!\u201dYi Yun had already been sent flying by Lin Xintong numerous times. This time he was sent flying into the woods, breaking several tree branches.Lin Xintong and Yi Yun both had their own motives. Lin Xintong was looking for the reason her meridians had been activated, while Yi Yun wanted to become strong.\u201cI can\u2019t dodge it, I still can\u2019t dodge it. Her speed is too fast for me and I can barely keep up with her movement. All I see is a blurry afterimage, and in the moment my body wants to react, I would already be hit!\u201dLin Xintong\u2019s strikes were well placed, although it caused Yi Yun\u2019s body to ache, the force she sent in only affected his muscles and bones.Such an attack would not only not cause harm to Yi Yun, but would temper Yi Yun\u2019s body, making his body even purer.This was what Lin Xintong wanted for she did not want to owe him a favor. She was sparring with Yi Yun for her own Yin Meridians.In order to understand the situation she had experienced, she had to beat up Yi Yun; but this made her feel bad. Hence, she decided to help Yi Yun grow stronger and by honing Yi Yun\u2019s combat experience, as a form of compensation.\u201cPhew\u2013Phew\u2013\u201dYi Yun half-squatted on the ground as he held out both arms on a rock, breathing in deeply. From his stance, he looked like the Toad skill practiced by Ouyang Feng.Yi Yun was in this stance because he couldn\u2019t help it.The benefits of half-squatting was the ability to exert strength quickly and without bending his leg, he was able to charge forward. Also by making his body shorter, he reduced the surface area that could be hit. He then had less spots to parry when Lin Xintong attacked.\u201cI can barely see her moves but I can\u2019t avoid them. My body\u2019s speed is slow and is unable to keep up with her. How should I overcome this?\u201dTo overcome his slow body movements seemed like an impossible task.Suddenly, Yi Yun had a sudden flash of brilliance!Right! Previously when I avoided her moves, I had moved my entire body, so I was naturally slower!When Lin Xintong sent a palm strike, Yi Yun was thinking of jumping to the side to totally avoid it, but he could not do it.There was a process for a person\u2019s body to accelerate from rest to motion.If he took a step backwards, he did not need to move his entire body to avoid it. As long as he changed his body\u2019s position, with the smallest of moves, he could avoid the palm?As such Yi Yun\u2019s center of gravity would not change; the only change would be his stance, which would make his avoidance naturally faster!Upon understanding this, Yi Yun felt exceptionally clear in his mind and as if his body was filled with energy.Seeing Lin Xintong\u2019s ankle making a gentle move, Yi Yun knew Lin Xintong was about to strike!Lin Xintong would always make a small movement before striking. In fact she could have totally avoided doing so, but she did it to alert Yi Yun.Yi Yun felt his mind having an unprecedented clarity. His vision was locked on to Lin Xintong\u2019s every move, even the night breeze gave him signals about Lin Xintong.Yi Yun was well aware of Lin Xintong\u2019s heartbeat rate and respiratory rate.\u201cCome!\u201d Yi Yun shouted in his heart and at this time, Lin Xintong made her move!Her speed was fast as usual and in a blink of an eye, she was in front of Yi Yun after traversing a distance of thirty meters.But at that moment, Yi Yun felt that time had suddenly slowed down.This feeling was the same feeling he had months ago when Zhao Tiezhu barged into his house and grabbed him. Yi Yun had the ability to see through Zhao Tiezhu\u2019s movements and had the opportunity to kill him in a split moment.Now, Yi Yun had the same kind of illusion.Lin Xintong\u2019s motions turned slow. In the past, he could only see the blur afterimage of Lin Xintong\u2019s movements, but now he could see every move of Lin Xintong in detail. He could also tell that Lin Xintong\u2019s arm was not straight but bent. Her palm was scrunched up as if she was catching insects as it came to his right chest.\u201cDodge!\u201d Yi Yun gritted his teeth and by sending strength to his legs, he bent his hips sharply, twisting his spine in a awkward position. It was as if his body was about to lose its balance!Yi Yun\u2019s right chest, which was where Lin Xintong was aiming, quickly moved backwards, while Yi Yun\u2019s left arm moved forward with his hands forming a fist.By tilting his body to the point of having almost lost his balance, Yi Yun managed to avoid Lin Xintong\u2019s strike!\u201cCha!\u201dThe recoil from the punch tore off the shirt on Yi Yun\u2019s chest! His chest burned with pain!Even after avoiding Lin Xintong\u2019s attack, it was still so painful!?This little girl sure didn\u2019t pull her punches!Yi Yun vented in his heart. He clearly understood the words Lin Xintong had said before they began their battle, \u201cIn the previous battle, I was not serious.\u201dIt was impolite not to reciprocate; Yi Yun had been taking hits all night, and had finally managed to avoid Lin Xintong\u2019s attack, how could he afford to give up the chance of a counterattack?Just before his body lost its balance, he had sent out a left punch, attacking Lin Xintong\u2019s belly!At this moment, Yi Yun\u2019s body was very close to Lin Xintong body, so close that he could smell the fragrance from Lin Xintong. This blow\u2019s angle was extremely tricky as it stuck close to Lin Xintong\u2019s body!\u201cPeng!\u201dYi Yun\u2019s body emitted a sound. This was his tendons tightening up. Yi Yun had managed to master Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist to the point where every fist of his instinctively included the strength of his tendons!Hit, he was almost about to hit her!Yi Yun\u2019s heart was crying out loud but at this time, as compared to Yi Yun who was highly concentrated, Lin Xintong had entered a temporary inattentive state.At the moment her palm brushed past Yi Yun\u2019s chest, Lin Xintong felt a tiny surge of coolness. This coolness had entered her meridian channels, as if a drop of water had dripped into a dried up well. Although it disappeared instantaneously, this feeling was enough to make Lin Xintong lose her concentration.It\u2019s this feeling again!?\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 - What do you want to do to mePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: What do you want to do to me?At that moment, Lin Xintong felt that mysterious feeling again; she felt her body start to burn up. Yi Yun\u2019s punch had already hit her belly!\u201cOh!?\u201dIn quick response, Lin Xintong\u2019s body rapidly retreated backwards. Her retreating speed was even faster than Yi Yun\u2019s punch.Although Yi Yun had managed to make contact with her body due to her moment of distraction, the moment she came to, Yi Yun could not keep up with her speed.Yi Yun\u2019s punch had clearly hit Lin Xintong\u2019s body, but due to her quick retreat, she had not received the full brunt of the force. Yi Yun felt like he had punched a ball of cotton.Yi Yun\u2019s raised his brow. He had been beaten all night and finally managed to hit Lin Xintong once, but Lin Xintong had retreated so quickly, it was as if he had never hit her.Yi Yun could not accept it. He did not want to let Lin Xintong retreat fully, so he charged forward forming his fists into a claw as he scratched forward.This was the stance of \u201cTiger Claws Smite Rocks\u201d. When Yi Yun issued the move, a tiger\u2019s phantom image manifested from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi had formed behind him.\u201cRoar!\u201dThe tiger roared as it pounced towards Lin Xintong. At that moment, Lin Xintong could even feel the wind brought forth from the tiger. This feeling was as if a real tiger was pouncing towards her.\u201cHuh!?\u201dSeeing the tiger phantom image, Lin Xintong was surprised. This act of surprise had made her footsteps slightly slower. With that, Yi Yun managed to grab the ribbon by her waist.\u201cPeng!\u201dThe tiger phantom image exploded in front of Lin Xintong. At the same time, with a ripping sound, as she tried to attack and defend, Lin Xintong\u2019s ribbon by her waist had been ripped open!\u201cYou!\u201dLin Xintong\u2019s reactions were extremely quick. With a quick rotation, she was covered with Yuan Qi as she flew up to a pine tree.As for that ribbon, it was left in Yi Yun\u2019s hands.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yi Yun froze.Lin Xintong looked angrily at Yi Yun. Yi Yun looked at the ribbon in his hand and the Lin Xintong standing on the pine tree. The situation quickly turned awkward.Actually it was no big deal having a ribbon torn off, but since the ribbon was located at Lin Xintong\u2019s waist, it made Yi Yun feel awkward.\u201cI did not do it on purpose, besides\u2026\u201d Yi Yun innocently pointed to his right chest, which had been ripped apart by the wind generated by Lin Xintong\u2019s palm.Yi Yun\u2019s meaning was clear. You tore my clothes and even revealed my skin, while I just pulled a strap of yours\u2026Of course, compared to Lin Xintong\u2019s clothes, Yi Yun\u2019s clothes were ugly.Lin Xintong did not know to cry or laugh, but she did not pursue further. In her eyes, Yi Yun was just a child.A twelve-year-old child naturally could not have any bad intentions.Although the reason why Yi Yun could tear off her strap had to do with her being distracted, it was still impressive. It was because Yi Yun had managed to avoid her palm strike.Lin Xintong was surprised that Yi Yun could progress so quickly from just a day\u2019s fight.She never gave Yi Yun pointers on his movements, and Yi Yun grasped them all by himself.Yi Yun having managed to avoid her palm may sound simple, but it was hard to do in practice. It had a special name for it, known as, \u201cMinute Subtlety\u201d, by using the smallest of moves to avoid an enemy\u2019s attack, one could reduce greatly the flaws in one\u2019s movement. It could also allow one to stick closely to the enemy, and counterattack when the enemy\u2019s move is almost done.To be able to do this at twelve years old, Yi Yun would be considered quite a genius. Of course in terms of genius, it only referred to his perceptivity and his body\u2019s coordination.Besides\u2026The thing that made Lin Xintong most concerned about was the strange reaction within her meridian channels at that moment\u2026In this world, few people were born with Yin Meridians. Compounded with the fact that people with Yin Meridians were considered to have a terminal condition, these people could not live long. Commoners with the condition would usually die around the age of twenty; even in a martial family, few families would spend the resources needed to nurture a person with this terminal condition.So there were very few records of Yin Meridians, just a few records that said something along the lines of \u201cYin Meridians are terminated meridians, without cure, without chance of practicing martial arts\u201d. Lin Xintong was searching for a way to open up her Yin Meridians.Now, although Yi Yun\u2019s body had resulted in a mysterious phenomenon for Lin Xintong, she did not know what it meant.\u201cYi Yun,\u201d Lin Xintong softly spoke.\u201cYes, Sister Goddess, what orders do you have?\u201d Yi Yun appeared very obedient and his speech was sweet to the ears.Lin Xintong descended from the pine tree, \u201cThe move, \u2018Tiger Claws Smite Rocks\u2019 that you used, formed a tiger phantom image from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi behind you, did you notice that?\u201dA tiger phantom image formed from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi?Yi Yun shook his head. When he used \u2018Tiger Claws Smite Rocks\u2019, he only had one thought, and that was to not lose totally, and as for the strike having an impressive aura, he was not aware of it.Yi Yun remembered that in the wuxia dramas he had seen, when skills such as the \u2018Eighteen Dragon Subduing Palms\u2019 were used, there would be a golden dragon flying in the sky. The phantom image formed from the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi he punched out was probably similar to that.Lin Xintong said, \u201cA warrior\u2019s every move and gesture can affect the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi. At a certain level, when a warrior attacks, the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi will automatically form a phantom image. This is usually an ability people have only after reaching the Purple Blood realm. But you are just in the Qi Gatherer realm. Logically speaking, you should not have such an ability.\u201d\u201cBut, since you have \u2018Tempered Body, Dragon Pulse\u2019, your meridian channels are wider than an ordinary warrior\u2019s. It might be wider that those of a warrior at the middle stages of the Purple Blood realm, so that\u2019s why you can punch out a phantom image formed from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi!\u201d\u201cBy infusing Heaven Earth Yuan Qi into your moves, it can strengthen and increase the speed of your moves! Besides that, the movement you used to avoid my palm strike, that is the introductory stage to a movement technique known as \u2018Minute Subtlety\u2019. By using the smallest actions to avoid an enemy\u2019s attack, this is known as \u2018Minute Subtlety\u2019! This \u2018Minute Subtlety\u2019 technique, after the introductory stage is known as the small success stage, which can borrow the opponent\u2019s \u2018force\u2019 to aid in avoiding. Even if I said more, it will be hard for you to comprehend. Everything will depend on your own enlightenment.\u201d\u201cBy being able to do those two things in the Qi Gatherer realm is quite impressive. You need to slowly chip away at it to understand its wonder.\u201d Hearing Lin Xintong\u2019s compliment, Yi Yun scratched his head. Heaven Earth Yuan Qi phantom image, Minute Subtlety movement\u2026Yi Yun did not know anything about this, but after being reviewed by Lin Xintong, he had learned a lot from her. At least in the short run, he had a goal which was to ponder over the two techniques.As for the Minute Subtlety\u2019s small success stage, by using the \u201cforce\u201d to avoid. These things that sounded too mysterious to him were ignored.\u201cYi Yun,\u201d Lin Xintong opened her mouth again.\u201cYes Sister Goddess, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yi Yun had noticed that Lin Xintong had something on her mind but was hesitant on saying it.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong bit her lips as she looked at Yi Yun\u2019s palm.The both times she had felt that strange phenomenon was when she touched Yi Yun\u2019s body.The contact with Yi Yun\u2019s body during their battle had been fleeting, but, what if they remained in contact for a longer period of time? Would something special happen?Aware of this possibility, Lin Xintong could not help thinking of verifying it.But, to proactively touch someone\u2019s body of the opposite s*x was awkward. Also if she made the request, people might find it strange.\u201cHe\u2019s just a child, it should be okay\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong said to herself as she beckoned Yi Yun over.Unsure of the reason, Yi Yun obediently went before Lin Xintong.She did not know what Lin Xintong wanted, but the next words of Lin Xintong left him dumbfounded.\u201cCan I touch your hand?\u201dLin Xintong could not think of any euphemistic expression and decided to just be direct.\u201cEh?\u201dYi Yun did not have time to react because her request was extremely strange.\u201cWhat do you want to do to me?\u201dWith those words, Lin Xintong choked.\u201cI\u2026\u201dA twelve-year-old child is usually muddle headed. When an elder sister says those words, a child would just stretch his hand out without knowing what is it about?But Yi Yun\u2019s rebuttal had rooted Lin Xintong to the ground.\u201cI\u2026 just want to verify something\u2026\u201dLin Xintong had trouble saying those words because it was embarrassing.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But since she did not explain herself, he knew he would not have received an answer. He could feel that Lin Xintong was a pure and noble girl. One could feel that in the middle of Lin Xintong\u2019s clear eyes was innocence.Yi Yun obediently stretched out his hand.Seeing Yi Yun\u2019s hand, Lin Xintong hesitantly took a step forward, closing the gap. She said, \u201cRaise up your palm.\u201dYi Yun followed and upon seeing Yi Yun\u2019s palm, Lin Xintong\u2019s cheeks turned slightly red as she hesitated for a moment before stretching her hand to meet Yi Yun\u2019s palm.Under the pine tree, they stood three feet apart from each other with their palms locked. Under the bright moon, the two figure\u2019s shadows were merging together. Such a picturesque scene seemed to have frozen for eternity.\u201cSo cold!\u201d This was Yi Yun\u2019s first thought. Although when he sparred with Lin Xintong, and had made contact with her body, due to the presence of energy, Yi Yun could never feel the touch of Lin Xintong.But today, he could feel it in the raw. It was cold and soft to the touch, like the touching of a pool of clear water.Why is it so cold?Both their palms were about the same size and they were a perfect fit.Lin Xintong closed her eyes as her eyelashes trembled slightly, as if she was hoping to feel something with her eyes closed.As she remained quiet, Yi Yun also stayed silent.\u201cThis feeling\u2026\u201d Lin Xintong closed her eyes and searched for any changes to her meridians. She had a strange feeling that the child in front of her was like an endless star-filled night sky.As for her, it was as if she was swimming within this night sky, and deeply experiencing the vast expanse of the night sky.It was a miraculous feeling. Although she knew it was an illusion, it felt very real.As such, Lin Xintong could not help but opening her eyes midway.Under the faint starlight, an immature but surprisingly handsome face appeared in front of her. Those eyes were black and bright, like the world\u2019s purest black gemstone.And facing this black gemstone, Lin Xintong could clearly see her own reflection.\u201cOh!\u201dThis scene, for some unknown reason left a deep impression on Lin Xintong. She subconsciously took a few steps back, as if she had been frightened by something.\u201cNo!\u201dAlthough in that split moment, Lin Xintong had experienced an illusion, the feeling that she had been searching for, the thing that had activated her meridian channels did not appear.It was like running after a shadow with no trace to be found.Lin Xintong was disappointed.But what was that star-filled like illusion from just now?Lin Xintong hesitated for a while before locking palms with Yi Yun again. Once again, there was nothing. She did not feel anything in her meridians nor did she experience the illusion of the star-filled sky.She looked up and saw that the moon hung in the sky as if nothing had changed.Lin Xintong sighed, had she failed in her search? But when she pondered about it, she realised that there was nothing to be disappointed about. In fact, this was normal. How could she have subconsciously believed that a child like Yi Yun was able to join up her terminated meridians?That would be impossible\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll look for you tomorrow night at this time and in this spot.\u201d With those words, Lin Xintong floated away and was gone with the wind.Yi Yun was still filled with questions. He did not know why Lin Xintong had approached him for a fight. But he was not worried because it was beneficial for him, and it was something he yearned for.After Lin Xintong left, Yi Yun was not in a hurry to leave. Although it was already late at night, he had just eaten one fierce beast relic, and his body was still overflowing with energy, so how could he waste this precious opportunity to train? He could train only when his body had energy, it was impossible to train without energy.After sparring, Yi Yun had some insight he needed to ponder over. First of all, it was the phantom image formed from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, and the other was the Minute Subtlety movement technique!The path of martial arts needed talent, but it needed hard work even more. A talented person who did not have the will to practise would still fall behind.Yi Yun\u2019s talent may not be good, but with the Purple Crystal making up for it, he was not worried.But nothing could make up for hard work, he had to rely on himself.Punch after punch was sent into the vacant air!\u201cPeng Peng Peng!\u201dA big black ironstone was shattered by Yi Yun, sending its stone chips flying!But it was a pity that the tiger phantom image formed from the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi did not appear. As for the Minute Subtlety movement technique, he needed a person to further his understanding.Hence, Yi Yun could not make any progress on those two techniques.On the contrary, Yi Yun entered a trance like state.In an unseen world, Yi Yun began to appreciate the wonders of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. It was a mysterious feeling but when Yi Yun tried grasping it, he could not\u2026\u201cMaster, he managed to form a phantom image from Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, and realized the Minute Subtlety movement technique.\u201d In the woods, Lin Xintong was silently staring at Yi Yun\u2019s practicing figure while speaking to old man Su beside her.\u201cYes\u2026I saw it. This kid\u2019s perceptivity sure is not bad. He didn\u2019t only comprehend these two things\u2026 We shall wait and see what else he has in store for us. Tomorrow is the Kingdom\u2019s selection\u2019s semi-finals and I still want to see his performance!\u201dThe Kingdom\u2019s selection\u2019s preliminaries had injured many, but the Jin Long Wei did not plan to give the injured much time to rest.In Zhang Tan\u2019s words, the moment a battle begins, it would be like a storm. Would the enemy give you time to rest?Yi Yun practiced all night till the break of dawn before returning to his residence. He was exhausted.The moment Yi Yun\u2019s head hit the bed he fell into deep sleep. In his dream, the Purple Crystal was slowly absorbing the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi around him, slowly recovering Yi Yun\u2019s strength.In his deep sleep, Yi Yun was still cultivating in his dreams.In a blur, he felt like he was by a cliff and above the cliff were a flying dragon and a fierce tiger who fighting it out!It was a bustling scene where the earth trembled and the mountains swayed!This dragon was like the Jin dragon on the Jin Long Wei\u2019s flag, and that tiger was the Fierce Divine Tiger Yi Yun saw during the preliminaries.This dragon-tiger battle made the heavens rend asunder and the earth cracked.In legends, peerless experts would learn a peerless skill from watching divine beasts fighting.At this moment, Yi Yun was gaining further insight from this strange dream. He grew a deeper understanding for \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.But when he woke up, all his understanding was a blur, recalling it was like chasing shadows.Yi Yun tried his best to recall but could not remember a thing.Such a pity.Yi Yun sighed with emotion. In ancient China, Confucius would dream of the Duke of Zhou frequently. The Duke of Zhou would tell him the ways of the world; and when Confucius woke up, he would gain some understanding. Sometimes, dreams was a great inspiration for people.Looking out of the window, it was already late in the morning.Yi Yun had slept for about three hours, but because it was in deep sleep, and with the Purple Crystal replenishing his energy, three hours of sleep was enough to push Yi Yun\u2019s mental state to its peak.\u201cTime to participate in the semi-finals.\u201d Yi Yun leaped up. He had already decided that he wanted to obtain the Mortal Blood\u2019s first place standing in the selection, and become an elite member of the Jin Long Wei!\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - The Semi-finals BeginPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96: The Semi-finals BeginThe people did not know the examination topic for the Kingdom\u2019s selection\u2019s semi-finals. Yi Yun arrived at the plains of the city\u2019s outskirts while hearing a flurry of discussion about the semi-finals\u2019 examination topic.Many disqualified participants and the citizens from nearby had gathered to watch the semi-finals, causing the venue to be packed with tens of thousands of people.The plains on the Tao tribal clan\u2019s city outskirts did not have a grand stand. The people in the front could see, but the people in the back couldn\u2019t. Even so, many refused to leave.In a while, the place was packed with people and the Tao tribal clan had to use the members of their warrior camp to maintain the order, in order to prevent a stampede from occurring.It turned out that it was necessary for the Tao tribal clan\u2019s upper echelon to send out men from the warrior camp to maintain order. The moment the Tao tribal clan\u2019s first and second young master appeared, the crowd exploded with unprecedented excitement.These first and second young master were the idols of the Tao tribal clan, especially the first young master, Hu Ya. He was eighteen, quiet and had a nonchalant attitude. He seldom appeared and kept things low-key, giving out a sense of mystery. This, along with his cold but handsome face, led many girls in the Tao tribal clan to worship him.This was especially because Hu Ya had reached the middle stage of Purple Blood, and was just a step away from reaching the \u201cTempered Body, Dragon Pulse\u201d state.In the vast wilderness, there was a lack of resources, and the heritage was lacking compared to the central heartlands. For the first young master to be close to the point of the \u2018Tempered Body, Dragon Pulse\u2019 state, in such conditions was a miracle.Because of this, the people of the Tao tribal clan were extremely proud of him!They had placed a lot of hope on their first young master Hu Ya!When Hu Ya appeared, many young girls began chanting Hu Ya\u2019s name, and some fainted with excitement.This scene reminded Yi Yun of concerts he had participated in. Some fans would go into shock upon seeing their idols; and in the vast wilderness where strength was everything, as a martial arts prodigy, Hu Ya\u2019s charisma exceeded the celebrities of Yi Yun\u2019s past.After Hu Ya was the second young master, Tao Yun who had received a lot of cheering.Following them were the seven Purple Blood realm warriors. Their ages ranged from twenty to twenty-eight. Compared to Hu Ya or Tao Yun, they were much less popular.Besides that, many elders of the Tao tribal clan had come. They represented the ruling class of the Tao tribal clan. As rulers, they had their dignity. It would be unsightly to squeeze amongst the crowd, so they had arranged for a row of tables to be placed, like a platform. There was even tea and fruits on the table.The main examiner of this semi-final was still Zhang Tan.About ten minutes before the semi-finals began; he rode a horse into the center of the arena.A few elders invited Zhang Tan to come to the \u201cplatform\u201d, but Zhang Tan simply ignored them. He stood in front of all the participants as his sharp gaze swept across the sixty warriors.At that moment, several elders of the Tao tribal clan felt confused. They did not know whether to sit or stand. With Zhang Tan standing there, did they have the nerve to sit down?Looking at each other, they decided to stand by their seats. It was like school children being punished by their teacher by making them stand by their seats. It was extremely awkward.The Mortal Blood warriors and Purple Blood warriors were split into two groups.For the semi-finals, it was just going through the motion for the Purple Blood warriors. If they were not too terrible, they would all pass.But for the Mortal Blood warriors, it was totally different. They would face intense competition!\u201cThe Tai Ah Divine Kingdom warrior selection semi-finals shall begin now!\u201d Zhang Tan held his horsewhip and exclaimed loudly.\u201cI shall announce the semi-final\u2019s rules!\u201dWith a wave of his hand, a white light shot into the sky and began to grow, it eventually became a white jade stone stage.This white jade stone stage was about ten meters per side. It steadily floated, hanging in the sky.The four sides of the stone stage had four columns. Each column had one blood-red crystal, these crystals were desolate bone relics.It was clear that the jade stage had some spell on it and was powered by the desolate beast relic. It was a treasure!But no one knew what the stage was going to be used for.Zhang Tan stood on the jade stage saying, \u201cWhen a warrior practices martial arts, they have to accept their heritage. The heritage comprises of cultivation techniques, movement techniques, mystic techniques, soul cultivation techniques, fighting techniques and various other techniques. The most basic of them is the cultivation technique! This will immediately decide the progress of your cultivation. It will decide if you can exceed Mortal Blood, or even exceed Purple Blood in the future!\u201d\u201cYour martial arts are still considered in the beginning stages. Your Spirit and cultivation techniques, that I will test are the most basic things. It will almost determine your success in the future. So try to do your best!\u201d\u201cNow, all of you will come up to this white jade stage and demonstrate publicly the cultivation technique you practiced. At the same time report your age and I\u2019ll grade you!\u201d\u201cThis white jade stage is a cultivation treasure used by the Jin Long Wei elite. A famous refiner master in the Kingdom created it. By using desolate bone relics to power it, it can gather Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, ensuring that you will be in your optimal state when you demonstrate your cultivation technique!\u201dWith those words, a \u201cbang\u201d could be heard as the white jade stage had fell to the ground, giving rise to a cloud of dust.\u201cSo it\u2019s to demonstrate cultivation technique!\u201d Among the Mortal Blood participants, Tao Yunxiao was standing right in front. Hearing Zhang Tan\u2019s words, his lips curled into a smile.He already had a well-thought-out plan!The ideal semi-final for him was to enter into real battle, but to demonstrate his cultivation technique was the same. By using the trump card of the Tao tribal clan, he could sweep the audience of their feet!\u201cWe will begin with the Mortal Blood group. Once I shout out your name, you can go up and perform!\u201d\u201cFirst person, Sun Yu!\u201dZhang Tan shouted out a name. Sun Yu was a heir nurtured from a small tribal clan. He had never expected to be first, so he was a little nervous.With a deep breath, Sun Yu calmed down and leapt onto the stage.\u201cSun Yu, twenty years old, demonstrating cultivation technique: \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019!\u201dIn the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was the number one Mortal Blood cultivation technique, so there were many people who practiced it. Besides the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was a high grade technique and a great cultivation technique.Unfortunately, Sun Yu was born from a small tribal clan. A small tribal clan from the vast wilderness had little contact with the central heartlands, so Sun Yu\u2019s \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, which was obtained from the Tao tribal clan, thus it was incomplete. It paled in comparison to Lian Chengyu, who had Yao Yuan as a teacher.As such, Sun Yu\u2019s performance was mediocre and could not demonstrate the full power of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. His tendons and bones could only emit a slight sound, and was far from the standard of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.Tao Yunxiao sneered. He was not bothered by this level of cultivation.\u201cNext, Zhou Kang!\u201dZhang Tan\u2019s reaction to Sun Yu\u2019s performance was expressionless. It was as if he did not see it. After Sun Yu left the stage, Zhang Tan immediately shouted the second name.Zhou Kang was an elite nurtured by the Tao tribal clan. He too demonstrated \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 but compared to Sun Yu, his \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was much fiercer since Zhou Kang had a master who was at the peak of the Purple Blood realm.Each blow was packed with a punch, and was accompanied by a crackling sound in the bones!\u201cKa-cha!\u201dWhen Zhou Kang shot out his last punch, he jumped off the white jade stage onto a clearing, with a \u201cTiger Descends Flattening To Dust\u201d stance, he kicked a granite stone the size of a human head into pieces!\u201cGood!\u201dIn the crowd, many of them cheered.Zhang Tan remained deadpan, \u201cNext, Cheng Pingguang!\u201d\u2026\u201cNext, Lin Jun!\u201d\u2026\u201cNext\u2026\u201dZhang Tan shouted out the names of about fifty Mortal Blood warriors without any expression. After about four hours, the weaker ones had finished their demonstration, leaving only the best among the Mortal Blood warriors. That of course included Tao Yunxiao and Yi Yun.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They would then find any rock they didn\u2019t like the look of and send a punch towards it, smashing it to piece as a demonstration of their strength. There were all types of rocks everywhere around the arena, from granite with normal hardness to black ironstone of extreme hardness!The weaker ones would smash granite rocks, while the stronger ones would smash black ironstone. Some of the elites of the Tao tribal clan could fracture three-foot-wide black ironstone with one punch!Although it was implied that it was not a test of the power of a fist technique when Zhang Tan mentioned that the lack of a uniform standard, the contestants were secretly competing amongst themselves. The target they attacked could express the limits of their strengthAs the end of the line of participants was reached, the black ironstone sizes that were broken became larger, making it more competitive!This aroused the crowd to cheer as they shouted with excitement.\u201cNext, Lian Chengyu!\u201dZhang Tan shouted again. It was finally Lian Chengyu\u2019s turn!\u201cYoung Master Lian is sure to win!\u201d\u201cYoung Master will live for many generations, he will unify the wilderness!\u201dWhen Lian Chengyu came to the stage, the members of the warrior preparation camp who were jostling in the crowd began to shout. Ever since Zhao Tiezhu was taken down, the members of the warrior preparation camp fought to become the number one henchman under Lian Chengyu. These warrior preparation camp members could not do well at the kingdom\u2019s selection, but among normal people, they were a lot stronger. So even in a crowd of ten thousand people, they were able to squeeze to the very front and cheer on Lian Chengyu.One of them was extremely good at sucking up to Lian Chengyu; Yi Yun did not know his name, but every time he saw him, he would subconsciously label him as \u201cZhao Tiezhu the second\u201d.This time, \u201cZhao Tiezhu the second\u201d shouted so loud, that even Lian Chengyu felt uncomfortable. The words \u201cfor many generations, he will unify the wilderness\u201d was fine when used in their own territory, but to shout that in the Tao tribal clan, at the selection\u2019s public venue was ridiculous!Indeed, the surrounding people of the Tao tribal clan began to laugh.Lian Chengyu coughed dryly and stood on the stage, ignoring the members of the warrior preparation camp. He closed his eyes in concentration and began to perceive the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.This white jade stage was a Jin Long Wei treasure; hence, there was an extremely dense Heaven Earth Yuan Qi on the white jade stage!\u201cIt feels great!\u201d Lian Chengyu took a deep breath and began demonstrating his cultivation technique, which was of course \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d!It had to be said that Lian Chengyu\u2019s \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d was extraordinary!When he performed \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, he would stir the surrounding Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, forming into an invisible air flow, sending them wafting in all directions.The demonstration of an expert was obvious.Many of the Tao tribal clan elders that stood by the platform had teasing smiles on their faces, but when they saw what unfolded in front of them, they slowly wiped it off their faces. After all, Lian Chengyu could be considered a talent for someone his attainments despite growing up in a small tribal clan.Lian Chengyu\u2019s \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d was a complete version as well.Technically, Yi Yun was also a student of Yao Yuan, despite only secretly learned from him. Many things were not taught by Yao Yuan publicly but were taught privately to Lian Chengyu. This was not because Yao Yuan had meant to keep them secret, but rather that Zhao Tiezhu and company would not have been able to comprehend those things even if he had taught them publicly.But even if Lian Chengyu managed to demonstrate a complete version of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, to Yi Yun there were multiple flaws in his demonstration!Yi Yun\u2019s \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d came from Lin Xintong. It was, of course, a complete version and also the truest version of the Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist in the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom. The drawn pictures were more profound than the normally inscribed versions.Just Lin Xintong\u2019s \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d manual alone was priceless, not to mention Lin Xintong\u2019s commentary in the manual.Lin Xintong was an extremely serious girl. Every understanding she had from browsing through the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 manual was written down meticulously. Yi Yun benefited much from it because Lin Xintong was standing on a completely different level.Yi Yun could guess that Lin Xintong came from some superior sect or ancient family clan.Lin Xintong\u2019s understanding of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 also represented the profound ancient family clans. How could a tribe in the vast wilderness compare?As Lian Chengyu demonstrated \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, Yi Yun began to carefully count all the imperfections in Lian Chengyu\u2019s movements.Although Lian Chengyu\u2019s every move looked perfect in the eyes of many, Yi Yun was still able to find faults in them.Up to this point, Yi Yun had already counted twenty-eight flaws.It was hard to imagine that, even with Lian Chengyu\u2019s high-speed movements, Yi Yun was able to catch every flaw in his moves sharply. This was also because Yi Yun was getting stronger and his senses were getting sharper.If Yi Yun was to battle Lian Chengyu in a death match, then Yi Yun could exploit Lian Chengyu\u2019s flaws and defeat him!By spotting the twenty-eight flaws, it meant that Lian Chengyu was no longer a match for Yi Yun in a direct battle.\u201cPa! Pa! Pa! Pa!\u201dAt that moment, Lian Chengyu\u2019s body was emitting the sounds of exploding bones.And after that, \u201cPeng! Peng! Peng!\u201dLike a strong bow being pulled, this was his tendons shouting in unison!The essence of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d was to train the bones and tendons. The aim of \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d was to train a warrior\u2019s body to the point of having dragon ribs and tiger bones.So having the bones and tendons sound was the most important symbol of having mastered \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d.\u201cHa!\u201dWith a large shout, Lian Chengyu jumped off the white jade stage and hit a black ironstone the size of a roller.\u201cKa-cha!\u201dWith a tremor, the black ironstone shattered!Lian Chengyu\u2019s fists were numb, but his eyes were filled with excitement.He succeeded! He had achieved optimal performance. That punch was also Lian Chengyu\u2019s maximum attack power. His every move could be said to be perfect.Lian Chengyu was satisfied with himself. He retracted his reddening fist and loosened his fingers. With a smile, he looked at the crowd and landed his eyes on Yi Yun.His eyes indicated a hint of provocation.He may have lost to Yi Yun at the preliminaries, but it was natural for him to exceed Yi Yun in the semi-finals. Yi Yun was only strong in Spirit, but Spirit was just an empty show of strength. In a real fight, one needed real skill and strength!Although the semi-finals did not compare their strength, it was not much different to comparing cultivation techniques!Lian Chengyu knew that Yi Yun\u2019s cultivation technique was the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. Although Yi Yun had another \u2018Elephant Swallowing Technique\u2019, it was a mystic technique that aided in cultivation, but it wasn\u2019t a cultivation technique, so Yi Yun could only demonstrate \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.Previously, everyone would display the strength of their \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 and attack a piece of black ironstone to test their destructive power.If Yi Yun wanted to stand out, he naturally had to showcase his fist technique\u2019s\u2019 power to obtain that impossible first place.But how much destructive power could Yi Yun\u2019s fist technique have? Could he even shatter a black ironstone the size of a face basin? He might even have to hit a granite rock.To Lian Chengyu, Yi Yun\u2019s level was at most at the peak of the Meridians realm. This was already an overvaluation. Even if Yi Yun was at the beginning stages of the Qi Gatherer realm, so what? Yi Yun\u2019s fist technique was obtained through improper channels. It was a question if Yi Yun could even perform the complete set of Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist having secretly learned from Yao Yuan, so how could his performance be brilliant?Lian Chengyu descended from the stage.The order of the semi-finals was according to the rankings of the preliminaries. Those who were ranked at the top in the first round were naturally the last to perform on stage.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Besides Yi Yun, the other four participants were elites nurtured by the Tao tribal clan.These Tao tribal clan elites were stronger than Lian Chengyu in every aspect. This was because they had masters at the peak of the Purple Blood realm in the Tao tribal clan and these masters were much stronger than Yao Yuan.Even Lian Chengyu had to admit that their \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was demonstrated with might. The level of their demonstration was much more powerful than his!This made Lian Chengyu feel uneasy.He had barely entered the top five in the preliminaries. It was not a done deal to enter the top five in the semi-finals.Besides, Zhang Tan said that the Kingdom\u2019s selection had three rounds. Lian Chengyu did not know if the third round\u2019s topic would be something he was good at. Now that Tao Yunxiao and the nine Purple Blood realm warriors had already taken ten spots, there were not many spots left. Lian Chengyu felt a sense of urgency.Three Tao tribal clan elites finished demonstrating one after the other.The next person was: Tao Yunxiao!As a person at the peak of the Mortal Blood realm, Tao Yunxiao was put in the limelight.And Tao Yunxiao was on his home ground, so the surrounding audience was mostly filled with people from the Tao tribal clan. As the third young master of the Tao tribal clan, he obtained cheers from the crowd the moment he appeared!Under such a cheering scene, Tao Yunxiao felt confident and he had a well-thought-out plan!He strode onto the white jade stage. He was sure he would win this stage and he would win by a mile!For the semi-finals, his father and the Tao tribal clan\u2019s elders had given him a surprise! Tao Yunxiao was confident that this surprise would be able to make the semi-finals into a one-man show!Standing on the stage while under the eyes of many, Tao Yunxiao exuded pride!This was a stage that belonged to him, the starting point of his brilliant future!He loved that feeling.As his glance swept the crowd, he looked at the Mortal Blood realm participants. Tao Yunxiao\u2019s lips curled into a smile; as for Yi Yun, he no longer noticed him.Tao Yunxiao wanted these people to know the huge difference between him and the other contestants. He wanted them to know what it meant to be a frog in the well!Tao Yunxiao waved and an elder came forward holding a long object wrapped in silk with both hands before passing it to Tao Yunxiao.It was a sword!\u201cA weapon?\u201d The people were shocked because so far, no one had used a weapon on stage.It was not difficult to get started with weapons. Even someone like Zhao Tiezhu could grab a large saber and dance with it with great extravagance.But a real warrior would not only just pose with their weapons. They would infuse their martial arts into the weapon, making the weapon part of them.Most fist or leg skills were easier to manage. As for weapons like sabers, swords or halberds, it was not easy to utilize them as if they were a limb.Warriors below the Purple Blood realm would muster their strength to break through to the Purple Blood realm, so they would not pay extra effort to cultivate their weapon skills.But today on the white jade stage, Tao Yunxiao had taken out a sword. It was naturally not just for show, but also to reveal his real skill!Tao Yunxiao was a warrior of the sword.At fourteen years of age, he was no doubt a cultivation genius by being at the peak of the Mortal Blood realm and having cultivated a sword technique.Even Zhang Tan, who saw Tao Yunxiao solemnly untying the cloth around the sword, was surprised.He too wanted to know the level Tao Yunxiao had attained in his sword technique.When the cloth was fully removed, what appeared to the masses was a two-foot-long short sword.The sword\u2019s pommel was unsophisticated while the sword\u2019s hilt was covered in old snakeskin\u2026Looking at this sword, the elders of the Tao tribal clan standing on the platform had mixed expressions, but they also looked proud.This sword was their Tao tribal clan\u2019s ancestral artifact!Tao tribal clan\u2019s ancestral artifact was a pair of swords, a male and female sword.The sword in Tao Yunxiao\u2019s hand was a female sword.\u201cGrand Elder, why did you agree to Yunxiao\u2019s use of the ancestral artifact? Aren\u2019t you afraid that it would be coveted by others, causing a calamity to our Tao tribal clan?\u201dThe two ancestral artifacts of the Tao tribal clan was how they had kept their foothold. In the past when desolate beasts attacked, the peak Purple Blood realm warriors in the tribe would use the ancestral artifact to battle the desolate beasts.Not only that, this pair of swords was able to condense Qi to cleanse a person\u2019s body. Training was more effective when both the male and female swords were used!But today, for a kingdom\u2019s selection, the Tao tribal clan\u2019s Patriarch have given the female ancestral weapon to Tao Yunxiao for demonstration purposes! It sounded incredible.The Tao tribal clan\u2019s Grand Elder was a thin person. He mused, \u201cThe Tai Ah Divine Kingdom is such a behemoth. Why would they care about our two ancestral artifacts? Revealing our ancestral artifact might cause trouble, but if we kept our secret, and never face the challenges posed to us, then our Tao tribal clan would eventually be destroyed.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time we show our strength and foundation. This kingdom\u2019s selection is the best opportunity to show it off. We can\u2019t forever stay in this poor wasteland of the Cloud Wilderness. We need to leave this place and create our own family clan!\u201dIn the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, family clans were not a trifling matter.Tribes such as the Lian tribe and the Tao tribe was just known as \u201ctribal clans\u201d.The difference between a family clan and tribal clan was like the difference between a noble in the capital city and a village\u2019s tycoon.The Tao tribal clan had existed in the Cloud Wilderness for eons. Their ambition was to establish a family clan, and with their own hand, develop it slowly and build it up.In the annals of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, many ancient family clans were built up from small tribal clans.Many family clans had even survived several dynasties to the point that they had a longer history than the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom\u2019s royal family.The Tao tribal clan had already accumulated enough. They could use the opportunity of the kingdom\u2019s selection to show their strength. And Tao Yunxiao was lucky; he was chosen to be the Tao tribal clan\u2019s Mortal Blood realm poster child.\u201cLord Zhang, I will be demonstrating \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019!\u201d\u201cNine Mysterious Swords of Heaven?\u201dThe commoners had never heard of such a cultivation technique; but for a person like Lian Chengyu, who had experience in martial arts, he knew what the \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019 was.It was a cultivation technique that used nine sword moves to cultivate the entire body\u2019s musculoskeletal system. It did the same thing as \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 in a different way. It was also able to complement \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 and vice versa. Since Tao Yunxiao had learned the \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019, it was natural that he had also learned the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.He had learned two cultivation techniques!This made Lian Chengyu feel mixed emotions. Such a large tribe like the Tao tribal clan was different. This was the difference in heritage.One should know that the \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019 was not widely spread. Certain factions hid it, so it was not easy to obtain the manual. To learn \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019, one had to use a sword, which made the difficulty of learning it even higher!The Tao tribal clan had their ancestral artifacts, the female-male swords. These two swords could give their users a mysterious energy. Coupled with the cultivation technique of the \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019, it allowed the users to release unbelievable strength, allowing warriors to successfully break through in their cultivation.This was the real secret the Tao tribal clan had, and it was the reason for being able to stand their ground in the vast wilderness for thousands of years!And this secret had been kept completely confidential for a long time. But today, the Tao tribal clan elders decided they had accumulated enough. It was time to display their strength and begin their development and growth.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - Yi Yun goes on stagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Yi Yun goes on stage\u201cNine Mysterious Swords of Heaven?\u201d Zhang Tan was slightly surprised. He had previously looked down on the Tao tribal clan. It was unbelievable that a small tribe in the vast wilderness could have such a thing.\u201cAlright, let me see your sword skills!\u201d Hearing Zhang Tan\u2019s words, Tao Yunxiao felt encouraged and he grew more confident.Tao Yunxiao began swinging his sword as the sword beams quickly turned into a spectacular light show!The sword moves of the \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019 were very beautiful!\u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 may be a top cultivation technique, but just comparing the elegance of the moves, \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 could not be compared with the \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019.Every move and stance of the \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019 was like art.And these great-looking moves could train every inch of a cultivator\u2019s body. Together with expiration, energy could enter the organs of a cultivator, strengthening their organs and blood.\u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019 was a cultivation technique that focused on strengthening the organs, while the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was used to strengthen the muscles and tendons. So they complemented each other.By cultivating both cultivation techniques together, it allowed for greater efficiency.Tao Yunxiao may be arrogant, but he had the means to be arrogant. The sword in his hand seemed to come to life.This two feet long female sword was a genuinely precious sword. As he swung the sword, the sword\u2019s body would generate sounds, as if the roar of a dragon or tiger.Tao Yunxiao was completely engrossed in his sword moves. Although he could not be as one with the sword, but he could inject his mental spirit into the sword, making it an extension of his arm.\u201cBuzz\u2014\u2014\u201dAs the female sword began to sound out more aggressively, it turned from a low hum to a clear buzz. It had become one with Tao Yunxiao, forming an indescribable \u201cforce\u201d.When this aura reached its peak, a sharp sound that cut through the air could be heard\u2013\u201cWhew!\u201dA visible airwave was emitted by the female sword with a crushing force!\u201cCha!\u201dTen feet from Tao Yunxiao, a piece of black ironstone the size of a washbasin flew up into the air before shattering!Seeing this, the audience could not help but let out a cry!\u201cSword Qi!\u201d Zhang Tan\u2019s eyebrows raised. By injecting energy into a sword and using the sharpness of the sword, when a warrior strikes, the energy released is known as sword Qi.Very few Mortal Blood warriors knew how to use swords, so to be able to release sword Qi was rarer!For Tao Yunxiao to reach this stage proved that he had talent with swords!Tao Yunxiao did not sheath his female sword, but made large strides forward; he was chasing the stone that flew in the air.His sword strikes were like a snowstorm!\u201cCha! Cha! Cha!\u201dIn the time of two breaths, Tao Yunxiao had sent out a few dozen moves. The female sword treated metal like mud; the wash basin-sized black ironstone was reduced to the size of a sugar cube before dropping to the ground.\u201cGood!\u201d The Tao tribal clan crowd turned to a jubilating uproar. Their loud cheers were like layer after layer of waves, with each wave higher than the other and took long to subside!The Tao tribal clan audience were extremely proud of their tribe.The grand elder was satisfied. He knew that they had met their goal today. To build a family clan was an arduous task, and might even lead to bloodshed.By displaying the tribe\u2019s strength, they could make the external tribes be in awe of their strength, and they could also implant their clan\u2019s pride amongst the people.Tao Yunxiao ended off with a beautiful sword dance before perfectly sheathing his sword. His face beamed with a confident smile. He too felt that his performance had been perfect!Zhang Tan nodded slightly, \u201cYou released sword Qi, but although it was through the aid of the sword\u2019s power, it can be considered to be not bad!\u201dZhang Tan finally spoke. The impression he had on the people was solemnity, probably harsh. By saying \u201cconsidered not bad\u201d was an extremely high compliment!The people of the Tao tribal clan were proud. Zhang Tan had praised their third young master!And they still had the first and second young master. And the first young master, Hu Ya was the brightest figure in their tribal clan.\u201cWell done Yunxiao!\u201dOn the platform, several of the Tao tribal clan elders were not stingy with their praise. By obtaining the affirmation of the Jin Long Wei, Tao Yunxiao had regained the pride of the Tao tribal clan.\u201cPinghai, you sure have a good son.\u201d A tribal elder said to a middle age man not far from him.The middle-aged man laughed, \u201cThere is still a large gap between Yunxiao and Hu Ya. When Hu Ya uses the male sword on stage, it will heat up the atmosphere even further!\u201dThis warm atmosphere lasted for at least thirty minutes but the people were reluctant to stop it.They had a feeling that Tao Yunxiao would obtain first place in the semi-finals.Until Zhang Tan announced, \u201cThe last participant of the Mortal Blood, Yi Yun.\u201d\u201cOh? It\u2019s not over?\u201d\u201cRight, there\u2019s still one more person!\u201dMany people then remembered that Yi Yun still had not gone on stage.Yi Yun was, after all, first in the preliminary, plus the fact that he was young, he should have received a lot of attention; but because of Tao Yunxiao\u2019s stunning performance, the people forgot about Yi Yun temporarily.\u201cYi Yun, is he the one with the strongest spirit?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If Yi Yun did not use a loophole in the preliminary, then he would be the person with the strongest Spirit in all the Mortal Blood warriors present. He may have great Spirit, but how\u2019s his strength?\u201d\u201cHow good can he be? He can\u2019t be much. That kid is only twelve. Our Young master Yunxiao is a top talent, but he\u2019s already fourteen. To say the least, even if the kid has talent and can catch up with Young master Yunxiao, but they have a two year age gap, so his strength must be much lower.\u201dThe people began nodding their heads, fully agreeing with a Tao tribal clan warrior\u2019s comments.The citizens of the vast wilderness had a difficult time understanding what Spirit was.But a cultivation technique\u2019s strength was something they could comprehend. If Yi Yun could break a black ironstone with his punch, then he would be considered strong.If he couldn\u2019t, then it proved that Spirit was some gaudy gimmick.This was the thought of the people of the vast wilderness, simple and direct!\u201cKid, I wish you luck!\u201d Seeing Yi Yun heading up on stage and passing him by, Lian Chengyu experienced schadenfreude. After seeing Tao Yunxiao\u2019s stunning performance, Lian Chengyu had been jealous.But as jealous he may be, he had always known the gap between the Tao tribal clan and the Lian tribal clan, so Lian Chengyu did not have a hard time accepting it.And next it was Yi Yun\u2019s turn to go on stage. Lian Chengyu was rejoicing within, for although no one knew Yi Yun\u2019s origins, he knew it clearly. Yi Yun could only demonstrate \u201cDragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u201d, and what\u2019s more, it was secretly learned from Yao Yuan.Firstly, Yao Yuan\u2019s standard was not the match of a Tao tribal clan expert\u2019s; secondly, Yi Yun had learned it secretly. So this difference was astounding!Thinking of Yi Yun using a secretly learned \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 to compete against Tao Yunxiao\u2019s \u2018Nine Mysterious Swords of Heaven\u2019, Lian Chengyu could not stop laughing.It was a torture to compare, but why did you have to perform after Tao Yunxiao?The contrast will be too obvious.\u201cLittle slave, do well later. Don\u2019t throw the face of your master, mine.\u201d Just as Yi Yun walked past Lian Chengyu, his ear rang with Lian Chengyu\u2019s voice.Yi Yun stopped and turned his head towards Lian Chengyu.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Lian Chengyu said with a teasing smile.\u201cLooking at a retard.\u201d Yi Yun said calmly and carried on walking to the white jade stage.Lian Chengyu\u2019s face sank as he rooted himself into the ground, \u201cLittle bastard, you reciprocate me giving you face with that!\u201dHis face flashed a malicious expression while Yi Yun had already gone on stage, ignoring Lian Chengyu\u2019s threat.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Mysterious FeelingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Mysterious FeelingYi Yun stood firmly in the center of the white jade stage. Everyone\u2019s eyes were on Yi Yun, anticipating his performance.Yi Yun felt some emotions. He slightly raised his head towards the airship in the sky. Without doubt, Lin Xintong and Su Jie rode in that and were here to watch the semi-finals.Just as Yi Yun came to the stage, they appeared. Yi Yun of course knew they were here to watch him.As for Tao Yunxiao, he felt it was a coincidence.Tao Yunxiao felt depressed. Why didn\u2019t Lin Xintong come twenty minutes earlier, so that she could see me shine?To be able to show his skills in front of a beauty would be a joy to Tao Yunxiao. Unfortunately, Lin Xintong had missed it.Seeing the airship, Yi Yun felt as if he could \u201csee\u201d Lin Xintong looking through the window at him.Yi Yun could not help but smile. He replayed the sparring match he had with Lin Xintong last night in his mind, and once again began to grasp further insight.After sleeping a while, those insights had turned evanescent, clear one moment, but fading the next. Yi Yun wanted to see if he could really incorporate those insights.With a deep breath, Yi Yun could feel the surrounding Heaven Earth Yuan Qi.The white jade stage he was standing upon was exceptional, with four desolate bone relics shining on the four pillars.The array the desolate bone relic powered condensed Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, making the stage have more than a hundred times more Heaven Earth Yuan Qi than the Tao tribal clan\u2019s outskirts.It was indeed a cultivation treasure! Yi Yun also coveted this kind of treasure. Of course, even if he took it, he had no way of powering it.\u201cPhew\u2013\u201d Yi Yun took in one deep breath after another, and felt the 36,000 pores in his body open up. He greedily absorbed the energy on the white jade stage. On this stage, besides practicing, just by standing would increase a person\u2019s cultivation.The Purple Crystal within Yi Yun\u2019s heart began to slowly work, a small eddy appeared within the Purple Crystal and the surrounding Heaven Earth Yuan Qi began to be attracted by this eddy and quickly swirled into the Purple Crystal.Pure energy cleansed every inch of Yi Yun\u2019s body. This feeling was unbelievable!Yi Yun felt intoxicated. It was like an alcoholic falling into a lake filled with thousand year old vintage wine, and had free reign at drinking it.\u201cThis kid, why isn\u2019t he moving?\u201d\u201cI wanted to see how good he is, yet he has not made any moves yet. Is he trying to fool us?\u201d The people\u2019s tongues wagged. From the beginning to now, Yi Yun had stood motionless for three minutes.Tao Yunxiao crossed his arms and a smile appeared on his face. With a proud expression, he did not think Yi Yun would pose a threat to him for the semi-finals.With the female sword appearing, who can challenge it?At this time, Yi Yun raised his arms. It was a simple stance and did not stir any of the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi energy flow. Because anytime the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi flow came close to Yi Yun\u2019s body, the Purple Crystal would absorb it.Within his body, with pump after pump of energy, Yi Yun began punching!His moves were not exhilarating but made people feel a softness. Each stance and gesture of Yi Yun was extremely slow, but it was very harmonious and seamless!This fist technique would not appear surprising to any normal person. It was just simple moves that could be easily learned and emulated by any ordinary person.In time, many of the audience turned restless. What the hell?! What sort of fist technique is this? We could do it if we were asked to go up.\u201cQuickly do something powerful, it\u2019s too boring!\u201d\u201cCan he really make the cut?\u201dThe audience began talking in private. To them, only fist techniques that could shatter rocks and kick down trees were real fist techniques. Even many warriors thought so too.Yi Yun may not come close to Tao Yunxiao, but being first in the preliminaries, he should at least shatter some black ironstone!The laymen were here for the excitement, while the experts looked at the technique.Zhang Tan stared at Yi Yun\u2019s every move. At the beginning, he did not take much notice, but slowly, his expression changed, and a look of consternation appeared on his face.\u201cOh? This kid\u2019s \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 can actually have such a harmonious feeling\u2026It doesn\u2019t seem like he learned this fist technique in the vast wilderness!\u201dTo enhance the people\u2019s ability to battle the fierce beasts, the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom had openly published the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 and it had been spread to the people for a long time. As for the people who had access to the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, they were a mixture of good and bad.The later generations of warriors would often inject that own understandings into it, causing there to be many versions of \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.As the cultivation technique became widespread, there were also drawbacks. Having many versions was not a good thing. Some of them oversimplified things and some of them removed things. As a result of all these varying standards, the essence of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was destroyed. But there was a benefit which was that it was easier to learn.The real and rigorous orthodox \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 may have never reached the vast wilderness, as it was too hard to learn.Yi Yun was currently performing the most orthodox \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. Together with Lin Xintong\u2019s notes, Yi Yun was able to reveal the charm.The \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 was a foundation skill of the Tai Ah Divine Kingdom, so it was the standard method for their armies. As a Thousand Households of the Jin Long Wei, Zhang Tan was well versed in the orthodox \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, so he could tell immediately the level of Yi Yun\u2019s fist technique.\u201cThis kid sure has good perceptivity.\u201d Zhang Tan was surprised. Without perceptivity, even if you were to learn the orthodox \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019, it was still hard to master, what\u2019s more Yi Yun was twelve years old. It was shocking!In fact, the crowd\u2019s murmurs and Zhang Tan\u2019s praises did not matter to Yi Yun.At this time, Yi Yun had reached the \u2018No Law, No Shape, No Void, No Me\u2019 state on the white jade stage. This was the first time that Yi Yun was practicing in a thick Heaven Earth Yuan Qi environment.The Purple Crystal could freely absorb the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi\u2019s energy in here.Although desolate bones contained a lot of energy, they were similar to herbs. Some of the energy within was not pure. Some of them, when absorbed, will turn toxic, harming the person absorbing it. It could make a person\u2019s foundation weak, or make it impossible to digest, eventually causing a person to burst to his death.But Heaven Earth Yuan Qi would not. It was the most original, purest form of energy.Of course, there was a weakness in Heaven Earth Yuan Qi. It was not as vibrant as desolate bone energy. To level up by absorbing Heaven Earth Yuan Qi would take an extremely long time.As the ancient saying goes, \u201cA meat-eater charges forward with bravery, a Qi-eater does not die and becomes a god.\u201dThe Qi-eater refers to a person who can absorb the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi. He possessed a long life, and had strength that rivalled a god!When Yi Yun\u2019s body and mind fused with the Heaven Earth Yuan Qi, his Spirit, Qi and Soul fused into one. In that evanescent state, it felt like he could touch the creator of the \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019 and obtain the true meaning of his legacy.This true meaning only existed within the most orthodox \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019. Now, it slowly coalesced with Yi Yun\u2019s mind.Yi Yun\u2019s every move and stance were injected with the true meaning, as if it had a life of its own.In Yi Yun\u2019s mind, this true meaning had evolved into various images.It was a battle between a Jin dragon and a fierce tiger.The dragon soared while the tiger leaped, the earth trembled and the mountains swayed!This was the dream scene Yi Yun had last night. The only difference was this time he was awake, watching the fight. He could see every detail.Yi Yun again thought back to the previous night in the woods when he felt an abstruse feeling while practicing \u2018Dragon Rib Tiger Bone Fist\u2019.At that time, he had trouble grasping it.But today, he could!Yi Yun finally understood what that mysterious feeling was.\\nPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
