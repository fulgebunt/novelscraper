The lights of ten thousand homes and stars spread out on the horizon, with soft and gentle natural starlight and extravagant artificial lights blending together, like the collision of reality and fantasy.This was a very successful photograph of the evening scenery, very in line with the main theme of the International Photography Exhibition\u300aSky\u300b, which was hosted by the famous photographer Zhao Tianhu. His three days camping out on the mountain to take this picture were not spent in vain.But now, none of these were the main point. The main point was that in the corner of this photograph, next to H city\u2019s tallest clock tower, a human figure could be seen jumping from the tallest floor of some big building.His phone suddenly rang, calling him back from his thoughts. Picking up the phone, not waiting for the person on the other side to say anything, he said in an urgent tone, \u201cUncle Zhao, I might have taken a photo of something crazy.\u201d\u201cWhat did you take a picture of?\u201d Zhao Tianhu asked in his very characteristic hoarse voice, with a very light tone showing his evidently happy mood, \u201cIt looks like our newest master photographer Mr. Xiao He, is going to give these old guys a big surprise, huh? What happened, did you end up hallucinating after taking the photo of your dreams?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He Bai\u2019s throat felt a little tight, he swallowed and said, \u201cIt seems like\u2026 I might have photographed a murder scene.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d?If you\u2019re enjoying this translation, please consider whitelisting this site in your ad-blocker. Thank you!?The great Film Emperor Mr. Di Qiuhe committed suicide by jumping off a building!This explosive news quickly became viral, occupying the front page headlines of all of the online news websites. Various fans and passersby crazily refreshed the sites of all the major news networks, questioning whether this was just an April Fool\u2019s Day joke done in extremely bad taste, scolding the different news platforms as shameless for cursing Film Emperor Di to die.Nobody could believe that Di Qiuhe would ever commit suicide. He was such a talented, gentle, and powerful person. Fifteen years after his debut, he brought so many excellent works to the masses. He established a company that fostered so many outstanding juniors in the entertainment circle. His relations with other people were some of the best in the industry- anybody who mentioned him wouldn\u2019t be able to help themselves from saying something good about him. How can this kind of person, who even when he was banned from work in the industry was able to work hard for his dreams, decide to commit suicide! Most importantly, he was only 35 years old! He was still so young!The crazy questioning from his fans flooded the internet. Everybody thought that this was just a joke by someone with bad taste, but a message sent out by Huading Company\u2019s official Weibo plunged them all into the abyss.[It is with great pain and grief that we send our chairman Di Qiuhe to a better place. Rest in peace.]The whole internet seemed to be shrouded in silence. The news from the official Weibo of his company made it impossible for anybody to deceive themselves anymore.\u201cNo! I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Di Qiuhe\u2019s little sister Di Chunhua cried and fell to the floor with her makeup running down her face and her hair a mess. Her pure white skirt became covered in dust after coming into touching the ground, \u201cThat isn\u2019t my brother, my brother can\u2019t be like this\u2026\u201dOn the other side of the shaking camera lens, Mr. Di Qiuhe\u2019s sister fell to the ground surrounded by a circle of reporters, crying in a disordered and pitiful way, letting anyone who listened to feel sad and anyone who saw her to cry as well.The policewoman turned off her cell phone that she had been using to look at the news with a darkened face, sneering, \u201cOf course he isn\u2019t your brother, your only brother is Di Xiasong! Her tears really look like they\u2019re real, but who doesn\u2019t know that Di Qiuhe doesn\u2019t have any kind of relationship with this half-sister. She\u2019s so fake and hypocritical, only knowing how to act.\u201dInadvertently witnessing this scene, He Bai awkwardly coughed and leaned over slightly, \u201cUm, excuse me, I would like to report a case.\u201dThe policewoman finally noticed that there was a person standing in front of the desk, quickly put away the emotions on her face, put her cell phone back on the desk, and smiled at him a little embarrassed, saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what would you like to report?\u201d\u201cI think, murder.\u201d He Bai pretended not to see her previous gaffe, pulled out the developed photos, and put them in front of her, and pointing at the magnified image, \u201cI am a photographer. Two days ago, I was on the mountains on the outskirts of the suburbs taking pictures of the night scenery, when I inadvertently took this photo and was a little concerned.\u201dIn the enlarged photo, a human figure could be seen leaping down from a window, while behind the curtain of that window, a white arm could be seen moving back inside.After seeing this picture, the policewoman suddenly stood up with her eyes focused on the blurred human figure and her facial expression distorted, \u201cIt isn\u2019t suicide\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d He Bai was confused by her sudden agitated state.The policewoman didn\u2019t answer, turning over the other enlarged pictures, picking them up and running excitedly towards the captain\u2019s office at the back, \u201cBoss! There\u2019s been a major discovery! Di Qiuhe didn\u2019t commit suicide! He was killed! There\u2019s someone with evidence!\u201dWhat? Di Qiuhe? The black shadow in the photo is Di Qiuhe? The male protagonist of \u300aImmortal Way\u300bDi Qiuhe?He Bai felt like he couldn\u2019t process anything, wanted to walk up and ask for specific details, but accidentally knocked over the calendar on the policewoman\u2019s desk.The calendar hit the floor with a muffled crash. Taped onto it were several old photographs that fell to the ground as well, one of which just happened to end up next to his feet.He stopped, and picked up the picture.This was a picture of a man, a very young man, probably around twenty years old. The man\u2019s facial features were perfect, his eyes gentle and with a smile, wearing loose everyday wear- a white baseball shirt that on him added a touch of elegance.His mind flashed the name of this person- Di Qiuhe, and he quickly realized that this person was already dead, and he seemed to have, probably, might have just\u2026 shot the moment this man had died.He Bai opened his eyes and looked at the familiar yet unfamiliar ceiling of his dorm room. He turned over, pulled the blanket over his head, and painfully shut his eyes, \u201cNo, right now I am thirty-three years old, not twenty, not twenty\u2026\u201d\u201cXiao Bai, come down and eat!\u201dHe pulled on the blanket, trying to trick himself into believing that what he had just heard was just an auditory hallucination.\u201cYou have to turn in the photography homework on Monday. Quickly get up, I already helped you borrow the equipment.\u201d The oldest in the dorm Lao Da, Wang Hu, stretched out his arms, pulled at his blanket, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just get a zero for the last photography assignment, all you have to do is take another set today, and then beg Professor Xu for another chance. It\u2019s still possible to makeup the score, so get up quickly.\u201dWith the blanket pulled away, He Bai opened up his eyes, sitting up with hair like a chicken\u2019s nest, looking sideways at Wang Hu\u2019s face that looked younger by at least ten years, with his heart full of despair.It had already been three days. He could no longer deceive himself.Four days ago, he had taken a bunch of photos to the police station to report a case, when he had accidentally knocked over a policewoman\u2019s calendar. He had been looking at a photograph that had fallen from the calendar, and then\u2026 and then he had just closed his eyes for one second, and opened his eyes the next, to see that he had disappeared from the police station only to find himself in a classroom at his alma mater.Going from the age of thirty-three back to the age of twenty, from a savings of six million to a savings of six hundred, from a newly anticipated photographer to a journalism student with horrible grades in photography class\u2026 in just a blink of an eye, the whole world seemed to have changed completely.\u201cOkay okay, cheer up, it was only one assignment. People who don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on would think you just got your heart broken or something.\u201d Wang Hu knocked on the railing of the bed, continuing to persuade him, \u201cNormally, that score is only twenty percent of the final grade. If you re-do it, you can definitely still get the scholarship money, so don\u2019t feel so sad.\u201dHe Bai shook his head, saying apathetically, \u201cIt\u2019s not me who\u2019s heartbroken.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the third eldest, Lao San.\u201dWang Hu was confused, \u201cLao San is heartbroken? When did he even have a girlfriend?\u201dAs soon as he finished saying this sentence, Lao San Niu Junjie burst through the door sobbing, hiccuping while falling to the floor drunk. He hugged Wang Hu\u2019s thighs, \u201cLao Da, I was dumped\u2026 Liu Huanhuan she cheated on me! She cheated! I treated her so well, bought her anything she wanted, and if she told me to go east, I would never go west! Why did she have to cheat on me? Why did she have to treat me this way?\u201dWang Hu was in shock, \u201cLiu Huanhuan? The Broadcasting Department\u2019s flower? You were dating her?!\u201dNiu Junjie lowered his head, throwing up on his shoes, and passed out drunk.Wang Hu\u2019s face twisted up like he had just eaten a sour lemon.The bad smell floated up, He Bai pinched his nose, and fell back onto bed.Sure enough, this isn\u2019t a dream\u2026 so why the hell was I reborn?After helping Wang Hu settle down the passed out Niu Junjie, He Bai ate his lunch in two or three bites, picked up the borrowed camera on the table, and left the school.Bell bottoms, suspender skirts, stripes, checkers, black rimmed glasses\u2026 all the things that were in fashion more than a decade ago fell into his sight. He took a deep breath, squatted on the side of the road, raised his camera casually, and aimed at the crowd while adjusting the focus skillfully, found a good angle for light, and pressed down on the shutter.Ka-cha.The picture was taken when a black SUV pulled up in front of him, making the dust rise from the road.The little girl who was supposed to be the main subject of the composition was replaced by a blurred image of a car. He Bai\u2019s brows twitched, and waved his hands in front of his face to avoid the dust, looking at the SUV parked two steps in front of him.The back door of the car was opened, and a long leg stretched out.Basic clean sneakers, simple jeans, a white graphic tee, broad shoulders, a long slender neck, a perfect jawline, tightly pursed thin lips, a high nose bridge\u2026 and a pair of eyes that naturally brought a gentle taste.He Bai\u2019s eyes opened slightly in shock, this face\u2026 is Di, Di Qiuhe?\u201cDon\u2019t think that being a little famous will let you have an opportunity to turn over in this lifetime. You can only dream of it!\u201dA slightly shrill female voice could be heard coming from the car. A backpack was thrown out, followed by a thirteen or fourteen year old girl\u2019s body leaning out of the car towards Di Qiuhe who was standing outside, \u201cThe only person who can be Huangdu\u2019s heir is my brother. You just wait to be blocked by everyone in the entertainment industry. Driver, drive!\u201dThe SUV left in a hurry. He Bai looked at Di Qiuhe standing at his side, and tried to reduce his presence.It seems like he saw something he shouldn\u2019t have seen\u2026Ka-cha, his hand accidentally pressed down on the shutter.Di Qiuhe looked back.He Bai stuffed the camera back into his arms out of habit, then realized how this seemed to be a little bit silly, so he pulled out the camera again. Facing Di Qiuhe\u2019s expressionless line of vision, the corner of his mouth twitched as he said, \u201cThe ground is dirty, your bag\u2026,\u201d pointing at the black backpack next to his feet that had been thrown there by the young girl.Di Qiuhe withdrew his stare, lowered his head, picked up the bag from the ground, patted it a few times, and looked at him again. You couldn\u2019t see any awkwardness from having a shameful moment seen by others on his face, asking bluntly, \u201cWhich news company are you from?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNext time don\u2019t take a picture in such an obvious position, someone will end up beating you up.\u201d Di Qiuhe put his backpack on, stopped a cab, got on, and left.After He Bai was sprayed a face of car exhaust, he looked at the camera in his arms, and realized too late, \u201cHey! What are you trying to say! I\u2019m NOT \u201cpup\u201darazzi!\u201d [T/N: In Chinese, the phrase for paparazzi has dog in it, which is why I will write \u201cpup\u201darazzi as it will be relevant later on in the story]Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the couple walked to the door of the tailor shop with an old-fashioned color scheme, he could press down on the shutter.One, two\u2026 right now!Ka-cha, the picture was taken right when a light blue taxi stopped in front of him, occupying his line of vision.He closed his eyes forcefully, putting down the camera.The car door opened, and a pair of long legs in jeans stepped out.\u201cDi, Qiu, He.\u201d He Bai gritted his teeth. It was this guy again! The photograph he had taken before his rebirth was ruined by this guy, and now the first and second photographs he had taken after his rebirth were ruined by this guy too. Did he offend this guy or something?Di Qiuhe turned his head towards the sound, and took one look at him before moving his line of sight towards the sidewalk. He picked up something that had fallen on the ground and stuffed it into his pocket. He suddenly paused, walked in front of He Bai, took out a notebook, and pulled out a pen to write something on it. Then, he ripped out the page in the notebook, and bent over to stuff it into his arms, \u201cSquatting on the side of the road isn\u2019t safe. I\u2019m not going to come back here anymore, so you should go back home.\u201d After saying this, he used his long legs to walk back to the taxi, and sprayed He Bai with another face of car exhaust.He Bai: \u201c\u2026 \u201c **!Using the fastest speed possible to finish his homework, he went back to school. He first went to the equipment management office to return the camera, and then took the memory card to an off-campus internet cafe.After taking him a while to remember the details of the email address that he had used in college, he clicked open a browser to look up his email. When the page popped up he cracked his knuckles and put on an expressionless face to use words full of emotion to send Professor Xu an email full of flattery, repentance, assurance, and appeal, talking about his troubles and how in the future this would not happen again. After attaching the compressed file, he pressed send.After doing all of this, he opened another browser, hesitated for a moment, before typing in the three words \u201cDi Qiuhe\u201d into the search bar. The page loaded again, he moved his mouse, and clicked open the first Baike page. [T/N: Chinese Wikipedia]Di Qiuhe, male, twenty-three years old. An artist at Huangdu, he debuted three years ago in a group act without much fame for around a year and a half until he went solo. In the first half of last year, he acted in a low budget mystery TV drama as the second male lead, which launched him into the public eye. In the second half of last year, he won the leading role in Director Jia Sheng\u2019s end of year production\u300aRouge Tears\u300b, which led him to receive the Thousand Flower Award for Best Male Lead in the beginning of this year, sitting on the seat of Film Emperor for the first time, and leading him to bathe in the limelight.Recalling the photograph that he had taken prior to his rebirth, he closed the page with a complicated mood. He took out the autograph that Di Qiuhe had given him from the pocket on his chest, opened the campus network, clicked open the For Sale section, and then posted a picture of the signature, setting the price to start at ten yuan.Whatever, seeing as this guy was gonna die early and in his golden years, he would forgive his rudeness with a generous heart.When he returned to the dorms, Niu Junjie, who had passed out dead drunk, had already woken up, and was in the middle of slurping instant noodles while complaining about the girl who had let down his trust and feelings.\u201cShe wanted a diamond ring, so I bought one! She complained about how living in the dormitory wasn\u2019t convenient, so I helped her rent a place and move there! She said that it wasn\u2019t convenient for her company to know about our relationship, and we could only date secretly, I could also endure it, but why did she have to cheat on me!\u201dThe second oldest in the dorm Lao Er, Chen Jie, turned his head to avoid the bits of instant noodles that he spit out as he was speaking, pushed a napkin in front of him, and advised him, \u201cOkay okay, don\u2019t be sad anymore. There are many fish in the sea- when a bad one goes away, a good one will come.\u201dNiu Junjie wiped away his tears, \u201cI just can\u2019t get over it! She lied to me! Saying that she couldn\u2019t go public with our relationship because of her company was all lies! She dumped me just so that she could sell the idea of a couple with the male anchor that she partners with! All I am is her spare tire, her wallet, a fool that she could play around with!\u201d\u201cYou seem to be quite clear on where your position is in her heart\u2026 \u201c Wang Hu said in a low voice.Niu Junjie stared at him, \u201cLao Da, what did you just say?!\u201dWang Hu looked towards He Bai, changing the subject, \u201cXiao Bai, why did you only come home now? Did you finish the homework?\u201d\u201cI finished it.\u201d He Bai nodded in response, and then seemed to be in deep thought. He dragged over a chair to sit in front of the table where the other three were sitting, put his hand out towards Niu Junjie and said, \u201cCell phone.\u201dNiu Junjie stared at him with red and swollen eyes, asking him in confusion, \u201cWhat are you gonna do with my cell phone?\u201d before obediently taking out the phone and putting it into his hand.\u201cHelp you make Liu Huanhuan cry and beg you to get back together again.\u201d He Bai opened his phone, found Liu Huanhuan\u2019s cell phone number, chose to send an SMS, and then quickly typed in some things into the page.The other three people all looked at him foolishly, not quite understanding what he meant with these actions.\u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d After he finished writing the text message and sent it out, He Bai patted Niu Junjie on the shoulder and comforted him saying, \u201cDon\u2019t feel sad anymore, what Lao Er said isn\u2019t wrong. When the bad ones leave, the good ones will come.\u201d If he didn\u2019t remember incorrectly, in the near future, his third sister-in-law would meet Lao San.Niu Junjie came back from his thoughts after being pat on his shoulder. He quickly took back his phone and opened the page for text messages, urgently asking, \u201cWhat did you send to Huanhuan? Will she, will she really cry and beg me to get back together again\u2026 huh? Why did you tell her my dad\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cTo let her regret her decision.\u201d He Bai tugged at his messy blonde hair, saying with great emphasis, \u201cLao San, in the future when you\u2019re choosing a girlfriend you have to make sure you wipe your eyes clean so you can see things more clearly. These kinds of women who stick to you just because you spend money generously, and then leave you for people who spend money even more generously, aren\u2019t suitable for you.\u201dNiu Junjie opened his mouth wide in surprise, \u201cXiao, Xiao Bai, why are you kind of strange today?\u201dHe Bai smiled, squeezing out a dimple on the left side of his face. Inside his twenty year old body lived his thirty-three year old soul. Being a little weird was normal. He only hoped that this group of lovely roommates would be able to adapt to his changes as soon as possible.Around midnight, when the lights on the clock tower finally reached their most gorgeous state, he carefully adjusted the of the camera, moving his fingers onto the shutter. The wind started blowing, and a dark shadow could be seen suddenly falling from a high floor of a building next to the clock tower. His hands shook, and the gorgeous night scenery in the camera lens turned into a blurry and distorted shadow.He Bai suddenly opened his eyes, and stared into space for a while at the ceiling of the dorm, before pulling the blanket over his head.Damn it, why did he dream about that scene?\u201cXiao Bai, why did you fall asleep again? Get up quickly, Professor Xu is looking for you.\u201dThe blanket was pulled off, and Wang Hu\u2019s voice could be heard from the side of the bed.He opened his eyes, turned over to look at Wang Hu who was standing next to his bed, and asked, \u201cProfessor Xu is looking for me?\u201d Why was that strict and serious old man looking for me this early in the morning? Today was the weekend, so there shouldn\u2019t be any classes.\u201cYeah, he said that your phone was off and he couldn\u2019t get in touch with you, so he called me instead.\u201d Wang Hu, in a good mood, urged him saying, \u201cQuickly get up, when the Professor talked about you just now he sounded really excited. He praised your homework this time as particularly excellent, and wants to change your grades!\u201dChange grades?He Bai\u2019s entire body went still in shock, and he quickly got out of bed.Changing grades= increase in his average GPA= increase in end of term scores= he still has hope in getting the scholarship money= he can save on next semester\u2019s tuition!Long live Professor Xu!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He Bai walked towards Xu Yinrong\u2019s office following the route in his memory, and upon seeing the door was already open, pushed his head in to look inside.\u201cWhy are you pushing your head inside without coming in?\u201d The serious looking old man sitting behind the desk next to the window took off his glasses, put down the photographs that he had just developed, and waved his hands at him, \u201cCome inside and sit over here,\u201d saying this as he pointed towards a chair in front of his desk.The corners of He Bai\u2019s mouth raised up, smiling at him flatteringly with his eyes squinted together like two crescent moons. He walked over there to sit down, leaned over, and rested his arms on the table. His slightly round eyes widened just a little, and showing the dimple on the left side of his face, he said, \u201cGood morning Professor, have you eaten breakfast yet?\u201dXu Yinrong raised his eyelids to take another look at him. Pressing the pictures in his hands under his arms, he snorted, \u201cDon\u2019t try to act like a good student. I already saw the email you sent me yesterday. The photography homework that you retook is pretty good.\u201dThe smile on He Bai\u2019s face got bigger.\u201cSo now, you better give me a good explanation. Since you obviously have the ability to take good pictures, why did you end up handing in such a horribly composed set of photographs last time? They completely deviated away from the main theme, and the light and shadow was completely overexposed.\u201dThe smile on He Bai\u2019s face stiffened. So, this is where the Professor was waiting for him.\u201cYou can\u2019t speak all of a sudden? It\u2019s fine, you can slowly spend time thinking of an excuse, I\u2019m not in any rush.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe thirty-three year old He Bai, with a memory that wasn\u2019t that great, sighed with what seemed like the vicissitudes of life. He tried to remember what had happened this year- how he had felt as though he had been struck by lightning when he received a zero for this assignment, and the empty figures in his savings account. His face fell, and very honestly said where he had gone wrong, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m poor and I\u2019m clumsy.\u201dXu Yinrong leaned back in his chair, silently watching him act out this scene.\u201cWhen I was taking the pictures for the assignment, the weather wasn\u2019t good. The camera I borrowed ended up having some little problems here and there\u2026 of course! This is definitely not a good reason for me for trying to get away with a lackluster performance. Wrong is wrong. I\u2019m sorry Professor, I\u2019ve failed to meet your expectations!\u201d After saying this, he lowered his head, looking very much the part of a little pitiful child who was ready to accept any type of scolding and abuse from his guardians.Xu Yinrong waited for a while, but didn\u2019t hear him continue speaking. He looked at the top of his head for a while before asking, \u201cAre you done speaking?\u201dHe Bai raised his head, blinked a few times, and then moved his line of vision towards some plastic flowers inside a vase. He asked cautiously, \u201cThen I\u2026 will try to make amends?\u201dThe atmosphere was a little heavy.Xu Yinrong put on his presbyopia glasses again, lowered his head, and took out the pictures that he had put in his arms. He flipped through them and finally loosed his mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s possible for me to change your grades.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s eyes started to sparkle like gold.\u201cTake two more sets of photographs and bring them to me.\u201d Xu Yinrong took out one of the pictures from his hands and placed it in front of him. He lightly tapped on it and said, \u201cAt this kind of level, with five pictures for every set. I want ten pictures for two sets sent to my inbox by next weekend.\u201dHe Bai lowered his head to look at the picture, and then his eyes widened in shock.Di, Qiu, He!Isn\u2019t this the picture that he took when he accidentally pressed down on the shutter yesterday? When did he end up including it in his homework?! But this picture really was taken very well, with an angle facing upwards from below, the composition of him leaning downwards with the diagonal rays of sunlight that fully illuminated his face, and the handsome side profile of a male model reflected in the camera lens\u2026 it really was perfect!\u201cDo you know why this picture is so good?\u201dHe was called back from his thoughts, with a somewhat guilty conscience, \u201cIt\u2019s because of the\u2026 composition?\u201dXu Yinrong took another look at him, shook his head, and spread out the rest of the photographs that he had been keeping under his arms. He put them all out in front of him, and pointed at them one by one. \u201cThese are the photographs you took for this makeup assignment. The theme was \u2018people,\u2019 so you took pictures of little boys, little girls, a couple, elderly folk, a homeless person, and this young man right here. If we look at these photos from a composition standpoint, the picture of the little boys was taken the best. From the way you adjusted the contrast between light and dark, the one with the homeless person would be given a full score. If we\u2019re talking about concept, then the one with the elderly folk would definitely make your eyes light up when you saw it. All in all, this one that you took of the young man, is the one that you were the worst in technically.\u201dOf course, a picture that he just randomly took wasn\u2019t going to be technically sound. He Bai tried hard to make his expression serious, \u201cCan I please ask Professor Xu to tell me why this is?\u201d Before his rebirth, he had already achieved a little success in the field of photography, but he specialized in taking pictures of scenery, not taking pictures of people. On the opposite end of the spectrum stood Xu Yinrong, who before becoming a professor had been one of the best journalists and documentary photographers of his time. He was especially good at taking pictures that captured the happiness, anger, sorrows, and joys of the people that he was working with. His style became a genre of its own, and he enjoyed a pretty high position in the photography world.With a master photographer of the older generation standing in front of him, he still had a lot to learn.Xu Yinrong saw that he finally got his spirits back together, and silently nodded in his heart. He turned around to take out a set of developed photographs from a drawer, and spread them out on top of the other set of pictures. \u201cThis is what you sent in for this week\u2019s homework. The theme was \u2018scenery.\u201d When I first saw this set of photographs, I was really amazed. The technical skills, compositions, contrast, concept\u2026 it was perfect from any angle. The effect from the visual impact almost immediately grabs the attention of the viewer. He Bai, although I don\u2019t know where your sudden progress came from, but from this set of photographs, when it comes to taking pictures of scenery, you already have your own style, and your technique is already mature. I have nothing more to teach you in this respect.\u201d\u201cProfessor\u2026\u201d He Bai was a little taken off guard.\u201cTherefore, I have decided to give you and the other students separate homework assignments in the future. The theme will be people. I\u2019ll sponsor some equipment for you, and every week I expect you to hand in two sets of photographs which I will grade in person.\u201d\u201c\u2026 huh?\u201dXu Yinrong furrowed his brows, \u201cWhat, I\u2019m going to open a back door for you, and you\u2019re still not satisfied?\u201dThe back door of a master photographer, a chance that students specializing in photography can only dream of because it can\u2019t be bought by money. He was only a student from the journalism department with grades in photography class that were only slightly above average, and he just got this opportunity out of nowhere? And privately sponsored equipment\u2026 this was just like a pie had fallen from the sky out of nowhere!\u201cNo, I am very satisfied!\u201d He pressed down on the table in excitement, the corners of his lips uncontrollably turning upwards. Squeezing out the dimple on his left cheek, he said, \u201cThank you, Professor! I will definitely study hard!\u201dPrivately sponsored equipment= no need to borrow from the school= can save money= can save up his tuition as soon as possible= can eat meat! Professor Xu was simply like his parents that had come back to life!\u201cYeah.\u201d Making a stark contrast with his excitement, Xu Yinrong only very reservedly nodded his head and pointed to a camera bag on the cabinet near the door. Waving his head in dismissal, he said, \u201cOkay, bring the camera with you and go do your homework. Remember, five photographs for each set. Two sets is ten photographs. If I\u2019m not satisfied, then you have to retake them. You can go now.\u201dHe Bai nodded his head, happily picked up the camera bag, and then left.Xu Yinrong waited until he left to take off his presbyopia glasses. He carefully put away the photographs that had been scattered on the desk, and a light smile could be seen on his serious and strict face. Taking out his cell phone, he gave his old friend a call, \u201cHey Lao Jiang, I\u2019ve discovered a talented seedling\u2026 \u201cSquatting at the end of a street where a lot of people came and went, He Bai picked up his camera, coming to understand that he had unknowingly walked into a pit.From his recent trip to the office, he only got three conclusions: one, his grades still weren\u2019t been changed; two, his weekly photography assignment was changed to two sets instead of one set per week, and the theme was even the subject that he was weakest in, people; and three, Professor Xu left him with a problem, and didn\u2019t tell him the answer. When he remembered to give him a call to ask what he meant, all he got was a profound and mysterious, \u201cFind a way to understand it yourself.\u201dHe really got the short stick in this bargain. So in the end, what was it about Di Qiuhe\u2019s picture that made it so good?He wiped his face, raised his camera, and aimed the camera lens at the crowd of people.One week later, Old Comrade He Bai, as his young and tender college aged self, gradually adapted to university life. Because he couldn\u2019t remember what part-time jobs he had been working at this time, he simply flipped through his cell phone to call all the numbers of any suspected employers to call in his resignation.On Saturday, he came out of the Professor\u2019s office with a worried and bitter face, sitting on the bus to leave school with his camera in his arms.His technical skills were on par, but he wasn\u2019t able to take a picture with soul, so he needed to retake the photos. This was Professor Xu\u2019s evaluation after looking at the assignment he turned in this week.He wasn\u2019t able to grasp the soul\u2026 He furrowed his brow, stared at the picture of Di Qiuhe on his cell phone screen that seemed almost fake, staring at the screen until he turned almost cross-eyed.Surely the Professor couldn\u2019t have meant that this picture was able to capture the Di Qiuhe\u2019s soul? Wasn\u2019t he just a little more handsome than average, with legs longer than usual, and with a jawline that was better looking than other people when he lowered his head? But this guy\u2019s hands seem to look really good, and his eyelashes are also really long\u2026His mind flashed through an image of Di Qiuhe\u2019s eyes that seemed to hold no emotion. His line of sight went upwards to look at the side profile of Di Qiuhe in the photograph. He really was a strange person. He obviously has a pair of eyes that look so gentle, but look so indifferent when he looks at other people. He was a walking contradiction\u2026 wait a second, a contradiction?The public bus suddenly took a sharp brake, and he held onto the back of the seat in front of him to stabilize himself. As the other passengers shouted out in surprise, he raised his head to look at what was going on in the front.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, there was a puppy that suddenly rushed out into the street,\u201d the slightly overweight middle-aged driver apologized in a raised voice, explaining nervously. The passengers stopped complaining after hearing the reason, and after indicating that there was nothing wrong, the bus gradually went back to the way it was before the accident.He Bai sat in a position where he could just so happen to see half of the driver\u2019s face from the rearview mirrors. He looked at the man\u2019s wrinkled but warm and gentle eyes. He raised the camera by reflex, and without taking into regard the composition, the lighting, or the shadows, he pressed down onto the shutter.Ka-cha.He took a deep breath, put the camera back inside his bag, got up and went to stand near the door in the back. After the bus stopped at the next stop, he went outside with the rest of the crowd.\u2026 Then, he looked up.\u201cDi, Qiu, He!\u201dIt was really a small world. Even though the other party was wearing a mask and a hat, covering his face from top to bottom, but that figure, those god damned long ass legs- he had looked at this person\u2019s picture for so many days before and after his rebirth, so if he couldn\u2019t recognize him, then he would livestream himself eating shit!Carrying a shopping bag while passing by the bus platform, Di Qiuhe stopped in his steps and turned his head to look his way.Both of their eyes met in midair, paused for two seconds, and then they started running away with very tacit mutual understanding- shouting the name of an actor in the middle of a crowd was really asking for death!One person running after the other, they hid in a small alleyway. After making sure that there was nobody following them, both of them stopped running to take some deep breaths.\u201cReally, really exciting, huh\u2026 \u201c He Bai wiped away his sweat, feeling his heart beat out of his chest, \u201cHaven\u2019t you only filmed two movies? Even though you became the Film Emperor, your level of national recognition shouldn\u2019t be that high. How, how do you have so many fans? After just shouting out your name in the middle of the street, a huge crowd can just come running like that \u2026\u201dDi Qiuhe raised his head, leaning back against the wall, taking off the mask on his face in order to make his breathing more stable. He lowered his head, taking out a bottle of mineral water from his grocery bag and said, \u201cHere.\u201dHis low and deep slightly out of breath voice after exercising was extremely sexy.He Bai rubbed at his ears, glanced over at the long fingers holding the water bottle, and said a word of thanks. He opened it before taking a long drink.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been two days since I moved around here.\u201d Di Qiuhe stood upright, suddenly opening his mouth.He Bai looked at him in confusion.\u201cYou\u2019re really good at your job.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cYou found out my new address pretty quickly.\u201d\u201c??\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t follow me anymore. I\u2019ve been blocked by Huangdu, so even if you have any news about me, you won\u2019t be able to send it out.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDi Qiuhe bent down to look straight at him, and stepped forward to take a good look at him. He suddenly laughed, \u201cHave you even come of age? You should go back to school- being a part of the \u201cpup\u201darazzi isn\u2019t a good job. If you want to become a journalist, you should go back and obediently apply for college. After I\u2019ve established my own work studio, you\u2019re welcome to come and interview me anytime.\u201d After saying this, he took out a business card to hand to him.He Bai\u2019s body froze in shock.This person\u2026 seemed to be a little different than how he imagined him to be.In his last lifetime, he never paid much attention to news from the entertainment industry. He only knew about Di Qiuhe because he was really too famous. Most of the classic TV dramas and movies broadcasted and re-run during the summer season were starring Di Qiuhe. He occasionally would see an interview with the other party, and thinking about it now, only knew that this person had a very friendly personality. Most of the highest ranking members of the entertainment circle were friends with him, and also greatly respected him. But who would really take that kind of interview seriously? Maybe it was all just rehearsed- the intrinsic nature of the entertainment circle was poor, with any person that you picked out of the crowd being someone who was being supported by a sugar mama or daddy.Until the moment he took the photograph of the other party falling down from the building, his impression of him only stayed at the level of \u201ca very successful actor.\u201d But right now, just because of one smile, the static image of him in his mind suddenly came to life.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say anything?\u201d When Di Qiuhe saw that he didn\u2019t take his business card, he slowly took back his hands and looked down at him to ask, \u201cDo you also think that I won\u2019t be able to open my own studio? That\u2019s right, I\u2019ve been blocked in the industry right now, and my career looks like its about to be over\u2026\u201dHe took on a self deprecating tone, with the gentle smile in his eyes nowhere to be seen, seeming to have returned to the time when they first met.He Bai was called back from his thoughts, furrowed his brows, and his mind flashed through the image of his blurred figure falling down through the air. He hesitated for a bit before lowering his head to take out his student ID from his pocket. He handed it over seriously, saying, \u201cI am not \u201cpup\u201darazzi, I\u2019m a second year in the journalism department of Q University. Both times that we met were just coincidences. Also, your career is not over. In the future, you\u2019re going to win more than a dozen awards for Film Emperor, set up your own company, stand at the top of the entertainment industry, and look down at all the people who used to look down on you. Di Qiuhe, you will definitely succeed.\u201dThis time, it was Di Qiuhe\u2019s turn to be stunned. He was in a bad mood these past few days. He was extremely tired of having to deal with his stepmother who harboured evil thoughts and her two foolish children, so he decided to retreat in order to advance. He took the initiative to break off relations with his father, gave up the right to the inheritance, and let his stepmother block him off from any jobs in order to make his father feel extremely guilty.His plan succeeded, and he achieved a short period of quiet and freedom, but the peace of mind that he imagined coming never came.All paths of retreat had already been cut off, with the future full of uncertainty. Sometimes he also wondered if all of his planning was for naught. Besides his stepmother and his younger half-siblings, all of the people who saw him would praise him, and respond to his gentle demeanor with a friendly attitude. But that was just it- in the face of bigger interests, goodwill can only extend so far. They would only go so far as to not kick him while he was down. As for sending firewood in snowy weather, this basically would not exist.When he first saw this little \u201cpup\u201darazzi, he had believed that the other person was a trap that his not so smart sister had arranged. So, he wore his disguise of harmlessness out of habit, not giving the other person a chance to find any possible ways to blackmail him. He planned on silently increasing the other party\u2019s goodwill towards him, and then turn the other person over to his side.He was born to be an actor. All of his acting was flawless. But this time, he failed to calculate that the audience that he had performed for was really just a casual passerby that had coincidentally seen him, while also giving him the best response to his performance.\u201cDo you really think that I\u2019m going to succeed?\u201d He reached over to take the ID handed over by the other party, took a glance at the student information written on it, and raised his eyebrows slightly. His originally gentle expression suddenly took on a trace of evil, \u201cAre you one of my crazy fans? Or maybe just a regular fan?\u201dHe Bai rubbed at his eyes, seeing that the other party still kept a gentle expression on his face, fell into confusion for a few seconds before shaking his head to dispel his previous doubts about that slight feeling of violation earlier just now. He replied, \u201cYes, you will succeed.\u201d As for one of his crazy fans or whatever, these kinds of questions that would let both sides feel awkward and embarrassed, he just wouldn\u2019t answer them.Di Qiuhe looked at his delicate eyebrows, and the dimple that appeared on the left side of his face as he spoke. His bad mood suddenly got a lot better, and he put the ID into his pocket. He waved at him, \u201cThank you for your encouragement. If we\u2019re fated, let\u2019s meet again.\u201d\u201cIf we\u2019re fated let\u2019s meet\u2026 wait a second.\u201d He Bai shouted at the other person to stop on an impulse. He considered his words for a few moments before asking, \u201cFilm Emperor, do you want me to read your fortune?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDi Qiuhe stopped, and then turned around to look at him. The corners of his mouth raised in a gentle and harmless manner, with his voice very low, sounding very seductive in the small alleyway, \u201cReading my fortune?\u201dWhy do he feel like this guy\u2019s tone was a little strange\u2026 He Bai unconsciously took a step back, and suddenly regretted calling him back. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him today- his long, unbeating heart of compassion just started to crazily beat and start to overflow, and this was towards a man that he had only seen in person twice. These kinds of actions were not in line with the way he usually handled things, but\u2026 He rubbed at his camera, looking at the young face of the other person that was just in the springtime of his youth, and remembered that arm that was behind the window curtain. He sighed in his heart, nodded, and answered, \u201cYes, I want to read your fortune.\u201d He really couldn\u2019t bear to let such a brilliant person leave this world just because of a conspiracy. Just let this be his way of thanking the other person for filming so many amazing works of art, letting him kill all of his free time during those boring vacation days.Di Qiuhe took another look at his face, pinched the ID card in his pocket, and then slowly walked back again, \u201cWhat are you going to look at? My career, my fortune, or my lovelife?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to read your lifeline.\u201d He Bai got rid of any extra emotions, and tried to look as mysterious and profound as possible as he studied him from top to bottom. He started to try and trick him by saying, \u201cWhen I was young, I lived near a Daoist Temple. I was lucky enough to learn about reading the fate of other people from an old Daoist priest. Just now, what I said about you becoming an extremely powerful big Film Emperor and starting your own company was all true- it\u2019s all written on your face.\u201dDi Qiuhe raised his hands to touch his face, \u201cThere\u2019s something written on my face?\u201dThat\u2019s right, it says two words- premature death.He Bai rubbed at his camera again, and continued to trick him by saying, \u201cYour facial features are honest, the area in between your eyebrows is large and wide. This means that you were born in a very wealthy family, and that you should have a lot of good fortune in your life. However, your lips are slightly thin, and there\u2019s a mole on your ear. This means that there\u2019s also flaws to your family life- it\u2019s not a happy one. Also, the dip above your lips is clear, you have a fair countenance, and you have a tall nose bridge. This means that in the future, you will definitely be someone who will be both rich and noble, but\u2026\u201dDi Qiuhe very helpfully prompted him by asking, \u201cBut, what?\u201d\u201cBut the middle of your face gives a sense of brokenness. I\u2019m afraid that you will face misfortune in middle-age.\u201d After He Bai finished putting together this mysterious and powerful facade, in order to increase his credibility, he even put on a very solemn expression to walk around him in a circle. He raised his hands to do some weird motions to simulate reading his fortune, sighed, and said, \u201cThis misfortune is very dangerous. If you are able to get through it, you will have a successful, rich, and worry-free life. But if you can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat will happen?\u201d Di Qiuhe\u2019s expression and tone were all very calm. It seemed like the person that He Bai was talking about wasn\u2019t him.\u201cYou will die young.\u201d Finally saying the main point, He Bai unconsciously relaxed a little, and sped up what he was going to say next, \u201cYour misfortune will come when you are thirty-five years old. It has to do with a woman and a high place. The direction of the misfortune is southeast. Okay, that\u2019s all I had to say. If we are fated, let\u2019s meet again.\u201d Everything that he needed to say, he already finished saying it. If he kept on speaking, he would end up revealing something he shouldn\u2019t be revealing, so he was going to leave first.When Di Qiuhe saw that he was leaving, he quickly pressed down on his shoulder to stop him from going. With a quick eye and a fast hand, and with eyes that held a sincere smile, he said, \u201cAre you going to leave just like that? You\u2019re not even going to tell me how to escape this misfortune, or send me something to protect me, and then leave your contact information?\u201dHe Bai pulled back his legs that had just started to walk away, turned around, and patted him on the shoulder, \u201cTelling you this much is already revealing too much of heaven\u2019s secrets. Remember, do good deeds and accumulate good karma. Also, avoid women and high places- that way, you\u2019ll be able to escape this disaster. Something like my contact information is unnecessary. You are a blessed individual. God will protect you.\u201d After saying this, he turned around and left the small alleyway at a seemingly calm, but extremely fast pace, towards the nearest bus station.Leave his contact information? Everything he said just now was all made-up nonsense. If you thought about it carefully enough, there were a lot of places that didn\u2019t quite add up. If Di Qiuhe could mix in the entertainment industry so well, it was plain to see that he wasn\u2019t a stupid guy. He could trick him for a moment, but he couldn\u2019t trick him forever. Therefore, it was still better for him to run away quickly. He could only hope that they wouldn\u2019t meet again in the future, and that he wouldn\u2019t have that nightmare about him falling off that building again. His mental state was fragile, and couldn\u2019t stand all that tossing and turning!Di Qiuhe watched him leave, the corners of his mouth slowly dropping. He took that ID card out from his pocket, looked at it, and said, \u201cA Q university student\u2026\u201d?If you\u2019re enjoying this translation, please consider whitelisting this site in your ad-blocker. Thank you!?After sending this week\u2019s homework to Xu Yinrong\u2019s email, He Bai went back to the dormitory, and collapsed on his bed. He looked at the last 500 yuan in his hands, and sighed worriedly.He needed to find a way to make money.The so-called, from rags to riches, from riches to rags. Before his rebirth, he had already spent more than a decade living off of the lottery ticket that he had won the year after he graduated from college. He didn\u2019t need to worry about what he ate or what he wore. So to let him go back to working those part-time jobs day and night that paid poorly, wasn\u2019t really something that he was willing to do. It wasn\u2019t that he wasn\u2019t able to suffer a little, but that he had broadened his horizons, and the ways that he used to make money were things that he naturally disdained doing.Thinking to here, he got up, and felt for the laptop and pen under his pillow, listing the names of several famous development projects in B city in recent years, crossing them out one by one. The advantage of rebirth still existed, but he had no capital in his hands. Even if he knew about business opportunities, there was nowhere for him to start. Not to mention, he also believed in the idea of karma, so he didn\u2019t want to take advantage of the things in his brain to take away the opportunities that should have belonged to other people.What if he ended up taking advantage of foresight to seize another person\u2019s opportunities, and then ends up making that person live a life of hardship? Therefore, it was better to just take the things that he would have gotten anyway, and as for the opportunity that belonged to him\u2026 He opened the calendar in front of his notebook, and drew a circle on a date two years later.After graduating from university, he started working at the evening newspaper in B city on the recommendation of one of his professors. He became an intern journalist in the education section. This was originally a good thing, but he was unfortunate enough to meet a very bad old journalist, and was suppressed and excluded by him at every corner. The nepotism at the newspaper was so serious, but being the foolish new graduate that he was, he didn\u2019t even realize that he was being put under the bus. Later on\u2026 later on when his career was on the rocks, and he had just come out of a gambling house, he bought himself a lottery ticket using the numbers for his birthday on a whim, just for fun. As a result, he ended up winning the first prize, and became rich overnight.After winning the lottery, he was confused and lost for a while. When that old journalist tried to mess with him again, he decided to beat him up, resign, stuff his pockets full of money, and begin his journey visiting all the different famous mountains and rivers in his home country. After seeing enough of the dark side of humanity, he needed to wash his eyes with some beautiful scenery.He went from place to place, and after he had finished washing out his eyes, he wondered if he could take a record of all of the things he saw along the way, so that when he was old, he could reminisce about the past. So, he bought a camera, and officially stepped into the world of photography.Photography is a hobby that burns money- cameras need money, lenses need money, not working while looking around searching for inspiration to take photos cost money. But luckily, he was fortunate enough to be someone who didn\u2019t lack money and was also willing to learn, and was also in his prime. Thinking about it now, his technical skills in photography were all basically learnt through using money.Slowly, his efforts paid off. He started to gain a reputation in the field of photography, got to know some people with the same interests, and started to have some small accomplishments\u2026 and then in just one night, he went back to before this all began.It was still that sentence- why the hell was I reborn?He put away his notebook and pen, lay down, and then rolled himself up in his blanket.\u201cWhy are you lying down again, Xiao Bai?\u201d Wang Hu\u2019s voice sounded next to his bed, and then pulled at his blankets, \u201cLao San reserved a place at the old hotpot restaurant on the back street. He said he was going to treat us all to dinner. Get up quickly.\u201dHe Bai pulled the blanket off, turn over to look at him, and wondered, \u201cWhy did he think of inviting us to eat today?\u201dWang Hu smiled at him dryly, answering, \u201cHe\u2019s heartbroken again.\u201dHe Bai furrowed his brows, \u201cHeartbroken again? With whom?\u201d He remembered that Lao San was only heartbroken in college once. How could he have his heart broken a second time? Was it that the butterfly wings that he didn\u2019t dare to flap, ended up flapping anyway?\u201cWith Liu Huanhuan.\u201d Wang Hu\u2019s voice sounded like he was choking, with an expression that said it was hard to put it into words, \u201cThis time it was Lao San who dumped Liu Huanhuan. He said that he wanted to celebrate.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn some upscale apartment complex, Di Qiuhe opened up his computer, skillfully logged into the Q University Campus Network, and entered in his account number. Then, he picked up the card on his desk, entered He Bai\u2019s school ID number, and clicked on the search button.Some simple student information jumped out, followed by a school forum ID. He clicked on the ID that was called \u201cWhite (Bai) and Whiter (Bai),\u201d and several posts asking about part-time jobs at the school could be seen on the screen.He really is my junior at school. That Mr. Fortune Teller didn\u2019t lie.He knocked on the table, copied the forum ID, went back to the homepage of the campus network, opened the search bar, and searched his name.Even more information popped up, most of it consisting of him asking about part-time jobs, and responding to restaurant food suggestions. At the very top of the first page, a post about an item for sale, listed about a week ago, caught his eye.White and Whiter: Selling the up and coming Film Emperor Di Qiuhe\u2019s autograph. Starting Price: 10Ten bucks?His finger on the mouse stiffened for a second.Without other people around him, the almighty film emperor, who could freely express his emotions, looked like he was in a bad mood almost immediately, looking at the words, \u201cstarting price: 10,\u201d unhappily, over and over again.\u201cI\u2019m only worth ten yuan?\u201dThe great Film Emperor, who was actually very narcissistic in his heart of hearts, couldn\u2019t help but shout out.\u201cHow can I only be worth ten bucks?\u201dHe expressionlessly picked up the ID card, looked at it for a while, and then an extremely gentle smile suddenly appeared on his face. His long and slender fingers moved over the mouse, clicked on the bid button below, and bid one thousand.\u201cHe Bai.\u201d He loosened the mouse, staring at the good looking young man with a brilliant smile on the ID card, and couldn\u2019t help but poke his finger into the dimple on the left side of his face. With a low and deep voice, he said slowly, \u201cI\u2019ll remember you, little underclassman.\u201dWith a clink, four beer glasses knocked against one another.\u201cDrink!\u201d Niu Junjie shouted proudly, draining all the beer in his glass in one gulp. Putting down the glass, he said, \u201cIt really let me release so much of my resentment! I stopped my dad\u2019s car at the front door of the TV station Liu Huanhuan is signed at. She immediately ran out, crying and telling me that she regretted it, saying that she actually really loved me. Acting as a couple with that male anchor was something that the station asked them to do. She only did it because she was forced to.He Bai helped him fill up his glass again, asking, \u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cAnd then I took her hand affectionately.\u201d Niu Junjie took another swig of his beer, drinking it all in one gulp again, laughing heartily, \u201cAnd I took off the diamond ring that I had given to her, pawned it off, and donated it to an orphanage! It really felt good!\u201dHe Bai pretended not to see his red eyes, and the way his hands were using too much strength to grip his beer glass. He shook his head at Wang Hu, who was looking worried and concerned, and filled Niu Junjie\u2019s glass to the brim again. He said with a smile, \u201cOut with the old, in with the new. The next one will be even better than this one was. Come, cheers!\u201d\u201cCheers!\u201d Niu Junjie clinked glasses with him, and held up his glass towards Chen Jie and Wang Hu, who didn\u2019t say anything the whole time and were just silently eating and drinking. With an expression that seemed like he was so excited that he could rise to heaven, he said, \u201cCome come come, drink. If we don\u2019t get drunk today, we\u2019re not going home!\u201dChen Jie and Wang Hu took one look at each other, shook their heads in unison, put on a happy smile, and also raised their glasses.\u201cOkay! If we don\u2019t get drunk, we\u2019re not going home!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXu Yinrong put the ten photographs on the table, and took off his presbyopia glasses to look at He Bai, asking, \u201cWhich one do you think is the best?\u201dHe Bai rubbed his face to let himself look more spirited in spite of the headache from his hangover. He looked over the photographs one by one, raised his hand, hesitated for a moment, before pointing the picture in the upper right corner of the bus driver, \u201cThis one.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d\u201cJust a feeling.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of feeling?\u201dHe picked up the picture with the bad lighting and skewed composition, looked at the fine wrinkles on the corners of the dark brown eyes of the driver in the rearview mirror, and answered him while recalling the feeling that he had when he took the photo, \u201cI just felt\u2026 that the look in his eyes was really good. After taking the picture, the feeling I had in my heart was just that- that with this look in his eyes, the whole picture just felt like it came to life. I felt very satisfied, very happy.\u201dXu Yinrong\u2019s eyes moved a little, and continued to ask, \u201cWhy were you happy?\u201d\u201cBecause I recorded a moment that was worth remembering.\u201d The feeling of chaos caused by his hangover gradually disappeared. His mouth unconsciously turned up, with the dimple on his left cheek showing up, \u201cWhen I saw this photograph, my mind unconsciously flashes through the time that this driver was both relieved yet apologetic for bringing inconvenience to his passengers because he was trying to avoid hitting a puppy. His eyes in that moment\u2026 were very kind. This is the only photograph in these ten pictures that let me have an urge to put it away in an album, and leave it for me to look back on my memories when I\u2019m old.\u201d\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Xu Yinrong, with a faint smile on his face, nodded, \u201cNot bad. You can take a break next week.\u201dHe Bai couldn\u2019t keep up with train of thought, \u201cTake a break?\u201dXu Yinrong nodded, leaning over to take out a roster from his drawer, turning to the page that had He Bai\u2019s name on it, and using a red pen, he crossed out the score of zero, changed it to 95 points, closed the roster, and waved at him to leave, \u201cI\u2019m giving you a week off. Now go, take a nice break. It\u2019s better for young people to drink less- it\u2019s bad for your body.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s eyes lit up as he looked at the roster in his hands. After he changed his grades, he stood up excitedly and gave him a bow, and said while smiling foolishly, \u201cThank you, Professor! Professor, you\u2019re really the best!\u201d After he finished saying that, he took the camera to run away, scared that he would regret his decision and change his grades back.\u201cThat little brat\u2026\u201d Xu Yinrong shook his head, but the smile on his face grew bigger without him realizing it. He picked put his phone, calling his good friend, \u201cHey Lao Jiang- do you still remember that good seedling that I told you about last time? He\u2019s made some real big progress\u2026\u201dFor the first time, He Bai was praised by Professor Xu. He happily went to the back street to eat a meal of meat, and then with an extremely good mood, brought all of his possessions with him to go to the famous wedding photography street in B City.He thought about it for a long time, before finally deciding on a both quick way to make money that would also take into account his major- editing photographs!A photographer who couldn\u2019t edit his pictures well, was not a good chef in the kitchen. One perfect picture definitely had the shadows of people tweaking it in the later stages. As a photographer who mainly took photos of the scenery, his photoshop skills couldn\u2019t be said to be at the top-notch, but they were still pretty good. Those blue skies, clear ocean water, gorgeous colors of the rainbow, birds flying away after being startled in the forest\u2026 He could also choose not to edit them, but as long as you edited them properly, a photo that was 80 points could immediately change into a photo worth 100 points! Even though he leaned more towards, and was also better at, taking landscape pictures, and the amount of editing he did on portraits couldn\u2019t match up to the amount he did on those of scenery, he had more than a decade\u2019s worth of experience on everyone else. As long as he was willing to learn and to practice, it would be more than enough to cover his living expenses.He adjusted the camera back to his side, looked up at the elegantly decorated photography studio in front of him, and stepped inside- this studio gave out the best pay, so he decided on this store!\u201cGood afternoon, welcome to Saint Elephant Photography. Is there anything I can help you with?\u201d The lady at the front desk stood up from behind the table, smiling both politely and sweetly.\u201cHello. \u201c He Bai squeezed out the dimple on his left cheek, returning her a friendly and harmless smile, \u201cI\u2019m here to apply for the job. I saw the ad posted at the door, saying that you guys were recruiting a person to edit photographs.\u201dThe lady at the front desk blinked a few times, discreetly looking over his unstylish hair, and his obviously cheap clothing. Her gaze finally stopped at the camera bag hanging at his waist, barely maintaining the smile on her face, said, \u201cThank you for choosing Saint Elephant. Please wait in the lounge area. I\u2019ll go ask my colleague in charge of supervising recruitment.\u201d As she said this, she gestured for him to enter the small rest area to the right of the door.He Bai looked in the direction that she pointed, thanked her politely, walked to the rest area, sat down, and touched the camera bag at his waist. Even though the lady at the front desk\u2019s gaze was discreet, how could he not notice it? In this day and age, people depended on clothing to make the man, huh.Ten minutes later, a serious looking middle aged woman stepped out in her high heels, looked He Bai up and down, furrowed her brows, and asked directly, \u201cDid you bring any samples of your work?\u201dThe other person was straightforward, so He Bai was naturally also very straightforward.\u201cYes.\u201d He got up, took out a stack of photos from a pocket in his camera bag, and used two hands to hand them over, \u201cThe original pictures is on the top, the edited version is on the bottom, and there are a total of five sets of pictures. Please take a look.\u201d Since he decided to apply for the position, he was naturally prepared.The pictures were all very new. They should have just been developed not too long ago. The top-most photograph was that of a lake, letting people\u2019s eyes light up when they saw it. Li Ru thought that the original photograph was something that the other party just downloaded of some photographer\u2019s work, and only scanned it roughly before not looking at it anymore, and put all of her attention on the edited picture below it.As a result, she was immediately floored.It was still the same photograph of the lake, but the colors were a lot brighter, the contrast between light and dark was also thicker, and she didn\u2019t know how the lines of the water were edited, but it was immediately made into the main subject of the picture. A photo that was originally only a little interesting, instantly became eye-catching, making people not able to help themselves but to take a second glance.She quickly put the original photograph next to the photoshopped picture, and with this direct comparison, you could tell that there was no competition.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d She raised her head to take a look at He Bai\u2019s young face, wanted to say something but swallowed it down, and quickly lowered her head to finish looking at the other four sets of photos.All of them were photographs of the scenery, a lake, garden, nine-bend corridor, a swan returning at night, and the forest at sunset. The original photographs were already great by themselves, but were amazing after being edited. Even if it was her, she couldn\u2019t edit better than this. It wasn\u2019t that the other party\u2019s technical skill was that great, but that the person editing the photograph was able to accurately grasp the focus and soul of the pictures of scenery. He used a kind of force that was able to touch the hearts of people, and brought out just how beautiful and vivid these pictures were.It was really too good- it let people hold their breath unconsciously.\u201cAll of these were edited by you?\u201d She calmed down her excitement, looking at He Bai, \u201cHow come there aren\u2019t any portraits?\u201dHe Bai took notice of the change in her attitude, smiling with more friendliness. He said straightforwardly, \u201cI\u2019m better at photographs of scenery. I haven\u2019t photoshopped as many portraits, so the effects aren\u2019t as good as these.\u201dThis sincere attitude, coupled with his young face and pleasant smile, succeeded in making Li Ru\u2019s strict face soften a bit.\u201cYou\u2019re still young, and having a preference is normal. You can slowly make up for that later.\u201d Li Ru said, and seeing there wasn\u2019t even a glass of water placed in front of him, took a stern look at the lady at the front desk, before gently saying to He Bai, \u201cMy name is Li Ru, the director of the design department here. The pictures that you edited are great, but I still need to confirm the level of your editing skills for portraits and advertisements. Is this okay?\u201dShe\u2019s actually a director? Was there nobody else working today? Was it really necessary for a director to interview a part-time photograph editor?Thinking this in his heart, he still put on an expression of happy surprise. He took Li Ru\u2019s hand, shook it reservedly, before releasing her hands and nodding forcefully, \u201cOf course, of course. My name is He Bai. Thank you, Sister Li, for giving me this opportunity!\u201dThe slightly intimate address immediately drew the distance between the two people closer. Li Ru saw through his cute careful thoughts, smiled at him, and also started to have a more intimate attitude. He gestured for him to come with her to continue the interview inside. Then, walked in front of the front desk lady to stare at her angrily again.After being warned twice through her angry glares, the lady at the front desk was too scared to even move. After she brought the young man wearing the cheap clothing into the room, she took a small sigh of relief, and used her hands to give herself a pat on the face, \u201cThe director is so scary, I have to pay more attention in the future\u2026\u201d But that young man\u2019s photography editing skills were really good huh, he could even make that director use that kind of tone when talking to him.Leaving the front desk to go further inside, there was a big hall. In the middle of the hall, there were some desks and chairs, with all different kinds of props lying around, and there were stairs directly leading to the hallway on the second floor in the corners of the room. Looking up, the rooms on the second floor were all open, with people leaving and entering nonstop, like they were all busy doing something.\u201cThe company has recently gotten work from a TV station. There isn\u2019t enough staff on hand, so it\u2019s a little crazy around here.\u201d Li Ru saw him look around, explained the situation in as few words as possible, before bringing him across the hall towards a corridor, pushed open the small office to the left, turned on the computer, and said, \u201cThe photographs that we need you do edit are on the desktop. It\u2019s divided into two folders- one is for portraits, and one is for advertisements. Editing two of each would be enough, and you can take as long as you need. Use this landline to call me when you\u2019re done- this is my business card. It has my number on it.\u201dShe spoke very fast- He Bai guessed that she still had things to do, so he quickly took her business card to show that there were no problems, and then sat down in front of the computer.Li Ru saw that he knew not to waste time talking, and got a better impression of him. She personally went to the water dispenser to get him a glass of water, before putting it down and walking out with light steps.After confirming that there was only him left in the office, He Bai relaxed his body, rubbed at his face that had gotten a little stiff from smiling so much, took off his camera bag, and opened the editing software while taking a drink of water. He found the folder of portraits on the desktop, and double-clicked to open it.\u201cPu\u2014\u2014\u201dAll of the water that he had just drank was spit out. He quickly put the glass of water down, and picked up the keyboard that had been drenched in water. Then, he pulled out several tissues from the tissue box on the corner of the table, to wipe away at the wet screen. Looking at the piles of photos belonging to Di Qiuhe, the expression on his face twisted for a moment.How can it be this guy again! Why can\u2019t he just go a day without seeing a picture of this guy? Why couldn\u2019t he!He unwillingly wiped the keyboard and mouse clean, grabbed the mouse, and pulled out the photos from the folder. He tried to find a picture that was of another person, but his efforts were fruitless, making him so angry that his hair was almost standing on its ends.What the hell? How come even when I apply for a part-time job as a photography editor, I still have to be ravaged by this guy\u2019s pictures? Can things still go on?After staring at the table for a while, he took a deep breath, and drooping his shoulders as a sign of compromise, grasped the mouse again.Forget it. In order to eat meat, in order to make money, he would just edit them.Di Qiuhe took off his sunglasses, sitting idly on the sofa in the rest area of Red Guest Photography, which was located on the opposite side of Saint Elephant Photography. He took out his phone, opened Q University\u2019s Campus Network, and selected the place that showed goods that he had already bid on.Transaction Progress: The Seller did not respond.He squinted his eyes, using a hand to hold up his chin.Right now, it was two o\u2019clock on a Sunday afternoon. Was that guy taking an afternoon nap, or was he playing games? Or maybe he was holding his camera running around on the streets, pretending to be a \u201cpup\u201darazzi or a fortune teller?He furrowed his brows at the thought of this. Recalling the \u201cselling price: 10,\u201d a trace of evil appeared between his gentle brows.Or maybe\u2026 that guy ran to \u201ccoincidentally\u201d meet with other Film Emperors, and then tried to continue scamming other people of ten yuan?\u201cHow do you have the free time to come over here?\u201d Jiang Xiuwen put a cup of coffee in front of him, sat down opposite him, leaned back on the sofa, folded his legs, raised his chin, and rejoiced at his misfortune, \u201cThe pitiful Film Emperor who was blocked, what\u2019s wrong? Do you not have any money to eat, so you ran over to my place to mooch off of me?\u201dDi Qiuhe took a glance at him without any emotion, and snorted.\u201cI really should let those people who are tricked by you to take a look at the way you are now. What \u2018gentle and amicable, elegant gentleman,\u2019 more like \u2018mean-spirited, wolf-hearted.\u2019\u201d Jiang Xiuwen said annoyed, mimicking the way he held his chin and reaching a leg out to kick him, \u201cHow\u2019s it going with you trying to get my dad to agree?\u201dHearing him mention this, Di Qiuhe\u2019s expression became serious. He furrowed his brows, \u201cIt\u2019s still the same result. Uncle Jiang thinks that I\u2019m too young, and that my looks fall too much towards the handsome side, to be in line with the character for that role.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJiang Xiuwen took a look at that face that was so handsome that it made people of the same sex jealous, and people of the opposite sex obsessed. He sourly made a noise of disapproval, and couldn\u2019t help but to use his legs to kick him again. He suggested unkindly, \u201cYou can try sunbathing, making your skin a bit more rough, and then moving bricks in construction to get some muscles. As for your hair, you can just shave it all off. If you do all of these things, I promise that you\u2019ll look like you\u2019ve lived through hard times, and look more like a rough and tough manly man, never to look young and handsome again.\u201dThis idea couldn\u2019t be more off the mark. Di Qiuhe rolled his eyes at him, avoided the leg that he tried to use to kick him, raised his long legs, and deliberately put them down on the tea table in between the sofas. He lay on the sofa like he had no bones at all, lifted his cell phone, and sneered, \u201cIf just doing this would let Uncle Jiang agree, then I would have done it sooner.\u201d What Uncle Jiang wanted was a feeling, not the appearance, and he already made the decision of putting the script on the backburner if he couldn\u2019t find a suitable actor. This kind of attitude that put quality over anything else really let people have headaches, but was also something that was worthy of respect.A good movie needed a good director, a good script, good actors, a good team, and a good attitude. When he read the first draft of this script in Uncle Jiang\u2019s hands, he was immediately blown away. With the premise of having a good script, Uncle Jiang would definitely put together everything that was needed to make sure the good script was utilized to its full potential.He was now blocked by Huangdu, and his jobs were stopping one after the other. In not even half a year, he would completely disappear from the public eye. Besides his true love fans, there would be nobody else paying attention to this new actor who popularity was so fleeting.On this point, he really had to admire that woman Qin Li, because she chose one of the most smart, and most simple ways to let him slowly, but surely, lose everything that he had worked hard to achieve.Letting warm water slowly become cold was a lot more effective than putting ice in boiling water to force it to lower its temperature. If an actor lost his exposure, and missed the golden age for development, the result would be exactly the way you imagined it to be.Jiang Xiuwen looked at his lazy appearance, and knew that his mood started to become bad again. Thinking about his current situation, he sat up and said worriedly, \u201cThat stepmother of yours blocked you in the industry, and is even holding your contract. Your father\u2019s being swayed again by her pillowtalk, so what are you planning on doing? Even if you manage to persuade my dad, your contract is still with Huangdu. That stepmother of yours won\u2019t let you easily jump to my dad\u2019s boat.\u201dThe background picture on his phone was of a foolish looking handsome student\u2019s ID. He using his hands to poke the dimple on the other person\u2019s face, raised the corners of his mouth in a not so obvious manner, and said indifferently, \u201cIf Uncle Jiang decides to use me, then I naturally have a way to make that contract useless, and even let that woman suffer a loss.\u201dJiang Xiuwen saw that he said everything with everything in mind, knew that he had his own ideas on how to handle everything, and put down the worries in his heart. He leaned back into the sofa, and went back to his not-so-serious appearance from before, asking, \u201cThen what if my dad isn\u2019t willing to use you no matter what? Are you really going to let your stepmother block you for five, ten years?\u201d\u201cTwo years, at the most.\u201d He put down his cell phone, squinted at the delicate ceiling over his head, and said casually, \u201cHalf a year. I can still spend half a year trying to convince Uncle Jiang. If after half a year, it\u2019s still not possible, then Lin Mo still has a TV drama waiting for me.\u201d\u201cLin Mo?\u201d Jiang Xiuwen was stunned for a moment, before stretching out his legs to kick his feet that were resting on the tea table, annoyed. \u201cLeave leave leave. I just wasted my worries on you. I even used my thick skin to try and help you say good things in front of my father, and here you are with such a big escape route. Why don\u2019t you just ascend to heaven already? Looking at you makes me annoyed. Quickly leave, quickly leave.\u201dDi Qiuhe took back his legs, turned over, and faced his back at him. He opened his phone again, opened the campus network, and pressed again and again impatiently.How come the transaction still doesn\u2019t have a response? That little \u201cpup\u201darazzi, did he not appreciate the fact that he helped him earn ten yuan? Does he know how hard it is to earn ten bucks? He really doesn\u2019t understand human suffering, huh!?If you\u2019re enjoying this translation, please consider whitelisting this site in your ad-blocker. Thank you!?He Bai sneezed three times in a row, before finally finding two photographs of Di Qiuhe, that were taken on the street, that he was satisfied with.After being accustomed to shooting scenery, sure enough, he preferred these photographs of people blending in harmoniously with the surrounding landscape. Not to mention, the photographs of Di Qiuhe taken on the street were even more casual and natural, looking even more realistic than his photo shoots and stills, making it a lot easier for him to edit.His mind flashed through the image of the other person falling from the building, and he quickly sat up straight, taking out his cell phone to open the picture of Di Qiuhe that his Professor had praised. He took two hard glances, and then recalled the feeling that he had when he was taking the picture of the bus driver, while gripping at the mouse again.People\u2019s emotions can be expressed through action, expression, language, and so on and so forth, whereas a person\u2019s personality was more like being made up of a variety of different emotions pieced together. A person\u2019s character could speak more about their soul. When you discover the charm in another person\u2019s personality, you would naturally discover the shining points hidden within their soul. And on the opposite end of the spectrum, if a photograph could show the unique and attractive parts of someone\u2019s personality capturing that person\u2019s actions or expressions through pictures, then that photograph would be considered successful, and to have a soul.He took a long time to ponder over this question. In the two pictures that Professor Xu had complimented, both the emotions expressed through Di Qiuhe\u2019s actions, as well as the emotions expressed by that of the bus driver\u2019s actions, shared similarities. Even though he was still a little confused as to what the emotions that Di Qiuhe was trying to show through his actions were, he still felt like he had a better understanding of how to take good photographs of people.And editing portraits was different from taking portraits. When he was editing a picture, the actions and expressions of the main character were set in stone. He couldn\u2019t change any of these things, so why couldn\u2019t he simply just regard the person in the picture as a part of the landscape, and use that part to enhance the beauty of the picture as a whole?With a clear train of thought, doing things naturally took half the effort.He chose street photographs- one of Di Qiuhe\u2019s side profile, and one of Di Qiuhe\u2019s face close-up; one that used actions to express emotions, and one that used expressions to show emotions, just right for him to put what he just learned into practice.He imported the photos into the software, zoomed in, edited some obvious flaws first, and then took a moment to stare at Di Qiuhe\u2019s handsome face for a while, recalling that day when he had a conversation with him in a small alleyway, and moved the mouse.This person\u2026 was full of contradictions- a contradiction between his facial expression and his eyes, a contradiction between his actions and the personality that he projected through the way he spoke, and a contradiction between his outward appearance and his soul. And what he had to do now, was to emphasize these contradictions.When a gentle person was dyed with other colors, that kind of impact would definitely be exciting.Li Ru basically looked at He Bai\u2019s edited portraits in amazement, not wanting to move away her eyes, with her gaze glued to the screen.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d She was once again at a loss for words.\u201cThis is the most I can do.\u201d He Bai saw that she didn\u2019t speak, thought that she wasn\u2019t satisfied, and like a actual twenty year old young man, said nervously, and with a little embarrassment, \u201cSister Li, I tried my best already. If you\u2019re still not satisfied, then I\u2026\u201d\u201cNo! I\u2019m very satisfied!\u201d Li Ru interrupted him, and finally tore her eyes away from the photograph. She looked at him with a complicated gaze, took a shallow breath, and held out a hand to him with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re too modest. The level of your editing on portraits is comparable to that of your editing on landscape photos. They\u2019re both really good! He Bai, welcome to Saint Elephant.\u201dComparable? The fact that she gave such a high evaluation was a little unexpected.He Bai squeezed out the dimple on his left cheek, shook her hand, and said, \u201cThank you Sister Li. Actually, I kind of have a little request\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of request? Just say it, and as long as it doesn\u2019t violate any company regulations, I can help you fight for it.\u201d Li Ru was always easy to talk with when it came to talented people, and she had a very good impression of He Bai. Intuition told her that this person wouldn\u2019t open his mouth to ask for crazy conditions just because he was a little talented.He Bai smiled at her ingratiatingly, saying a little shyly, \u201cWell you see, I\u2019m still a student right now. From Monday to Friday, I have classes. I don\u2019t have time to stay at the company all the time, so I hope that I can take my work home with me\u2026\u201dIt was actually such a simple request. Li Ru couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud, and intimately patted him on the shoulder, saying, \u201cWe were recruiting a part-timer. We weren\u2019t asking for punctuality and punching in. As long as you can finish the work we give you on time, it doesn\u2019t matter where you edit the pictures. Of course, it\u2019s better if you come in on the weekends when you have time. The company has employee benefits, so remember to come and take advantage of them.\u201dHe Bai nodded happily, thanking Li Ru incessantly, making the smile on her face never stop. Then, he read the atmosphere, asked to leave first, and asked for the two portraits that he had edited before leaving. He wanted to bring them to Professor Xu to look at, and to research a little his new approach in taking pictures of people.Happily coming out of Saint Elephant, seeing that it wasn\u2019t early anymore, he found the nearest noodle shop to fill his stomach. Then, he strolled out onto the street to head for the closest bus stop.\u201cLittle \u2018pup\u2019arazzi.\u201dHe took out his phone, looking at the two edited portraits back and forth. His hands began to itch, and he took out his camera from his camera bag, put his phone back into his pocket, stopped, held the camera in front of his eyes, and aimed his camera lens at a little girl walking her dog. Seeing how the other party cutely squatted down to pet the little doggy, the corners of his mouth turned up, and his finger reached for the shutter.\u201cLittle \u2018pup\u2019arazzi.\u201dA tall and slender figure suddenly appeared two steps in front of him, arrogantly taking up the shot in his camera lens.Ka-cha.He Bai\u2019s hands tightened, he took a deep breath, and put down the camera. Looking at Di Qiuhe standing in front of him, he smiled without it reaching his eyes, \u201cWhat a coincidence, huh, Mr. Film Emperor. I just so happened to want to take a picture of a dog, and then you appeared.\u201d\u201cPu.\u201d Sitting in the driver\u2019s seat in a black car two meters away, Jiang Xiuwen couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.Di Qiuhe\u2019s habitual gentle smile stiffened for a moment, before unhappily putting the ID card in his hand back in his pocket. He pushed down the baseball cap on his head, and asked indifferently, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dHe Bai had stared at his picture for the better half of an afternoon. He already didn\u2019t want to look at this face of his anymore. So, he moved his eyes away, and answered, \u201cI\u2019m here to find a part-time job. Many thanks to Mr. Film Emperor for your concern. Sorry, but I have to go back to school now. If we\u2019re fated, let\u2019s meet again.\u201d After saying this, he lifted his feet and left, in a very heartless manner.Di Qiuhe\u2019s heart skipped a beat, and he raised his legs to chase after him. Barely maintaining his aloof and cool image as a Film Emperor, he used a low voice and a flirtatious tone to say, \u201cLittle \u201cpup\u201darazzi. Last time, you read my fortune from my face. There were some parts that I didn\u2019t quite understand. I wanted to discuss it with you again.\u201dHe Bai stopped in his steps, took out a notebook from his camera bag, found a pen, and randomly drew a seal. Then, he tore out that page of notebook paper to solemnly stuff it into Di Qiuhe\u2019s hands. He said seriously, \u201cYou\u2019ve recently offended a bad person. You shouldn\u2019t leave the house. This is for you- it can help you avoid one disaster. Farewell.\u201d After saying this, he stepped back, turned around, and quickly ran onto the bus that had stopped a couple of steps away, mixed in with the group of other boarding passengers, and disappeared.Di Qiuhe\u2019s watched the bus drive away with eyes wide open in disbelief. His brows twisted and twitched. He looked down at the pink notebook paper in his hands, saw the ugly ass dog that was drawn on it, and couldn\u2019t help but grind his teeth in frustration.\u201cHe, Bai.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDriving the car back onto the main road, Jiang Xiuwen turned to look at Di Qiuhe with eyes full of gossip, who was sitting shotgun, over and over again.Di Qiuhe noticed his line of sight, and put the notebook paper that he had been clenching in his hands onto his lap without saying a word. He turned his head over to face him, with that good-looking face of his, and a murderous aura.\u201cCough.\u201d Jiang Xiuwen removed his gaze, looked back towards the front, and tried to ask as casually as possible, \u201cSo who was that guy just now? You and him seemed to be really close with each other. Is he a new friend of yours?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d Di Qiuhe answered in a heavy voice, his hands tightening their hold on the piece of paper. Just as he thought of saying that he was just a little \u201cpup\u201darazzi that didn\u2019t know how to distinguish between good from bad, he quickly swallowed the words as they came to his mouth. He finally also tried to act as casually as possible, and responded by saying, \u201cHe\u2019s one of my little super-fans. Last time, I gave him an autograph. In order to pay me back, he decided to give me a signature as a return gift.\u201dJiang Xiuwen glanced over at the piece of paper held in his hand with an odd expression on his face, \u201cIn order to show his gratitude to his idol, a super-fan gave his own signature as a return gift, and then ran away from him like he was the plague?\u201d And even implied that this idol was a dog? Are you sure this wasn\u2019t an anti-fan?Di Qiuhe\u2019s body stiffened. He turned his head away, and stuffed the piece of paper into his pocket. He adjusted the chair so he could lay down, pulled the baseball hat over to cover his face, and pretended to be dead, \u201cI\u2019m tired. Wake me up when it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d It only takes five minutes to drive from here to the restaurant. I dare you to try and find a more reasonable reason to try and avoid having this conversation!After annoying the Film Emperor, He Bai welcomed in a new Monday with both his mind and body relaxed. Then, he was stunned silly when he went to the cafeteria window to buy breakfast.After annoying the Film Emperor, He Bai welcomed in a new Monday with both his mind and body relaxed. Then, he was stunned silly when he went to the cafeteria window to buy breakfast.\u201cOne bowl of rice porridge, two vegetable buns. Your total will be three yuan. Please swipe your card.\u201d The loud voice of the cafeteria auntie could be heard coming from the window.He took his hand out of the empty compartment in his camera bag, was silent for a few moments, before coming out from the front of the line. He reached for his cell phone to call Wang Hu, \u201cHey Lao Da- I need you to come save me. I forgot to bring money for breakfast\u2026\u201dAfter finishing breakfast, Niu Junjie, who had already walked out from the shadow of getting his heart broken, took a look at Wang Hu and Chen Jie, who were walking in front of him. He said in a low voice, \u201cXiao Bai, did you run out of living expenses? I saw that you seemed to have quit all of your part-time jobs. The semester\u2019s about to come to an end, so it\u2019s better that you decided to stop working. This way, you can have free time to prepare for the end of term exams. So, um, you shouldn\u2019t make yourself too tired. With regards to your next semester\u2019s tuition and all that, if you have any problems, just know that your brothers are always here to help.\u201dHe Bai looked at how he tried to be as careful as possible, trying not injure his pride, and his heart felt warm. He couldn\u2019t help but lift up his camera and press down on the shutter, before smiling and putting his arm around his shoulder, saying, \u201cI still have enough living expenses. I just lost my ID card somewhere, so I had no way to swipe at the register, and need to get a new one made. Since you offered to help, then until my new ID card is ready, you\u2019re responsible for my three meals a day!\u201d In the past, he used to be really sensitive towards money. He wasn\u2019t willing to take advantage of his good friends, which led to Wang Hu and the others always being as careful as possible when it came to the subject. But now, he had already lived many years surrounded by an ocean of money, and had come to understand the concept that \u201ceven siblings need to return debts,\u201d wasn\u2019t really realistic when it came to getting along with others. A good friend\u2019s good intentions should be accepted when it was appropriate, and when there was a good opportunity in the future, you could always find a way to return that favor. This kind of interaction between friends, was the most comfortable way to get along.Niu Junjie saw his attitude, and took a sigh of relief in his heart. He immediately laughed heartily, took a card out of his pocket, and stuffed it in his hand with a face that said, \u201cI\u2019m rich and I have a lot of money.\u201d He replied, \u201cOf course, of course, of course. You can have this card- whatever you want to eat, just swipe it whenever! My dad put twenty thousand yuan in there, and if i\u2019m the only one to use it, I won\u2019t be able to finish even by the time we graduate!\u201dWang Hu and Chen Jie, who were walking in front of them, were listening to their conversation. When they looked back to see Niu Junjie\u2019s happy face, they understood that the problem had been resolved, and took a sigh of relief. They took a look at one another tacitly, and slowly joined the two others walking behind them. They naturally joined in the conversation, and walked side by side towards the teaching building.At noon, the four of them swiped Niu Junjie\u2019s card to buy some small dishes at the dining hall, and had a lively meal together. After eating, He Bai went to the ID card center by himself, and went through the process of getting a new ID.Without other people by his side, he finally had the time to try and remember where he lost his ID card. After thinking about it here and there, his mind flashed through an image of Di Qiuhe\u2019s face.He vaguely recalled that day in the small alleyway, when his heart was uncharacteristically flooded with sympathy. He took out his ID card to seriously explain who he was, and even encouraged Di Qiuhe with some mind-numbingly sweet words\u2026 And then, the other person just took his card with him, just like that, without any shame at all?! What the hell kind of Film Emperor is this! Taking away something a poor student uses to buy food, doesn\u2019t this hurt his conscience at all?And then, he remembered how the other person ruined his photograph of the little girl playing with the dog. He couldn\u2019t help but angrily take out his camera, and flip to yesterday\u2019s picture. He started to click delete, dele-\u2026 huh? This guy\u2019s hand seems to be holding something\u2026He looked at the camera screen more closely, enlarged the picture, and then saw that Di Qiuhe\u2019s slender and good-looking hands seemed to be holding some card-shaped object. Looking at the color and size, it seems to be, vaguely, as if, just like\u2026 it was his ID card\u2026So that means that yesterday, Di Qiuhe called him out in order to return the ID card to him?\u2026He put down the camera, and guiltily looked up at the bright afternoon sun.Forget it. Just take it that they both repaid each other\u2019s grievances. Just let him and Di Qiuhe\u2019s fate end with him losing his ID card, and that piece of notebook paper with the drawing of the dog.After finishing the supplementary procedures, he went to an off-campus internet cafe. First, he sent the photos that he had edited yesterday (of Di Qiuhe at his workplace), along with the sets of portraits to Xu Yinrong\u2019s inbox. Then, he downloaded the pictures that he needed to edit by the end of this week from the work email he reserved for Saint Elephant, and started working.An hour later, his afternoon class was about to begin. He stretched out his arms, and called Wang Hu to help him bring his textbooks. Then, he uploaded the edited photos onto his email, closed his computer, paid his bill, and left.After he left, the long-haired artsy youth sitting next to him took off his headphones, closed the game on his screen, went on the campus forum, and excitedly, with his fingers typing so quickly they seemed to be flying, made a new post\u2013 A Breath of Fresh Air Spotted at the Internet Cafe! A Cute Underclassman Comes to the Internet Cafe to Finish Homework!At some high-end apartment building complex, Di Qiuhe had just returned home after settling an endorsement fee, and turned on his computer. His fingers automatically clicked open the Q University\u2019s Campus Network, and went to the page for buying and selling items.Transaction Progress: The Seller did not respond.His expression turned cloudy. He picked up the notebook on his desk, opened it, took out the pink notebook paper, took a picture of it, chose the option for selling an item, priced it at ten yuan, and then clicked upload, uplo-\u2026 The operation was interrupted, and your item failed to upload.That annoying little \u201cpup\u201darazzi!He angrily closed the screen that said his item failed to upload, refolded the piece of notebook paper, placed it back into his notebook, thought about it for a while before taking it out again, stuffing it into his wallet, and ground his teeth. He gloomily thought about how He Bai said that this thing would help him block disasters. If it couldn\u2019t, then he would tear the university apart until he found him, and make that little \u201cpup\u201darazzi apologize for last night\u2019s deception! Admit that he was wrong! Massage his shoulders and legs and become his little brother!After ordering the little \u201cpup\u201darazzi around in his head for a while, he was finally in a good mood. He grabbed the mouse with a gentle and kind expression on his face, casually refreshed the forum, and then saw that a new post had gone viral, and appeared on the front page.Huh? A \u201cCute Underclassman?\u201d Could they be as cute as his little \u201cpup\u201darazzi?He laughed out loud, and clicked open the post with a sort of pride that he couldn\u2019t really understand, skimmed over the content of the post, and then carelessly used his mouse to scroll down.A photo could be seen attached at the bottom of the post- the background was an internet cafe, and you could see from the picture\u2019s angle, that it was taken secretly. In the middle of the picture, was a slightly thin boy wearing a checkered shirt sitting on a black sofa chair. He had a mouse in one hand, his posture was extremely good, and on the screen in front of him, a complicated photo editing software was open with a enlarged photograph for an advertisement that had been edited halfway.This person, was the little \u201cpup\u201darazzi?He unconsciously sat upright, and stared at the carefully blurred face of the person in the photograph. His gaze was so hot it could burn through the screen, and seemed to be able to look through the mosaic to see that face that was so good-looking, it was annoying, and the small dimple that was just asking to be poked that appeared on the left side of his face when he pretended to smile.\u201cBeing in a messy place like an internet cafe\u2026 he deserves to have his picture taken secretly!\u201d He coldly snorted, and couldn\u2019t help but use his mouse to scroll back up to read the main contents of the post again, this time in detail. After he finished reading it, he couldn\u2019t help but right-click on the photo, and download it.And then, he started to feel upset again.When the little \u201cpup\u201darazzi does his homework, he has to go to an internet cafe. Is it because he doesn\u2019t have his own computer? That guy seemed to dress pretty plainly, and he even went to look for a part-time job yesterday\u2026 He suddenly felt like his heart hurt.He loosened his grip on the mouse, and glared at the two photographs that were taken secretly for a few seconds. The more he looked at those mosaics, the more he felt like they hurt his eyes. He moved his eyes away from them, and noticed something on the screen in front of the little \u201cpup\u201darazzi. He furrowed his brows, and enlarged the photograph a little.In the middle of the editing software, on the corner of the half-finished advertisement picture, there were the words, \u201cSaint Elephant Photography.\u201dHe immediately thought of the studio opposite Red Guest Photography, and thought of how the little \u201cpup\u201darazzi said that he was there to find a part-time job yesterday. He couldn\u2019t help but feel even more bad, and took out his phone to call Jiang Xiuwen.Jiang Xiuwen was driving when he saw Di Qiuhe calling him. His eyes turned, and pretended to casually ask Jiang Guanshan, who was sitting shotgun flipping a script, \u201cHey Dad, someone\u2019s calling me. It\u2019s not convenient for me to answer them since I\u2019m driving- can you pick it up for me?\u201dJiang Guanshan was called back from his thoughts looking at the script, picked up the phone, and glared at Jiang Xiuwen when he saw the name on the caller ID. He then pressed answer, and turned on the speaker phone, making sure that his son didn\u2019t have an opportunity to pull one over him.Jiang Xiuwen\u2019s brows drew together when he saw this.\u201cYou useless piece of trash.\u201d After the phone connected, Di Qiuhe\u2019s voice could immediately be heard coming out from the other end. Without giving the person on the other side a chance to reply, he continued, \u201cYou can\u2019t even win when it comes to recruiting part-timers. No wonder your competitors were able to get the business deal with the TV station instead of you guys.\u201dDu du du, the phone was hung up on the other side.The Jiang family father and son: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cQiuhe, he\u2026\u201d Jiang Guanshan started speaking first, with a somewhat complicated expression, \u201cIn front of his peers, is he always this\u2026 uninhibited and unrestrained?\u201dJiang Xiuwen recalled how his good friend always maintained a gentle and friendly mask in front of his elders. He felt at a loss, and managed to try and give him an excuse, \u201cHe\u2019s just worried about me. I mentioned the thing with the photography studio to him earlier, and he was pretty concerned for me\u2026 As you know, he has a soft heart. When his friends go through rough times, he gets even more anxious than they do.\u201d\u201cOh really.\u201d Jiang Guanshan rubbed the edge of the script, and said with a look of indifference, \u201cI can tell from the way he spoke. You know, that he\u2019s really anxious.\u201dJiang Xiuwen took a sigh of relief, and continued to try and explain the situation with a smile on his face, \u201cRight, he\u2019s just too much of a good person. He always likes worrying about\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, what\u2019s the deal with your competitors robbing you of the business deal with the TV station?\u201d Jiang Guanshan looked at him from the side, with eyes blazing like torches, \u201cWho was the person who told me that everything was going great at the photography studio? That business was going smoothly, and it would become profitable soon?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo tell me, is that kid Di Qiuhe really just worried about you, or is his real personality just like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cClose the studio. Come home and learn how to direct with me.\u201d\u201cHis personality is just like that! But, the fact that he\u2019s worried about me is also true!\u201d Jiang Xiuwen immediately abandoned his moral integrity, and lit a candle for his best friend in his heart, \u201cDad, just listen to me. Actually, Di Qiuhe, he\u2026\u201dBefore going to bed, He Bai opened the campus network, and was about to ask about the progress of replacing his ID card. As a result, the minute he opened it, he received a huge amount of transaction notifications. After being stunned for a couple of seconds, he remembered that he had listed Di Qiuhe\u2019s autograph for sale.At that time, what did he set the starting price at? Five bucks? Or was it ten bucks?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere were hundreds of notifications about the transaction, the majority of which had been automatically cancelled by the system due to a lack of response from the seller. He flipped through a long series of notifications that had already turned gray, and silently exclaimed at Di Qiuhe\u2019s popularity in his heart.This person\u2026 God is rewarding me with money for a meal, huh!Putting out the sudden flame of jealousy in his heart, he deleted the expired transaction notifications, and tried to remember where the autograph was. Feeling slightly guilty, he moved his fingers, and prepared to delete the For Sale listing.System Reminder: The item has finished bidding. The final transaction has reached 1000 yuan. Deletion of goods will cause an automatic deduction of 5% as commission. Do you still want to proceed?What? Someone bid on it? And they even spent 1000 yuan?That\u2019s not right, wait a second, automatically deduct 5% as a commission fee? How are they going to deduct it? From where are they going to deduct it? Who are they deducting it from? Why are there handling fees when all you\u2019re doing is deleting a listing?He \u00b7Poor As Fuck\u00b7 Bai clicked open the page that explained in detail the fees for transactions on the campus network with a stunned expression on his face. Ten minutes later, he went back to the campus network homepage, quickly selected Listed Goods, and looked at the both red and gorgeous looking words underneath the item that read, \u201cWinning Bid: 1000.\u201d He clicked the button to agree to the transaction, and then quickly sent a private message to the buyer, asking for their shipping address and contact information.He would never have thought that in order to prevent students from arbitrarily using the resources on the campus network, the school\u2019s leaders would set up so many rules and regulations for the buying and selling of goods. And people like him, who listed goods for ten days to half a month without responding to requests for transactions (people who only list goods but don\u2019t actually follow through), were the focus of these commission fees!After waiting for several minutes without any response from the buyer, seeing that it was getting pretty late, he threw his phone under the pillow and covered his head with his blanket.So dangerous- he almost lost one meal (with meat)\u2019s worth of money.At some upscale apartment complex, Di Qiuhe had just finished taking a shower before drying his hair and picking up his phone. Seeing that there was a new notification from the campus network, and two private messages, he stopped drying his hair for a moment, and then quickly threw the towel aside. His fingers hesitated before he clicked open the private messages first.White and Whiter: Are you there?White and Whiter: Sorry to keep you waiting for so long. The transaction was successful. Please send me your shipping address and contact information, and I will send the goods to you as soon as possible. PS: If you\u2019re a student from the North District, I can even send the goods to your door hehe. Thank you for your patronage ^-^What do you mean \u201chehe?\u201d And what\u2019s up with that smiley emoticon!Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows, and poked at the smiling emoticon at the end of the private message. He clicked reply, and wrote a whole bunch of words, but his fingers cramped up before he could send it out. He then even more angrily deleted everything he just wrote, and sent him a short reply with an expressionless face.A Bird (\u2018He\u2019 Means Crane) Born in Autumn (\u2018Qiu\u2019 Means Autumn): I\u2019m here.A Bird Born in Autumn: I\u2019ve already left school to do practical training, so I\u2019m not at school. It\u2019s too late today\u2013 add my WeChat XXX to discuss the transaction in further detail. Let\u2019s talk whenever you\u2019re free. Good night.After sending out this message, he cleared his thought, raised his chin slightly, and used a kind of expression that an emperor would use when his subjects came to pay their respects to him. He started staring at at the phone screen with his eyes squinted in focus.Two minutes later, he had still not received a response.He moved his body a little, and pressed his chin down slightly.Five minutes later, there was still no response from the other end, and also no new friend applications on the WeChat page that he opened just in case.He glared at the screen, and then clicked on the page for purchased goods, and moved his fingers.A Bird Born in Autumn: I accidentally pressed the button used to remind the seller to deliver the goods. I didn\u2019t wake you up, did I?After he finished typing, he hesitated, and added a smiling emoticon at the end of the sentence.Half an hour had passed, and the hour hand turned to twelve o\u2019clock. His half-dry hair had already thoroughly dried. He threw the silent phone to the side, and lay on his bed with a stinky expression on his face. He poked the little \u201cpup\u201darazzi\u2019s dimple in his heart a hundred times before unwillingly closing his eyes.That damn little \u201cpup\u201darazzi!\u201cXiao Bai, what are you looking for?\u201d Wang Hu, who had toothbrush hanging from his mouth, looked strangely at He Bai, who was turning over all of the things in his desk the minute he woke up. He asked with a tone of uncertainty, \u201cDid you lose something? Do you need any help?\u201d\u201cI found it!\u201d He Bai took out the slightly wrinkled piece of notebook paper from the corner of his drawer, took a sigh of relief, and explained the situation to Wang Hu. Then, he took out his phone, opened the private message that he received the night before, opened WeChat, and added the other person as a friend\u2014\u2014 It was good thing that he didn\u2019t lose the autograph. Otherwise, it would be horrible of him because not only did he make the buyer wait so long for his response in the first place, but he would also have to cancel the transaction altogether. Not to mention, the other party had such a good attitude about it all.Using a book to press the piece of notebook paper flat, he smiled while walking into the bathroom. He brushed his teeth while saying to Wang Hu, \u201cI just completed a business transaction without using a cent of my own money. When I get the money, I\u2019ll invite all of you guys to eat shish-kabobs!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Hu also wasn\u2019t polite with him, pulled the towel off the hanger to wash his face, and answered while smiling, \u201cIt\u2019s almost the end of the semester. Getting everyone together to have fun would be perfect. We\u2019re going to that place in the old alleyway, right?\u201dHe Bai stuffed his toothbrush into the side of his mouth, and gestured a sign of affirmation at him.When the semester started drawing to a close, all of the professors would start to review the important points of their classes. As a person who was reborn, and forgot everything to do with university classes, He Bai needed to work even harder than other people when it came to reviewing and studying. He made sure he paid attention at all times during classes, and didn\u2019t touch his phone even one bit\u2026 So Di Qiuhe, who had ran to Red Guest Photography in the early morning, was not happy again.He had a sour expression on his face as he curled into the sofa, and kept poking at his cell phone here and there.\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiuwen sat opposite him, and tried to ask in a pleasing way, \u201cQiuhe, have you had breakfast yet? There\u2019s a noodle place that just opened nearby, and the food\u2019s pretty good.\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s raised his eyebrows, put down his phone, and looked him over carefully, squinted his eyes, and said, \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019re hiding from me.\u201d\u201cHow, how is that possible. How can hide anything from you?\u201d Jiang Xiuwen avoided his line of sight, and smiled dryly, pulling over a pillow and hugging it in his arms. He nervously poked at it over and over again.Seeing him like this, Di Qiuhe was more and more certain that he had guessed correctly, thought for a bit, and furrowed his brows, \u201cThe last time I came over, you were still pretty normal. So the reason you\u2019re like this right now\u2026 is it because Uncle Jiang was next to you when I called you yesterday? And he heard the things I said to you?\u201d\u201cNot exactly that\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiuwen carefully glanced at him, with his voice getting lower and lower, \u201cI just wanted to help make more opportunities for you to talk with my dad. It just so happened that yesterday, when you called me, my dad was right next to me, so\u2026\u201d\u201cSo that phone call was actually picked up by Uncle Jiang himself?\u201d Di Qiuhe\u2019s eyebrows furrowed even further.Jiang Xiuwen nodded, and seeing that the expression on his face was even worse now, explained, \u201cI helped you explain afterwards. It\u2019s going to be alright. My dad doesn\u2019t have a negative opinion of you, so you can rest assured.\u201d\u201cBut there isn\u2019t any positive opinion.\u201d Di Qiuhe answered expressionlessly, and then sighed while falling back onto the sofa, rubbing his forehead, \u201cI guess this is fine too.\u201d When he kept on failing to get Uncle Jiang\u2019s approval, he had already considered exposing part of his real personality to the other party. With the current situation, he didn\u2019t need to hesitate anymore.Masks couldn\u2019t be worn for a lifetime. A little truth here, and a little lie there, would be able to get the job done even better. He had also been too careless. He had clearly decided that no matter where he was, he would never take off his disguise, and relax his ever tense nerves. But, he ended up forgetting a lot of important things without even realizing it, just because of the little \u201cpup\u201darazzi that ended up suddenly coming into his life.He had really been too relaxed lately.\u201cQiuhe\u2026\u201d Jiang Xiuwen saw the expression that had just started to have a little bit of a shadow of Di Qiuhe\u2019s past self, gradually being replaced by that familiar mask, and his heart felt sour. Finally, a strong sense of powerlessness came over him.It was a terrible feeling to see a good friend struggle to get out of a swamp, and not have any way to help. Everyone else in their twenties, like himself, were still recklessly spending their parent\u2019s money because of their parents\u2019 love and indulgence. [T/N: In Asian countries, children, especially children with rich parents, rely on their parents for a long time after what we usually consider independent in Western countries]. But, the other party had already started wearing a mask in front of other people very early on in life, for a future where he wouldn\u2019t get hurt. Di Qiuhe has had to live in an isolated and helpless situation, having to watch himself every step of the way.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I\u2019m fine.\u201d Di Qiuhe got up, and patted him on the shoulder. He smiled at him, \u201cThanks for your hospitality. I\u2019ll come over to have breakfast next time.\u201dJiang Xiuwen was stunned, \u201cYou\u2019re leaving? Where are you gonna go? Is there still work you haven\u2019t finished?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go apologize to Uncle Jiang.\u201d Di Qiuhe put on a baseball cap and sunglasses, and took out his mask to put on his face. He waved his hands at Xiuwen, \u201cUncle Jiang has always treated me sincerely, but I let down his expectations. Fortunately, it\u2019s not too late to try and fix things. Xiuwen, thank you.\u201dJiang Xiuwen watched him leave, had his shoulders collapse in exhaustion, and took a long sigh.The buyer agreed to the Wechat\u2019s friend request, but didn\u2019t end up responding.They were probably busy with something.He Bai took out his phone, carefully laid the autographed piece of notebook paper flat, and carefully placed it into a cute gift box. He also added some photographs as a free gift, and then took out a piece of paper to write a congratulatory message. After placing the message on top of the photographs, he put the lid back on the box, and clumsily tied a bow around the box with ribbon.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know otherwise, I\u2019d have thought that you were giving this to your girlfriend. It\u2019s just an autograph. Is it worth you going out to buy a box just to put it in?\u201d Niu Junjie used his fingers to play with the rather ugly bow, and pretended to dislike it, \u201cXiao Bai, your technique in tying this bow is really horrible.\u201d\u201cThe other person spent 1000 yuan on a piece of paper. If I don\u2019t make the packaging at least look a little nicer, then I\u2019d really become a mean-spirited businessman.\u201d He Bai slapped his hand away, and pushed him away like he was trying to shoo away a fly, \u201cEven if it\u2019s ugly, it\u2019s still the thought that counts. Not only is the buyer patient, but they also have a good attitude. It\u2019s definitely a young girl with a good personality. She won\u2019t mind if the bow is ugly or not.\u201d\u201cAnd what if it\u2019s a big, strong man?\u201d Niu Junjie laughed at him, and put an arm around his shoulders, \u201cDo you wanna bet? If the buyer is male, then I\u2019ll get hot water for you for two months [T/N: In Chinese university dormitories, hot water has to be taken and carried from a different location, so it\u2019s considered a chore]. If the buyer is a girl, then I\u2019ll let you use my computer for two months. I won\u2019t play games for the entire summer vacation! Lao Da and Lao Er can both be our witnesses!\u201dChen Jie and Wang Hu laughed and shouted words of encouragement.He Bai immediately understood the reason why Niu Junjie was teasing him after listening to his last comment. The smile on his face grew bigger, and he didn\u2019t poke through the other party\u2019s attempt at a bad joke. He patted the gift box, and answered, \u201cLet\u2019s make that bet! That buyer\u2019s WeChat avatar was of an extremely cute cartoon drawing of a dog. I just don\u2019t believe that a big ol\u2019 man would use that kind of picture for their profile!\u201d\u201cYou little brat, you\u2019re just too naive. Trust me, I\u2019m gonna have you prostrate before me and call me Daddy!\u201d Niu Junjie said confidently, and as a result, was poked and prodded by He Bai. The inside of the dormitory instantly became a mess.At some teahouse, Jiang Guanshan drank the tea that Di Qiuhe handed to him, and didn\u2019t give any response to his apology.Di Qiuhe was sitting opposite him with his back straight as a rod. The hands that he put on his knees tightened lightly.Ka-da, the door of the boxed room was pushed open, and an old man with grey hair walked in after the waiter who had showed him the way.Di Qiuhe looked over to see who had arrived. After getting a clear look at who the man that walked in was, he stood up hurriedly and greeted politely, \u201cElder Xu.\u201d\u201cYo, so Qiuhe is here too.\u201d Xu Yinrong nodded in his direction, and then sat down opposite Jiang Guanshan. He looked back at Di Qiuhe, who was in the middle of pouring tea for him, and his eyes flashed a bit of understanding. He looked at his good friend to ask, \u201cWhy did you call me over in such a hurry? What\u2019s going on, have you decided to use him for the role of Cheng Jun?\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s hand that was pouring tea shook a little, but went back to normal very quickly.\u201cI kind of had that in mind.\u201d Jiang Guanshan still refused to pay any attention to Di Qiuhe, and put down his tea cup to say in a calm manner, \u201cBut, the script was written according to the characters and storyline that you provided. As the only person around, who has ever had personal contact with Cheng Jun, how do you think he would do?\u201dDi Qiuhe unconsciously started breathing more lightly, put down the tea pot, and placed the tea that he had finished pouring in front of Xi Yinrong. Looking sideways at him, his expression was calm, but his hands couldn\u2019t help but clench together even tighter than before.Xu Yinrong saw the look in his eyes, and thought of the two pictures that his student had sent over that had left him feeling amazed. A slight smile appeared on his face, and he nodded, \u201cHe\u2019s not bad. There are a lot of parts to him that we have yet to discover. He can play the part.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He released his fingers which were clenching tight on the teacup, bowing deeply towards Xu Yinrong and said reverently, \"Elder Xu, thanks for the affirmation, I appreciate it.\"Xu Yinrong leaned askew to avoid Di's courtesy, shaking his hands as a gesture of \"you are welcome\".Jiang Guanshan coughed and tapped gently on the table.Di Qiuhe reached for the teapot and poured tea for him, looking him directly in the eye, said in a more reverent tone, \"Thanks for the opportunity, Uncle Jiang, and, sorry for letting you down in the past.\"\"En.\" Jiang Guanshan finally accepted his apology, holding the teacup in the hand, he said, \"Qiuhe, you've been close friends with Xiuwen for years, I watched you guys growing up together.\"Di Qiuhe's eyelashes quivered, repressing the excitement of getting what he had long wished for in the heart, lowered his head in silence for seconds. And he raised his head to smile at Jiang Guanshan, relaxing his tight shoulders, \"Silly me, it was me who had been tunnel-visioned.\"As a director, Jiang Guanshan had an eye for people. He and Xiuwen had been close friends for years, Uncle Jiang surely knew who he really was. It was ridiculous that he had been approaching Uncle Jiang with a mask on. No wonder when he tried to convince Uncle Jiang for the role of Cheng Jun, he was only told he couldn't quite deliver for his disguised personality. Now to think of it, Uncle Jiang was doing him a big favor be merely giving him a chance to read through the scripts, a shame that he hadn't understood Uncle Jiang and almost put Uncle Jiang's regard down the drain.\"He who was involved can't see as clear as a bystander.\" Jiang Guanshan saw how Di Qiuhe finally came around, he continued straightforwardly, \"If you hadn't visit me today, you wouldn't get the role of Cheng Jun.\"Di Qiuhe shuddered in the heart, waiting for Jiang Guanshan to continue.\"But you are here, and you apologized.\" Jiang Guanshan's expression turned soft, he looked at Di Qiuhe with complicated feelings, and sighed, \"Qiuhe, I've heard one thing or two about what happened in your family from Xiuwen, self-protection is human nature, I totally get that. But you are pushing people further when they approach you with good intentions. Qiuhe, you are leading yourself into a dead end.\"Di Qiuhe looked on the ground, feeling his long-closed heart now cracking open a gap. He knew what Uncle Jiang said was right, they were neither relatives or stakeholders, Uncle Jiang could have not confided with him and watching him fumbling in the wrong way as a bystander, but Uncle Jiang not only did the opposite, but also he went so far to organize this meeting, Uncle Jiang must have treated him as an endearing junior. On reflection, he was the one who put on a mask and had misinterpreted Uncle Jiang, which almost cost him this opportunity\"I'm sorry.\" He apologized again, full of gratitude.Seeing Di Qiuhe like this, Jiang Guanshan knew Di Qiuhe had taken in what he said. He nodded in content, said gently, \"You are a good kid, just keep this in mind, don't give negative thoughts the chance to take over your mindset, the best self-protection is strengthening yourself instead of isolating outside world by putting a mask on, it doesn't matter what you are isolating is good or bad.\"Di Qiuhe nodded in agreement, feeling his prospects that were deemed as negative now unfolding vividly in front of him.He Bai finally got messages from the buyer just before the afternoon class.A Bird Born in Autumn: Sorry for the delay to reply. Please send the autograph to XX Street, Red Guest Studio. Recipient: Jiang Xiuwen. Ph: 13xxx. No rush, just send it at your convenience, and WeChat me after you send it.White and Whiter: Red Guest Studio?A Bird Born in Autumn: Yup.White and Whiter: At my convenience?A Bird Born in Autumn: Yup.White and Whiter: Do you mind waiting till Sunday when I can deliver it to you in person? I happen to need to go to XX Street this Sunday.Seeing this message, Di Qiuhe who had drank a bit with the two elders at lunch suddenly sat straight out of nervousness, and soon enough sinking himself into the sofa due to dizziness.No way could \"pup\"arazzi [T/N: In Mandarin, the phrase for paparazzi literally means \"puppy squad\", which is why I put it as \"pup\"arazzi as it will be relevant later on in the story] find out it was him who bid the autograph at such a high price, no way! He wouldn't commit such a stupid thing as bidding his own autograph at such a high price! It was not allowed by his high self-esteem!He pressed his head, and typed quickly as the dizziness repressed.A Bird Born in Autumn: No way!!!He Bai, who saw three exclamation marks on the other side of the screen, touched his nose.There went his plan of delivery in person.A Bird Born in Autumn: Xiao Bai.He Bai glanced his WeChat ID, and replied compliantly.White and Whiter: Yes, sir.A Bird Born in Autumn: \"Pup\"arazzi, not cute.White and Whiter: If you are against the idea of delivering it in person, how about I post it after school this evening?Di Qiuhe was still under the influence of alcohol, he shook his head to see the screen clearly with a smile on his face.A Bird Born in Autumn: Yup, such a good boy Xiao Bai, as an elder brother, imma treat you to lollipops.He Bai was like \"\u2026\u2026\". \"Did the buyer make a move on me?\" Wait, elder brother?White and Whiter: You are a \"he\"?There went Di Qiuhe's good mood, he tapped his phone with a solemn face. \"What's wrong with a \"he\"? Can't a \"he\" message you? Yeah, right. Not a \"he\". Cannot let him know it's me who buys the autograph.\"So he kept typing with a bitter face.A Bird Born in Autumn: No!!!!He Bai saw one more exclamation marks appeared on the screen, he felt a relif, \"Phew, no more fetching hot water.\"A Bird Born in Autumn: I'm a cute girl with a big cock.White and Whiter: \u2026\u2026A Bird Born in Autumn: Cute and handsome, that's what I am.Seeing the scree, He Bai fell into silence.He\u2026he couldn't continue.The one on the other side of the screen seemed to read him through and didn't continue messaging. Class bell happened to ring, he quickly put his phone away and opened his textbook, ready to focus on the class.After class, four boys gathered at the canteen.\"So\u2026what are we gonna do about the bet?\" Chen Jie put He Bai's phone down with a funny look on the face, uttered the question in everyone's heart, \"That A Bird Born in Autumn, a 'he' or a 'she'?\"Wang Hu allocated the chopsticks, said in an uncertain tone, \"A 'he' I suppose, people blurt outy the truth when they say it inadvertently.\"Niu Junjie (Lao San) kicked those two under the table, still managed to keep a thinking face, and replied, \"I think that's a 'she', some girls like to referring themselves as 'Elder brother', 'Daddy', 'Uncle', 'Grandpa', etc just for fun, so this is not enough to prove that's a 'he', what's more, that person made a move on Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai didn't hide his info on campus BBS or his WeChat profile, do you think a 'he' will make a move on Xiao Bai who is obviously a dude?\"\"Lao San sure has a point.\" Chen Jie got the signal and nodded along, \"A 'she', definitely a 'she'. Gotta bet what you bet. Lao San, from now on, you need to stay away from your laptop and video games, we are all your supervisors here.\"Niu Junjie wailed on purpose, he threw himself on He Bai, begging Xiao Bai to care for his endearing laptop.\"Please rest assured, I'll care for it.\" He Bai stroked his chin jokingly, accepted his loot, and said, \"Poor boy, I'll fetch hot water for you before summer holiday, don't be sad, daddy loves you, daddy will see to it you pass all the exams.\"Niu Junjie's eyes sparkled, kneeled at He Bai, \"Save my ass please. Help me on my professional courses. \"Chen Jie and Wang Hu snorted at him, calling him spineless. Jollification soon took over.Later that night, Di Qiuhe woke up from hangover. He cleared his throat, went to the kitchen for warm water, stroked his stomach ached from hunger, and he made an instant noodle from the fridge.He went to wash his face while waiting for the noodle, and he looked for his phone to chat about their transaction.Been silent for a day, hoping Xiao Bai was cool with that. Thinking about this, he tapped open the WeChat app with a smile on the face.The sole chatting frame stood out on the empty screen. He tapped the frame open, skimmed through chat history, only rendering the smile frozen on the face.A Bird Born in Autumn: I'm a cute girl with a big cock.White and Whiter: \u2026\u2026A Bird Born in Autumn: Cute and handsome, that's what I am.The last three lines zoomed in greatly in his mind, he grabbed the phone tight, all his thoughts were frozen as if he was plunging into an abyss.\"A cute girl with a big cock\u2026\" \"What was I thinking? Why on earth would I reply like that? Was I possessed? By a ghost? No, no, no, no way it was me who said such a thing like that, no way. A guy with such a good taste like me would never say such a thing.\" Di Qiuhe thought to himself.And what was the matter with \"pup\"arazzi's suspension points? Was he speechless? Was he embarrassed? Or did he find the reply low taste and off-color?\"It is not like that!\"Di screamed in his heart, while he kept his cool on the outside and sat on the sofa, resumed his expressionless face, opened his noodle cup, stirred like a robot, and shoved a big fork in his mouth.\"Ouch.\"It was so hot that he threw away the fork.\"Pup\"arazzi's fake smile with a dimple on the left side of the face seemed to appear in his mind, he sank into the sofa with his eyes closed, and covered his face with a cushion in a self-avoidance way.The next afternoon, Jiang Xiuwen signed the delivery himself and sent the package only as big as a man's palm to Di Qiuhe.\"Why the long face? Shouldn't you be celebrating on getting the role?\" Sitting across Di Qiuhe, Jiang Xiuwen stared at his hands busying opening the package with prying eyes, \"Who sent you this? It says it's from Q University. Was it the little anchorwoman who chased you hard? Hadn't you told me you had nothing to do with her?\"Hearing Jiang Xiuwen mentioning that little anchorwoman, Di Qiuhe's face pulled longer, replied apathetically, \"This is from a fan, a boy.\"Package bag was open wide, a cartoon box with a ribbon bow on it showed up.Jiang Xiuwen looked baffled, \"This is from a fan, a boy, are you sure?\" \"Can this box be more girlie? A boy? Can a boy fan be so well-informed that he knew this address? Can you please put more thoughts when it comes to lying?\" Jiang Xiuwen thought in secret.Little did Di Qiuhe anticipate He Bai would use such a girlie box, his fingers went stiff, and he put the box in his bag in a self-though casual way, nodding, \"Yup, a boy fan who looks up to me, who admires me.\"Jiang Xiuwen squinted, clearing not buying what he said. He wouldn't hide the box if that was really from a fan from a close friend for year. What has he got up his sleeve?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: Sissy That WalkWith the computer sponsored by Niu Junjie, He Bai went full-on retouching photographs mode.The salary package offered by Saint Elephant Studio includes a basic salary plus commission from retouching photos. Since he was just a freshman in the company, and worked part-timely, so the basic salary he got was just 1200 Yuan, which might be deducted if he couldn't reach the minimum number of retouching required by the company. But luckily the number required was not that much, so it would be easy to finish.The commission for a retoucher varied widely. An experienced retoucher could get from a few hundreds at least to thousands at most with just one photo. But for a green-hand like him, a harsh photographic studio was justified to offer 1 Yuan for a photo, and nobody would argue about it. Luckily enough, Li Ru was quite generous with talents, so the base commission rate He Bai could get was 10 Yuan.A retoucher who worked fast could retouch a few hundreds of photos in a single day. So, if you could handle it, the earnings you could get were quite considerable, but it was also tiring. He Bai didn't intend to do the work for a long time, and once he could save enough money to cover his living expenses in summer holiday and to pay for his tuition for the next term, he would say good-bye to the monotonous assembly-line-like work.The tasks assigned to him by Saint Elephant were portraits for most of the time, among which the portraits of babies occupied the majority, and scenery-oriented advertising photos made up a small part. The work didn't require much skill, and he could easily finish dozens of photos in a day if there were few classes that day, so he could earn good money.After packing the photos retouched today and uploading them to the mail-box, He Bai stretched himself. Noticing it was already past 11:30 p.m., he hurriedly turned off his computer, took a shower and went to sleep.At the weekend, He Bai came to Saint Elephant Studio to handle the admission procedures he didn't have time to deal with last week.\"Ah, Hi, Xiao He,\" walking out from the office on the second floor, Li Ru, standing beside the handrail, waved at him with a smile, \"Come on up, I have something to talk with you.\"Noticing the Destroy Nun of the Design Department came out from her office suddenly, and talked with a stranger in a friendly manner, employees coming and going cast curious looks to He Bai who had just walked out of the Personnel Department.Having perceived the attention from the staff, He Bai greeted them with a shy smile, and went upstairs with the admission materials.After he followed Li Ru to enter an office, one employee who was moving clothes asked with curiosity, \"Who is the guy? He looks handsome, and even has dimples on his face. I noticed he took admission materials in hand. A new-coming trainee?\"\"He is not a trainee, but a part-time retoucher hired last week.\" A receptionist girl came out of the tea room, and said in a low voice.\"You guys went to work in the field last week, so you didn't know. He was interviewed and hired by Chief Inspector Li in person, and his retouching skill is just like such.\" While saying, the receptionist gave a thumbs-up, and then added, \"Besides, he is a top student from Q University, so don't boss him around the way you treat other trainees, or Chief Inspector Li will settle it with you.\"Thinking of Li Ru and her RBF, these employees trembled, and didn't continue the topic any more tacitly.\"A new-coming retoucher he is! I have been wondering why the tasks assigned to me recently have been much lighter, and it turns out that somebody has helped me share the assignments.\" A stubby young man with glasses interrupted with a smile, \"That's great! Ms. Li is so considerate. The photos from the TV station are much too sizable, and we all have been focusing on them. It is good to have someone share some odds and ends for us.\"Hearing what the young man said, the receptionist felt disdained in the heart, and thought \"Share? The fact might be that you are too bad at your job, so Ms. Li has allocated all your tasks to others. Just a lickspittle! Don't pretend to be generous! You must have hated the new-comer after being taken away the work. Pooh, You lackey.\"The office was not properly closed, so Li Ru could hear clearly about the jibber jabber in the hall of the first floor. Li frowned. She got up to close the door, and poured a cup of water for He Bai.\"Thanks, Ms Li.\" He Bai took the cup, pretending not to have heard what they said on from the first floor.\"Never mind.\" Sitting on the opposite side, Li Ru explained with a tender voice, \"We trust your ability! The work had been carefully considered before given to you! You did it well, and our clients were quite satisfied.\"\"That's great.\" Drinking a sip of water, He Bai responded with a smile.Having been quite satisfied with him, Li Ru couldn't help giving a smile too. She took out a document, and said, \"Look! After one week's investigation, we think it's such a waste for your talent by just letting you retouch basic photos. So, we have decided to get you involved in working groups dealing with some commercial photos. This is a revised contract about you salary package. Have a look.\"Taking over the document, and turning it over, He Bai widened his eyes in surprise, \"100 Yuan in commission from one photo?\" That was as well-paid as an experienced employee. He just worked here temporarily, a high commission like this was simply unbelievable.\"Yes, 100 Yuan, and based on your ability, you are getting the short end of the stick to be honest.\" Looking amusedly at his popped eyes, Li Ru felt the surprised look of the young man was just like a baby cat seeing a slice of dried fish. She explained, \"The photos I sent to you before didn't need to be refined bit by bit, so you could retouch them quickly. But the commercial photos are different, and you have to retouch them once again carefully after going through the first time of retouching. What's more, it involves layout and other aspects. You have to redo your work if the customers are not satisfied. Your workload will be doubled, and you tend to get high pressure.\"He Bai was quite clear about what Ms. Li had said, but he couldn't reveal his thought. So, he just behaved as if he had been a young man completely knowing nothing about all the knowhow in this industry. Looking as if he was suddenly enlightened, He Bai said, \"I see! But Ms. Li, pardon me, I don't know much about layout\u2026\u2026\"\"It doesn't matter. Your primary job is still retouching. Concerning the layout part, there will be other colleagues coordinating with you.\" To pacify He Bai, Li continued, \"Our major tasks recently come from the TV Station, most of which are portraits, so they don't involve much layout work. Don't be nervous.\"Expressing he had understood it at once, He Bai felt ecstatic in the heart.100 Yuan for one photo! Although retouching photos carefully took efforts, he was efficient. He could retouch 10 photos a day, so he could earn enough money to cover his tuition next term within a month! When summer holiday came, he would have more time to retouch photos, then he would get more money\u2026\u2026 Fantastic! He would treat himself to eat meat to celebrate!After walking out from Saint Elephant Studio happily, he ran to a roast duck restaurant which he had longed for a long time. A bread winner now he was, so, he wouldn't even blink spending as much as 180 Yuan on a duck!Di Qiuhe withdrew his eyesight fixated downstairs, and now he looked gloom.\"You don't study the script at home, but come here every day. What's the matter?\" Jiang Xiuwen got even more confused about this good friend of his. He had taken off his mask, but the bad temper he had hidden for many years got more severe.Casting a glance coldly at Jiang, Di took out a photo from his backpack, and put it beside his face. He asked Jiang seriously, \"Who is more handsome? He or I?\"Here we came again.Putting down his coffee cup, Jiang took a glimpse at the photo taken on a street which would surely attract one yet again no matter how many times one had seen. Jiang pocketed his conscience and said, \"You.\"\"Liar! Putting down the photo, Di looked even more gloom, \"The guy on the photo is me. How could I be more handsome than myself?\"Jiang cast a contemptuous glance at him, and said disdainfully, \"The first time you asked me about this question, I replied this way. But what's the result? You said I was perfunctory since you thought how can the real you as handsome as the you in the photo. Can you go to see a doctor? Where did you get the photo? The man who took this photo was really good at it. It just showed well your temperament of deserving a beat. I'll employ him to come to Red Guests Studio, and offer him the salary package of a chief photographer!\"Di Qiuhe took out another photo, and said without expression, \"Here is the original one.\"Getting stupefied, Jiang picked up the original photo, had a look at it, and then looked at the photo in his hand. He looked surprised, \"That photo was retouched? My God! Till now I've known the effect of retouching on a photo. The retouching guy seemed to have known you well, and he must have been blind to beautify you 200%.\"\"The jealous look of a man is just too terrible.\" Having pulled the corners of his mouth, Di rested himself in the sofa looking like a master. Raising his chin, Di's affection to himself swelled crazily. \"The retouching guy is a huge fan of me, one of the die-hard fans, who is obsessed with me, crazy, loyal, and he even stalks me for photos.\"\"Uh, isn't that a pervert.\"Di Qiuhe looked at him with his eyebrows up.Jiang Xiuwen couldn't stand it anymore. Getting up to take Di's backpack, and put it into his arms, Jiang began to drive Di outside. \"If you are suffering PMS, please go back and lie on your bed. Since you're young, don't give up treatment. My dad is still waiting for you to shoot a movie. Just cheer yourself up.\"\"You're just jealous!\" After showing himself off, Di Qiuhe felt good in the heart. Putting away the photo carefully, he stood up to grab his backpack, and said, \"Now you want to employ my true-love fan to come to your studio. Hum, it is too late.\" Having said this, he threw his backpack casually onto his back, and left handsomely.Watching him leave with astonishment, Jinag Xiuwen pressed his hands on the chest feeling suffocated. What spell was the guy cast on? How could he relapse into what he was in his teenager years when he behaved like an idiot?\"Don't forget the image labels you've given to yourself! Be gentle and upright!\" Jiang couldn't hold back the feeling of suffocation in the heart, and he shouted loudly towards the stairs, \"Remember to take some medicine! Never come here without eating medicine!\"The only response was the solicitous voice coming from the staff downstairs who led Di out shyly.\u2026\u2026That brat did piss Jiang off!There was a long queue for roast ducks. Having said in his dormitory WeChat group there would be an extra meal in the evening, He Bai went to buy a cup of milk tea, and stood at the end of the line while drinking the milk tea.\"I'm going to star in a film.\"A familiar voice coming from behind, He Bai stopped sucking the straw.\"The roast ducks here are not as delicious as those of SuXiangYuan in the southern city.He Bai spat the straw out silently.\"The signature I signed for you last time was too casual. Give it back to me, and I'll sign a new one for you.\"His hands holding the cup of milk tea trembled slightly. Thinking of the meal a few days ago, He Bai turned around timidly and smiled at the man behind, \"What a coincidence! I meet you again! Are you here to buy roast ducks too?\"Looking at the dimple on his left face, Di Qiuhe squinted his eyes, and said, \"You have lost the signature I gave to you, right?\"He Bai turned around in an instant with his eyes rolled wildly. \"How\u2026How could it be? As for the signature of a Film Emperor, such a precious item, I must have put it away well. Hah, hah\u2026\"\"Sure enough, you have lost it.\" Thinking of the dust and folding mark of the signature card, Di reached out his hand, \"Give it back to me.\"Staring at his pretty and long fingers, He Bai got speechless in the heart. To his surprise, there was such kind of Film Emperor who would take back the signature he had given out! Di Qiuhe was described as gentle, and generous to his fans in those news reports. Was it true or not? Then who was the niggard standing behind and arguing with him about a signature.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You had it coming.' With this thought, He Bai reached out his hands and held them above Di Qiuhe's.\"Well, you should return my school card.\"With a serious look on his face, Di Qiuhe looked down at the tinny hands that were considerably smaller than his. That man was indeed the 'pup'arazzi that people said he was. He had little dimples and tiny hands and was half a head shorter than him.He Bai was led to believe that he had outwitted him after getting no reply. With his dimples deepened, he withdrew his hand and said with a low voice, \"Film Emperor, this squabble between us will take us nowhere. Let's call it even, shall we?\"\"Call it even?\" said Di Qiuhe with his eyebrows raised, not afraid of shining his true colors. He shook his head in protest, saying \"No, never.\"He Bai froze a bit as their eyes met. The odd feeling that he had vaguely experienced in the alley that day was once again raging and had become clearer than ever to the extent that it could no longer be ignored.His gentle eyes remained unchanged, but the look on his face, the tone of his reply and the relaxed way he posed himself were all too foreign to him\u2026. With a twitch of his eyebrow, he unconsciously squeezed the tea cup, \"Film Emperor, it doesn't suit you to behave like this. You want to be careful with how you carry yourself in public, gotta stick to your image.\" 'Where have his tenderness and gentlemanly manners gone? Are those all just facades? It's no wonder that this guy always looks odd. It turns out that all the tenderness and amiability are staged. The truth is, he is a mean bastard! Last time we saw each other, he acted like a Film Emperor. Why is he acting so frivolously this time? Has he given up on himself because he is being blacklisted?' thought He Bai.Thinking of this, he glanced at Di Qiuhe's energetic eyes typical of the young people and sighed with great mercy. He chose not to hold it against this young man and lowered his head to take out 500 yuan from his wallet. He placed the money onto Di's hand which was still there motioned to ask the autograph back and said with an honest tone, \"The truth is, I have sold your autograph for 1000 yuan. Here, this is half of it. Your share. Don't give up just yet. Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. Your autograph will be worth 10000 yuan soon enough.\"'\u2026 He is not playing by the book,' thought Di Qiuhe.\"Keep up the good work.\" said He Bai. Wearing an amiable smile of a kind elder, He Bai patted Di's shoulder and stuck a sticker in the shape of little red flower, which he had taken out from a filming prop kit when he was going through the formalities for his first day on the job, onto his chest. He gave a few pats on Di's chest and nodded in satisfaction, \"Well, look at that. It suits you. Being blacklisted is not the end of the world. The game is not over until you give up. You must always keep up a fighting spirit. Go, go embrace your bright future!\" After finishing these words, he turned Di Qiuhe around and pushed him two steps away out from the line.After being pushed out of the line, Di Qiuhe felt a sudden tightness on the part of chest where he was patted. He looked down at his chest with his eyebrows knit as he was also experiencing a sense of joy somehow.\"What's wrong with you? Didn't I tell you there is a line here? Go wait at the back of the line. We all want our roasted ducks. You don't get to cut in line. Off you go,\" shouted He Bai. His public scolding was a stark contrast to his previous uplifting comments.Suddenly, Di Qiuhe turned back and saw He Bai staring at him with a disapproving look on his face. Meanwhile, people in the line were all looking in their direction curiously. He hurriedly covered the mask on his mouth and lowered the cap peak of his cap. Looking at those elusive dimples on He Bai's face, he couldn't help but step forward.\"Hey, Hey, did you hear me? You're not supposed to cut in line. Everyone is watching you.\" yelled He Bai loudly. Now, even the passersby also turned their gazes towards them.\"The queue jumper looks familiar. Don't you think so?\" \"Yeah\u2026I've been watching him for a while. He keeps wearing the hat and the face mask. Do you think there is a possibility that he is Di\u2026\" Di Qiuhe halted his forwarding steps as he vaguely heard a discussion coming from the back of the line. He squeezed his eyes to look at He Bai whose lips were widely stretched from side to side and then grabbed his milk tea. After that, he lowered down and growled \"'Pup'arazzi, don't play any tricks during the time when I'm filming.\" After finishing those words, he turned back and strode away. Looking from behind, his straightened back looked so much like that of a gentleman.The triumphant feeling was as fleeting as a comet as He Bai was immediately dumbfounded by what Di Qiuhe just did. That sudden robbery sent him into a rage.\"Hey! I was drinking that!\"However, Di Qiuhe was nowhere to be found.\"Excuse me\u2026\" a long-haired girl suddenly popped out and smiled at him. She asked with a flushed face, \"I saw you talking to that man for a long while\u2026 He didn't actually jump the queue, did he? You two know each other, right? Well, is he\u2026 is he\u2026?\"\"What?\" said He Bai who instantly put on a baffled look on his face and scratched his hair in embarrassment, \"I am sorry you have to see that. That man is my cousin. He's had measles and was told to avoid certain foods, but he still secretly followed me for roast duck, so \u2026. I'm really sorry. Next time, I'll remember not to talk loudly in public.\" On hearing this, the long-haired girl held back what she was preparing to say. With the blush fading, she stuttered, \"Oh, he\u2026 he is your cousin. That's\u2026 that's alright. You didn't speak that loud. Never mind\u2026\"He Bai continued to let out an embarrassing laughter which helped quash whatever resentment people might have towards them, and so this unpleasant episode eventually ended with his smile.Holding the lukewarm milk tea, Di Qiuhe smiled as he was recalling the surprised look on 'Pup'arazzi's face when he took the milk tea from him.\"Where to?\" asked the taxi driver as he started the car while pressing down the meter.The smile on Di Qiuhe's mouth quickly disappeared. He turned his head to look at the receding street view and pulled down his face mask a bit to answer the driver's question, \"The Heng Jing Villa. Drive slowly, please. I am not in a hurry.\" Now that he had secured his role in the play, it was time to address the issues regarding the contract.Upon hearing that, the driver mistakenly stepped heavily on the gas pedal and the car raced forward a few meters. Luckily, there were no cars ahead and so no harms were done. He hurriedly stabilized the speed and replied in a more careful manner, \"Sure, sure. Relax, I've got steady hands. I won't go above the speed limit.\"The Heng Jing Villa was a renowned luxurious villa compound in B City. Its residents were either rich or powerful. Who would have thought that he would be serving one of its residents? This experience was fairly exciting.Surprisingly, He Bai got a WeChat message from a buyer after buying the roast duck back to school.A Bird Born in Autumn: The giveaway is great. May I ask if you have more photos like this? I'm keen to buy it.'Buy photos?'Thinking of this, he put the roasted duck on the table, and sat down to reply the message.White and Whiter: The photo was randomly downloaded from the Internet, but I edited it a bit. If you like it, I will send you a few more for free. ^-^A Bird Born in Autumn: That's so generous of you.White and Whiter: Don't mention it. As it happens, I am on a few editing works recently. It's really no trouble.A Bird Born in Autumn: Well, thank you very much.White and Whiter: You are welcome.Five minutes later.A Bird Born in Autumn: It's Building F dormitory, North District, Q university, correct?He Bai felt confused, but then gave a positive reply.A Bird Born in Autumn: Noted.White and Whiter: ???A Bird Born in Autumn: Your bowknot is very ugly.He Bai: \"...\"A Bird Born in Autumn: But I like it very much. Thank you. ^-^He Bai was speechless, but he had to admit that he found this buyer to be very interesting.White and Whiter: Thank you for your kind words.\"Bai.\"Niu Junjie's big head suddenly emerged from behind, which sent He Bai spring to his feet.\"Why do you walk like a ninja? You scared the hell out of me.\"Rubbing his chin, Niu Junjie looked at He Bai with a crooked smile, \"In my experience, there are about three circumstances where a man would look at his cellphone with an enigmatic smile: First, he is watching something erotic. Second, he's making a bucket of money. Third, he is in love. With the way you smiled, I'll bet my money on the third scenario.\"He Bai grabbed the roasted duck and hit him with it, \"Really, getting all detective on me? Aren't you supposed to be reviewing your class notes? Come on, let's go buy some disposable tableware. We are running low.\"\"\u2026Fine\"Di Qiuhe put down the cellphone. He was now in a better mood to present himself to confront Di Qiuhua's downcast face.\"Why the silence? Is that supposed to make a point?!\" said Di Chunhua who had had enough with the way he ignored her by playing with the cellphone with his head down. She raised her voice and said, \"For a man who claimed to have renounced his right to the inheritance, you sure are quick to crawl back in disgrace. What? Are you scared of being blacklisted? Tell you what, there is no use in begging. There is no place for you in this family anymore!\"Di Qiuhe curved up his lips and showed her a scornful smile.Di Chunhua was struck dumb by his smile, and then she exploded. She stood up to fetch a cup of tea from the table and directed her aim towards him, \"What's so funny?! What? Are you finally done playing an innocent puppy? Humph! You are in no position to smile in front of me! You are just an ill-bred bastard!\"\"Shut your mouth!\"The door was thrown open by Di Bian, who was supposed to be in a company meeting. He strode in and glared at Di Chunhua, looking both pissed and surprised at the same time, \"So that's how you treat your brother when I am not around! Who taught you to say those things? Speak up! Who?!\"\"Dad\u2026 why have you returned?\" Di Chunhua stood up in embarrassment, instantly looking a lot less aggressive. She stole a threatening look at Di Qiuhe, signing him to help with the situation. Instead, Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows, looking more contemptuous than ever.\"You!\" Being turned back by someone who had never dared confront her before was way too much of a change for Di Chunhua and she immediately flew into a rage, \"What's that look on your face?! Go explain this to dad. I was only joking!\"Unlike her mother who was an expert at disguising herself, she was after all just a teenage girl who would show her true colors at the first provocation.At this moment, Di Qiuhe had finally understood his folly of pretending to be nice to everyone around him. After all, disguise only comes in handy when it is in need . For those who harbor ill will towards you, it's only fitting that you show them the same malice that they've shown you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thinking of her good behavior in the past, Di Bian feels buzzing in his head and has splitting headache. He shouts, \u201capologize to your brother, right now!\u201dDi Qiuhe reached out to Di Chunhua at the right time, and appeased her, \u201cChunhua, I do not blame you. Don\u2019t be angry. You are in poor health, don't get emotional.\u201d\u201cGet away from me. You are insincere!\u201d Di Chunhua hit his hand away without thinking.Di Qiuhe almost couldn\u2019t help laughing. He lowered his head for a while and pressed down his mood. Then, he stood up and faced Di Bian. He pulled his clothes which was wet by tea, said with a forced smile, \u201cDad, is my room still there? I want to change my clothes. Do not blame Chunhua. She is just joking. After all, there is even worse saying outside. Because she is still young, so she may be influenced by those rumors outside.\u201d\u2018How shall be it a joke by calling you bastard? What do you mean of even worse saying outside?\u2019 thought Di Bian.Di Bian looked at his little daughter who became a stranger to him because of her face of rage; meanwhile, he looked at his eldest son who was forcing a smile and hadn\u2019t been home for a long time. He felt that some of his understanding was faintly crumbling.His daughter who was clever and obedient in front of him abused her brother by shouting and commanding behind his back without scruple. The disgust in her voice was so deep. It was obvious that it was more than just throwing a fit. If this was the real attitude of his daughter toward his eldest son, was the brother-sister moment in the past fake?\u201cQiuhe, what happened to your clothes?\u201d He asked with an angry face, suppressing his agitating mood.Di Qiuhe took one step forward and stood in the front of Di Chunhua, and replied briefly, \u201cI just accidentally knocked the cup over. Dad, don\u2019t worry.\u201dDi Bian glanced at Di Qiuhe\u2019s gesture of protecting Di Chunhua, and he felt his heart was blocked with a stone. He paused and tried to soften his tone of voice, \u201cYou can go upstairs to change your clothes first.\u201d Then, he looked at Di Chunhua who was just coming out from the back of Di Qiuhe with a expression full of discontent, said with heavy tone on purpose, \u201cAs long as I live, you shall have your room in this house!\u201dDi Chunhua was stunned, and the dissatisfaction on her face was replaced by astonishment quickly. She demanded, \u201cDad, what do you mean?\u201d \u2018Mom finally forced the bastard to renounce his inheritance. What Dad is doing will put all Mom\u2019s efforts into nothing.\u2019 thought herself.\u2018Look at her attitude and tone. I was just saying that for test. Unexpectedly\u2026\u2026\u2019 Di Bian closed his eyes. Then he looked at her again and asked, \u201cWhat do you think my meaning is?\u201dIt was the first time for Di Chunhua to be gazed by her father with this kind of inquisitive and dark look. She was surprised and realized that she was too complacent in her previous behavior, so she concealed all her dissatisfactions quickly and ran to her father. She lowered her head and talked fawningly, pulling his arm, \u201cDad, I have been at home these days. Brother seldom comes home, but he has been playing mobile phone and ignored me. I went angry, feeling neglected, so I said the wrong words. Sorry, I am not intentional.\u201dThe coquetry that used to soften his heart easily suddenly was colored with new meaning now. The daughter was fifteen years old and no longer a girl who did not understand anything. Di Bian looked at his eldest son who had been standing there calmly without any argument, and looked at two cups on the tea table, one full and one empty. He pulled down his daughter\u2019s hand slowly and said, \u201cChunhua, please go to your room for rest. Qiuhe, follow me to the study room.\u201d\u201cDad.\u201d Di Chunhua was really flustered. Her father had never spoken to her in this manner.Di Bian ignored her, picking up his briefcase, and went straight upstairs.Di Qiuhe watched his dad going upstairs and removed the staged gentleness from his face. He bent down to pick up his backpack on the sofa, smiling at Di Chunhua proudly, and turned to follow Di Bian.\u201cYou!\u201d Di Chunhua wants to get angry, but considering Di Bian, she had no choice but to calm down. Biting her lips, she ran to sofa to pick up her phone and dialed her mother\u2019s phone number.The father and son sat in the study room. Di Bian asked the housekeeper to send clean clothes and towels. After watching Di Qiuhe changed the clothes, he talked to Di Qiuhe in a commanding tone, \u201cQiuhe, as you have come home, don't leave again. I don't agree to cut off the relationship between us. Huangdu is the property of Di Family. You are my son. Of course, you shall have your share for the right of inheritance.\u201d He was confused in the past. The saying of letting Qiuhe suffer grievance for family safe and compensating him in future is nonsense. The son of Di Bian could accept anything but unfair treatment!\u201cDad, if you do this, Aunt Qin will be in a pickle. She has devoted herself to the family a lot these years. It\u2019s The Board of Directors that is making trouble now. She has no choice but to propose that I quit Huangdu. If I can stabilize the situation by taking a step back, I would love to. You do not need to feel sorry for me. I believe that if Xia Song is the one who is asked to quit by the Board of Directors, he would make the same choice as me for the sake of family stability.\u201d Di Qiuhe said that while folding the clothes that he had changed and put it aside. He talked in a gentle and placatory tone, as if he had no idea of how much fortune that he was giving up on.After hearing this, Di Bian grew more dissatisfied with the Board of Directors, but also felt even more indebted about his eldest son who had always been sensible. Because he knew, if it was his second son who was put in this situation, he would never choose to quit decisively.\u201cQiuhe, you\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cDad, stop please, I will not come back. The members of Board of Directors have been changing over the years. Even you are laborious in managing Huangdu. As your son, I am not competent enough help you. Now, there finally came up a chance that I do not drag you down.\u201d Di Qiuhe shook his head and changes the topic, \u201cIn fact, I come back home this time to ask you for help.\u201dDi Bian\u2019s heart missed a beat when he heard the changes of the Board of Directors, and asked Di Qiuhe urgently when he heard that Di Qiuhe needed help, \u201cWhat kind of help? Do you need money or you agree to study abroad? I will agree whatever you want.\u201dDi Qiuhe smiled gratefully, and shook his head, \u201cNo. I have enough money. I earned endorsement fee before I was blacklisted by Huangdu, couple millions RMB. Aunt Qin also gave me the downtown apartment. I am not short on money. I have thought about going abroad to study, but I may probably have to fail Aunt Qin\u2019s kindness. Our family is in trouble now, although I may not be able to help, I want to be close to you\u2026\u2026I come back this time to hope you can ask Aunt Qin to terminate my contract. Don\u2019t worry, I will pay the liquidated damages, and I will not sign contracts with other company. I love being an actor, and I want to fight for myself.\u201dDi Bian didn\u2019t expect that he would only ask for this in the end. He swallowed his dry throat and asked, \u201cDid Aunt Qin give you the downtown apartment?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Di Qiuhe nodded, looking calm and contented, \u201cThe apartment is in good location. It is convenient for me. Aunt Qin also hires housekeeper for me. It is good.\u201dDi Bian was completely speechless. He knew that his wife gave apartment to his eldest son. At that time, he just thought his wife was being considerate to his son. But now, from a different perspective and with more information in hand, everything had changed.For families at the same level of Di family, almost every adult child had several houses and cars under his name. For the favored children, they even had company shares and started to participate in affairs of the Group. How about Qiuhe? He had been in Huangdu for three years. No one knew he was the member of Di family. He did not enjoy any benefit. The reason was that his wife said a young fella like Qiuhe might get pride easily; she meant to trial him and exercise his ability. However, three years had passed, Qiuhe had made some achievements with great effort, but he had to give up everything for this family. In the end, he only got an apartment.\u201cI am sorry.\u201d What had been taken for granted suddenly was unveiled now, only to find the things underneath was so unendurable. How he failed as a father.\u201cDad, where did that come from?\u201d Di Qiuhe slightly frowned, hesitated for a moment, \u201cI\u2019m giving you a hard time, aren\u2019t I? Aunt Qin manages the contracts of all actors of Huangdu. If she terminates my contract without going through formalities, the Board of Directors may bring trouble again\u2026\u2026It is only a seven-year contract. Three years have passed if counting this year. I can wait four years and continue my career by then. Dad, please do not feel sorry. Furthermore, Xia Song will grow up after four years. He can join the company and give you a hand with Aunt Qin. I will also feel relieved.\u201dDi Bian felt shocked and his expression became terrible again.His son only wanted to terminate the contract, yet he stooped so low to compromise.The Board of Directors of Huangdu did undergo member-changing these years. Most of the current members were relatives from his wife\u2019s side. In addition, for the contracts of actors, because there were situations that the senior executive changed jobs and took actors away alongside, so he assigned all the contract issues to his wife. At that time, he only felt that his wife was a good wife who helped him to share affairs and solve problems. But now to think it carefully, was Huangdu still under the name of Di?Once doubts arose, they were hard to put down.Di Bian looked at his son, who had become so mellow, and he was panic-stricken.Qiuhe is his first child. He once outshined all his peers. Fancy him becoming so edgeless within a few years.When exactly did all that start? Two years ago, or three years ago, or even longer?He hardly had any clue. The huge change seemed to take place in a short moment. The child once laughed loudly and resplendently became such a person who wouldn\u2019t be angry even if his sister called him bastard. Was it possible that Huangdu, just like Qiuhe, which was also grinding off the edges of Di family inch by inch and was replaced by a shell belonging to the Qin family?\u201cNo. The contract must be terminated. I will terminate your contract personally. \u201d Di Bian seemed to wake up suddenly. He took out his phone hastily, as if trying to prove something, and called his wife. The line was busy. He called again, but the line was still busy. A sudden rage rose in his heart. He called his trusted subordinate, vice-president, instead, demanding, \u201cSend me the contract of Qiuhe. Then, ask someone to draw up a termination contract. As a president, since when do I need the approval of a manager for my request? Go and get it done. If someone obstructs you, let him communicate with me directly!\u201dDi Qiuhe looked at the red face of Di Bian due to anger. A sneer flashed in his eyes. Then, he put on a worried expression quickly and walked forward to \u201cpersuade\u201d.No sooner had He Bai finished the roast duck than there came the WeChat message of the buyer again.A bird born in autumn: I feel blue.He Bai raised a hand to prop up his face, expressionless.\u2018You are feeling blue, so? We are just under transaction relationship. We shall not cross the line when it comes to deep communication.\u2019A bird born in autumn: comfort me.He Bai decides to pretend to be blind.A bird born in autumn: I was bullied by my half-sister today. My stepmother is very mean.He Bai halted the action of closing the chat box, and held the mobile phone again at eye level.A bird born in autumn: then I provoke my father to help me bully back, and I have dug a trap for my stepmother.The budding sympathy withered suddenly.A bird born in autumn: so I am happy again.He Bai: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d, \u2018is this buyer crazy?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: Sissy That WalkA bird Born in Autumn: But I know that my father shows favoritism only on a temporary basis. When my stepmother comes back and renders a curtain-lecture, I am still regarded as an outsider in this family. After all, such things have happened multiple times.He Bai sat straight. After a brief silence, he heaved a sigh and then weighed his words to type.White and Whiter: it\u2019s not hard for me to obtain an autographed photograph of Di Qiuhe. If I give it to you as a present, will you feel happier?Turning his head sideways, Di Qiuhe looked out of the window and saw Qin Li getting off the car in the yard. A breath of oppression was exhaled from his chest, which had been lingering on his mind since he returned home. With a smile on his mouth, Qiuhe fixated on his phone again and continued typing.A bird Born in Autumn: I feel blue. Only your hug and kiss can cheer me up.He Bai raised his eyebrows, staring at the phone screen for a long time with his face expressionless. All of a sudden, he stretched out one finger and poked hard at the keyboard.White and Whiter: a child who shows ill temper is not a good boy. In most cases, they were just putting on a show. What they need is nothing but a thrashing.Di Qiuhe was overwhelmed with joy instantly. To imagine the twisted expression White and Whiter had when typing that sentence insjected his body abundant energy again. Hearing the faint sound of door opening, he typed a sentence in a hurry, putting his mobile phone away, and walked over to Qin Li at the door.Qin Li was a beautiful woman, tall and delicate. Time seemed to have given her preferential treatment, leaving her only maturity and lingering charming. Like a bottle of precious wine, the older she got, the more charm she displayed.\"You already back?\" She brushed away a strand of falling hair from her ears, greeting Di Qiuhe in a gentle and natural manner, and then handed the document to him, \u201cThe vice president told me your father required your contract hastily, so I cut short the meeting to send it back. But where\u2019s your dad?\u201d\u201cIn Chunhua's room. She suddenly fell ill and called the family doctor over. Dad is worried about her and has been watching at her bedside\u201d. Di Qiuhe also put on a gentle disguise, took the document and replied in guilt,\" It\u2019s my fault. If I had not suddenly come back, she would not be angry like this. Thank you for sending me the document. Actually, you could have made others do this. Official business should come first.\u201d\"Never mind. What\u2019s more, it has nothing to do with you. Chunhua herself is excitable by temperament.\u201dQin Li patted him on the shoulder as a way of comfort, shook her head and sighed, \u201cI also wonder what\u2019s wrong with her. She looks so strange these days that her teachers informed me she often wrangled with her classmates recently. Her mother I am, I dare not to rule her over too hard. Teenagers tend to be overly sensitive, especially girls. I\u2019s so sorry that you are the one who suffered, Qiuhe.\u201dLooking at her perfect-staged expression, Di Qiuhe expressed his approval to her acting skill at heart, and then wore a slightly desolate expression, answering to her after a period of silence, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Aunt Qin... But I have a suspicion that there is someone close to Chunhua having stirred up discord between her and me. Last time we went home together, she suddenly lost her temper, drove me out of the car on the way, and even declared to blacklist me. In case it irritates Dad, I didn\u2019t tell him that. Luckily, Driver Li is a clever man who disclosed nothing to Dad. \u201dQin Li knit her brows slightly, shot an unobtrusive glance at the staircase on the second floor, bowed her head and drew a wisp of hair away. A surge of anger emerged on her face when she looked up again with her voice raised, \"How dare she make you alight from the car? She is too willful! No wonder you came late last time and were hence scolded by your father. It is really ... Oh! It\u2019s extremely unreasonable for her to do so. Let me go upstairs and give her a piece of my mind! \"\u201cPlease don't, Aunt Qin!\" Di Qiuhe barred her way swiftly. He looked very restrained, but actually he pulled her hand very hard and then continued to persuade her, \"Chunhua was just exploited by someone. Her behavior of calling me bastard or alleging to blacklist me must be the result of the dissension a certain villain sowed behind us. If you fall into rage, things will go as he or she wishes. Nowadays, Board of Directors in Huangdu is in flux, which adds the difficulty for Dad to manage it. I suspect that it is to some extent caused by sabotage of the base person, so our top priority is to smoke out the villain and solve the problem. Chunhua is still young. You have a lot of time to teach her. By the way, you'd better make an investigation of people around Xiasong. Even Chunhua is surrounded by villains, let along Xiasong. He is a candidate the board thought highly of. There must be bad person around him. \u201dShocked by Diu Qiuhe\u2019s penetrating words, Qin Li sensed clearly the villain he mentioned was nobody but her. In addition, he talked of the turbulence in Huangdu as well as the strain on Di Bian to manage the company in the first place, and then referred to that the directors fix their mind on Xiasong as their favorite and that anything should not go wrong with him. He was actually driving a wedge between Di Bian and her!She finally finds that things are quite wrong with the stepson. With her eyes dropped, she examined his facial expressions inch by inch with a critical eye, and drew her hand out, \"Qiuhe, let go of me. Where do you hear the rumor? You are as innocent as a child. Be careful not to be taken in by others\u2019 plot of sowing discord.\u201dDi Qiuhe loosened his hand and slightly leaned to one side, with his back against the staircase. The original air of tenderness disappeared from his face, and an abominable smile revealed. With his body askew, he pointed with his finger at the direction of the staircase on the second floor, and then put on a gentle disguise again when Qin Li\u2019s expression changed all at once. He offered his apology, \"I know you would say so ... I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bypass you and present the cancellation to Dad. I tried to reach your assistant several times but no one answered the phone, so ... But there\u2019s no need for you to get worried. After this thing is done, I will try to pay fewer visits to Dad lest the board stirs more trouble. \u201dWhen hearing his words, Qin Li\u2019s heart almost skipped a beat. How perfect his trick was--- avoiding the focus and then making concessions in order to gain advantages! Her calculation to get sympathy from Di Bian as well as to throw mud at Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t work at all under his words. In addition, he had also sowed discord between she and Di Bian! What happened to the boy who had been cowardly and timid before? Since when had he become so sharp-tongued!She subdued her dissatisfactions, lifting one hand to touch his hair, and said in a gentle voice, \"You silly boy, how could it comes that I should blame this on you. Leave those of the board alone. They are merely a group of clowns who make trouble. Later on, you are still the legitimate successor to Huangdu.\u201dDi Qiuhe also smiled when he dodged her hand without the least hesitation, with his smile shut off. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie to me. I understand I have no chance to inherit the company. Saying this is totally not my original intention, but now that I'm leaving, I can\u2019t help worrying about my dad. \u201dA flicker of anguish gradually appeared on his mouth, \u201cI feel very tired and don\u2019t want to act any more. Eight years ago, I, 15 years old, was almost crippled by a thug outside the school, whose father turns out to be father-in-law of your assistant; six years ago, when I was 17, a rabid dog bit me at the thigh on my way home, and the dog owner is a crack agent working for you now; four years ago, when I was 19, my roommate enticed me to go clubbing and handed me a cigarette mixed with drug. His mother, however, serves as the head of Qin\u2019s Supermarket; three years ago, I signed a contract with Huangdu, only to find that my partner was a gay of disreputable character, nothing but a pretty face. If I had not gone solo in advance, my reputation would have been spoiled since then. In spite of this, his brother, a consummate villain as wicked as one could be, took up the post of hotel manager of Qin\u2019s Hotel at your cousin\u2019s invitation; and one month ago, I unknowingly offended a grandson of one board member and was thus directed against by that person in coalition with other directors. Consequently, my father had to give me up. I am not a fool, Aunt Qin. Everything you did couldn\u2019t escape my attention, but given that you are the person my dad loves, I am willing to make a concession and help you cover up your mistakes. But you really shouldn\u2019t blacklist me or purposely put obstacles in my way and refuse to terminate my contract. What I want is nothing more than being an actor. \u201d\u201cYou ...\u201dQin Li was stunned by his bluntly-honest words. Recalling the vague figure looming up at the stairwell, she had no time to ponder how he knew those things, uttering hastily, \u201cCut the nonsense, Qiuhe! I swear that I never intend to blacklist you. What you said just now...\u201d\u201cNow that you say you have no idea, what I can do is nothing but believe that. I acted on impulse just now.\u201d Di Qiuhe interrupted her, taking a document out of his bag, gave it to her, and spoke with a hint of sadness, \u201cIt\u2019s a document to sever my relationship with Dad, on which I signed my name. But I dare not give it to Dad in person for fear that it grieves him a lot, so I have to bother you with this task. Please help me hand this document over to him and give him a few words of comfort. Besides, thank you for sending my contract back. I will entrust the letter of cancellation to my lawyer, and mail it with the penalty fee to Huangdu. From then on, I hope neither of us will interfere with each other. I will continue my acting career, and you can pay attention to grooming Xiasong for the presidential post of Huangdu in the future. All I ask for is that you could stop making things difficult for me.\u201dThe situation took an abrupt turn for Qin Li. The document, which she had been drooling over for a long time, had become a hot potato now. Burning with inveterate hatred, Qin Li had no choice but to continue putting on an act, with her eyes brimming with tears, she explained, \u201cQiuhe, you have misunderstood me. Just tell me who cooked up the story and cheated you, I guarantee to settle scores with him! As for this certificate, you\u2019d better retrieve it. As a saying goes, blood is thicker than water. Your emotional tie to your dad can never be ended by a piece of paper. I ...\u201d\u201cIsn't a document enough? I\u2019ve already severed relationship with Dad. What else do you want?\u201d Di Qiuhe suddenly raised his voice to interrupt her. His heart was pounding heavily. It seemed that Diu Qiuhe was trying to suppress some painful emotions, and then he continued in a low voice, \u201cI understand. No wonder you have been persuading my father to send me abroad for study ... Aunt Qin, please take good care of my father. It\u2019s time for me to leave. \u201d\u201cQiuhe!\u201d Qin Li nearly cried a scream. She stepped forward to hold his hand and shouted at him, \u201cYou can't do this! We are a family. When misunderstanding occurs, what we need to do is to clear it up instantly. You father and I will be heartbroken if you leave in this way!\u201d She was quite clear that Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t go away before her very eyes. If he did, she could hardly get rid of slanders on her, and the document he left behind would no longer take effect. Even if she finally coaxed forgiveness out of Di Bian, he would be forever extremely guilty of Di Qiuhe, his eldest son who had undergone such grievance, and she could hardly make any issue out of it.Di Qiuhe halted, turning around after a deep breath. He grasped her hand on his arm, pulled it down slowly, and said with tears in his eyes, \u201cDo you have any idea that I was actually ready to call you mom when I was 15? Unluckily, I overheard your talk with your assistant by phone then ... You must have been disappointed at the news that I wasn\u2019t crippled, haven\u2019t you? As to Chunhua, she is still very young. I already renounced my claim to Huangdu and am ready to cut off relation with the family. Please do not teach wrong thing to her. She should have been a lovable girl pure in thought.\u201d After that, he shook her hand off and strode into the darkening night.\u201cQiu ...\u201dOh, no! She was done\u2026Looking at the empty gate and listening to the footsteps from the staircase, Qin Li shut her eyes in a fury.Di Qiuhe, you bad bastard! \u2018As the proverb says, a barking dog doesn\u2019t bite.\u2019 She had to admit that she indeed made an error of judgment!Early in the morning, He Bai walked out from the dormitory building yawning. Fiddling with the campus card that was re-applied just now, he headed for the canteen.\u201cI would like longevity noodles of the North Canteen. \u201dA tall, slender figure suddenly emerged from another pathway and drew more and more closer to him spontaneously.He Bai dropped his gaze and stepped sideways to draw a line between the two.Di Qiuhe looked up at the rising sun with his hands in his pocket and muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s my 23th birthday today.\u201dHe Bai covered his ears with his hands to indicate that he was able to hear nothing.\u201cYesterday I was kicked out by my family. Also, Huangdu terminated the engagement with me and demanded a large amount of penalty fee. Sometimes I really feel that life is so boring... Do you know what will happen to people when they die? Is there really Lethean soup for them to drink? \"There occurs a lump in He Bai\u2019s throat as he heard this. Smoldering with sentiment, he turns into the other path at the fork and takes two steps forwards to find that the person who always tags him along does not keep up. Turning his head, He Bai darted a feigning furious look over his shoulders at Di Qiuhe, \u201cAren\u2019t you the one who would like longevity noodles? Keep up!\u201dOn hearing what he said, Diu Qiuhe was taken aback at the fork, with his expression covered by the brim of his hat. Then he smiled, lifting his hat, and stepped forward, \"In return for your treat, I will give you something as a gift. How about one autographed photo of mine? You once said my signature can be sold for 10,000 in the future, let alone my autographed photograph, which will certainly be sold better. Little pup, you are about to make a bundle. \"He Bai: \" ... \" He was so tempted to beat that Film Emperor up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He put a straw into the soy milk without hesitation, took a swig, and then took it out. He then got up with his school card to buy another one.\u201cGot any sugar in it? I like it sweet.\u201d Di Qiuhe requested with an innocent look.He Bai took a deep breath. \u2018It\u2019s his birthday after all. Besides, I shouldn\u2019t quarrel with an imbecile\u2019. Thinking of that, he got up in a rage and took the soy milk to add sugar. After that, he put a straw into it and placed the soy milk beside Di Qiuhe\u2019s bowl. Then, he picked up his bun and took a bite, looking ferocious with his eyes widened.His angry face looked a lot like that of a teenager. Di Qiuhe sneaked a look at his elusive dimples when He Bai was chewing and gave a small cough to cover his laugh. He slowly rolled up his sleeves before stirring the noodles with the chopsticks\uff0cgently picked up one and delivered to his mouth.He Bai\u2019s eyes followed his movements before finally fixing his eyes on his mouth.The lips were moistened by the wet noodle when it\u2019s sent to his mouth and now he had become even more attractive with glossy lips, slightly closed teeth and faintly revealed tongue. The wooden chopsticks holding the springy noodles were slowly being sent into his mouth.\"I want more pepper.\" said Di Qiuhe while putting down the chopsticks.He Bai tried to get his breath back as he was nearly chocked by the bun after hearing his request. He hurriedly gulped down a large amount of soy milk to help with the choking and then throwed the bag of buns onto the table in a rage. After that, he got up again, saying \u201cWait!\u201dDi Qiuhe looked at him with a baffled and aggrieved face \u201cAre you ok?\"He Bai, unconsciously gritting his teeth, said, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dBang!A bowl of flaming-red pepper oil was placed next to the soy milk.Di Qiuhe, with eyes lightening up, smiled gently at He Bai. \u201cThank you. You are so considerate.\u201dHe Bai continued to bite his buns and decided to turn a deaf ear to whatever he was going to say next.\"That\u2026\u2026\"He was resolved to not respond to him and simply kept biting one bun after another.Di Qiuhe curled up his lips as he noticed his stuffed cheeks and uptight body, but then he held back his desire to mess with him further and instead lowered down his head and swallowed a mouthful of noodle into his mouth. He commended, \u201cSo delicious, just like before.\"Like before?He Bai felt surprised. He swallowed the buns and looked up at him, asking \"Have you ever had longevity noodle here?\"\u201cHm,\u201d replied Di Qiuhe with a smile after gulping down a mouthful of sweet soybean milk in the same way he did, \u201cI have tried it twice. Didn\u2019t I tell you? I am a student of the Q university, but I graduated this year. I\u2019ve come back to collect my diploma. Never thought I will run into you here.\u201dIt was June and the fourth graders were coming back in droves for their graduation photos and diplomas. Although it did surprise him that Di Qiuhe was a student of this university. He was suddenly reminded of the buyer who bought Di Qiuhe\u2019s autograph. That man was also a fourth grader of the Q university and his ID on both the forum and WeChat bore uncanny resemblance to Di Qiuhe\u2019s name. Could they be the same person?\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Is there something on my face?\u201d Di Qiuhe touched his face and put on a gentle smile. \u201cAre you surprised that a handsome man like me would go to such a prestigious college? That\u2019s fine. I get that a lot. Though I study here, I seldomly came to school because of the nature of my job. Even my classmates might not know me.\u201dHe Bai slightly lowered his eyes. The unreasonable doubts bothered him to ask, that\u2026.\u201cDid you sign in the school BBS? What\u2019s your ID? Let\u2019s friend each other.\u201d He requested.\u201cSchool BBS\u201d said Di Qiuhe with a confused face. He frowned as he tried to dig into his memory, then he drew out his phone to search the websites, all the while saying \u201cI remember I signed up when I got enrolled back then, but I used my school ID number instead of a registered account name. Let me see\u2026\u201dSeeing that, He Bai quickly used his WeChat to send a message to the buyer.He sneaked a look at Di Qiuhe who was busy signing in the school forum. Di Qiuhe was obviously not using the WeChat, and he got an immediate reply from the buyer.A Bird Born in Autumn: Good morning. It\u2019s yet another beautiful day.\u201cSorry, it would seem that my company canceled my ID in order to protect my privacy.\u201d Di Qiuhe showed him the screen of his phone, looking quite sorry. Then he withdrew his hand with a touch of melancholy on his face, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that an alumnus wanted to friend me\u2026 Thank you for being with me on my birthday. I\u2019m very happy today.\u201dLooking at his sad face, He Bai almost felt guilty as if he had done something terrible to him.\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re welcome.\u201d Ashamed of what he had in mind a while ago, he put away his phone.It made sense. They couldn\u2019t very well be the same person. After all, who would pay a fortune to buy back one\u2019s own autograph after giving it away? That was not something that a smart man like Di Qiuhe would do. He was not that rich.The more he thought of it, the guiltier he felt for being so paranoid a while ago. He then realized that what he said had deeply upsett Di and he hurriedly added, \u201cToday is your birthday. What else do you want except for the longevity noodles? Cake? I know just the place to eat cake. Would you like me to order you one\u201d\u201cOk. Let\u2019s go have some cake.\u201d Di Qiuhe chimed in and sped up to finish his noodle. \u201cI thought I\u2019ll be alone today. Thank God I ran into you, little puppy. Thank you.\u201dHe Bai swallowed what he wanted to say and looked towards his camera bag beside him.\u2018Perhaps, I just found the right model for photographic course this week.\u2019Each of them finished the breakfasts with their own axe to grind. Then Di Qiuhe went to get his diploma, while He Bai took photos of Di Qiuhe striding into the teaching building.With the sun rising, more and more students were coming out for exercises. To avoid causing disturbance, Di Qiuhe rode with He Bai downtown after getting his diploma. Afterwards, they drove together to a game center.\u201cDon\u2019t you want a cake?\u201d Standing in front of the game center, He Bai felt as if he was about to enter the lion\u2019s den.\u201cI have already ordered a cake over the phone, but it needs time to be ready. Let\u2019s kill some time with this while we wait.\u201d Di Qiuhe lowered his cap. From his pocket he drew 500 yuan and delivered them to He Bai, \u201cHere you are. Go exchange some game coins. Let\u2019s play to our hearts\u2019 content.\u201dHe stared at the money as if it\u2019s the same 500 yuan that he made yesterday. The shame for selling the autograph came out again. He took a picture when he saw Di Qiuhe \u2018s handsome face under that cap peak. He then took the money and strode into the game center, all the while thinking, \u2018Well, think of it as a compensation for selling his autograph.\u2019They tried everything that the game center had to offer: basketball machine, fishing machine, street dancing machine and VR equipment. He Bai stood next to a doll machine with an emotionless face, quietly watching Di Qiuhe wrestling with the gripper trying to catch the dolls. At weekends, there were a lot of people. Earlier the two were able to go on unnoticed under the cover of the dim lights, but now in the section of doll machines where lights were sufficiently bright, more and more passersby were looking towards their direction.Holding back his impulse to yawn, He Bai suddenly noticed that not far away there were a few girls looking at his direction with sparkling eyes. With a twitch of his eyebrows, he looked around and saw a staff in a maid\u2019s uniform selling comic spin-offs. He hurriedly stopped her and bought something. Then, he came back, placing his hands on Di Qiuhe\u2019s shoulders and turning him around to face himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d causally said Di Qiuhe, not minding the fact that this sudden interruption had totally ruined his best chance at catching the doll. Nonetheless, he wasn\u2019t pissed, and instead raised his hat a bit and gently asked, \u201cGetting impatient, hm? Shall we go get some drinks?\u201dThe blushed face after playing, the smile, and the gentle way he said those words almost made He Bai feel like he was flirting with him. What a horrible delusion it was!Holding back his desire to make sarcastic comments, He Bai stuck a sticker on Di\u2019s face and then he squeezed a lot of paint, randomly rubbing them all over Di\u2019s forehead and cheeks. He nodded with satisfaction after the handsome face had turned into a messy drawing board and then waved him away, \u201cOk. Go play. Childish Di.\u201d He had figured out that Di Qiuhe was a childish man faking to be a mature grown-up. He was obviously a lousy gamer and the way he kept playing said a lot about his childish character. He now looked nothing like what he was made out to be.Di Qiuhe let him do what he would to his face, but then he, smelled at the paint with a frown, \u201cChildish Di?\u201d\u201cHow about Junior Di?\u201d He Bai generously replied.Di Qiuhe suddenly grabbed the paint from him, squeezing out a handful and rubbing it onto the dimple on the left side of his face. He then pinched his face. \u201cYou are younger than me. If I\u2019m Childish Di, what does that make you?\u201d\u201cYour uncle.\u201d\u201cLittle puppy.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cMy uncle has been dead for many years.\u201dHe Bai took away his hands. Then he quickly took some photos and snickered \u201cI\u2019m going to take all the ugly photos of you, then sell them to your stupid fan. Let\u2019s see whether she would stop idolizing you and turn against you instead.\u201dDi Qiuhe put on a gentle smile while looking into the camera. \u201cStupid fan? Who? The one spent 1000 yuan for the autograph? Little puppy, I forgot to ask you. Why did you sell my autograph? Do you hate me?\u201dThe guy in the camera was smiling, but with a sense of sadness. Unconsciously, He Bai pressed the shutter to take a picture, then put it down with a sigh. He put on his poker face again and tilted his head to looked at the door, signaling him to tag along, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I\u2019m starving. Let\u2019s go eat something.\u201d\u201cYour treat?\u201d\u201c\u2026 My treat.\u201d\u201cI want to eat ribs. The most expensive kind.\u201dHe Bai paused suddenly and pulled over his hands for a quick shake. Then he let them go, waving \u201cHappy birthday. See you again!\u201dDi Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help but laugh. The moment He Bai turned around, Di Qiuhe quickly caught his bag belt. Being taller than him, Di Qiuhe took away his camera with ease, and then he waved \u201cAll right. Thanks. See you again!\u201dAfter finishing those words, he turned back and went away without hesitation as quickly as he could.\u201cWait\u2026\u201d He Bai was dumbfounded, and then he stomped his feet, shouting \u201cYou bastard! My camera!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just in a flash, Di Qiuhe disappeared into the crowd from the view of He Bai. He had no choice but to chase him along a possible direction. After hitting a couple, he had to admit in despair that his camera bag had been snatched away by a bastard whom he offered to celebrate birthday and faced no shortage of money at all!A bastard who bit the hand that fed him!Quite ungrateful!Diu Qiuhe had appropriated his campus card, snatched the milky tea he had not finished, and took away his camera just now. How come such a creature became the Film Emperor? He was more of a bandit than an actor! Such a person, such a person... What lousy luck he had to make the acquaintance of Di Qiuhe!He Bai did several twirls on the spot when he recalled he had stowed his mobile phone in his pocket. He stopped immediately and took the phone out to find in desperation that he had no way to get in touch with Di Qiuhe.The camera he borrowed from Mr. Xu was not cheap. What he could do if it was never returned... to call the police? He laid a finger on the emergency dial key and then turned his phone off ferociously after a slight hesitation! \u2018Fuck! Today is supposedly not fit for going out!\u2019Against a jewelry store shelf across the street stood Di Qiuhe who clicked the shutter at He Bai trotting down the street in a rage. Smiling, Di Qiuhe logged in WeChat on his phone and sent a message out with delight.A Bird Born in Autumn: Happy Birthday! Don\u2019t forget to eat cake ^-^Hearing the beep, He Bai logged in his WeChat, and a stroke of doubt was raised in his mind when he saw this message. He replied in a puzzle.White and Whiter: my birthday?A Bird Born in Autumn: Yeah, I notice that your WeChat account name is the combination of an acronym plus a date, so I guess that date is your birthday, isn't it?He Bai blinked perplexedly. He quit the chat box, looked at his WeChat account as well as the date, and then realized that it was really his birthday today...Staying alone for a long time, he had forgotten to care about things like his birthday which occurred every year while Di Qiuhe should be so careful to find this detail and extended greeting to him unexpectedly.He Bai\u2019s rage was quickly appeased. He felt a little embarrassed and quite touched, replying in a hurry.White and Whiter: It's my birthday indeed. I myself didn\u2019t even realize. Thank you.A Bird Born in Autumn: My pleasure. Remember to have birthday cake and longevity noodles^-^He Bai smiled so dazzlingly that a pair of dimples appeared on his face. He thanked Di Qiuhe again when something occurred to him suddenly.Di Qiuhe, Qiuhe (which means \u201cAutumn Crane\u201d in Chinese). He remembered vaguely that the encyclopedia online reported Di Qiuhe was born in autumn so his parents named him Qiuhe. And now ... was certainly in summer! Early summer!S-H-I-T....He was a sheer liar and robber who behaved like a three-year-old boy!He Bai acted furiously again, pacing up and down, and ran briskly to the bus stop. Since Di Qiuhe was a student of Q University, he must have left his contact details and address there. As a saying goes, the monk can run away, but the temple won\u2019t run away with him. He told himself the camera must be taken back!Watching the slightly thin figure disappear from view, Di Qiuhe packed the mobile phone up and turned to the shop assistant who was staring at him carefully. He pointed to the camera bag hanging about his arm, and asked politely with his habitually gentle smile, \u201cExcuse me, can I have a gift box to hold this camera?\u201dLooking at Diu Qiuhe\u2019s paint-stained face and colorful stickers on it, the clerk couldn\u2019t help treating him as a retarded youth. He helped to search out a pink-and-blue heart-shaped gift box with a sympathetic attitude and asked as softly as possible, \u201cIs this OK?\u201d In his eyes, Di Qiuhe was obviously a game enthusiast who had lost his mind so much that he dared not to provoke him.Di Qiuhe sized the box up and recalled that He Bai wore a sky-blue T-shirt today. He nodded with satisfaction and added, \u201cPlease fetch me a ribbon that looks cute.\u201dThe clerk responded and turned around to get a ribbon when he paid silent tribute to his gift-receiver: the girl who was pursued by such a neurotic person must feel very painful.Due to traffic jam at weekends, He Bai spent over two hours on the way to campus. Being looked up and down in the taxi, He hurried to his dormitory to wash his face as soon as he got off... However, he was taken aback by two ribbon-decorated pink-and-blue boxes on the ground, one smaller and the other larger.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?!\u201d He looked at the door plate first and then the dreamy boxes on the ground, rubbing his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re finally back, Bai! Look, someone sent you a gift!\u201d Niu Junjie sprang out and cried excitedly. Puzzled, he looked at He Bai\u2019s face and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your face? Were you beaten up?\u201d\u201cNo, it's paint.\u201d He rubbed the paint which dried out on his face and replied in puzzlement, \u201cSent me a gift? Are these for me?\u201d\u201cSure\u201d, Wang Hu came towards him, with a pair of scissors in his hand, and signaled him to look at the note on the box, \u201cThere are your information on it, including your faculty, major, school card number and your name. The housemaster told us the two boxes were sent half an hour ago by a guy in takeaway uniform. He didn\u2019t have your number and thus gave them to the housemaster. If Junjie hadn\u2019t passed by and looked on, your name would be on the blackboard at the door of the housemaster. \u201dThe blackboard bulletin was prepared specially for students who returned late, stayed out all night or lost their belongings. Whoever was recorded on it would be ridiculed for an entire week.He Bai wiped his face, gave Niu Junjie a grateful look, and spoke in a sincere way, \u201cthank you, Junjie.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Niu Junjie waved his hand while his eyes glued on the box. He made faces to He Bai, \u201cOpen them and have a look at things inside! Judging from their color and package, the giver is definitely a girl! Ha, a girl courts you, Bai!\u201dChen Jie who kept quite all the while held his glasses up and burst into claim, \u201cWhy not a boy?\u201dSilence reigned the room, and it suddenly struck them that a foreign exchange student once pursued He Bai in a crazy manner. They stepped back in concert without previous arrangement, far away from the two boxes.Touching the scissors in his hand, Wang Hu uttered slowly, \u201cThe anonymous gift-giving is to some extent like the guy\u2019s style... Does Locke, the romantic art student, come back?\u201d\u201cI suppose he is not. The exchange ended last semester and he already went home ...\u201d Niu Junjie said with little confidence.Chen Jie bent his head to look at the note, and made a rational analysis, \u201cThe note is written in Chinese with elegant handwriting, so it is by no means penned by foreigners.\u201dHearing his words, Niu Junjie also stared at the note, flustered, \u201cBut this handwriting looks so unrestrained that no girl could compose it.\u201dHe Bai racked his brains, trying to remember things about Locke with his eyebrows raised. He came up to see that note and something crossed his mind. Expressionless, he stretched one hand to Wang Hu, \u201cBro, give me your scissors. Don't panic! These boxes aren't from Locke. \u201d\u201cNot Locke?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHearing his definite answer, the other three drew closer again, all asking at once why he was so sure as well as whether he already knew who it actually was.\u201cI had no idea originally, but after seeing the handwriting on the note, I think I know who he is. Don\u2019t worry. The giver is an enemy, no, a friend of mine, but he is really not Locke.\u201d He Bai answered with a sullen face, cut the ribbons around the box directly and opened the box while scolding Di Qiuhe secretly.With the box lid opened, a delicate three-layer cake revealed in front of the crowd, which greatly shocked Wang Hu and the other two.He Bai\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. He opened the other box and found his camera robbed as expected.... Di Qiuhe was certainly a retard, of which He Bai was now quite sure.\u201cA three-layer cake from J. It must be quite expensive!\u201d Niu Junjie crouched over the cake and rubbed his chin, \u201cBut why did your friend draw a dog on it?\u201d\u201cThere are words next to the dog.\u201d Chen Jie pushed his glasses up, lowered his head, and made every effort to identify those extraordinarily small words next to the puppy, \u201cHappy birthday, Little Pup! Thank you for sending photos to Mr. Xu Yinrong. Plus, my birthday is on September 7th. Don\u2019t forget to present me with a gift in return!\u201dWang Hu took the phone to look at the date, and clapped himself hard on the forehead, \u201cMy memory is so poor that I almost forget today is Bai\u2019s birthday. How about going out for dinner at night to celebrate?Niu Junjie gave his consent immediately by raising his hand. Chen Jie also nodded with a smile.He Bai looked at them, smiling, \u201cmy treat\u201d, and looked down at the cake with his brow slightly knitted. \u2018Why did Di Qiuhe thank me for the photos? Which photos? Was he familiar with Mr. Xu? Did he refer to the picture I took by chance? But how did he know I had sent the picture to Mr. Xu? Wait, does this mean Di Qiuhe had already knew I handed in his picture as my homework?\u2019...Looking at the three-layer cake on the ground and the camera bag in the box, He Bai heaved a deep sigh....The feeling was like having sugar mixed with shit.He Bai thought his \u201csurprise\u201d was finished and didn\u2019t expect that another box was sent over two days later, and that his name was recorded on the blackboard after all.\u201cWas it also sent by that friend of yours?\u201d Niu Junjie moved over curiously, took a look at the pink boxes and then at He Bai\u2019s tender face, and sighed with gloom, \u201cAlas, Bai, you\u2019d better get a girlfriend.\u201dHe Bai threw him a sidelong glance, pushed his face aside, tore off the note on the box and opened the lid. Then he looked completely stunned.The box was half full of photos Di Qiuhe had taken the other day with his signature on them.There was another note glued to the surface of the box. He tore it off to find that a phone number was written on it. After some hesitation he took out his phone, saved the number and sent a text message to the number after circumspect typing.He Bai: I have received your photos. Thank you. In addition, as regard to what you mentioned on the cake about the photos and Mr. Xu, could you please tell me exactly what was going on?Di Qiuhe was listening to discussions between Jiang Guanshan and Xu Yinrong about the script when his phone rang. Thinking that the photo was delivered at this moment, he broke into a smile. Under the cover of the script, he took out the phone, glanced at the message from an unknown number and quickly browsed the content. His eyes ran down a folder near Xu Yinrong\u2019s hand, and then he started typing.Di Qiuhe: Wanna know why I thank you?He Bai: Yes.Di Qiuhe: Dying to know?He Bai: ...Yeah.Di Qiuhe: Me too.He Bai: ?Di Qiuhe: Dying to have you beg me.He Bai: ...Di Qiuhe: You looked so cute when you trotted down the street.Bang!He Bai tucked his phone into the drawer with indignation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: Sissy That WalkThere were two sets of photos in the box. One was signed under the name of Di Qiuhe, and the other Childish Di.With a frown, He Bai collected the photos signed with the name Di Qiuhe in a rage. After that, he bought a new box for those photos and also put in the ones he had once edited. Then, after he had the photos delivered, he sent the buyer a WeChat message, thanking him for the birthday message.Rather than receiving an immediate response, as was the case last time, he waited for two minutes before putting down his phone. Then, he picked up his phone and put it into his drawer.After all was done, he finally felt a little bit refreshed. Moreover, having only a few lessons in the afternoon allowed him to review them in advance. With that done, he then turned on his computer to download the new tasks from Saint Elephant Studio.This time the Saint Elephant didn't sent him as many photos as before. There were only five sets, each containing six photos, and he was expected to finish them in a week.All the photos were portraits. Out of five people in those photos, three of them being males and two females, there were two that looked familiar to He Bai. After a while of painstaking memory-searching, he remembered that those two were the up-and-coming hosts of the local TV station of B city. However, right now they were just a couple of new hosts of the TV station.He then picked out six photos, all featuring one particular person. He zoomed in on that person with the help of Photoshop, and all the while his mind started to wander off.It's no wonder that Li Ru would promise him such a high commission. It turned out that the Saint Elephant was cooperating with the TV station of B city. As far as he knew, though the local TV station was not as prestigious as the Central Station, it was nonetheless high on the ranking list with good resources and political support. The most important was that the local TV station would recommend excellent hosts to the Central Station from time to time, so it was usually the preferred choice for most new hosts.He remembered that Liu Huanhuan, LaoSan's ex-girlfriend, was also signed by the TV station after pulling a lot of strings\u2026 But Liu Huanhuan didn't last long there and resigned early. After being off the radar for a few years, she married a divorced rich man with a record of domestic violence. In her most desperate times, she once went back for LaoSan, which almost caused his wife to break up with him.Thinking about the old-time gossips didn't slow down what he was doing. He skillfully removed some obvious flaws on the photos and readjusted their overall tones. He also zoomed in on the people for more detailed editing and then edited them again so that the people in those photos wouldn't look out of place with the backgrounds. After all was done, he clicked save and have them exported. Whenever he had an inspiration, he would also make an extra version that was more to his aesthetic taste.It took him three days to finish all the tasks. Then he sent those edited photos to Li Ru to look over so as to make sure that they were approved before e-mailing them to the company. With all done, he then asked Li Ru for next week's tasks.Li Ru was satisfied with the high-quality photos as well as the speed with which he carried out the task and was rather impressed by that extra version of the photos he made. She encouraged him to edit more and be more creative in his future works. Meanwhile, she ordered three weeks' worth of works to be assigned to him all at once and generously offered to help him with this month's bonus.He Bai listened to the commendation carefully, and then, in his moment of joy, blacklisted Di Qiuhe who kept texting him while he was editing!At the weekend, Di Qiuhe came to Red Guest again, looking through the script with an absent-minded face.\"Here, your gift from that 'male fan'\". Jiang Xiuwen put down the coffee and the box, and sat opposite to him with a look that clearly read \"I want to kick you out\". Impatiently shaking his legs, he asked, \"What have you been doing these days? I've been calling you to take the box. You didn't show up. Nor did you discuss the script with my dad. Are you going to let this rare opportunity pass you by and bail on my father?\"Di Qiuhe ignored him and still looked down at the box on the table.'Well. What does that mean? Last time, he was so excited when he received a gift from the fan. Are they fighting?'Intrigued by his reaction, Jiang Xiuwen stopped shaking his legs and tilted his head to steal a few peeks at him. Finally, he leaned over, asking \"What's up? Is there a problem with this gift?\"Di Qiuhe still stared at the box in silence with a poker face.The sight of his silence gave Jiang Xiuwen the creeps and he boldly reached out to the box, thinking, \"Is there something dangerous in it? But it doesn't make any sense. This box has been here for two or three days and nothing happened\u2026.\"\"Don't touch it.\" Di Qiuhe grabbed back the box.Jiang Xiuwen stopped, sweeping a look at the way he grabbed the box into his arms. Then he felt relieved, sitting up straight before immediately falling back into the sofa in a rage. With a slow tone, he said, \"Tell me. What the hell is wrong with you?\"The box was very light, but Di Qiuhe felt it's a little heavy in his hands. Then he replied with a bitter tone, \"I was blacklisted online.\" For the first time, he was blacklisted online.\"By whom?\" asked Jiang Xiuwen with a gloating voice and with a touch of new-found admiration on his face for the one that held accountable.Di Qiuhe looked up suddenly and fixed his gaze on him with razor-sharp eyes.Jiang Xiuwen avoided his eyes, coughing in a low voice to conceal the gloat in his tone. With a frown, he said \"That's too much. How dare he! That's really... That's really too much!\"There was no worse performance than this.Curling up his lip, Di Qiuhe put the box into his backpack and then raised his hand to support his face. He tilted his head to look outside the window and said with an uncaring voice, \"It's nothing. Being blacklisted is only temporary. Young men can be touchy sometimes. I get it.\"It was all Jiang Xiuwen could do not to whistle. 'Well, well, well. Look at the gritting teeth and twisted face and all the big words he was talking about. It's so obvious that he is pissed like hell right now. Kudos to the man who blacklisted him!'The phone beeped suddenly, and immediately Di Qiuhe sat up straight to take out the phone from his pocket.White and Whiter: Haven't got a reply from you recently. Are you ok? Have you received the photos? P.S.: I've edited a few more photos of Di Qiuhe. Are you in Red Guest? I am on the way to XX Street. If you are keen, I can deliver them to you. ^-^Di Qiuhe frowned.'What's so funny? Since when you did you become so obliging and start providing home delivery service? Just a buyer. Why are you so eager? Why do you blacklist me, while being so generous to a WeChat friend whom you've never met? Do you need a spanking? Man, do you know how I felt when I was told that the number does not exist? Elder Xu could get through it the last minute!'Looking at his furious face, Jiang Xiuwen took out his phone anxiously and carefully asked, \"Qiu.. Qiuhe, have you been under any stress recently? Schizophrenia, brain disease?\"Di Qiuhe was still staring at the phone.White and Whiter: Hello? Are you online?White and Whiter: ? ? ?White and Whiter: @A Bird Born in Autumn?White and Whiter: Qiuqiu (Qiu means autumn in Chinese)? Hello?Di Qiuhe's heart skipped a beat all of a sudden with the furious look disappearing quickly off his face. Curling up his lips, he looked up at Jiang Xiuwen and stopped smiling. \"Call me.\" said he with eager eyes.Jiang Xiuwen swallowed while pressing his finger on \"1\", asking \"Call you? Di, Di Qiuhe?\"Di Qiuhe shook his head. \"No, call me by my nickname.\"With finger on \"2\", \"Qiuhe?\"Di Qiuhe stared at him, \"Is that my nickname?\"Jiang Xiuwen took a breath in desperation and moved his finger to \"0\". (TN: 120 is the emergency number in China) When he was pressing on the button, he said, \"Qiuqiu, I think you need a doctor.\"\"No.\" Di Qiuhe suddenly raised his voice and shook his head. \"No, not this tone.\" 'Little puppy would never call him in such an obedient tone!'Thinking of that, he couldn't help but stride away after shoving the script into his backpack.Jiang Xiuwen froze and pressed on another button, which triggered a beeping, warning him that it was an empty number. He got up to pull back Di Qiuhe, saying patiently \"Don't leave. I think you've been under too much pressure recently, so you need a rest\u2026.\"White and Whiter: It seems that you're offline. Well, it just so happens that I've got something up right now, so I couldn't deliver them to you today. Rain check? ^-^After hearing the beep, Di Qiuhe grabbed his phone and took a quick look at the message. Then he suddenly halted, turning around and striding back to the window.At the gate of the Saint Elephant across the street, He Bai put the phone into his pocket. He looked at the short guy wearing glasses who poked his head out of a van from the shotgun seat. He searched hard in his memory for his name, and then he put on a friendly smile and said, \"Brother Ma, did Li send me to go out with you?\"\"Yeah\", said Ma Qun with a sincere smile. He promptly got off the van and opened the back door for him. Wiping off the sweat on his forehead that he had when moving the equipment, he said \"The TV station decided at the last minute to take a set of anniversary photos for the newly signed intern hosts. But some of the field crew members were assigned to cover a group wedding, and there are simply not enough men for this ad hoc task. So Li sent in the editing crew. Li said you are good at taking high-quality photos. If you like, you can come with me. You'll get paid for overtime work plus the allowance for commute and food. It's not mandatory. Would you like to come? The location is near the Li Hu Park. It's not far and the view is great. I highly suggest that you come with us if you are free. \"\"Right, you are so young. Spending some time in the field will do you good.\" Another member of the editing crew poked his head out of the van. After greeting He Bai, he continued, \"Besides, this time Mr. Ma will lead the team. He is Ma Qun's uncle and the best photographer in Saint Elephant. I always see you carrying a camera, so I guess you must like photography. If you go, you might learn a thing or two from him.\"When they finished talking, He Bai nodded. He thought about how Li Ru had been caring for him all the time, and he smiled. \"How can I pass up such a good opportunity? Thank you for giving me this opportunity.\"\"We are all colleagues here. No need to thank us.\" Ma Qun helped him close the door before going back to his seat and fastening his own seat belt. While signaling the driver to drive ahead, he said, \"As long as you work hard, there will be plenty of such opportunities.\"Upon hearing his words, He Bai broke out an uneasy smile and touched the camera strap in his hand.Ma Qun seemed welcoming and friendly, but the way he looked at He Bai told a different story... This was a little bit interesting.Di Qiuhe watched He Bai getting on the van and leaving. He tried to hold back his feelings but he failed, curling up his lips with a sneer.Jiang Xiuwen who was standing far away from him, cautiously asked, \"Qiuhe, the hospital is very close. Shall we, shall we go there?\"Di Qiuhe looked back at him and took a step back to the sofa. He put down his backpack to take out the script. Lowering his head, he's completely absorbed into the script. The elegant posture, and the gentle temperament evident in the way he flipped through the script were in stark contrast to the furious look on the guy standing on the road just now.Jiang Xiuwen: \"... I see... It's schizophrenia.Our purpose is to provide the public with original translated novels. However, as we have found, illicit use of exclusive works is quite common.

For this time, B city TV station choosed to shoot commemorative photos for the new hosts here for two reasons: one for it was set in a quiet and beautiful environment here; and the other for it was\u2026.cheap to book here.\u201cThe TV station has booked the west side of the lake for two days and set up isolation belt. Some colleagues have already been there for setting the scene.\u201d Lin Rui, another member of photo retouching group moved the equipment outside while explaining. Seeing that He Bai lifted the heaviest box directly, he could not help raising his hand and patting He Bai\u2019s shoulder, and said: \u201cDon\u2019t force yourself. If it is too heavy to move for one time, make it two times. I will accompany you. You can still grow a little taller at your age. You need to pay more attention for this. Don\u2019t press on your bones.\u201dThe hand that patted on the shoulder was very gentle, it was an considerate gesture in a polite manner. He Bai took a look at slightly thin body of Lin Rui and the heavy equipment in his arms, and then looked at Ma Qun who was taking light props cloth in his hand in the front of cars. He Bai\u2019s dimples on his face changed from shallow to deep quickly. He reached out to help Lin Rui to lift the equipment and said: \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I can lift it. I just had my 21st birthday. My height might not grow anymore. But look at your glowing face, any good news at home?\u201dLin Rui couldn\u2019t help but show a smile on his face after he heard the question of He Bai, and replied: \u201cNot a big deal, but just my wife finally gives birth to a girl for me after so many years.\u201d\u201cGirl is good, she will be close to you. Congratulations to you and your wife.\u201d He Bai looked at the face of Lin Rui with very infectious expression of happiness, he wanted to take photos of Lin Rui, but due to the box in his hand, he couldn\u2019t reach take the camera, so he whispered \u2018what a pity\u2019 in his heart.Lin Rui and He Bai chatted while walking towards the photography destination. Having a topic, their relationship became close quickly. They quickened their steps unconsciously and left other people behind far away.After looking at Lin Rui and He Bai, the driver who walked beside Ma Qun smiled and shook his head, pokinges Ma Qun, \u201cMr. Lin must be talking about his daughter again. That guy will definitely dote on his daughter in future. He Bai has good temper so that he has the patience to listen to those long-winded parenting talks.\u201dMa Qun staggered a little after being poked by him. The expression of Ma Qun was not good, but he concealed it quickly, and said with smile, \u201cHe Bai is a good person, but not sure how long he can work in Saint Elephant. After all, he is just a sophomore student, not mature or perseverant.\u201d\u201cWhy he is not mature and perseverant? I think he is good. Moreover, he will be a junior student next semester and he will graduate soon. I feel that Ms. Li also wants to keep him in Saint Elephant. Ms. Li asked us to persuade him to come this time. She wants to know his photography skills. It looks like the top management is ready to train him into a photographer.\u201d The driver gossiped what he heard from others with a sigh, \u201cit is good to be a photographer, earning more with good development prospects awaiting. He Bai has good ability and is driven to learn. He will certainly have a bright future. It is true that as in the Yangtze River waves urge waves, so the younger generation excels the old generation.\u201dA listener might perceive an unintended meaning in what was said. Ma Qun frowned and there emerged a sullen look in his eyes.\u2018As in the Yangtze River back waves urge front waves, so the younger generation excels the old generation.\u2019 At present, his uncle was the best photographer in Saint Elephant. The meaning of the driver was that his uncle was like the front wave that will be beaten on the sand beach by the newcomer? And uncle had promised to train him to a photographer. He felt grieved that He Bai emerged suddenly and was taken seriously by Li Ru and robbed resources that were supposed to be his.The shoot scene had already set up by the lakeside. The colleagues who came here first rushed over to them and took over the equipment after seeing them, and guided them for other works.After busy work for half an hour, the scene setting was completed. The car of the TV station was coming by and a group of young people got off the car.\u201cMakeup team and costume team, please get ready. Where is leader Ma? Somebody go to the car and ask leader Ma to come here.\u201d A management staff shouted with a loud voice.Ma Qun came out from the crowd and took the job of asking leader Ma to come.With that being done, there was nothing that He Bai could help with. He retreated to the periphery of the crowd and watches the working staffs lead the young people into the temporary makeup shed. He found and talked to the driver, and then he took the camera and walked around the lake, not far from the shooting place.The sunshine was just pleasant, and the water ripples were floating on the lake gently. Suddenly, a white dove entered the camera. It bypassed the weeping willow, flied over the gallery of the lakeside, and landed on the top of the pavilion in the center of the lake. After grooming its feathers with its peak, it flapped and filed into the woods not far away.He Bai pressed the shutter button gently. He smiled and checked some lake scenes that he just took. Seeing the shooting began, he walkeds back quickly.On the white swing chair, a beautiful girl leaned obliquely, holding a book in her hand. She raised her head and closed eyes. It seemed that she was feeling the warm sunshine caresses her face.\u201cGood, good state, hold on, relax your shoulders and smile a little sweeter.\u201dA middle-aged fat man who was wearing cotton and linen tribal clothing was holding the camera around the girl to shoot. He guided the staffs beside to adjust the lighting board from time to time.He Bai looked at all these things with a novel perspective. His eyes focused on the middle-aged fat man who was filming, and finally fell on the girl. A breeze blowing by lucky coincidence, it swayed the skirt of the girl. He was touched and held his camera to capture the scene that the girl bowed her head and fondled her skirt.\u201cThe wind is blowing. Everyone, please pay more attention.\u201d The photographer put down the camera, guided the people of costume team to adjust the clothes and hair of the girl. He frowned slightly, \u201cthere is just a few hours of good natural lighting, everyone, please hurry up.\u201dThe crowd responded and sped up their action.\u201cHe is Ma Xingtong, the team leader and Ma Qun\u2019s uncle. He has been invited to shoot covers of four major fashion magazines, top player in the game.\u201d Lin Rui explained to He Bai in a low voice. He Bai did not know since when Lin Rui was standing behind him. After seeing Ma Qun gave a bottle of water to Ma Xingtong during the shooting, Lin Rui paused and talked in an even lower voice, \u201cHe, Ma Xingtong does not have children, so he loves his nephew, Ma Qun. He intends to cultivate Ma Qun as his successor. Ms. Li is satisfied with you. Although Ms. Li and leader Ma are old friends with good relationship, anyway, you shall pay more attention.\u201dHe Bai tried to digest these words. Finally, he understood where the strange attitude of Ma Qun came from and he appreciated Lin Rui in his heart for the explanation. However, there were many people around at this time. He couldn\u2019t say much about it, so he nodded to show understanding, indicating that he would pay more attention.Both of them reached tacit understanding, neither did they talk anymore, nor moved forward. They just stood on the outside and watched people inside busy working; and then went to help to move the equipment at appropriate time when the scene changed.When inspiration came occasionally, He Bai would also hold his camera to capture and shoot the young hosts, quietly done, he tried to be unnoticed.At lunchtime, the food truck ordered by the TV station arrived on time. People gathered together to have lunch. He Bai still did not go to crowd center. He squatted outside and talked to Lin Rui about parenting and experience of retouching. Ma Qun, who took him here and talked fair-sounding, now seemed to have suddenly forgotten him. He only followed Ma Xingtong around, leaving the two in the corner.Everyone continued their work after lunch. Four hours later, the shooting finally came to an end.\u201cTake a break first, everyone. Then, put your things away and we will continue tomorrow.\u201d Ma Xingtong put the camera away, and wiped his sweat on his forehead. He made command after looking at the weather.Ma Qun came up and offered a bottle of water considerately.\u201cYou have good performance today.\u201d Ma Xingtong took the water and praised Ma Qun. He smiled and said, \u201cWe do not have a tight shooting schedule tomorrow. I looked at your photos which you handed to me last time. They are good. I can let you try tomorrow.\u201dMa Qun\u2019s eyes sparkled after he heard this, nodding in a hurry and promised that he would do a good job.Seeing them act like this, all the people know that Ma Xingtong was paving the way for Ma Qun. Thus, they made compliment and encouraged directly or with implication.Lin Rui was still standing in the periphery. He frowned and said with doubt, \u201cit is not right. Ms. Li said if the shooting progress is fast, you can follow and have a try. Why is it Ma Qun now? Didn\u2019t Ms. Li talk to leader Ma in advance?\u201d\u201cPerhaps so,\u201d He Bai pressed his shoulder and patted to appease him, he meant to stop Lin from going forward to confront Ma Xingtong, and said, \u201cNot a big deal. He might forget. It is also good that we can take rest. The work of shooting is so tired, with big pressure. It is not as comfortable as chatting with you about parenting.\u201dLin Rui pushed He Bai\u2019s head resignedly, and shook his head, \u201chey boy, as a man, how can you always hide for rest. If it is your opportunity, you shall seize it. Do not let those dirty men take advantage of the loophole.\u201dThis was a little straightforward. He Bai smiled, showing dimple on his left face, and said carelessly, \u201cThanks for your instruction. However, not everyone cherish this kind of opportunity. For me, although I want to be a photographer, my main task is to study now. I come to Saint Elephant for earning tuition and living expenses, not for other purpose.\u201d Furthermore, that uncle and nephew were clearly in a league. They had tacit understanding to ignore him. He, as an outsider, did not want to ask for troubles.It meant that he was not going to stay in Saint Elephant for long. He planned to leave after he earned enough money, and did not care about the opportunity that was snatched away from him. Lin Rui looked at He, so young and childish, Lin was speechless for a moment. Then, he shook his head and smiled, \u201cYou are right. Students do have to focus on study. As for the ostensible obedience of Ma Qun today, leave it to Ms. Li after she comes back from business trip.\u201dThere was another car of TV station coming when people were ready to pack things up and go back home. Two girls got off the car in a hurry, followed by a person in charge.\u201cSorry, sorry, we are late. Please do us a favor and help to take photos for them.\u201d The person in charge said that while taking the girls towards Ma Xingtong. His forehead is beamed with sweat due to the heat and he explained hastily, \u201cMr. Ma, these two girls need to go out of town tomorrow to shoot a program. Their photos must be taken today. Sorry for making you work again, I will buy you dinner tonight.\u201dA trace of displeasure flashed in the eyes of Ma Xingtong. His eyes fell on his nephew for a moment and an idea came up. He replied diplomatically, \u201cYou are welcome. It is no problem to continue shooting, but the sun is going down. There is not enough time if we shoot them one after another. We need to shoot them at the same time. \u201d The person in charge nodded quickly, \u201cIt\u2019s ok, we follow your instruction.\u201d\u201cDo not worry. I have a situation here.\u201d Ma Xingtong handed him a bottle of water and continued, \u201cBecause it is the work out of the plan, so we did not make preparation. I am the only experienced photographer here. Besides me, there is only a new comer who can take photos. But I can ensure that the new comer is skillful, but just lack of experience. Thus, for these two girls, who follows me for shooting, and who follows the new comer?\u201dAll people present remain silent after they hear this.The people of Saint Elephant remained silent because they knew Ma Xingtong was really the only photographer who could take photos today, while the new comer who could take photos as mentioned by Ma Xingtong shall refer to Ma Qun. However, the photographic skill of Ma Qun was\u2026\u2026doubtful \u2026The employees of TV station who came here to help remained silent because for these two girls, one girl had close relationship with the old host, Haoge in the station; the other had background reputedly, however, they did not know who it was behind that girl. Anyway, neither of them could be offended. Thus, it was a big problem to decide.He Bai also remained silent because one of these two girls was Liu Huanhuan, who betrayed Niu Junjie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The time waits for no man.\" Ma Xingtong urged the person in charge for decision and despised in his heart for the hesitation of the person in charge at this time. 'Just two new girls, why bother to take photos seriously. Why he hesitates so much? Doesn't the person in charge believe his word?'The person in charge frowned after he heard this. After a moment's thought, he turned to two girls behind him, and asked, \"Who wants to follow Mr. Ma and who wants to follow the new photographer?\"In this way, the option was transferred to the two girls who were going to take photos. The public sight moved to the two girls.The two girls looked at each other. One girl with ponytail moved and was just about to talk, the other girl with her hair down stepped forward and said softly, \"let me shoot with Mr. Ma, Xiaofu is prettier than me. She looks beautiful in every way.\" Then, she smiled at the girl with ponytail, looked at the person in charge with her bright eyes, and fingerings the lanyard around her neck slowly.That was the pass card of project team which the host, Du Hao applied for her specially. For the group of new comers who joined the TV station with her at the same time, only she had this pass card.A young host from other channel who had finished shooting and was ready to go back could not help but sneer after seeing her like this. Then, the young host was pulled back by her partner quickly.The person in charge frowned more tightly, instead of answering her, he looked at the girl with ponytail and asked gently, \"How about you? If you two cannot come to an agreement, I can let you draw lots.\"The girl with her hair down stopped fiddling with her pass card, and became unhappy.\"It's ok. I will follow the new comer for shooting. Huanhuan is the main person for next program. Her souvenir picture will be on desk calendar of the TV station. It is important. Furthermore, I believe the capability of Saint Elephant's photographer. The person that is recommended by Mr. Ma must be good.\" The girl with ponytail replied with smile. She took over the embarrassing situation at this time actively by a word and also secretly praised the people of Saint Elephant who were forced to work overtime.After hearing this, He Bai smiled with his mouth slightly curled up, and admiration could be seen in his eyes. 'This little girl has high EQ. Compared with her, Liu Huanhuan's edgy and utilitarian performance is unlikable.'Obviously, people had the same idea with him. At this time, they looked at Liu Huanhuan with strange light.\"Then, Liu Huanhuan shall follow Mr. Ma for shooting, and Xiaofu shall follow the new photographer.\" The person in charge made a decision and looked at the girl with ponytail gently. He ignored Liu Huanhuan and talked to Ma Xingtong, \"Mr. Ma, who is the new photographer that you are talking just now? I want to communicate with him first. Xiaofu hosts a children's program. There are a few matters require special attention to when taking photos.\"Ma Xingtong intended to show off his nephew in front of people. After hearing this, he chimed in with the person in charge for the attention of children's program, looked back at Ma Qun, and waved to Ma Qun to come forward and said hello to the person in charge.While at this moment, the people of Saint Elephant thought that Ma Qun was so lucky for having this opportunity. However, Ma Qun was flustered and was eager to disappear on the spot. Having a try was not the same as shooting the photo independently. Ma Xingtong said he would let Ma Qun have a try. That meant to let Ma Qun follow Ma Xingtong to take photos. The photos which would be finally submitted shall be under the name of Ma Xingtong. If Ma Qun did a good job, one or two of his photos would be selected and submitted. It belonged to on-the-spot teaching. However, for the current circumstance, he planned to directly use Ma Qun's photos which he shot independently. No matter the photos were good or not, there was no time to shoot again. Furthermore, the photos shot this time would be finally printed on the autograph albums of the TV station. If Ma Qun failed, it definitely would be his dark past after he developed successfully in future.The most important thing was that, in order to let his uncle lead him as a photographer as soon as possible, the photos which he submitted to his uncle for the first two times were from someone else. In fact, his photographic skill was\u2026..\"Qun, come here.\" Ma Xingtong looked at him with smile, with great confidence in him.Ma Qun felte more and more flustered. He glanced at He Bai who was standing under the slope of periphery and watching, stepped forward and talked with a loud voice without deep consideration, \"Uncle, are you looking for He Bai? I saw him here just now. Please wait a moment. I will bring him here soon.\" Then he pretended to look around and waved at He Bai passionately, \"He, come here. It's your turn for shooting. Come on, don't disappoint Ms. Li's trust.\"The people of Saint Elephant were all bewildered.Lin Rui's eyes widened in surprise, \"What happened? Is Ma Qun insane?\"He Bai was also confused. He brought his camera bag and hesitated to take a step, slightly frowned, \"I don't know\u2026\u2026Did I misunderstand Ma Qun? In fact, he wanted to give me opportunity more than anyone else?\"Lin Rui shook his head, puzzled.\"Hurry up, hurry up, we are working against the clock.\" Ma Qun ran over actively, pulled He Bai out and brought him in front of the person in charge without giving He Bai the opportunity to refuse, and made introduction affably, \"he is the excellent new comer that my uncle was talking about, top student from Q University, the talent that our director is training personally. You can communicate with him for any requirement.\"As things developed, He Bai had to adjust his mood and waved at the person in charge, talked politely, \"Hello, I'm He Bai, I will try my best to take photos that satisfy your TV station.\"The person in charge did not feel at ease when he saw the young face of He Bai. After he knew that He Bai was the top student of Q University and talent that the director was training personally, the person in charge settled down his heart suddenly, shakinghands with He Bai and said, \"Hello, thanks for your hard work. Let me explain to you what you need to pay attention to during shooting. Xiaofu, come here. Let's communicate with Mr. He together.\"Yang Fu answered liquidly, getting close to them, and joined them to a quiet corner to communicate.As soon as they left, there were only Liu Huanhuan who was shocked after seeing He Bai; Ma Qun who breathed a sigh of relief and nervously he looked at Ma Xingtong who was confused and unhappy;; and the whole crowd who didn't know what was going on either.\"Makeup team and costume team, come here and bring this Miss Liu Huanhuan to make up and change clothes.\" Ma Xingtong was the first to return to reality and made command with a calm face.All the people returned to reality and spread out for busy work with different expressions in their eyes.The crowd dispersed in a moment. Ma Xingtong took a glance at Ma Qun and made a sign to him to talk alone.Ma Qun followed Ma Xingtong guiltily.\"What's wrong with you? Don't you know how rare this opportunity is? Although that girl is just a new comer, the souvenir picture of TV station is not like others, a lot of people will see it. It is a good start. You\u2026\u2026\" As the conversation went on, Ma Xingtong was getting angry, almost could not suppress the fidgety mood in his heart.\"Uncle, I am sorry.\" Ma Qun apologized at once. Then, he looked up with an aggrieved smile, sadly, \"but Ms. Li is satisfied with He Bai\u2026\u2026she specially gave me the task of leading He Bai before her business trip. If I don't do well in this, it will be bad for you too. Uncle, it is my fault. I should not accept Ms. Li's advice arbitrarily\u2026\u2026\"The expression on the face of Ma Xingtong changed. Finally, he eyes were getting sullen and snorted, \"I see. Li Ru asked you to take care of He Bai on purpose. She is afraid that I will promote you with selfish motives. Hum, just a young guy of sophomore. He takes this opportunity without effort. I want to see how he is going to end up. Qun, do not be foolish anymore in future. In this world, honest people are destined to be bullied.\"Ma Qun answered meekly and couldn't help hating He Bai in his heart.What a good opportunity. Why did he give the opportunity to He Bai without deep consideration at that time? 'I hope He Bai to screw up.'The uncle and nephew of Ma family were immersed in working field conspiracy theory, while He Bai had obtained the good impression from the person in charge quickly.\"You do live up to your reputation. You understand quickly by little instruction. I expect to see your photos.\"He Bai smiled ashamedly, \"Thanks to your detailed explanation. Please rest assured. Miss Yang Fu has good appearance. Her photos must be beautiful.\"Yang Fu also smiled, and said gently, \"Mr. He, you are so modest.\"The three people praised each other and the atmosphere became harmonious. Then they went to get makeup done. After settling down Yang Fu, the person in charge left with a smile on his face. He Bai found the makeup artist and communicated what kind of vibe he was looking for. Then, he retreated to one side and started to get his camera prepared. He was thinking about how to shoot good photos in the scene made by the Saint Elephant.This was his first time to shoot commercial portrait, so he was somewhat nervous that he might not be able to do a good job for such important commemorative photos. However, since the opportunity had dropped into his bowl, of course, he would try his best and strive to deliver satisfying photos for the customer.\"He Bai?\"A unfamiliar female voice rised close to He Bai. He Bai stopped his action of adjusting the camera and turned his head.\"Really it is you.\" Liu Huanhuan just changed her clothes and was about to get her makeup done. She smiled at He Bai, raises her hand to groom her messy hair, said shyly, \"What a surprise meeting you here. When did you join Saint Elephant? You have become a photographer. You are amazing.\"He Bai also smiled and asked politely, \"Excuse me, who are you?\"The smile on the face of Liu Huanhuan stiffened. Then, she covered her mouth by hand and said in surprise, \"Don't you know me? I am a friend of Junjie, Liu Huanhuan from Broadcasting Department. We met on the birthday party of Junjie last year.\"Yes, they met before. However, Liu Huanhuan, as the \"ordinary friend\" of Niu Junjie at that time looked down upon poor He Bai. She even did not look at He Bai in the eye, let alone had a conversation. Thus, they were strangers.He Bai remembered that meeting, and also recalled Niu Junjie who cried and vomited after getting drunk. The smile on his face became more polite and he shook his head, \"Sorry, Junjie is a good person. He has many friends. I may not know all of them. The dresser is shouting, Miss Liu, please hurry up.\"Liu Huanhuan felt embarrassed because she took the initiative to talk but was driven away by He Bai. Thinking of Yang Fu who was sitting behind her for makeup, and she must had heard this conversation, Liu Huanhuan felt more embarrassed in her heart. Thus, she put away her smile and said coldly, \"The friends of Junjie are also divided into different levels. It is normal that you don't know me. Xiaofu is my good friend. I hope Mr. He do not screw up her souvenir picture.\" Then she turned and walked away. Her back so erect, like a proud peacock in victory.He Bai was amused by her reaction, he couldn't help taking out his mobile phone and sending WeChat message to Junjie.He Bai: Encountered your ex-girlfriend, had a hard time. You were so blind in the past.Di Qiuhe was reading the script when he heard the tone of WeChat. He stopped and picked up his phone in a very casual manner. He tapped open the WeChat and glanced at the message. Then he glared slightly and typed quickly.A bird born in autumn: My ex-girlfriend? Who?He had been single for 23 years. No ex-girlfriend. He Bai, the puppy, stigmatized his innocence.He Bai: Liu Huanhuan, how should you forget her so quickly?\"Liu Huanhuan? Why this name seems a little familiar to me?\" Di Qiuhe frowned and talked unconsciously.Jiang Xiuwen who was sitting opposite him and reading reports raised his head after hearing this, confused, \"Liu Huanhuan? Isn't the name of a host who was in hot pursuit of you in the past? Why you mention her again?\"After being reminded by him, Di Qiuhe finally remembered who Liu Huanhuan was. His face became gloomy suddenly. He looked at the message of He Bai again with his face sulky and eyes blurred.Why the puppy knew Liu Huanhuan and sent message to this WeChat account? Did he find that this was his secondary account? So the reply of cute girl with big cock\u2026\u2026He was so terrified that he threw his phone immediately and raised his hands to cover his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: Sissy That WalkThere occurred a muffled noise when his cell phone hit the fruits basket on the teapoy. Glancing at the guy who threw a fit, Jiang Xiuwen had no alternative but to bend over to pick his phone up, asking, \"What's the matter? Is the z-list host pestering you again?\"Di Qiuhe got into a sheer panic, his mind stuffed with He Bai's derision. Not in the mood for Jiang's words, he covered his head with his hands and seemed on the verge of a breakdown.'Dumbass in the flesh.'Jiang Xiuwen heaved a sigh, ready to inquire what happened to He Bai when his mobile phone vibrated all of the sudden. The screen turned bright immediately, and another new message came.White and Whiter: Are you feeling sad now? Cheep up, Bro Three! Liu Huanhuan and you are definitely ill-matched in terms of deposition. You deserve better.The text not only puzzled Jiang Xiuwen but also took him by surprise, \"Isn't this man the one who you asked me the other day to send a WeChat message in your name in reply. I remember you specially urged me to add a smiling emoji at the end of the text. But why does he call you Bro Three? Who he really is? The 'male fan' of yours?\"\"He called me Bro Three?\" Di Qiuhe raised his head, bucked up in a flash, grabbed his phone from Jiang Xiuwen and looked at the message again and again. His expression kept changing and finally put on an air of anger. With his lower jaw slightly lifted, he started typing hard.A Bird Born in Autumn: I am not Bro Three! I have no ex-girlfriend! You wronged me and scared me!After sending the text, he found the tone of his message appeared quite strange, not in line with the manner of speaking of an adorable girl, thus hurrying some remedy.A Bird Born in Autumn: What a lovely single girl I am ^-^A Bird Born in Autumn: Thank you for the photo. I like it very much.After some hesitation, he cast a glance at Jiang Xiuwen, leaned to one side and covered the phone screen with his hand, typing quickly.A Bird Born in Autumn: Blow you a kiss.Seeing He Bai send message in a furtive manner, Jiang Xiuwen was completely dumbfounded. A myriad of feelings welled up within him... He must have been so possessed by devil that he had made friends with such a neurotic!Noticing the reply from Bro Three, He Bai's mind went blank for a while. He cast an eye on the top of the chatting box, only to find that he had sent messages to a buyer's WeChat account which used similar profile pic with that of Bro Three -- a careless mistake. Both images were brown toned, quite similar at the first sight. Besides, his mobile phone was cheap and nasty, making it hard to tell the pics apart with its low-quality screen and disappointing color rendering performance. Therefore, he mistook the buyer for Di Qiuhe due to carelessness.What a bad thing he had done to gossip about another person when her back was turned! ... He was slightly embarrassed and then moved by the considerateness the buyer displayed. It was very considerate of 'her' to help him resolve the awkward situation with a teasing yet lovely reply.What a kind and sweet girl she was! Plus, the habit of spreading one's gossip behind his back must be kicked in that it's proved immoral. Thinking in this way, he hurriedly replied the message to apologize.White and Whiter: Sorry, I had mixed your account up with that of another person.White and Whiter: Thank you for reminding me. Kiss back.After he sent the message, his dresser came along to discuss something with him. Stowing his cell phone away, He Bai followed her to the car to choose the clothes Yang Fu were to wear in a while.Considering Yang Fu is the hostess of Children's Channel, he selected a few articles of clothing in the style of teenage girls to be picked out after scanning each piece hanging in the clothing car. Due to this, the dresser even teased him a little. She told him photographers hardly ever picked out clothes for models in person and asked him whether he had a crush on the beautiful girl.Faced with the bantering out of goodwill, he tended to palm them off with a 'shy' smile, and this time was no exception.The dresser was a middle-aged woman, and her children were almost the same age as He Bai. On seeing his adorable smile, she couldn't bear to tease him again as expected and changed the topic. Very soon, she was hoaxed into uttering a lot of gossips about Saint Elephant staff in answer to several seemingly random questions of He Bai.Get the costume and makeup settled at high speed, He Bai said goodbye to the make-up artist, and led Yang Fu to a photographer's studio.\"I'm sorry, but Miss Liu selected here first, and the photography has begun. Please move to the spot over there.\" Ma Qun stopped them and pointed to another scene that had been torn apart in half, looking very apologetic.He Bai didn't utter a single word. Glancing at Liu Huanhuan in a sexy long gown who occupied the flowery gallery scattered with swings, and then at the other half-torn forest scene which looked rough and messy, he pondered for a while and sought Yang Fu's advice, \"Do you mind taking photos by the lake instead of inside these scenes?\"Yang Fu also cast a glance at Liu Huanhuan and smiled gently, nodding, \"Sure, It's up to you\".He Bai gave her a smile, and then looked back to Ma Qun, towards whom his attitude became much colder and less courteous than before, speaking bluntly, \"Where the hell are juicers? Assign me at least one.\" Portraits taking differed greatly from scenic photographing. Lightning played an important role in the former.Ma Qun looked a lot more apologetic. He indicated the frantically busy team directed by Ma Xingtong and said sheepishly, \"We are too busy to spare anyone to help you right now... Or you wait for a while?It was getting dark very soon. After a while, despite lightening, photos couldn't be taken.It was obvious that he deliberately made things difficult for them. He Bai frowned and looked around other staffers, only to find that they shunned his eye contact, which made him a little angry. It is understandable that people in the workplace fight and scheme against each other or seek advantages and avoid disadvantages, about which he didn't care. But now he was working for customers as well as for the company, they still made no clear distinction between public and private interests, which violated professional ethics a lot.\"I noticed several spare lamp panels were lying over there. I'll help you, He.\" Lin Rui came from the periphery. Without looking at Ma Qun, he went straight there and took a panel in hand.He Bai's expression turned slightly bright. He bypassed Ma Qun, gave Lin Rui a friendly nod, signaled the lakeside and said, \"Thank you a lot, bro. It is quite late now. Let's go to the lakeside.\"\"Count me in, too.\" A makeup artist came over with a makeup box in her hand, \"I can help touch up Miss Yang's make-up.\"Yang Fu smiled at her, \"Thank you a lot.\"\"You\u2026 You're welcome.\" The girl blushed at her words answering.While waiting for Liu Huanhuan to fix her make-up, Ma Xingtong checked the camera and asked, \"Only four people? Do they use the camera our company provided?\"\"No, they don't. He Bai used his own camera.\" Ma Qun handed a bottle of water over, hesitated for a while and said, \"Uncle, is it right to do this? After all, He Bai is backed by Mrs. Li, and Yang Fu works in the TV station. Will our behaviors offend Li and the whole TV station?\"\"It's all right.\" Ma Xingtong gave a careless wave of the hand, his voice a little cold, \"Li Ru gets complacent recently. A successful photography company relies more on photographers than directors. As for Yang Fu, she's nothing but a mere intern host, a newcomer of newcomers. The station won't fall out with Saint Elephant for such a newcomer.\"Ma Qun nodded his agreement and flattered Ma Xingtong all the more, \"You're really knowledgeable, uncle.\"\"There's a long way for you to learn from me.\" Ma Xingtong gave him a mild look and sighed, \"You are too simpleminded.\"As an hour and a half passed, the sun sunk, and the shooting finally came to an end for Liu Huanhuan.Liu Huanhuan lifted up the skirts and headed for where Ma Xingtong stood. Seeing a few of ready-made photos, she felt quite satisfied and flattered him in a few words. Afterwards, she pretended to ask in a casual way, \"How's Fu getting along? Haven't they finished? By the way, how long has it been since Mr. He entered Saint Elephant Company? Young he is, Mr. He has become a photographer. Really awesome!\"\"Not very long. He was only recruited to fill the gap on a part-time basis. There's a long way for him to go.\" Replied indifferently Ma Xingtong, who didn't care at all that what he said ran counter to the previous introduction of He Bai by his nephew. Stowing the camera away, he called a staffer over and asked, \"Where's He Bai? Tell him to hurry up. Everyone wants to wrap up early. Even if he couldn't take good photos, dawdling is not allowed. Given that he is a newcomer of low ability, the quality of his photos won't necessarily be improved even though he spends more time.\"The staffer looked embarrassed when he glanced at Liu Huanhuan, replying, \"Leader Ma, Mr. He and Miss Yang finished photographing and left half an hour ago... Miss Yang intended to wait for Miss Liu and leave together, but unfortunately the TV station called her and urged her to go back. So Mr. He sent her over immediately.\"Have they left?\" Ma Qun couldn't help but to interrupt.The staffer nodded, \"It's been a while.\"Anger crossed Ma Xingtong's face. He asked, \"Where are photos he has taken? Does he hand them in?\"\"Yes, he does. But it's only a backup. He took away the original copy and told us that he must hand them over to Director Li for a routine check after retouching the photos.\" The staff replied.Handing in the backup only and specially explaining that he would retouch the photos himself and then delivered them to Li Ru, it was beyond doubt He Bai guarded against him! Ma Xingtong was seething with anger but feigned magnanimity with scruples that Liu Huanhuan was still there and that he might be laughed at by an outsider, thus speaking, \"I got it. Do as he likes. Today he takes photos for the first time, so it's normal for him to become nervous and unconfident. Asking Director Li to check will help.\"Liu Huanhuan bowed the head and ruffled her hair, giving a contemptuous smile.It turned out that He Bai took photograph for the first time on a part-time basis. Humph! She originally considered He Bai a skilled photographer, who only turned out to be a nobody. Indeed, how come a poor wretch was able to pursue such a money-consuming hobby like photography? Yang Fu's photos must be messed up.Covering her mouth with one hand to feign yawning, Liu Huanhuan tried hard to restrain herself from smiling. She had complete confidence to substitute for Yang Fu now.Saying goodbye to He Bai and getting into the car her family sent to pick her up, Yang Fu was bubbling over with excitement. She took out the mobile phone, dialed her aunt's number and cried, \"Aunt, I met a very cute and skilled photographer today! Seen from the photograph he took of me, I'm just like a celestial fairy! I hear that you are worried recently about lacking in good clothing photographer. I recommend him to you! To be frank, he is really an excellent man, patient and considerate. Plus, he has a dimple which appears when he smiles. I would definitely court him if I had no fianc\u00e9!Thumbing through the product manuals her subordinates sent over, Zhu Ke replied smiling, \"Is he really as good as you said? Zehang will get jealous if he hears you praise another man to the skies. By the way, do you adapt to the working conditions at Station Five? Remember to tell me if you don't so that I could assign you to other posts. Anyway, your father is Station Head. Don't let such a good resource go to waste.\"\"I'm well adapted.\" Yang Fu reclined in the back seat of the car. Recalling Liu Huanhuan's nauseating actions, she muttered with her nose wrinkled, \"Everyone is nice, and hosting program with children is full of fun, but...\"Zhu Ke listened to her chatter patiently. Looking at the vacant column for clothing photographer on the product manual of a newly created teenager girl brand, she couldn't help heave a sigh.It's not all rainbows and butterflies for a company to develop at a quite fast pace. New talents proved hard to come by.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he asked Niu Junjie out for a late-night snack. \"Have you bumped into Liu Huanhuan?\" Niu Junjie stopped gnawing chicken wings and emerged grim-faced while asking it. He dropped his eyes and said evasively, \"Well, it doesn't matter. What you need to do is nothing but pretend unacquaintance.\"\"I wish I could, but she herself accosted me.\" He Bai bought him a bottle of orange juice, took the beer in front of him away and gave a brief account of what had happened today, persuading him, \"You hope to have no entanglement with her, while she should bear no grudge and try to strike up conversation with your friend. Today she came across me, and maybe tomorrow she would meet another friend of yours? Your dad has a wide range of business interests, and many of your friends are of great ability. Be on the alert for her, and you can't go wrong.\"In the previous incarnation, when Liu Huanhuan was reduced to dire straits, she came back to seek Niu Junjie's help. Good-hearted, Niu asked one of his friends to give her a hand. However, both he and his friend who had a fianc\u00e9e then were all entangled by Liu Huanhuan, which almost led to the martial breakdown of the two. Therefore, person like Liu Huanhuan was definitely a bomb that would explode at any time, and it's better to be far away from her.Niu Junjie frowned on hearing it, and then nodded after some thinking. Giving a self-deprecating smile, he replied, \"I get it, thank you for reminding me. As for Liu Huanhuan, I'll handle her myself. My mind wasn't in the right place before. Judging from her character, she wouldn't behave herself until she came to grief and learned a lesson. When she was in a relationship with me, she had two-timed me for many times\u2026 Well, let's drop it. How's your part-time job? Was she spoiling your work?\"No, she wasn't.\" He Bai narrowed his eyes, smiling, and continued the topic, \"I messed her scheme up instead, and her plot to spoil another girl's photographing had fallen through.\" Niu Junjie looked stunned and then burst out laughing, patting He Bai's shoulder hard, \"Good job, my bro! Help yourself and order whatever you'd like--my treat!\"The shooting took two days. Next day He Bai went to the park again and offered his help. This time he got no opportunity to take photographs himself but kept running errands all the while. Standing at the periphery of the crowd, he had been watching Ma Xingtong and his nephew put on an act by displaying their attachment to each other. Ma Xingtong taught Ma Qun something, and the latter flattered his uncle.Afterwards, he went straight back to campus and hurried a meal. Then he sorted out the pictures he snapped, sent them to Xu Yinrong's mailbox as his homework, and searched Yang Fu's photos out for final retouching. At eleven o'clock in the evening, the work was eventually done. Rubbing his eyes, He Bai sent the photographs to Li Ru's mailbox, climbed into the top of the bunk and reclined on the bed.As a new week began, the Department of Journalism entered the period of exam preparation. After rebirth, He Bai became poor at study, so he had no other choice but to make every effort to review his lessons, during which he was almost completely unplugged except answering the calls. Throughout the day he buried himself in the reference books to revise for his lessons like crazy.Di Qiuhe checked his WeChat message for countless times, but still received no reply from He Bai. Subsequently, his excitement and astonishment at the word \"blow you a kiss\" were all replaced by a feeling of anger.\"I'll be damned if I send MORNING to you again!\" Di Qiuhe stuffed his phone into the pants pocket with a scowl, took out his schedule under the script and circled a variety show. Since the previous contract was rescinded and the lead-up to his film had begun, it's time to make relevant information public and lay a trap for his step-mother.A busy week passed. On Saturday, He Bai, with deep shadows under his eyes, was summoned to Shengxiang by Li Ru who returned from a business trip.\"There were two pieces of news, one good and the other bad. Which one do you want to hear first?\" Li Ru poured a cup of tea for him and seated herself opposite him.\"Thank you.\" He Bai took a sip, feeling him sober-minded a little, and replied, \"Bad one, please.\"\"I guess so.\" Li Ru leaned back into the chair, with a faint smile on her face, \"You have received two complaints, one from our customer and the other from a colleague. The customer's complaint was sent to our group leader Ma Qun, and the latter bypassed me and went to my superior.\" Complaints?It was quite unexpected. He Bai raised his hand to massage his puffy eyes, thought for a while and asked, \"Let me guess. The customer complaining about me is Liu Huanhuan, isn't she? And the colleague\u2026 Ma Xingtong?\"\"You guess out only half the story.\" Li Ru shook her finger and replied, \"The colleague who made a complaint of you is indeed Ma Xingtong. He said you were too self-assertive to conform to the rules and regulations of our company as well as to the requirements of the television station and conduct the shooting in the appropriate scenes. He also said you are lacking in team spirit.\"It was quite a groundless countercharge. He Bai completely did not expect Ma Xingtong, a skilled photographer, should spare no efforts to push him aside.\"What shall I do with the complaints?\" He asked, with his face hardening.Li Ru found his childish expression amusing. Shaking her head, she said, \"The regulations stipulate that a regular employee, when receiving a complaint from his customer, must apologize to the customer in person, and make every effort to compensate his client for his losses after finding reasons out; when complained of by a colleague, the employee would face dismissal (if his error is of a serious nature) or wage deduction (if his error causes no considerable consequences) plus demerit recording. One who has three demerits shall be forced out.\"It was indeed an undeserved catastrophe. He Bai was neither willing to make apology to Liu Huanhuan nor expecting wage deduction. After all, that's his hard-earned money ... He Bai was getting desperate.Li Ru couldn't help laughing eventually, \"But you're not a regular employee and work on a part-time basis. So it's me, your supervisor, who needs to make an apology and inquires about the cause. Besides, given that you work part-time and that your superior considers the complaint from your co-worker may be a slander, so the complaint is overruled and you'll receive two hundred yuan as consolation prize.\"He Bai sat up in a flash and stared at her with joy, \"Sister Li ...\"\"Don't look at me this way. It's too sappy.\" Li Ru waved her hand and teased him, \"Are you in the mood to hear the good news now?\"One dimple appeared on He Bai's left face as he smiled. Then he gave a nod, and poured a glass of water for Li Ru attentively.Li Ru enjoyed his service, and spoke slowly, \"As for the good news ... The station personnel were quite satisfied with those refined pictures you had taken. The person in charge happened to hear that you also snapped some pictures of other hostesses to good effect, so he decided to make a sidelight collection with those snaps so as to boost the online publicity of the station's commemorative activities. You can get a good price for each photo.\" She stuck a finger while speaking.He Bai's eyes lit up, and his body leaned forward unconsciously, \"one hundred each?\"Li Ru shook her head, \"Mind you, I myself negotiated the price with them on your behalf. You can add a fourth digit.\"\"A thousand?!\" He Bai was agape with astonishment, \"They\u2026 They decide to buy the snaps at such a high price before seeing them?\"\"I believe in your capability.\" Li Ru put her finger down, and affected by his emotion, her smile broadened, \"And the television station believes my judgment as well as the charm that the series of Miss Yang's photos have displayed. Come on, He. I've got your back.\"Breathing a sigh of relief, He Bai stood up, gave a bow to Li Ru and smiled in a radiant but silly way, \"Thank you, Sister Li, I will do my best!\"When he left Saint Elephant, He Bai met Ma Qun, with a camera hung on a string around his neck. It seemed that he had become a regular photographer.\"Good morning, Bro Ma.\" He Bai greeted him, as if completely unaware that he had just been complained by Ma Qun's uncle. He Bai looked very happy and spoke to him in a grateful manner, \"Thank you a lot for offering me the opportunity last week. The TV station was extraordinarily gratified with my photos and decided to buy the snaps I took that day to make a sidelight collection. Thanks so much for your help, I really appreciate it. When I'm paid, please let me treat you to dinner!\"\"Real\u2026 Really? Congratulations.\" Ma Qun forced a smile. Seeing He Bai left, he grasped the camera firmly when a button on it dropped all of the sudden.\"My god! What are you doing? This is a new camera that our company has bought recently! There are only several ones! You'll be complained about damaging the corporate property purposefully!\" The receptionist girl who had watched their exchange attentively yelled angrily.Recovering from shock, Ma Qun clenched the button and rushed to ingratiate himself with the girl.Having Ma Qun irritated, He Bai strode down the street in high spirits. He sent the snaps to Li Ru immediately when returning to campus. The next morning, Li Ru gave him a call and informed him that the television station selected a large part of his pictures for use and paid the wage into his bank account.The station staff worked at such a great efficiency that it took them only one day to finish the montage and post the photos along with the sidelights video online via the official Weibo account of B City's television station, causing a heated discussion among netizens.\"Wow, there's my photo. My God, I look so good in this suit! I would have thought I must be done for when Mr. Ma showed us his refined pictures. After all, I don't photograph well in the garment!\"In one of the green rooms, a hostess held her phone tightly and screamed in her excitement.Another newcomer leaned close to her, with a blush warming her cheeks, \"Yeah, yeah, you're right. I wonder who took such beautiful photos. In his photograph, my thick calves look so charming! I couldn't love him more!\"\"Wow, netizens say the girl in Photo 7 is so cute! It's me! I am the person in the seventh picture! These snaps prove better than the feature! Awesome! I remember these photos are taken by the young photographer who's responsible for taking photographs of a newcomer at Children's Channel. I really envy the hostess for her photographer is of great ability!\"Another round-faced hostess holding her cell phone was so excited that she nearly cried out.\"Of course. Among all the newcomers who were sent for photo shoot that day, who wasn't envious of Yang Fu?\"A bob-haired girl came in interrupting them, and scoffed while picking her working card off, \"But Liu Huanhuan, the newcomer who has gained major support of the station, must be an exception. After all, she demanded strongly that Mr. Ma serve as her photographer. I also heard that she filed a complaint about the young photographer who took photos of Yang Fu. Hmm, no wonder she doesn't appear in the sidelights. It's obvious that her behavior deeply offended the photographer. It serves her right!\"The three hostesses exchanged glances on hearing it and dared not to respond. Everyone laughed at Liu Huanhuan on the quiet when the sidelights came out. It was said that she was rebuked by the head of the television station for spoiling the cooperation between the station and Saint Elephant, and her program was suspended for two weeks.Seeing them stand in silence, the bobbing girl showed the whites of her eyes disdainfully, \"Look at you who are scared stiff. A word of warning: keep away from Liu Huanhuan recently. Someone intends to sort her out.\"Shocked by her words, the three went closer to her and asked out of curiosity, \"Who? Who wants to sort her out?\"\"The media magnate at Channel 4. Rumor has it that Liu Huanhuan was the girlfriend of his son and two-timed him. It's too kind of the guy who never brought her to account and let her off, while she should lodge a complaint against one of his best friend. Indeed, she was down on her luck right now. The giant warned that he would stop putting advertisements on the station if Liu Huanhuan continued to work there. There are a large number of TV stations. He could choose any one at will.\"What a juicy gossip!Excited at her words, the three girls approached the bobbing girl and asked her more details.Their support gave the bobbing girl a chance to vent her anger at Liu Huanhuan. She simply pulled a chair to sit in and continued her talk with gusto.Outside the door, a staffer raised his hand to wipe the sweat, looking at Di Qiuhe who stopped for the gossip, and carefully said, \"Mr. Di, the program is about to start, you see...\" One of his seniors once told him that Liu Huanhuan had had the audacity to seduce the good-tempered idol. Now the situation ... was quite embarrassing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/One Useless RebirthCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: Sissy That Walk\u201cSorry.\u201d Di Qiuhe stepped forward again and looked at him with his head tilted slightly. It seemed like his gentle and smiling eyes were covered with a layer of light created by the dusky light in the corridor, causing a tempting vibe. \u201cHas the commemoration activity of your TV Station begun yet?\u201dSoft and low voice, attentive and deep eyes and slightly upturned lips were so tantalizing that one was attempted to kiss him involuntarily. The working staff was stunned for a moment, and then uncomfortably moved his sight away from Di Qiuhe. He pinched his red earlobes while pretending to adjust the glasses and his attitude was unconsciously softened. \u201cIt\u2019s just a preliminary act for building up the momentum and the formal event is still at preparation stage. As soon as it begins, we will send you an invitation letter. We hope you will be able to do us the honor to come.\u201dDi Qiuhe nodded his head to show that he understood, and then it looked like something came to his mind, so he frowned and replied with a trace of regret on his face. \u201cI am glad that the TV Station is so hospitable that you want to invite me, but... I have left Huangdu now and all the team members have been called back. Today\u2019s TV show will be the last time I appear on stage as a Huangdu entertainer. It is still unknown that whether I can keep working in the entertainment industry after that, so I am afraid I will not be able to live up to your expectations.The working staff stared at him without noticing his manners. \u201cYou are no longer a Huangdu entertainer? Why haven\u2019t I...\u201d Remembering the quiet scene that Di Qiuhe came to the TV station to record the TV show all alone by himself today, he quickly swallowed his words down with a storm stirred up in his heart.Di Qiuhe had just won the Best Actor Award at Thousand Flowers Award with Tears of Rouge. He was in the limelight, and rumor also had it that this man had a very powerful background which would definitely make his career in the future extraordinarily bright. But it had been just a few months since he won the award, how could he have left Huangdu? He also said that it was uncertain if he could keep working in the entertainment industry in the future. Was he blacklisted or forced out by Huangdu? How come? No wonder there were rumors that all product endorsements of Di Qiuhe had been withdrawn recently. It turned out to be... an explosive news!What did Di Qiuhe mean by telling him all of this now? What was Di Qiuhe\u2019s purpose? He was just an inferior working staff at the TV Station. What could Di get by telling him this information? What did Di want?All kinds of conspiracies were swirling in his mind and his expression unconsciously became somewhat stiff.Di Qiuhe did not seem to have noticed his abnormal reaction. Taking out his cell phone from his pocket and searching for the official blog of the TV station of City B, he asked, \u201cIs this video posted and used for building up the momentum by your station obtained from Saint Elephant Studio? What is the name of the little photographer who provided the material?\u201d\u201cIt is Saint Elephant Studio. The photographer\u2019s name is He Bai.\u201d The staff answered instinctively, then quickly regained his sense and asked nervously, \u201cYou, you are asking about this to...\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that I will not be able to participate in your commemoration activity, so... well, I wish you all the best with the commemoration activity.\u201d Di Qiuhe smiled, he forwarded the video on his weibo account, posting a few words of congratulations, and praised the unknown photographer who provided the material and the working staff who edited the material incidentally. He showed his cell phone to the working staff and asked with a smile, \u201cHope you don\u2019t mind me using the commemoration activity of your TV Station to create some hype.\u201dWatching Di Qiuhe doing all of this and wearing a gentle smile all the time, that working staff suddenly felt embarrassed. Though the future of this man standing in front him was bleak, he was still thinking about helping the TV station promote the momentum-building activity, and he showed respect by saying that he was taking advantage of the TV station to attract attention, this was...Good person! A very good man! How could such a good man make use of an inferior working staff like him? It was him who mentioned at first to invite Di Qiuhe to participate in the commemoration activity, that man was just responding to his invitation and then explained why he refused the invitation. What on earth was he thinking about!\u201cThank you very much, Mr. Di.\u201d That working staff\u2019s attitude became more and more enthusiastic, it even got intimate. Then he said sincerely, \u201cAs such an excellent person, you will absolutely shine brightly in the entertainment circle in the future. You get it!\u201dDi Qiuhe beamed more gently and genially, he looked at this working staff kindly and nodded, \u201cWell, hope all things can work out as you said, thank you.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome.\u201d What a good temper he had got. Once again, the working staff had red ears and looked away for being shy.He Bai came to the Computer Town with the money he just earned. He was ready to choose a computer for himself.Suddenly the notification tone of the cell phone rang, he pulled out his cell phone from the pocket and was stunned at the sight of a lot of Wechat message notifications on it. It reminded him that he had not checked the Wechat messages for a long time, so he hurried up to check the unread messages.A Bird Born in Autumn: Good morning ^-^A Bird Born in Autumn: Good night ^-^A Bird Born in Autumn: Being busy?...A Bird Born in Autumn: Liar! Didn\u2019t you say that you will mail me the pictures which you failed to deliver to my door last time?A Bird Born in Autumn: I was just kidding. The final exam is around the corner. You must be very busy. Come on ^-^...A Bird Born in Autumn: Good Morning ^-^...A Bird Born in Autumn: What are you doing?Messages had been sent on and off to him from last week till present. He Bai went through all the messages and pounded on his forehead, then he hurried to type words and replied.White and Whiter: Sorry, because I have been busy reviewing all this time, I have not been able to check the Wechat messages. I will send you the photos later.The buyer replied very fast as if he did not need time to type in words.A Bird Born in Autumn: That\u2019s ok. Work harder at the end of the semester. What are you doing?White and White: Buying a computer.A Bird Born in Autumn: At Computer Town?White and Whiter: Yes. I will mail the photos to you as soon as I finish buying the computer, sorry to keep you waiting for such a long time.A Bird Born in Autumn: Take your time.White and White: ???A Bird Born in Autumn: Buying a computer is something that needs caution. You should take your time in choosing a computer.He Bai fell in silence for a few seconds and could not help laughing.Though the buyer was a bit nuts, he occasionally was warm-hearted...It was lovely.He Bai hesitated for a long time between laptop and desktop computer. Considering that he would be leaving school for an internship in another year and the budget was sufficient, he finally bought a super expensive laptop whose performance could endure his torment for at least three years.He Bai went out of the Computer Town with his computer case. He took a look at the watch and walked toward the bus stop.\u201cLittle puppy.\u201dFamiliar voice, familiar intonation, familiar scenario.He Bai paused his forward steps and then made a decisive sharp turn.\u201cDo you want to know why I want to thank you for sending teacher Xu Yinrong those photos?\u201dHe Bai stopped and turned his head to look at Di Qiuhe, who managed to look handsome and shining even in a casual shirt and jeans a few steps away. Knitting his eyebrows together, He Bai thought he should first change a new cell phone, one with the almanac app to check whether it was an auspicious day.Di Qiuhe raised his hand to lift the brim of his cricket cap, pulled his mask and raised his eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t try to expose my identity and run away. If you do so, I\u2019ll take you to have an experience of alley escape again.\u201dHe Bai choked, \u201cI did not think that... About the photos, I can ask teacher Xu.\u201cA long time has passed, why haven\u2019t you asked him?\u201d Di Qiuhe looked at him with his arms held across his chest and chin raised. His gentleness and courteous manners were gone, and his body language was provocative.He Bai choked again. Because he asked about those photos, but teacher Xu did not utter a word, he gave him an unfathomable laugh and more homework.Di Qiuhe crooked his finger to beckon him, smiling gently, \u201cCome on, get in my car.\u201dHe Bai stood there thinking for three seconds. Finally, curiosity prevailed. He walked towards him with an expressionless face and raised his chin. \u201cLead the way.\u201dDi Qiuhe looked at He Bai\u2019s staged poker face. He hummed and turned around to lead the way, thinking proudly that what use did it do to blacklist him in WeChat because He Bai was now in his hand anyway?The sports car in flashy red color sped all the way to the center of the city and steadily parked outside the alley where the two used to escape from the crowd.He Bai covered his mouth and wanted to vomit.\u201cAlthough my father kicked me out of Huangdu, he compensated me for several luxury cars and many houses, and more money than that I can spend in my life.\u201d Di Qiuhe unfastened his seat belt and turned his head to look at He Bai. \u201cDo you like this car? Is it cool?\u201dHe Bai opened a bottle of water and drank it slowly. He suppressed the nausea feeling and said numbly, \u201cYou...\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Di Qiuhe ran his fingers through his hair with his body half tilted. Two of his shirt buttons were unbuttoned, revealing his sexy clavicle lines. As the shirt was a little tight, his sexy waist line was clearly exposed.\u201cYour driving skills stink.\u201d He Bai tightened the water bottle cap, opened the door with his feebly hand, and got off the car. He then supported himself with his arm put against the car roof and buried his face in his arm to relieve his dizziness.Di Qiuhe stared at the steering wheel with a stiff expression and an unhappy face. Then he pulled his collar, got out of the car, walked to He Bai and poked him on the shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201dHe Bai turned his head and gave him a lifeless look.Only then did Di Qiuhe find that He Bai\u2019s face was a little ghastly, his lips were very pale and slightly closed, which made him feel an impulse to help him redden his lips.Here it came again, that inexplicable heart tremor. He pressed his chest with doubt and twisted his eyebrows slightly. Then he put one hand on He Bai\u2019s shoulder and the other hand on his waist. Unconsciously holding his breath, Di Qiuhe leaned over and slowly moved his hand down He Bai\u2019s waist...\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He Bai knitted his eyebrows.\u201cYou look terrible. I\u2019ll take you to the doctor.\u201d Di Qiuhe said with a serious face.He Bai gritted his teeth. \u201cThat is the reason why you touched my butt?\u201dDi Qiuhe was stunned, he took a look at his hands and raised his eyebrows. \u201cThis is butt? This is clearly the back of your waist!\u201d As he spoke, he moved his hand down, pressed on He Bai\u2019s butt and patted it hard. \u201cThis is butt!\u201d Do you have the common knowledge, little puppy?\u2019He Bai opened his eyes widely and looked at Di Qiuhe incredibly. Then he turned around, hooked Di Qiuhe\u2019s neck, pressed him down and pounded on him. \u201cDi, you are a piece of garbage!\u201d You touched me...you took my milk tea, you took my camera and you caused me to be reported by the newspaper! You send me harassment messages in the middle of the night, you destroyed my photos, made me have nightmares! And you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have ever dreamed of me?\u201d At first, Di Qiuhe stood still to allow him to pound on him. When he heard this, he could not help grasping He Bai\u2019s hand and raising the corner of his mouth at a satisfying angel. \u201cI know you are one of my fan-boy! It doesn\u2019t matter, as long as you restrain your worship of me a little, idols and fans can become friends.\u201dThe hands gripped He Bai\u2019s shoulder and wrist were very big and warm, and the strength used was not too big, but it made him not being able to move, so he could only passively cling on Di Qiuhe\u2019s body. As Di Qiuhe knew Kungfu, he was no rival of him.He Bai knew that \u2018a wise man submits to fate\u2019. He lowered his voice. \u201cLet go of me first.\u201dDi Qiuhe was very satisfied with both of their present posture. He grabbed him and walked away with an unruly expression. \u201cThen beg me.\u201d\u201c...You\u2019re not afraid to be photographed by the \u201cpup\u201darazzi and then tabloid news of \u201cShocking! The famous handsome young star is gay, flirting and cuddling with a person of the same sex in a secret alley?\u201cNo.\u201d He found it very abominable when Di Qiuhe laughed at him gently. \u201cThe monitoring devices around here are all not working. If someone appears at the front and back exits, it will be very obvious. The people in the alley can find that right away. Most importantly, I was forced out and no news about me can be published. Qin Li is a clever woman. Under this circumstance, she knows better than anyone what to do.\u201dSince Di Qiuhe was not having any sense of shame, He Bai could only take the unwise decision.He Bai drooped his eyelids silently and then said quietly, \u201cI want to pee.\u201dDi Qiuhe stopped.\u201cAnd I am carsick and want to vomit.\u201dDi Qiuhe loosened him, turned him to a trash can in the alley, patted him on the back, and gently said, \u201cPee and vomit by the way. I will watch out for you and not let others see your Little Bai.\u201dHe Bai: \u201c...\u201d The script did not seem right?\u201cDo you need me to untie your belt?\u201dHe Bai decisively turned around and ran away. He found out that the reason why this crappy Film Emperor blocked his way today was to revenge himself for making a fool of him in front of the roast duck restaurant. He had to run. Otherwise, today would be his doomsday.\u201cYour camera and computer are all in my car.\u201dHe Bai halted quickly and scolded himself for being so stupid in his heart. Then he turned around and ran back to Di Qiuhe. He took his hand and said sincerely, \u201cI am your fan-boy! The one totally with no brains! Do you want to eat steak? My treat, not the most expensive one, but the general expensive one is still OK!!\u201cGood boy.\u201d Di Qiuhe touched his head and the force used was very gentle. \u201cI heard you were bullied by a little host some time ago? Do not be afraid. As your big brother, I will help you out.\u201dHe Bai: \u201c...\u201d \u2018Why does it seem that I have heard this tone of \u201cbig brother\u201d before?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

And he comforted He Bai in a I-don\u2019t-care way, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019ll find you a cooking tutorial, if you blow up my kitchen, it\u2019s okay, just compensate me, I will give you a 50% discount.\u201d\u201cThank you for your generosity\u2026.\u201d He Bai shook his head and shook off his hand.Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrow, took back his hand and gently tugged at his hair. He smiled contentedly, \u201cDon\u2019t always show me your admiration, I will feel embarrassed.\u201d\u201c...\u201d It was impossible to communicate with someone who had no sense of shame.Finishing buying the ingredients with the fastest speed, Di Qiuhe paid the bill, crossed the alley and returned to his car with He Bai.As soon as He Bai got in the car, he immediately took his camera bag into his arms and took out his cell phone. He looked at Di Qiuhe, saying, \u201cTell me your account number and I will transfer the money to you.\u201d Since he said he would treat, then he would pay the bill. It was an accident that Di Qiuhe paid for those ingredients just now. His wallet, cell phone and camera bag were all left in the car and that was why he could not pay.\u201cI only accept cash.\u201d Di Qiuhe leaned over to help him fasten his seat belt, then he sat up, fastened his own seat belt, and started the car. \u201cAnd brand-new notes only.\u201dThe handsome face of that man approached and left. He could smell a faint smell of male perfume. He Bai stayed still with his wallet in hand for a moment, and then gritted his teeth, \u201cDi Qiuhe, you are doing this on purpose!\u201d\u201cYou finally found out.\u201d Di Qiuhe turned the car around and drove towards his residence. He looked sideways at him with a smile. \u201cSo, you want to continue beating me now? Little puppy, my shoulder hurts a little, which may affect the filming progress later. Do you want to pay me for my loss of working time?He Bai put away his cell phone with a sullen face and decided to change a pile of coins to bash this bastard.The car drove into the underground garage of a high-grade residential area. He Bai carried his camera bag and computer case, Di Qiuhe carried the food ingredients, and they stood side by side at the elevator entrance.Click.He Bai turned his head sensitively and looked at a dark corner of the garage.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Di Qiuhe turned to look at him. He took off the hat and pulled his fingers through his hair. His posture was quite relaxed. \u201cIs the computer too heavy? Give it to me and I will carry it for you.There was another faint sound of the shutter. He Bai frowned. He decisively put the computer into Di Qiuhe\u2019s arms, took out his camera, adjusted the exposure number, turned on the flash lamp and pressed the shutter madly toward the dark place.Ding! The elevator arrived.Di Qiuhe realized that something was wrong. He turned his head toward that dim spot, squinted, and asked, \u201cSomebody is snapping photos?\u201d\u201cYes, if it is not that I play with the camera myself and am very sensitive to the shutter sound, I probably would not have found it.\u201d He Bai nodded, put down his camera and turned to look at him. \u201cShould we call a security guard?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Di Qiuhe took out his cell phone and made a phone call to the property management office. Then, it seemed as if something came to his mind. He smiled, grabbed He Bai on the shoulder in an intimate gesture, took him to the elevator and said, \u201cLittle puppy, do you want to make a scene?\u201dWith the weight imposed on his shoulder, He Bai could feel the body temperature of Di Qiuhe transmitted through his two layers of clothes. He felt uncomfortable when two people who were not really familiar with each other did such intimate actions. But he was afraid that Di Qiuhe had done it deliberately for the photographer to see, so he waited patiently for the elevator door to close before he stepped aside, pulled Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand off and asked with a frown, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dDi Qiuhe took back his hand, pressed the button of the top floor, looked up at the direction of the camera in the elevator, and curled up his lips. \u201cIt is better to take the first move.\u201dHe Bai also looked at the direction of the camera in the elevator. Something blurry appeared in his head and disappeared quickly. He rubbed his forehead doubtfully and grasped the belt of his camera bag unconsciously. Snapped photographs, elevator, Di Qiuhe... It seemed as if he had ever heard some sentence or phrase with these three connected together somewhere?Di Qiuhe lived in a large duplex apartment. Most space of the first floor was broken through and a large living room was formed. There was a small room in the corner adjacent to the living room. That was Di Qiuhe\u2019s bedroom. The second floor was empty and the decoration was of the deserted style. It did not look like a home, but rather like a temporary hotel.He Bai stood in front of the landing window and looked out at the broad city view.He felt the hatred of the rich in his heart was roaring for a moment. Then he turned his head to look at Di Qiuhe who was walking towards this side with a plate of fruit on his hand and He Bai quietly felt the jealousy.Broad shoulder, narrow waist, long legs, fair skin, rich and handsome face, it made him very upset when comparing himself with Di Qiuhe.\u201cEat some fruit to first to line your stomach, I will search for cooking recipe for you.\u201d Di Qiuhe put down the fruit and walked toward him. Suddenly he put his arm on He Bai\u2019s shoulder and took a picture of them with his cell phone.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He Bai moved sideways to avoid his arm.\u201cAs I said, it\u2019s better to take the first move.\u201d Di Qiuhe took back his arm before He Bai completely got out of the way. Then he went to the sofa, took out a laptop, hit the keyboard for a few times, turned the screen to He Bai and clicked to play the video, \u201cOkay, the cooking tutorial of fried steak has been found, watch it and cook.\u201dHe Bai, who was waiting to see him make a scene, could not help but stare at him, \u201cThe first move you mean is this?\u201d \u2018To arouse one\u2019s curiosity yet fail to meet the satisfaction is what animals do!\u201cIn a second.\u201d Di Qiuhe picked up his cell phone and took a quick picture of He Bai staring at him. Then he pointed at He Bai\u2019s camera bag on the sofa and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mind me borrowing the pictures you just took, right?\u201dAn impatient person would probably get furious at his casual and care-for-nothing style.He Bai raised the corner of his mouth, stepped forward to pull the memory card out of the camera, took out a card reader, inserted the memory card in the card reader, and put it in front of him. \u201cUse it as you wish, as long as you do not delete my photos.\u201d\u201cGood boy.\u201d Di Qiuhe reached out to touch his head.He Bai resolutely picked up a pillow and slammed it into his face.Di Qiuhe pulled down the pillow and smiled gently, lowering his head.The laughter was clear and melodious, echoing in the living room and matching his handsome side face when he lowered his head. It was so perfect that it looked like a painting.He Bai was so attempted. He could not help but picked up the camera and pressed the shutter at Di Qiuhe, and then found that the camera was not working without the memory card. He rolled his eyes and sat across Di Qiuhe, pulling the computer to him to watch the cooking lessons attentively.\u201cYou can take the photographs as soon as my work is done. Don\u2019t get angry.\u201d Di Qiuhe pushed the fruit tray to He Bai, then pulled out a computer from the interlayer of the tea table, opened the computer, plugged in the card reader, and quickly operated.The tone of that sentence just now seemed to have a gentle and friendly touch...No, it was all illusions. Such a terrible fellow had nothing to do with the word gentleness! He Bai rubbed his forehead and tried to fix his eyes on the video.Eight minutes later, the cooking video was over and the sound of Di Qiuhe typing letters stopped.\u201cAll right.\u201d Di Qiuhe snapped his finger.He Bai looked up at him.\u201cLook at this.\u201d Di Qiuhe turned the computer to him, got up and went to the kitchen.He Bai pulled his computer closer with curiosity and touched the touchpad with his finger.On the computer screen was the website of Weibo, Di Qiuhe\u2019s account was logged in, and there was a new post on it.Di Qiuhe: When I came home from recording scene, I met one of my junior alumni and invited him to come to my home. But what was unexpected was that we met a reporter who followed us to take pictures. My junior alumni studies at the school of journalism played with the reporter and took some pictures of the reporter. How many points do you think he could get with these photos? [Picture] X 9He Bai clicked open the pictures one by one and found that the first eight pictures were all the pictures of that \u201cpup\u201darazi shot by him, all of those pictures were pixelated. The remaining one was the selfie of him with Di Qiuhe and only his face was pixelated.A few minutes later, hundreds of comments were left below that post. He took a glance at those comments below and found that they could mainly be divided into four types: first, directly scored the photos; second, criticized the \u201cpup\u201darazi for being shameless and complimented Di Qiuhe\u2019s junior alumni for doing a good job; third, analyzed the location of where the photos were taken and finally drew the conclusion that the location was the garage, hence it could be concluded that the \u201cpup\u201darazi followed Di Qiuhe to his home; fourth, cursed Di Qiuhe for being selfish, abusing the influence of a public figure to expose the appearance of the \u201cpup\u201darazi, inciting the fans to scold the \u201cpup\u201darazi, making a fuss, being petty and abusing cyber violence.This was indeed a scene, but that was all? Posted a Weibo message to let others curse him?He Bai did not understand what Di Qiuhe was thinking. Just when he was ready to ask Di some questions, he found several webpages beside the Weibo page. He clicked those webpages open in confusion.It was another Weibo page which stayed on the homepage of a marketing account. On the top of that webpage was a tip-off newly posted.I love gossip, I am proud: Explosive news, explosive news! A handsome young star surnamed D was forced out by his previous employer and he terminated his contract in anger. Tip: This handsome young star surnamed D has been rumored to have an affair with a new TV host and it is rumored that he is actually the younger master of his previous company. However, you get a stepfather when you get a stepmother. so...You know.He Bai opened his mouth slightly and clicked on the remaining webpages in a hurry.There were seven or eight webpages in total. Except for the first one which was the homepage of Di Qiuhe\u2019s Weibo account, the rest were all the homepages of various marketing accounts. Various tip-offs were posted at similar times, all related to Di Qiuhe. Most of them were negative news. He could foresee how lively Weibo would be during this period of time.\u201cFinished watching them all?\u201d Di Qiuhe came out with two glasses of juice. He put a glass in front of him, sat across him with his hand supporting his chin, laughing. \u201cThis is the first batch, the second batch will catch up immediately, and I will end up being scolded very miserably, and then cancel my Weibo account desperately, disappear in public view from now on until my new work comes on the market.\u201dThe vague things in his mind suddenly became clear. He recalled the personal interview with Di Qiuhe before he was reborn. It was mentioned that Di Qiuhe had to be forced out by his employer due to some negative news and he cancelled his Weibo account in depressed mood. It was not until the Immortal Way came out that he reappeared in front of the public, and then he clarified the negative news posted before with substantial evidence.The negative news posted at that time seemed to be something like \u201cthe handsome young star is suspected of losing control due to his use of drugs, he pulled the sneaky paparazzi into the elevator and caused serious injuries to that paparazzi, leading him on the verge of death\u201d. When this happened, he was reviewing his studying courses around the clock and just took a careless look at that news. Even though he just followed that news in such a casual way, he probably knew how miserable that handsome young star was bullied by the mass media in that year.In this way, if he did not come back with Di Qiuhe today, Di Qiuhe would probably be blocked in the elevator by that paparazzi, causing the extremely sensational \u201cseriously injured reporter\u201d incident in his previous life? The first move referred by Di Qiuhe turned out to be sabotaging his own reputation before those reporters did?\u201cAre you nuts?\u201d He Bai could not help asking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Three-in-one (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe stared blankly for a moment, then, he shook his head and smiled, \u201cNo, it is my stepmother who is insane.\u201d Before discovering the candid cameras, he thought Qin Li would become smart recently, laying low and trying to regain the favorable impression of his father and daring not play any trick on him. After discovering being taken photos secretly, he knew that he misunderstood her. Now, Qin Li not only wanted to regain the favorable impression from his father, but also wanted to block Di Qiuhe\u2019s outlet.He stabilized his position in the heart of his father by making concessions in order to gain advantages, and broke away from the control of Huangdu completely. This made Qin Li nervous. She would definitely try her best to force him to go back to Huangdu and control him again; then, cut off his outlet. After leaving Huangdu, he had thought about all the actions that Qin Li might take. However, he had never thought that she would react so fast.This apartment was given by Qin Li. He had already guessed the purpose of this present. Now, in such a tightly managed community, paparazzo suddenly appeared and hided for taking candid photos in the garage. This was undoubtedly a signal that Qin Li had lost her patience.He could almost imagine what Qin Li would do next. First of all, she would splash dirty water on him. Then, she would disclose that the company blacklisted him out of helplessness. By using the relation network in her hand, she would block him secretly and forced him to return to Di Family awkwardly. Then, she would pretend to be a good wife and mother in front of his father and accepted him to go back so as to stabilize the heart of his father. At that time, his father would be touched; while he, as an actor full of bad records, could not work in the entertainment industry anymore, and too disqualified to become the successor of Huangdu. As a result, he would be left witt no choice but to live under the shadow of Qin Li and two of her children, and reduced to the tool of Qin Li for performing and pretending a mother\u2019s love. The reason that Qin Li who did not take any action before but suddenly became impatience was probably the information vaguely disclosed recently that Uncle Jiang had confirmed the leading actor for his new movie. If the puppy were not here today, what would the paparazzo do? Would they be just taking candid photos? Or they would do something else? He was pretty sure that he did not leave any video image in the monitor of the building that may turn the potential bad records of him before he took puppy home today. Then, what was the purpose for the paparazzo to take photos today? \u2018Test? Or take some plausible photos and make up some plausible news? What will Qin Li do next?\u2019He was thinking about the unpleasant things in his head, so the smile on his face unconsciously got stiff. There was a gentle look of eyes and eyebrows with smile, but no temperature in his eyes, only indifference.He Bai looked at Di Qiuhe at this moment and remembered the breaking news that he saw just now and how Di Qiuhe ended his life in previous life. Then, his anger at the tease by Di Qiuhe before was dissipated slowly, and he could not help sighing.This was a poor young man. The mask was his protective shell, and the showing of emotions like before was probably his only indulgence.\u201cIs there anything I can help you?\u201d He moved the computer away and looked at him carefully.From rebirth to now, he encountered with this man again and again. From holding a position of not willing to interfere in his life path at the beginning to giving veiled reminders and now hoping to help him, he understood that he had taken him as a friend unconsciously, although this man was bad and naive, and made him angry each time they met.Di Qiuhe recovered from thought and felt the eye contact of He Bai. He was shocked by the pure concern in the eyes of He Bai. Then, he looked away reflexively, smiled and turned offthe computer. He raised his chin to indicate the kitchen, \u201chello, I am hungry. I\u2019d like some steak, medium rare.\u201d After that, he stretched himself comfortably and lied on the sofa with a domineering posture like a landlord waiting for dinner.The serious expression invalidated suddenly. He Bai stiffly looked at Di Qiuhe who was lying on the sofa, not giving a damn of the way he looked; he stepped on him angrily and strode towards the kitchen.\u201cI\u2019d like to drink red wine. You need to drink with me.\u201dHe Bai flipped his middle finger and felt that he was a pure fool for the compassion just now.There came the sound of the kitchen ventilator. Di Qiuhe moved the leg which was stepped on by He Bai, moved away the pillow on his face, and squinted at the ceiling with absence of mind. Then he jumped up with smile and fetched his cell phone, scrolling to the phone number of Jiang Xiuwen and texting.Di Qiuhe: Xiuwen, my younger brother is cute.Jiang Xiuwen: \u2026\u2026What makes you think that Di Xiasong, a hypocritical man is cute? Are you controlled by witchcraft?Di Qiuhe: What is the qualification for Di Xiasong to be my younger brother? Does he have dimples on his face? Is he as cute as puppy, as considerate as puppy? Can he roll his eyes like puppy?Jiang Xiuwen: Who is puppy? Wait a minute, why I feel this name is familiar\u2026\u2026you are not talking about that male fan of yours, are you? Is that White and Whiter that you tricked with using your second account?Di Qiuhe: Yes, he is not only my fan, but also my junior at college, who can be called as younger brother. As his upperclassman, I shall protect him well.Jiang Xiuwen: I have helped you to register at the hospital, the reservation for an expert, expert in psychiatry department. Do remember to go there on time, do not waste my money.Di Qiuhe: You are jealous.Jiang Xiuwen: \u2026\u2026 I beg you, please take your medicine.\u201cGee, jealous man is really ugly.\u201d Di Qiuhe showed off and threw the cell phone away with satisfaction. He reflected the word of \u201cyounger brother\u201d for several times and the more he thought about it, the more he found this name very good and suitable for He Bai.No wonder he felt affectionate toward puppy. It was because he wanted puppyto be his younger brother. It was good. He had a good taste. \u2018His bark is worse than his bite. He is much better than Di Xiasong, definitely a perfect younger brother he is.\u2019Notifications of new comments and likes constantly rang, which Di Qiuhe ignored completely. He bounced up happily and walked to the kitchen door, looking at He Bai who was turning side of the steak skillfully. What a surprise, \u201cYou can cook?\u201dAs a single man that had been on his own for years, cooking was a necessary skill. He Bai sprinkled a little sauce on the steak, but reluctant to look at him.Di Qiuhe did not care that He Bai did not want to talk to him. Instead, he felt that He Bai who was angry but still cooking for him was cute. He couldn\u2019t help walking behind He Bai, rubbing the head of He Bai with satisfaction, \u201cGood brother, I will treat you well.\u201d\u2018Cool! That\u2019s a great thing to say.\u2019He Bai halted the cooking shovel and twitched his brows. He moved his right foot backwards decisively and stomped down severely.The hand on the head of He Bai paused. Then Di Qiuhe said gently and stably, \u201cIf you hurt me and influence the shooting progress, you are not able to afford the charge for loss of working time, little brother.\u201dHe Bai was speechless. He pulled his foot back silently and shook Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand off putting the fried steak on the plate and turned back, putting the plate on the hand of Di Qiuhe, he said seriously, \u201cEat, keep your mouth shut.\u201d Do not challenge the bottom line of his temper again.Di Qiuhe took over the plate and enjoyed the smell of the food. Then, he poked the dimple on the left cheek of He Bai by his finger and rotated his finger, \u201cLittle brother, smile please.\u201dHe Bai sneered, smearing all the oil on his hands onto the abominable face of Di Qiuhe.Ten minutes later, the two people that roasted each other sat by the tea table and gulfed the steak. The red wine in the disposable paper cup was at their hand.\u201cWhat do you plan to do after the release of bad record? Are you going to wait and make clarification when launching new works to the market?\u201d He Bai couldn\u2019t help asking during eating.Di Qiuhe took a sip of the red wine, squinting to taste, and replied with smile \u201cNo. After I cancel my Weibo account, those bad records will be clarified slowly. Then those people who cursed me on the internet will regret their behavior before and wish they hadn\u2019t done that\u2026...By then, I will be shooting new film in border province.\u201dHe Bai was stunned, \u201cAre you going to shoot new film in border province?\u201d He remembered that the works of Di Qiuhe which made him successful in his previous life was a drama of chivalrous man \u201cImmortal Way\u201d which was directed by Lin Mo. The filming location was the movie city in China and various scenic spots, which had nothing to do with the border province.\u201cYes.\u201d Di Qiuhe nodded. Although he was sitting on the floor, his action of cutting steak was still gracefully, \u201cMy new movie is the new work of the Director Jiang Guanshan. I play the leading role of the movie, a cop who joins in transnational drug gangs as undercover. There are a lot of fight scenes. We get the shooting permission of movie recently. It\u2019s still a while before we start shooting, but I need to go there in advance so as to get familiar with the environment. Then, I will participate in closed training. \u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Three-in-one (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai\u2019s hand trembled. The meat on the fork fell into the plate again. He raised his voice due to surprise, \u201cMovie? Movie directed by Director Jiang Guanshan? No\u2026\u2026\u201d \u2018Isn\u2019t it a teleplay? How is that things are completely different than they were in his previous life?\u2019Di Qiuhe looked at the unconsciously open mouth of He Bai and had a deepening smile on his face. He suddenly reached out and forked up the piece of meat that He Bai dropped on the plate and put it into He Bai\u2019s mouth quickly, and then touched the teeth of He Bai by his fork, and said, \u201cYes, movie, so you may not see me for months. Don't miss me too much.\u201dHe Bai leaned back and spat out Di Qiuhe\u2019s fork. His surprise was choked in his throat by the sudden movements of Di Qiuhe, looking quite unpleasant.\u2018Fork\u2026\u2026The fork that he just ate with\u2026\u2026put into my mouth\u2026\u2026saliva exchange\u2026\u2026indirect\u2026\u2026\u2019Di Qiuhe looked at the changing expression of He Bai and took back his fork with good mood. He forked up the last piece of meat in his plate and put it into his mouth slowly and chew carefully. Then, he put down the fork and got a tissue to clean his mouth, and smiled to He Bai gently, \u201cThanks for your steak. It tastes good. I am satisfied.\u201d\u2018\u2026\u2026He ate it. He ate the last meat with the fork which touched my teeth\u2026\u2026\u2019 He Bai\u2019s three views (means world view, value view, and life view) are collapsed, speechless, and he decided he\u2019d better just keep eating.He Bai finished the steak without feeling the taste. He thought that Di Qiuhe would continue to command him to wash plates. Unexpectedly, Di Qiuhe collected the plates of his own will, considerately replacing the red wine that he did not drink for a cup of juice.Clear sound of plate collision and the sound of water came from the kitchen. He Bai raised his hand and pinched himself. He felt what happened today was like a dream, a super big nightmare.The mobile phone rang suddenly. It was WeChat. He came back to his senses and took the phone out from his pocket.A bird born in autumn: I was bullied by my stepmother again.He Bai looked into the kitchen reflexively. Then, he took back his sight after hearing the sound of water stop, and sighed silently. The idol has a stepmother and his fan has have stepmother too. Is it called similarity attraction?A bird born in autumn: I will run away from home.He Bai was shocked, and hurried to comfort her.White and Whiter: Calm down. It is dangerous for girls to stay outside alone.A bird born in autumn: I am sad.White and Whiter: Then\u2026\u2026how about watching some comedy movies for districting attention?A bird born in autumn: That\u2019s a bad idea.White and Whiter: Anyway, you\u2019d better not run away from home, it\u2019s not safe. Does your father know that your stepmother is bullying you?A bird born in autumn: He knows, but he is partial.A bird born in autumn: I still feel sad. Xiaobai, how about you call me Qiuqiu again? I like this name.He Bai hesitated for a moment, and sent a voice message for comfort patiently.There was the cracking sound of plates breaking.He Bai was scared and rushed to the kitchen to check.Di Qiuhe was standing in front of the sink innocently. He was wearing rubber gloves with full of bubbles on it. There were a pile of broken plates around his feet. After seeing He Bai came in, Di Qiuhe turned his head and smiled, \u201cSorry, hand slippery.\u201dHe Bai sighed, pushing him aside and rolling up his sleeves, \u201cLet me wash these. You do not need to pour so much dishwashing liquid. Go and get the broom to clean the floor. Do not pick up the debris with your hands. It will cut your fingers.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201d Di Qiuhe took off the gloves and looked at He Bai\u2019s hand in the sink. He touched his phone which was a little hot in his pants pocket secretly, with eyes twinkling.\u2018My brother is\u2026\u2026 really cute.\u2019After washing the plates, He Bai carried a box of chocolates in his arms, camera bag on his back and computer case in his hand, and then he wasstuffed into the taxi by Di Qiuhe.\u201cSorry, I drank wine, so I cannot drive you home.\u201d Di Qiuhe bent down and looked at He Bai through the car window which was half closed, with gentle smile on his face.\u201cThanks for accompanying me today. That cheered me up. By the way, wish you have good achievement of photography. Your works are great. The new script of director Jiang Guanshan is written based on the character prototype provided by Xu Yinrong. The reason that Xu Yinrong agrees to hire me is because he was touched by the two photos that you retouched. So, thank you.\u201dThe question that He Bai had been wondering for a long time was answered. He looked at the gentle face of Di Qiuhe at this time and suddenly didn't know how to reply to such a gentle Di Qiuhe, too strange.\u201cLiu Huanhuan will soon pay the price.\u201d Di Qiuhe stretched out his hand into the car window and poked the dimple on He Bai\u2019s left cheek. \u201cThere will be a lot of news on the internet later. Don't worry, I will be fine. Come on, smile.\u201dHe Bai came to himself and frowned, and pulled down the hand of Di Qiuhe off the window.\u201cIs this how you treat your creditors?\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows. The unruly expression took place of the gentle one on his face. \u201cRemember, you still owe me RMB 163.78. I will keep the receipt of buying the steak. Do not try to repudiate the debt.\u201dHe Bai searched his wallet and wanted to throw total RMB 132 in his wallet on the face of Di Qiuhe.\u201cSir, go to Q University.\u201d Making a gesture to the driver, Di Qiuhe said that and then took three steps backward to the place where He Bai cannot touch. He raised his hand to adjust the brim of his hat, and smiled, \u201cPuppy, you\u2019ve got a nice ass.\u201dThe car started. He Bai dug his ear and couldn\u2019t believe what he had heard. He poked his head out of the window angrily and shouted at Di Qiuhe who was disappearing slowing in his sight, \u201cRubbish Di, what are you, a three-year-old? I will not return the money. Be mad as you pleased.\u201dThe car took a turn and disappeared. The off-key roar was dissipated in the wind. Di Qiuhe lowered his head and chuckled. He turned around, took out his phone and dialed the number of Di Bian and spoke while walking to the apartment, \u201cDad, sorry. I am afraid I have to leave B city for a while\u2026\u2026\u201dThe explosive news about Di Qiuhe was disclosed on the internet furiously. Firstly, someone disclosed that Di Qiuhe was actually the eldest son of the family of Huangdu, with powerful background. Then, someone disclosed that Di Qiuhe, as a student of Q University, taking advantage of the actor status, did not go to class and got the graduation certificate by pulling strings. Later, Huang Xunzhou, an outdated singer who once formed an acting duel with Di Qiuhe appeared and said that Di Qiuhe had been discriminating and bullying him because of his homosexual identity, Di even suppressed him using his superior identity as the eldest son of the family of Huangdu, and forced him to give up acting career and go to foreign country.One stone makes a thousand waves. People were all stunned.Di Qiuhe was actually the eldest son of the family of Huangdu. His former acting partner was gay. He pretended to be gentle and friendly in front of people. In fact, he was a bully, and shameless guy who got the graduation certificate by pulling strings.The image Di set collapsed seriously. The netizens felt they were cheated and went toWeibo Di Qiuhe\u2019s Weibo to give him a piece of their mind.Two days later, the news that Di Qiuhe being a philander towards the new innocent host and dumped her later by use of his identity as the eldest son of the family of Huangdu was disclosed. The name of Liu Huanhuan appeared on the headline of entertainment section for the first time and she became the object of sympathy from the people on the internet.On that night, Liu Huanhuan sent an ambiguous message on her Weibo whereWeibo she had a fan base of less than ten thousands surging to hundreds of thousands now. She sighed that she encountered bad people in the past and only wanted to work hard and became a stronger and better woman than before.The people on the internet supported her action of not being trapped in the romance world and becoming positive quickly. Their comments for supporting her became the top one hot topic quickly.\u201cBitch.\u201d Niu Junjie turned off the computer and commented with one word coldly.He Bai looked back at him and remembered the words that Liu Huanhuan said on the internet. He Bai understood where Niu came from and started to comfort him, \u201cShe will be doomed sooner or later by making use of the hype maliciously. Do not pay attention to the news anymore. We are going to take the first exam tomorrow. Let\u2019s review lessons.\u201dNiu Junjie looked back at him and suppressed the anger in his heart. He nodded and made a fist, \u201cOk, Let\u2019s study. The most important thing is not to fail exam.\u201dHe Bai leaned and patted him on the shoulder. He turned around to close the website and picked up the books too.They studied for the whole afternoon. At dinner time, the explosive news on the internet raised to a new level.\u201cThat Di Qiuhe who had affair with Liu Huanhuan takes drugs? Oh my god.\u201d Niu Junjie stared in surprise. After he found that the other three roommates were looking at him together, he smiled in embarrassment and lowered his voice, \u201cWell, please keep studying. I will not disturb you again.\u201dWang Hu and Chen Jie went to the library that afternoon. They did not know that He Bai had comforted Niu Junjie about the issue of Liu Huanhuan in the past. When they heard Niu Junjie talking about her at this point, they couldn\u2019t help to comforting him, \u201cBrother, let bygones be bygones. We need to move forward.\u201dChen Jie nodded in agreement, and proposed, \u201cHow about we drink with you after the exam?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no, do not misunderstand, I do not care anymore. I just saw that news by accident, and I couldn\u2019t help but express my feelings.\u201dNiu Junjie explained and raised his arms to the two people for surrender, \u201cI swear, I will not pay any attention to the news anymore. I will not touch my computer. I swear.\u201dWang Hu and Chen Jie barely believed his promise and supervised him to turn off the computer. They stopped looking at Niu Junjie after he picked up the book.The dormitory returned to quiet again. He Bai was a little worried, so he turned on the computer to search the latest news about Di Qiuhe. Then, the words of \u201cDrug Abuse\u201d \u201cLewd Private Life\u201d which were highlighted in red made his brain twitch. He could not help taking out the phone and taking the phone number of Di Qiuhe out from the blacklist to send message.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Three-in-one(3)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai: How are you recently? Is it you who release the news of taking drug? How are you going to end this?Di Qiuhe: Are you missing me?He Bai: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe Bai: Please calm down first. Then we\u2019ll get down to business.He kept a straight face, threw he phone into the drawer, hit the close button hard on the webpage and buried himself in reading.Half hour later, he took the phone out from the drawer and opened the short message page again.He Bai: When are you going to clarify, and then put on an act of sadly cancelling your Weibo accountWeibo?Although he knew that explosive news were fake, maybe some people on the internet who abused Di Qiuhe seriously were arranged by Di Qiuhe himself, he still felt not comfortable and unhappy after he saw the information full of negative energy.Di Qiuhe: Are you feeling sorry for me?He Bai thought he needed to drink some cold water to calm down.Di Qiuhe: Do you ignore me again?Di Qiuhe: Puppy, you are so cruel-hearted.Di Qiuhe: The news will be clarified soon.Di Qiuhe: Check out my WeiboWeibo.He Bai was stunned. He held his mouse, logged into the Weibo and searched the account of Di Qiuhe.It took a while for the page to jump out. On the home page of Di Qiuhe, which had not been updated for several days, a video Weibo appeared on the top.He moved his mouse to click it.\u201cHello, everyone. I am Di Qiuhe, the eldest son of Di Bian who is the President of Huangdu. I was the partner of Huang Xunzhou, former actor of Huangdu.\u201dThe face of Di Qiuhe appeared in the video. The background of the video was the back seat of a car.\u201cI have seen all kinds of news on the internet and I want to make the clarification as below: first of all, during the contract period with Huangdu, I never used the power of my father to do anything. This can be proved by any employee of Huangdu. That is because till now, except some people of top management, most of the employees do not know that I am a son of Di Bian. Secondly, I never discriminated against the gay community or had I bullied my partner. The reason that our acting combination was dissolved and I worked alone at that time was because my partner said that he would go to foreign country and marry his boyfriend and live a quite life without disturbance. This can be proved by my agent at that time. If you think that my agent\u2019s evidence can be false, then I have nothing else to say. Thirdly, I was a student of Department of Economics of Q University. I lived in campus when I was a freshman; and moved out after signing the contract with Huangdu as a sophomore. After then, I began to be absent from class for a long time, but I learned by myself and came back to participate the examination of every semester. I entered into Q University by formal entrance examination and got the graduation certificate fair and square. Welcome to inquire about my academic performance in the office of academic affairs of Q University.\u201dThen, he paused and suddenly smiled.\u201cAs for the drug abuse rumors today, I am on my way to the hospital now, with a notary staff around me. My urine test results will be released by the notary personnel first time it came out. You are welcome to supervise. In addition, the love affair between Miss Liu and I is also nonsense. She was the ex-girlfriend of the roommates of one of my alumni in lower grade, and now the girlfriend of Du Hao who is the host of B city. I have nothing to do with her. \u201dHe spoke his viewpoints one by one, coherent, well organized, neither too fast nor too slow. That was indeed the grace of one elegant gentleman. It put an end to the rumors that he was in fact a bully.The car stopped and the video shot wobbled.\u201cI have arrived at the hospital.\u201d Di Qiuhe took a look outside and the smile on his face became faint and his expression was colored with a touch of loneliness, \u201cGossip is a fearful thing. A repeated slander makes other believe. Hereby, I want to make solemn statement, my father Di Bian is not a person who use public source for personal purpose. He is an excellent enterprise manager. It is ok to stigmatize me, but please do not question the responsibility and moral quality of my father as the highest ruler of the Huangdu. Furthermore, I have terminated my contract with Huangdu one month ago. Please do not misunderstand Huangdu because of me. Finally, my Weibo account will be canceled ten minutes later. Thanks to the fans that always accompany and encourage me. Bye.\u201dThe video was over and the dormitory was so quiet as if you can hear the falling needle.Niu Junjie got close to He Bai unknowingly, and asked carefully, \u201cThe roommate of his alumni of lower grade as mentioned by Di Qiuhe\u2026\u2026is it me? Who is this alumni that he was talking about? \u201dWang Hu sighed, \u201cIt is true that gossip is a fearful thing. Di Qiuhe speaks with reason and evidence, neither too fast nor too slow. We can see that he is a man with good temper. The people who scolded him on the internet went too far.\u201dChen Jie pushed his glasses and there was an iPad on his hand suddenly. He shook his head, \u201cNo wonder that he is so frustrated that he cancelled Weibo. I heard that some extreme netizens found his residence, put dead mice, poured the paint and stuck curse at his door.\u201dNiu Junjie was left speechless, \u201cThey are not sworn enemies, are they? It\u2019s awful.\u201dHe Bai felt uneasy after he heard that. He picked up his phone and called Di Qiuhe.The call could get through, but no one answered. Then, a short message was sent to his phone.Di Qiuhe: Don\u2019t worry. I am fine, my well-behaved brother.Niu Junjie saw the message by accident. He was panicked suddenly, \u201cDid I misread it? Di Qiuhe? Is he texting you? He calls you brother?\u201dWang Hu and Chen Jie came over and looked at He Bai wickedly.He Bai was stiff and said simply, \u201cI can explain.\u201dThree people moved the chairs and sat down with tacit understanding, and circled He Bai in the middle.He Bai twitched the corner of his mouth, looked at the three people and tried to explain the acquaintance process with Di Qiuhe as short as possible.\u201cIt is destiny.\u201d Niu Junjie sighed after he heard the explanation.\u201cIt looks like Di Qiuhe is really a good person. The bad rumors on the internet are all slanders\u2026\u2026Xiaobai, please try your best to comfort him, alas.\u201dWang Hu patted on his shoulder, and felt sad.Chen Jie pushed his glasses, \u201cHe was the person who sent the birthday cake to Xiaobai. He is really a good person and considerate. Xiaobai, don't be ungrateful. He is now at the bottom of his life, in a difficult situation. You, as his friend, remember to comfort him.\u201dNiu Junjie and Wang Hu nodded in agreement.He Bai: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Why my roommates react like this? Good person? Isn\u2019t he a childish person? Are they blind?\u201cBy the way, since he has already terminated the contract with Huangdu, it is not necessary for him to get the approval from the company to accept advertisement contract, right?\u201d Niu Junjie jumped suddenly, and took out his phone happily, \u201cHe helped me to expose the true personality of Liu Huanhuan on the internet, help me to revenge. I must thank him. My father is looking for a spokesperson for the new light luxury watch series just released. I have decided. We will hire him.\u201dHe Bai looked at him with disbelief, \u201cAre you going to sign him as a spokesman? The watches of your family always hire A-list movie king or movie queen to be the spokesman.\u201d\u201cOh, we need to change the taste once in a while. His appearance and temperament are quite suitable for my family\u2019s new series of watches.\u201d Niu Junjie waved his hand carelessly and called his father. He walked to the balcony and said excitedly, \u201cDad, you need to help my benefactor. Do you remember Liu Huanhuan that I mentioned to you before? Someone has avenged me. We need to thank him\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, Junjie\u201d He Bai stood up agape.\u201cI think he is right. As a man, a favor of drop of water received shall be repaid with a surging spring.\u201d Wang Hu held his shoulder and pushed him back into the seat with a serious face, \u201cYour task now is to comfort Di Qiuhe. He must be sad now. Since he is not answering his phone, then you shall send short messages to comfort him.\u201dChen Jie held the other shoulder of He Bai and nodded with a solemn face, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It is really terrible for getting dead mice in the front gate at home. You must comfort him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d What\u2019s wrong with the people in the dormitory?On the other side, Di Qiuhe said goodbye to the notary personnel after leaving the hospital. He came to an upscale club and opened the door of a room at the highest floor by the password card.\u201cQiuhe.\u201d Di Bian stood up and walked towards Di Qiuhe. He hugged Di Qiuhe, \u201cI am sorry to put you to such trouble. It is my fault.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d Di Qiuhe embraced Di Bian too, with full of son\u2019s attachment to the father on his face, \u201cI did not expect that Aunt Qin would turn to such extreme measures this time. Before I saw the evidences, I even doubted that someone slandered Aunt Qin. I did not expect\u2026\u2026Dad, I\u2019d rather believe all these are misunderstanding.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Three-in-one(4)Translator: Sissy That WalkThere was a somber look lingering on Di Bian's face. He patted Di Qiuhe's shoulder, loosed Di Qiuhe and led him to the sofa, and sighed, \"I did not expect this either\u2026\u2026It is my fault that I brought such a threat to the Empire. If it is a misunderstanding, it's all right, but if it is not\u2026\u2026Qiuhe, I need your help.\"Di Qiuhe looked at Di Bian putting on a look of kind father, he sneered in his heart, but showed admiration on his face, \"Go ahead, as long as I can help, I will do my best.\"Di Bian looked at him with a moving face and sighed, \"You are still as sensible as you were little, like your mother\u2026\u2026Now, the board of directors of Empire is mostly controlled by the Qin family. I can do nothing about the things you are stigmatized even I want to help you. But you can rest assured that when those activities of espionage in the board of directors are pulled out, I will help you to revenge.\"\"Thanks, Dad.\" Di Qiuhe's got somewhat discomposed with his eyes turning red, and then asked, \"You come out to see me today, what did Aunt Qin say? By the way, Chunhua did not feel well suddenly when I left home last time, is she getting better now? Xiasong studies abroad, does everything go well with him? Did my bad rumors influence them?\"Di Bian looked at him helplessly, \"Kid, you are in trouble now, yet you still care about them. Don't worry. No one knows that I come to see you. Qiuhe, are you really going to leave B city?\"Di Qiuhe nodded and made a forced smile, \"That's the best solution. The information that I am your son has spread out. Any of my bad rumors may affect you, and further affect Huangdu. It is not what I want to see. Uncle Jiang has a movie and he asks me to be the hero. I have good relationship with Xiuwen, so I cannot refuse. It is good for me to shoot a movie and avoid the current trouble as well.\"These words were really what Di Bian cared. Recently, Huangdu was turbulent due to the exposure of Di Qiuhe's identity. Furthermore, Qin family made more trouble in the company. Di Bian could hardly cope with all these troubles. If Di Qiuhe chose to leave of his own accord at this time, it was no doubt the best solution to stabilize the current situation.\"I feel sorry for you. Now, you do not have the support from the company, you must find it inconvenient when you shoot film outside. I will arrange two assistants for you. Then, it will be easier for you.\" Di Bian resorted to \"carrot policy\", and then spoke to the main topic, \"Now, Chunhua and Xiasong have grown up. Your Aunt Qin is more ambitious under the brainwash of Qin family. She does not think deeply. Huangdu will belong to Chunhua, Xiasong and you in future anyway. Meanwhile, you are not a person with aggressive personality. Except for disappointing the members of our family, what she can get by doing this?\"Di Qiuhe stepped forward anxiously, \"Dad, don't be sad. Aunt Qin is just muddleheaded temporarily. She must be tempted and cheated by the Qin family to pay marketing account to slander me and play a dirty trick in my apartment. After I am gone, she will be fine.\"\"If only it were as easy as you say.\" Di Bian sighed and turned around to get a few documents in his briefcase and put them in front of Di Qiuhe. He paused and said, \"Qiuhe, as you know, Huangdu is no longer the place that I can control by myself alone. I am powerless, and sad\u2026\u2026There are some proposals. You can take it and study. When you are outside, if there is an opportunity to help Dad to get back some shares of the company, please try\u2026... Do you understand what I'm saying?\"A thought came to Di Qiuhe, but he showed an incredulous look, and said sadly, \"We are family, do we really need to go this far?\"Di Bian put up his hand and wiped his face, with a face full of decadence, \"I do not want to do this too, but your Aunt Qin is muddleheaded, and the Qin family is\u2026\u2026it is ok if the company does not exist, but how about you? Chunhua and Xiasong still have half of Qin family's blood. Your Aunt Qin will protect them, how about you? Dad only wants to leave something to you after I die. You, please do not blame me. I let you down these years. It is ok if you do not want to help. I am still in good health. I can help you to keep some\u2026\u2026\"\"Dad!\" Di Qiuhe stopped Di Bian, closed his eyes and put the documents away, \"Don't say that. I will help. You can rest assured that I will try my best to finish what you have assigned.\"\"Good boy.\" Di Bian looked at Di Qiuhe with relief and finally smiled, he picked up the menu on the table and said, \"You have not had dinner yet, right? Come on, the dishes here are great. You would like it.\"Di Qiuhe smiled too, and put the documents into his backpack, with a trace of ridicule in his eyes. It was an ugly thing for a husband and wife to be suspicious of each other like this. If Qin Li knew that his husband who she thought was completely convinced was actually calculating Qin family secretly behind her back, wouldn't she flare up and be anxious to kill Di Bian?Di Qiuhe's Weibo was canceled amid the worries of his fans and the skepticism of netizens. Some marketing accounts with quick action had screenshot the last Weibo messages that he sent out. A more subtle action for clarifying his innocent was under way quietly.I love to gossip and I am proud: I find a strange thing. Di Qiuhe, as the eldest son of the family of Huangdu, was not supported at all during the first year of his career. His resources were much worse than those of his peers, even worse than his partner, Huang Xunzhou. Huangdu did not take any action for his bad rumor this time. It looked like Huangdu was acting like a looker-on. The people who said Di Qiuhe was a bully, do you feel shame?Secondary account for disclosure: That means, as the saying goes, once you have a stepmother, you have a stepfather at the same time. After the stepmother talks on the bed, the gentle, cultivated and graceful eldest son is reduced to a bully. The four people of Di family live in a villa, while the eldest son lives in an apartment alone. What a poor man.Insider: There is big news for the contract termination between Di Qiuhe and the Empire. However, I do not want to mention it today. I want to analyze whether the bad rumor of Di Qiuhe is true or not, whether we can believe the saying of Di Qiuhe. [Link to full article]The analysis articles emerged endlessly. While analyzing, the netizens found something wrong.First of all, the girl who was taken as Di Qiuhe's girlfriend did not have any relation with Di Qiuhe at all. Furthermore, that girl was an attention whore who liked to show off. Her program was cancelled by B city television station due to her fault. The reason was that she cheated her ex-boyfriend who was the son of a big advertising company, and had an affair with Du Hao, a host of the television station. Secondly, the moral quality of Di Qiuhe was out of question. All the people who had worked with him in entertainment circle had praised him. There were a lot of people in the entertainment circle spoke for him at the beginning of the bad rumor. However, due to the strong public opinion at that time, the netizens directly ignored the comments which supported Di Qiuhe. Thirdly, a student of Q University checked Di Qiuhe's academic performance. All his academic scores were above 90 points, quite outstanding performance. In the column of university admission score, his score was close to the full score, which made the people who questioned him for entering the university by pulling strings speechless. Finally, taking drugs? It did not exist. The urine test results were disclosed. The neutral notary office witnessed the whole process. It was impossible to tamper with the result.Once the major bad rumors were clarified, some pieces of information were disclosed slowly.For example, Huang Xunzhou was a person with moral quality problem and promiscuous private life. He might be paid for releasing bad rumors of Di Qiuhe for this time. The employee of the television station disclosed that Di Qiuhe had terminated the contract with Huangdu before the bad rumor was released. The reason for contract termination was that Di Qiuhe was not supported by the company for resources. Thus, the bad rumor that Di Qiuhe used his identity as the eldest son to bully other people was nonsense. He was of little importance in the company. Some irrational netizens found Di Qiuhe's house, they went so far as to put dead mouse in front of his door and pour the paint and curse Di Qiuhe\u2026\u2026They acted over the line.The netizens were angry, then felt shamed, and then they wanted to apologize. Finally, they regretted after they found that Di Qiuhe had canceled his Weibo due to the bad rumor, and could not understand why they cursed such a hardworking and low profile young man at the beginning, acting like they were blindfolded.The direction of public opinion was completely turned at this point. The topics of asking Di Qiuhe back ranked the hot topic quickly and lasted for a long time.After turning off the Weibo, He Bai put away his phone numbly and saw Di Qiuhe who was walking towards him, strutting his long legs.\"You are chasing me to the airport. Puppy, are you reluctant to let me leave? \" Di Qiuhe sat opposite to him, held up his chin by his hand and looked at He Bai with a smile.He Bai did not want to answer him, he took a document out from his bag and tapped on the table for attention, \"Here you are. Remember to call the person after you read it. You refused to answer all the unknown calls recently, and the person has no choice but ask me to come. \"Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows, opened the document to see, and surprised, \"Endorsement contract? Buffalo Watch wants to hire me as spokesman?\"He Bai nodded, taking a bag of coins in his bag, and pushed in front of him, \"Here you are. RMB 164, I return RMB 0.22 more to you. Do not need to thank me for my generosity. You are welcome.\"The sound of coin rubbing was very clear and pleasant. Di Qiuhe put down the document and squinted at He Bai, \"Puppy.\"He Bai looked at Di Qiuhe without any expression on his face, and corrected Di Qiuhe, \"Please call me He Bai, thank you.\"\"Oh, Xiaobai.\" Di Qiuhe answered perfunctorily. Then, he calculated the coins in the bag, got close to He Bai and blew in He Bai's ear, \"Are you worried about me? You know I am leaving, so you come here to give me money?\"Warm breath went along the cochlea of He Bai. He Bai gave a shudder and then retched.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: A Nagging Housewife(1)Translator: Sissy That WalkHaving retched for a while, He Bai hurriedly rubbed his ears and took tissues out from the camera bag to cover his mouth and nose. He stared at Di Qiuhe, with his voice lowered, \"Have a good trip. I'm leaving.\" said He Bai when he was ready to go.Di Qiuhe frowned, pressed He Bai's shoulder to make him sit down and touched his forehead.It felt a little warm but with no fever.\"Have you got a cold?\" Diu Qiuhe sized He Bai up to find that he didn't look well. With his lips darker in color, the guy seemed washed-out.He Bai shook his hand off and leaned backward to keep a distance with Diu Qiuhe, \"Stay away from me, or you'll be infected. I caught the influenza from my classmates.\" Moreover, he behaved in a strange way when catching a cold-neither sneezing nor running at the nose like anyone else. Instead, he would only shudder and retch from time to time, which made him very uncomfortable.Hearing He Bai's hoarse whisper, Diu Qiuhe cast a glance at the contract at hand when his brain was teeming with a whole tangle of emotions all of the sudden. He did not sit away from He Bai as he said but moved much closer, asking, \"Are you taking exams these days? Sending this over must hinder your revision, doesn't it?\"\"You held me up many times. Fortunately, it's only half a day.\" He Bai reached out his hand to push Diu Qiuhe back and patted him on the shoulder, \"Don't get too close. Work hard with the shooting. Plus, I prophesied that luck would be on your side in six months when I observed the heavenly bodies last night. Remember to go back to B City at that time. There may be a surprise waiting for you.\" Despite a slight discrepancy between Di Qiuhe's present life and his incarnation, the general trend remained the same. Immortal Way, as a hit fantasy TV drama, had received popularity among the old, the middle-aged and the young in his previous life, by which Di Qiuhe became an idol of countless audiences. Therefore, He Bai hoped Di Qiuhe wouldn't miss this opportunity due to his rebirth.A scowl emerged on Di Qiuhe's face. Giving He Bai a glare, he gestured towards a man and a woman sitting not far away from them.\"Who are they?\" Seeing the two people come closer, He Bai felt a little strange. They were now in the coffee shop of the airport, and before this he saw Di Qiuhe come alone and thought he must rush here by himself, little did he expect that there were another two keeping him company.\"They're assistants my dad assigned me, whose task is to supervise me, and meanwhile, come to my aid if necessary.\" Di Qiuhe replied in an indifferent way and then put on a gentle look when the two came over, \"This guy who came to see me off at the airport had a cold. Please go to the medical room to fetch him some medicine. Also, buy a cup of hot water for him.\"He Bai hastened to stop him, \"Please don't. I'll take medicine when I'm back to campus. If I take it now, I'll definitely doze off in a while. Just give me a cup of hot water, please.\" Meanwhile, he pushed the coffee undrunk towards the direction of Di Qiuhe, \"It's untouched. Don't let the coffee go to waste. Have it.\" The coffee at the airport was sold at an extraordinarily high price. He Bai couldn't have ordered it but for fearing that he would be kicked out.\"It doesn't matter. I'll hail a cab for you when you feel sleepy.\" Di Qiuhe took his coffee naturally and reached for his camera bag, \"Where're your cold pills? Take one, in case you have a fever.\"He Bai gripped his camera bag firmly to prevent him from touching it, \"Leave it to me. What's your boarding time? Be careful not to miss the plane.\"The two assistants standing by his side tried to speak when Di Qiuhe turned his head and threw a glance at them. In spite of the smile on his face, he looked at them with a frigid stare and ordered peremptorily, \"An, could you please fetch me a cup of hot water? And Wang, please hail a taxi for me.\"The two people were shocked by his action. They exchanged glances and were astonished at the imposing manner the gentle and amiable young master displayed at this moment. Thinking of their boss's order, the two restrained their surprise, responded to his demand in a respectful way and followed his instructions separately.When they left, He Bai reached his hand out to turn Di Qiuhe's head thus to talk to him face to face, frowned and said, \"Be careful in case your image is spoiled. Have you forgotten how netizens scold you before? Besides, are these two assistants designed to help your father monitor your activity? Is he really your dad?\"The hand patting him on the face felt cool and comfortable. Di Qiuhe turned back to look at him, and his attempt to disguise his look failed. Raising his eyebrows, he smiled, \"Such kind of father is everywhere. Are you worried about me? How about joining the training with me? See it like a summer internship, and I'll pay you. How about that ?\"\"Not good.\" He Bai rolled his eyes at Di Qiuhe, took his hand back and spoke in a serious manner, \"Take care when you were trained on the border. Don't go out alone. The public order is poor in the area.\"Di Qiuhe beamed with pleasure and couldn't help poking him in the dimple, \"You're so sweet. Give me a smile, please.\"He Bai pulled Di's hand away from his cheek angrily, pointing to the coffee, \"Drink it, and then shut up. I have a headache. I don't want to banter with you.\"Di Qiuhe rubbed the finger which touched He Bai's dimple just now and kept quiet for two minutes. After Assistant An sent the hot water over, he took a candy out of his pocket as if by magic and said coaxingly, \"Take the medicine, good boy, and you'll get a candy.\"He Bai kicked him under the table, took the pill quickly, consulted his watch and wondered, \"You've been dawdling here for so long. Is it really okay? When does the plane take off?\"\"All right. It's quite early. You see, my assistants look so calm.\" Di Qiuhe gave an equivocal reply. Glancing at He Bai's lips that seemed a little redder after drinking the water, Di Qiuhe asked reluctantly, \"Do you have an exam this afternoon? Are you leaving now?\"\"Yeah. I'm going to take the exam of a specialized course in the afternoon.\" He Bai seized the opportunity and said goodbye to him decisively, \"Enjoy your trip. I'll go.\"Just then Assistant Wang pushed the door open and entered. Di Qiuhe bit his tongue, gulped the coffee down and picked up the contract and coins from the table, smiling at him, \"Let's go. I'll see you off.\"Watching his taxi disappear from view into the traffic flow, Di Qiuhe fiddled with the old shopping bag that held coins and looked reserved.\"Sir, we missed the flight. We...\"\"Transfer to another flight.\" Di Qiuhe turned his head to look at the assistant and put on an anxious look, \"Poor guy, he went alone to B City to pursue his studies... When I was vilified, he had been comforting me. Today he specially came over to see me off... What a kind boy.\"Seeing the way Di Qiuhe holding the shabby shopping bag as if it were a treasure, the two assistants looked at each other, and their suspicion was gradually allayed. Their younger master was indeed a good-hearted and gentle person as others said. It might be a mere illusion that he had an aura of domineering.After sailing through the final exams, Wang Hu and Chen Jie, who came from other districts, returned home immediately. Niu Junjie tried to take He Bai to his yacht but failed, also going home on He Bai's advice.As summer vacation began, the dormitories became empty gradually. This day, He Bai got up at 6:30 am and stood in a trance when brushing his teeth.'There's no need to attend class or review lessons.' As to Saint Elephant Company, he had applied for leave before the final exams began, so he didn't have to go there for the time being. Due to the summer vacation, Teacher Xu Yinrong set him no more homework, and Di Qiuhe who emerged from time to time to make fun of him left for the border ... Emptiness overwhelmed him. He Bai felt completely at a loss.In the mirror reflected a young face, which made him feel strange for he hadn't seen it for a long time.Who was I? Where I came from? Which destination I would get to?The inquiries deep in his soul crossed his mind and rang in his ears, and then they were interrupted by the sudden beep of WeChat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: A Nagging Housewife(2)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe spat the toothpaste foam and washed his face with cold water.Picking up the phone on the desk, he clicked on WeChat messages to find the buyer who hadn't contacted him for a long while suddenly appeared.A Bird Born in Autumn: I'm boiling with anger, Bai. Recently I have made the acquaintance of two people. Both of them are nice, but I didn't expect that one of them actually took orders from my step mother! She made friends with me on purpose!A Bird Born in Autumn: I was fooled. I want to kill myself. I wanna die.He Bai frowned at the message and heaved a sigh. He almost forgot that the neurotic fan was still on his WeChat friends list although his idol, who was as insane as him, had gone.White and Whiter: How about I photoshop several your idol's pictures for you?A Bird Born in Autumn: Not enough. I want him to use Weibo again.White and Whiter: Maybe not gonna happen for a while... How about changing an idol?A Bird Born in Autumn: You should encourage me to have a new sweetheart? You've gone too far! Could you say this on your conscience?White and Whiter: ...A Bird Born in Autumn: Bai, I'm so sad.Giving his face a rub, He Bai had no choice but to continue to type.White and Whiter: Just tell me what you want. I'll try my best to satisfy your needs.A Bird Born in Autumn: I want a vocal message: Good night, and xoxo. At the beginning of the message, please call me 'dear autumn'. I'll set it as my ringtone to serenade me to sleep at night.A wry smile lifted the corners of He Bai's mouth. All that he wanted to do was to sham death, while his conscience drove him to type.White and Whiter: It's quite difficult. Your idol has gone to another city recently. I have no way to contact him.A Bird Born in Autumn: I don't want his voice but yours. Leave such a message to me, please. I know you are the best, xoxo.White and Whiter: ...A Bird Born in Autumn: I'm sad! I wanna die! I'm going to kill myself!He Bai also felt a deep pang of 'sorrow', and almost failed to restrain himself from throwing the mobile phone out. It's only several weeks since they discontinued the contact. How come the buyer went so crazy...?A Bird Born in Autumn: Are you angry with me, Bai?A Bird Born in Autumn: Dear Bai [Crying]He Bai's shoulders drooped. Despite the shyness, he sent a message over: Dear Autumn, good night. Kiss you.\"A Bird Born in Autumn: Thank you, Bai^-^. Would you mind sending me a second one to say good morning?He Bai pretended that he was offline, while the buyer began to bombard him with words like 'killing myself'. He had no alternative but to compromise on his request and sent a good morning message over.A Bird Born in Autumn: How about sending me a GOOD AFTERNOON\u2026?He Bai logged out his WeChat immediately and took a deep breath. 'One thing is for sure; all the fans must have the same character with their idols.' The buyer's imprudent attitude and insatiable demand were absolutely learned from Di Qiuhe!The phone rang suddenly. He Bai looked down at the screen. With his brow furrowed, he picked up the phone and roared, \"You are presenting a gentle and considerate public image, aren't you? But why does your fan act so shamelessly? Have your true colors revealed?\" A chuckle was heard from the earpiece. It seemed a bit strange under the influence of long distance and current flow.\"Little puppy, the training wore me out. I am thinner and tanner.\"He Bai managed to calm his irritation at the buyer and frowned, \"What training have you received? How come your voice becomes so hoarse?\"\"A variety of physical training, boxing, fire opening... Besides, we set off on a long march on foot these days. Been dehydrated, I had a sore throat. My voice must be unpleasant to the ear, isn't it? Will you dislike it?\"Even-toned, he spoke in a slightly hoarse voice, poor but sexy.He Bai moved the mobile phone to the other side and gave an insincere reply, \"Yes, I will. You're as hoarse as a crow. I hear that you've received enclosed training, but why are you able to use the cell phone?\"\"Today a few martial arts coaches arrived, so the team head gave me a holiday.\" Di Qiuhe coughed, with his voice hoarser, \"We have to treat those coaches to a dinner in a while. There's no more time for me to use the phone. Please be patient. By the way, I have sent you something by mail. This time I attached your number to it. It's delivered express and will arrive tomorrow. Don't forget to sigh for it.\"Neither bantering nor annoying him intentionally, such a Di Qiuhe seemed really strange and threw He Bai at a loss for words. He had nothing to say but utterances of solicitude, \"Thank you... You'd better stop talking and drink some honey water if you have a throat ache. Don't have spicy food. Remember to get some rest.\"\"Ok.\" Di Qiuhe really stopped speaking as He Bai said.There was awkward silence between them. The dorm was so quiet that He Bai could even hear the sound of Di Qiuhe's breath.He Bai cleared his throat and forced a few words, \"How long will the training take?\" Thinking of Di Qiuhe's throat, he added, \"Don't\u2026 don't talk. We put the phone down and chat with texts. Go fetch yourself a glass of honey water and drink it.\"Di Qiuhe burst into laughter over the phone.\"Why are you laughing?\"Beep-Di Qiuhe hung up the phone and sent He Bai a text.Di Qiuhe: You sound like a nagging housewife just now.He Bai raised his eyebrow.Di Qiuhe: So cute.He Bai pressed the keyboard hard, ready to tell him off to vent his anger.Di Qiuhe: There will be one of my seniors asking you to take birthday photograph of his granddaughter in a few days. He's not a liar. You can accept the job. The man has considerable resources in hand, which will be beneficial for your further development.Di Qiuhe: Saint Elephant is indeed a good platform, but its boss is devoid of moral quality. You can work there on a part-time basis, but you must think carefully before you become a regular worker.Di Qiuhe: Don't miss me too much. My phone will be turned off. I promise to bring you specialty when I go back to B City.He Bai's typing slowed down. Having deleting the spur-of-the-moment words, he looked grim-faced in a flash and continued typing.He Bai: I got it. Thank you. Take care not to get hurt over there.After a while, there was still no reply. He Bai tried to dial Di's number, only to find his phone shut down. He put the mobile down and heaved a sigh after a silence. It's not easy for him to get a break while he only called He Bai, who was bound to him by no ties. Presumably, he had nobody to contact. After all, none of his families were kind people ... Alas.The next day, a tightly wrapped box was delivered to He Bai's dormitory. He opened it and was taken aback by piles of tropical fruits inside. Di Qiuhe was really... How could he finish them off by himself on the premise that his roommate returned home all.On the weekend, Jiang Xiuwen lounged in the rest area with no neurotic friends to bother him. Browsing through the refined pictures his subordinates sent over, he drank iced coffee in a cross-legged posture.There occurred a loud knock at the door, and the new front-desk receptionist craned her neck inside, speaking hesitantly, \"Boss, a young man called He Bai comes and tells us he is here to see\u2026 see\u2026There was a pocket of fruits in his hand.\"Jiang Xiuwen rocked the coffee cup gently and asked in a good mood, \"See what? Don't ham and haw. As a front-desk receptionist, you must be able to put thoughts into clear speech. Come on, don't be afraid. Speak it loud.\"The girl darted a careful glance at him and made up her mind to cry out in a high voice, \"He said\u2026 He said he had a few things to talk with Miss Jiang Xiuwen!\"Yikea!The coffee Jiang Xiuwen had drunk spurted from his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Resignation(1)Translator: Sissy That WalkLike the Saint Elephant, the Red Guest Studio was also a three-story building erected along the street. From the outside, they looked similar in size, but their insides looked very different. Compared with the grandeur of the Saint Elephant, the decoration of the Red Guest was much cozier. Although both were duplex hall, the Red Guest divided its hall into separate areas by soft partition. The environment there was also more laid-back with fewer staff compared to the Saint Elephant.\u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d After putting the tea and the snack in front of He Bai, the long-haired slim receptionist pointed at the magazine rack next to the seat in the rest area, and said, \u201cI\u2019ve sent one of my colleagues for the boss. Please wait a moment. There are magazines and some excellent works of our company. Please feel free to have a look.\u201dHe Bai was growing to like the Red Guest because of this considerate reception. He thanked her hospitality with a smile and asked, \u201cIs Ms. Jiang Xiuwen the boss of this company?\u201d The buyer once said she just graduated and that she was an intern\u2026 but this Red Guest \u2026The receptionist froze for a second, but she quickly covered it and nodded, all the while holding back her desire to laugh, \u201cYes. Our boss is Jiang Xiuwen. Well \u2026. Please wait a moment. Let me bring you some new snacks.\u201d After finishing that, she took away the tea tray and walked away quickly with a hand covering her blushing face.\u2018She is really the boss. And... New snacks?\u2019He Bai curiously swept a look at the tea and the snack which were served together on the table. His fondness for the Red Guest kept growing more. The nice reception here dwarfed that of the Saint Elephant.After putting the fruit on the table, he took out his mobile phone to log into the WeChat. When he found no reply from the buyer to whom he sent a message in the morning, he was a little agitated.\u2018Is it rude for me to come here without informing her in advance?\u2019 But there were way too many fruits. He had given away some to the Saint Elephant and Elder Xu and still he got enough fruits to fill half of the box. Those fruits couldn\u2019t last long as they rot easily, and he didn\u2019t like wasting things. When he was reminded of the buyer who wanted to commit suicide several days ago, he thought maybe he could pay a visit with some fruits.But his trip here was not in vain. He never thought that such a noising and childish WeChat friend could be a studio owner. Of all the information revealed by the buyer before, who knew how much were real and how much were false? Was it also false that the stepmother\u2019s bullied her into committing suicide? Was it all just staged for the merchandise of her idol?Thinking of how he was preparing to make the buyer come around when he saw her, he couldn\u2019t help but frown and swept a glance at the fruit on the table with a sigh. Then he leaned over to take a photo gallery out of the rack next to him.\u2018Well, I\u2019m already here. If the buyer is full of shit, I will simply ignore her going forward.\u201dJiang Xiuwen was anxiously waiting for Di\u2019s replies in the lounge upstairs. The air conditioner was operating at full capacity, but his forehead kept sweating.\"Damn it. Why is his phone always off!\"He canceled the call and raised his hands to scratch his head. Again, he regretted making friends with Di that year.\u2018What should I do now?\u2019 He knew a little about Di Qiuhe using a backup account to approach his fans, but he didn\u2019t know how. Now there was someone coming for him, but he couldn\u2019t get in touch with Di Qiuhe. Was this whole thing going to fall through?Thinking about Di\u2019s smirking face when talking about the \u2018younger brother\u2019, he rubbed his temples in desperation and gritted his teeth. After tidying himself up, he went downstairs.Seeing as how things were at the moment, he had to play it by ear. First things first, the priority was to stabilize this fan! Di Qiuhe\u2019s disguise mustn\u2019t be exposed here, or else the Red Guest would be demolished by the fan!Jiang Xiuwen halted his steps after spotting a young, slim man sitting in the lounge from a distance. After taking over the snacks from the receptionist, he waved her off. Then he adjusted his facial expression and stepped forward.\"Sorry to keep you waiting.\" He put the snacks in front of the young man and smiled at him as He Bai looked up. Then he reached out to He Bai. \"Nice to meet you. I am Jiang Xiuwen, the owner of the Red Guest Studio.\"Bump.The photo gallery dropped from He Bai\u2019s hands.\u201cAh, sorry.\u201d Immediately he bent down to pick up the album. He was still a bit stunned when he shook hands with Jiang Xiuwen. \u201cNice to meet you, too. I\u2019m He Bai. WeChat ID: White and Whiter\u2026. Are you A Bird Born in Autumn?\u201d \u2018It\u2019s a man! Or it\u2019s a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body! So, all he said was completely made up? Have I been cheated all the time? This man looks quite decent. Who would have thought that he is a fan of Di Qiuhe\u2019s\uff1fAnd he even chatted with him in that girlish way.Too many thoughts were running through his mind, and a sense of being cheated was growing ever stronger. He took back his hand and quickly put on a friendly face. He then said politely, \u201cSorry. I\u2019m just a bit surprised. I thought you were \u2026. Well, sorry. I should have informed you in advance before I came. There are some fruits sent by my friends from the border province. I thought you were not in good mood, so \u2026. Sorry, I have been thinking too much. Just want to make sure you are OK.\u2018What a tone. Damn it!\u2019Noticing his change in attitude, Jiang Xiuwen got alarmed. Immediately he wore an intimate smile and said, \u201cNo, Mr. He, you are mistaken. The buyer \u2018A Bird Born in Autumn\u2019 who bought things from you was my cousin. As she is abroad, it isn\u2019t convenient for her to collect and send delivery, so she filled in my address when she was shopping online. I usually repost those things to her after I receive them.\u201d \u2018Yes, like this, calm down. It\u2019s the cousin who bought the things and now she is abroad, so she couldn\u2019t receive the delivery in person, nor can she come out to meet him. This is a flawless excuse.\u2019He Bai froze a bit and the feeling of being deceived suddenly disappeared. He asked in surprise, \u201cYour cousin? Abroad? But didn\u2019t she just graduate and work as an intern? Is it a foreign internship?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes,\u201d Jiang Xiuwen nodded. After he seated He Bai down, he explained, \u201cMy aunt wanted a broader career prospect, so she arranged a foreign internship for her. Actually, she didn\u2019t go far. She has her internship in Country R, which is right next to us. It\u2019s only one-hour time lag from us.\u201d \u2018Keep it up. Keep making it up. Now the issue of time difference is also solved. Good job!\u2019He Bai sat down, looking more surprised. \u201cArranged by your aunt? Well... If your cousin feels safe enough to trust you with her deliveries, she must have trusted you very much. Honestly speaking, your cousin recently revealed her dislike towards her stepmother to me on WeChat and she seemed convinced that her stepmother was sending someone to get close to her. I thought she was close to losing it, and so I decided to come here with the fruits to check up on her. I want to make sure she is OK. You are her cousin and she trusts you very much. So, how is she? Is she alright?\u201d The feeling of being deceived had completely gone, instead he was now worried about her. He doesn\u2019t feel odd any more after hearing the explanation. It was no wonder that the buyer always confided in him even though they had traded only once. It was because she was sent abroad by her stepmother, and there was no one she could talk with\u2026\u2026 What a poor girl.After hearing those words, Jiang Xiuwen\u2019s face twitched. He couldn\u2019t help but curse Childish Di three hundred times over. How could the bastard say those words to others? How was he supposed to further spin this story?\"Actually, she is fine... Thank you for your concern. I will have a talk with her.\" Crossing his legs, he clenched the tablecloth under the table. Then he looked up at He Bai with a reluctant smile and sighed, \u201cGirls are sensitive. They rather remain silent than sharing with their elder brothers. Thank you for chatting with her. She always put on a brave face in front of me. I didn\u2019t know that... Mind if I ask what else she has told you? Sorry, I don't mean to pry. I am just a bit worried...Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Resignation (2)Translator: Sissy That Walk\"Not at all. I can understand. She has got a brother who cares for her, so maybe it\u2019s not all that bad for her.\" He Bai was a little embarrassed. After putting on a nice face, he took some time to organized what he was going to say next. He talked with Jiang Xiuwen over some minor topics and then he focused on the buyer\u2019s plan to run away from home.Jiang Xiuwen was getting more shocked. Cursing Di Qiuhe was not enough for Jiang Xiuwen, he wanted to kill him! What kind of bullshit had he been sharing with others? Thank God. If he hadn\u2019t asked in advance, the lie would have been exposed already!\u201cI know about her plan to run away,\u201d he sighed, shaking his head. He was getting better at this now. \u201cShe was sad at that time. My aunt would like her to settle abroad and never come back, but my cousin didn\u2019t like it. That\u2019s why they quarreled. My uncle never cared about this. The elders in my family had already scolded him.\u201dHe Bai frowned, and he felt sorry for that. He never expected that the buyer was in a much worse family environment than he previously imagined. All this time the buyer had been pretending to be lively when they were chatting. She must have been really depressed.Noticing his silence, Jiang Xiuwen held back his desire to ask about the condition of his \u2018cousin\u2019 and pretended to be depressed for a while. Then he changed the topic, \u201cMy cousin has mentioned that both of you are the fans of Di Qiuhe. And you are very good at taking photos and editing. Well, are you interested in working here with us?\u201dHe Bai suddenly got out of his trance. Fans of Di Qiuhe? Did the buyer have any misunderstanding about who he was?\"Thanks for the offer. What a pity. I have a part-time job at the Saint Elephant.\" With a smile he took a sip of tea and then he took his leave, \"Since your cousin is abroad, you will have to receive these on her behalf. And thanks for your time. I really enjoyed it. \"Jiang Xiuwen finally felt a ton being lifted off him. He tried to restrain himself from appearing too excited and got up to see He Bai off at the door. He put on a hospitable face and sighed \u201cWhat a pity. I was a step late in winning you over. Thank you for the fruits. I will convey your concern to my cousin. You will always be welcomed in the Red Guest.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you.\u201dAfter a short conversation, Jiang Xiuwen saw He Bai off at the door. He was suddenly reminded of something and stopped him, \u201cWait a minute. You said the fruits were send by your friend from border province. They have just arrived here?\u201dHe Bai nodded in agreement, \"Right. He sent an urgent delivery. The fruits are still fresh now. Any problem with that?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing. I notice that the fruits are very fresh, so I want to buy some for my family, too. It seems you have a good friend. Even in border province he still remembers to send you fruits. I\u2019m a bit jealous.\u201d He laughed, but deep in his heart, he had chopped Di Qiuhe into meat sauce. Di never gave him a call, but he had time to send fruits to He Bai. And he made such a mess for him to clean up? WTF. He should stop making shitty friends going forward.Astonished by his overly radiant laugh, He Bai quickly left and strode back to the Saint Elephant.After Jiang Xiuwen saw He Bai off, the smile on his face suddenly disappeared. Turning around, he entered the Red Guest in a rage. Seeing the employees looking at his direction, he shouted with widened eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny? Have you finished your work? Don\u2019t you dare talk about what happened today. You do well to remember this!\u201dEmployees were deeply shocked and started to go about doing their usual businesses...After returning to the Saint Elephant, He Bai felt strange when others looked at him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He got hold of a passing driver, and asked, \u201cWhy do they look at me like that?\u201d\"No, nothing. They are thanking you for those fruits.\" The driver muttered a reply, and then he ran away, pretending that he was needed elsewhere.This reaction looked very odd.Raising his eyebrows, He Bai swept a look at the people who was peeking at him. Having thought about it for a few seconds, he walked towards Li Ru\u2019s office.\"Okay, I will have a talk with him... Well, thank you for your invitation... Ok, talk to you soon.\" After Li Ru hung up, she heard a knock and saw He Bai\u2019s head coming up from behind the half-closed door. The expression on his face became relaxed and he waved to He Bai. \"Just in time, I have something to tell you.\"With a smile, he walked up and took a seat opposite of Li. He magically produced a big and delicious fruit from his bag and presented it like a treasure to Li Ru. \u201cHere you are, Sister Li. I have been hiding this one from others. It smells the sweetest among those fruits. It must be delicious.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you sweet?\u201d Li Ru smiled and promptly accepted it without being coy. After that, they got right down to business. \u201cHere is the thing. The work over the TV station is coming to an end. The busy period is over, so the demand for part-time workers is not as urgent as before. But considering your ability, the company decided to keep you.Putting on a serious face, He Bai sat up straight and listened carefully to what she said.\u201cDon't be so uptight.\u201d Li Ru smiled to soothe his nerves and suddenly changed their topic, \u201cHave you logged on Weibo recently?\u201dHe Bai froze for a moment and shook his head. \u201cNo, I have been busy with my exam recently. I haven't turned on my computer for some days... Why do you ask?\u201d Is the topic of Di Qiuhe still trending? Have there been some new developments?\"Nothing. It\u2019s just you are famous now.\" Li Ru replied in a teasing way. She clicked on the tablet on the table and held it up for him to look, \"Look, what are the odds? A while ago, some negative news of an actor went viral and the actor ended up closing his Twitter account. Right before he closed it, he reposted a behind-the-scene video of the B City TV station and praised the person who provided the materials. Later, when the netizens wanted to help redeem the actor\u2019s image online, they dug into the posts which he posted before closing off the account, and among those posts the one commending you was second to last, so you are also noticed by the netizens. The B City TV station noticed that the behind-the-scene video was gaining popularity at the actor\u2019s expense and decided to take advantage of the situation. They removed Liu Huanhuan from her place on the album, and instead used the set you shot for Yang Fu and posted it.On the screen of the tablet were the hot topics on Twitter. Under the trending hashtag #Please come back, Di Qiuhe# was a topic #want to be photographed by the young, handsome photographer#. He clicked on the topic link and all he could see were the selfies of netizens captioned with mawkish subtitles.\u2018These people just want to post their selfies,\u201d He twitched his lips.Sensing his silence, Li Ru thought he was shocked and she proceeded with a smile. \"You did a good job on the photos of Yang Fu. The enthusiastic responses that you received from the netizens speak volumes of your ability. Considering your current popularity, the company decided to offer you the position of photographer after discussion. Your will be responsible for the promotion of commercial films on Weibo. We think that will strengthen your popularity.\u201d\u2018Strengthen popularity? Are they going to make me an Internet celebrity and a poster boy for Saint Elephant?\u2019He Bai immediately put down the tablet and asked with hesitation, \u201cMs. Li, if I am not mistaken, the company wants to move me off the probationary period?\u201cYes. That\u2019s it.\u201d Li Ru nodded her head. Then she took out a document from the drawer and delivered to him, \u201cThis is the contract. Your salary will be almost as high as the team leader Ma. Since you are a student and have classes, the company agrees to reduce your monthly workload and you don\u2019t need to clock in. The only thing that the company needs is your full cooperation when the it needs online promotion.\u201dWhen taken at face value, this offer sounded very good, but He Bai knew things would not be as simple as that.He did not answer but took the contract to look it over. He paused over two articles in the contract and looked up at Li Ru with a serious face, \"Ms. Li, the company wants to sign a ten-year contract with me? And this supplementary clause here says the adaptation period is one year. After one year, the company will consider whether I should be transferred to another position. What does this mean?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Resignation(3)Translator: Sissy That WalkLooking at his trusting eyes, Li Ru was reminded of the instructions from her superior. After struggling for a while, she said to him with a sigh, \"He Bai, you should be able to understand the meaning of this contract. The trending topic on the Internet always changes far more quickly than we could imagine. If you could retain your current popularity, then that's a yay for all of us. If you couldn't, the company will need some insurances and a plan B to make up for what it has invested in you.In other words, the ten-year term is to prevent the situation where you bail on the company after it props you up to fame. And if you prove to be a bad investment, then the company couldn't very well continue to pay you that well, hence the one-year probationary period. That's to say that the company would take the offer back if you fail to deliver any good result in a year and by then you could only get what you are due.'In other words, the risks are all on me while the company reaps all the benefits.'He Bai finally understood why Di Qiuhe's said \"The big boss of the Saint Elephant is a bad guy. Think twice before you sign the employment contract.\" Such an unfair contract could achieve nothing other than driving people away.\"Ms. Li.\" He closed the contract and for the first time he refused her, \"I am not stupid, and there is no way I would sign this. I appreciate your trust and the care I felt during my time in the Saint Elephant, but popularity is just too fragile a thing for me. I'd like to support myself by working hard, not by some online popularity\"Deep in her heart, Li Ru admired his attitude, but considering her position, she could only try to persuade him, \"Luck is also an integrate part of one's strength. If you are not satisfied with the contract, we could talk about it. Why don't you think about it and get back to me later? There is no rush.\"\"Sorry,\" said He Bai as he pushed the contract back with a bitter smile, \"Ms. Li, I am to be a junior student soon. I am only here to earn tuition. And after the incident over at the Li Hu Park, I have already seen what the company can be. Short-term cooperation is fine, but long-term cooperation is just not what I want.\" The offer had already been made, and if he didn't refuse it outright, he would run the risk of being seen as a snooty person living off his popularity. If the negotiation failed, the company might even come after him on the Internet. He was never an indecisive person and he thought it best to get out now.After finishing his words, he got up and bowed to Li Ru, \"Thank you for giving me this opportunity. I am sorry things don't work out the way you want. The task that the company assigned to me will be finished as soon as possible and I will email it to you. Good bye.\"Hearing him mentioning the previous incident in which the company sided with Ma Xingtong, she realized He Bai had been gradually alienated from the company. As she thought about this, she felt more tired than she was sorry for the situation, Seeing that he was about to go, she hurriedly stopped him and said \"You have a long way to go. There will never be a just working environment. If you insist on doing it your way, then work harder. Only when you reach the top can you enjoy the scenery. Best wishes to you.\"He Bai was a bit touched. He turned around and took another bow, \"Thank you, Ms. Li. I will do my best.\"Seeing that, Li Ru felt a ton being lifted off her and reminded him in a subtle way, \"You have gone to the Red Guest today. Many people here have seen that. I believe you were just there to give your friend fruits, but others might not think the same. The summer vacation has just begun. If you still want to find a part-time job on this street, best avoid the Red Guest.He Bai was reminded of others' odd looks back in the company. It all made sense to him now and he found it ridiculous. After thanking her again, he turned around and left.It would seem that the transition from a promising photographer to a jobless vagrant could happen as quickly as the time it took for him to deliver the fruits.Lying in the chair, he dragged over the computer and turned it on. Then he took out his phone to check on the deposit. He had a minor headache when he saw the figures on the screen. If he had known this earlier, he would have bought a cheaper computer. It's just the beginning of the summer vacation and he still had two months before the school started, so he needed to find a new part-time job ASAP.Suddenly He Bai's phone rang up. Lowering his head, he found that it's an unknown call. Reminded of what Di Qiuhe had told him about a potential client, he sat up straight quickly and answered it courteously with a \"Hello\".\"Hello, is that photographer He Bai speaking?\" A gentle and sweet female voice came out from the phone.'Photographer He Bai? This is definitely a business call.'He held back his excitement and replied in a polite way, \"Yes, this is. You are?\"\"Hello, Mr. He. I'm Lin Xia, the head of the Yi Ka apparel. We saw some photos you took for the hostess of the B City TV station on Internet and we love it very much. We think your photographic style is very consistent with our subsidiary girl's apparel brand. So I'm calling to ask you may I invite you to work with us.\"The woman on the other end of the phone cut right to the chase and that startled He Bai a bit, \"What kind of cooperation are we talking about?\" 'Girl's apparel brand. What's that?'Lin Xia didn't mind that his question was too shallow. At first, she patiently introduced him to her company and then she walked him through the details of this potential cooperation. At last, she said that he did not need to decide now and that he should give it some thoughts.He Bai agreed and told her when he would reply. After hanging up the phone, he was quiet for a few seconds to digest what had been offered to him.'Taking photos for girl's apparel brand comes with high commission. And I don't need to clock in. I can begin with a short-term contract and if everything goes fine, I get to discuss long-term cooperation with them. Perfect! That's the kind of part-time job I want for summer vacation!'He jumped out of joy and immediately took out his phone to make a call to Xu Yinrong. Taking photos of clothes wasn't exactly the same thing as taking photos for models and he needed to consult his teacher first!In the border province, Di Qiuhe finally got half a day off after the tough training with the martial arts coach. He stuck to his gentleman image and said farewell to everyone. Then he sent away the assistant under the pretense that he was tired and needed some rest. After that, he returned to his room, charged his phone and turned it on.Suddenly, a rush of missed calls and messages popped out and they were all from Jiang Xiuwen.Feeling disappointed, he just ignored it outright. When he found the message from the little puppy, he looked it over carefully. Then he found out the phone number of the shop owner from whom Di bought the fruits last time and ordered another batch of fruits for the little puppy. He was about to make a call to the little puppy, but on second thought, he decided to chat with him via WeChat.So, he quitted the dialing page and opened the WeChat while lying in sofa by the window.White and Whiter: Are you in the Red Guest?White and Whiter: My friend sent me a lot of fruits and it's too much for me. Would you like some?White and Whiter: Are you there? Qiuqiu?Fixing his eyes on the last sentence, Di Qiuhe curled up his lips with a satisfied sigh, \"Well. Just some fruits. Why do you have to share them with me? What a clingy child\u2026\" And, it's not from your friend. It's from your senior schoolmate, elder brother and idol!\"You little puppy. Always saying these things when you mean the other.\" He clicked on the profile image of He Bai and started typing words with a face that read 'It's your honor that I would chat with you.'A Bird Born in Autumn: I've been busy these days and I haven't been using WeChat for quite a while. Thank you for your concern, Bai. ^-^A Bird Born in Autumn: Love you, Bai.A Bird Born in Autumn: My stepmother haven't been making any trouble for me recently. I feel so good. Thank you for all the photos and gifts that you gave me before. Where is your dorm? I would like to send you gifts in return. ^-^Before he left B City, he saw Xiuwen purchased a batch of new cameras. The little puppy loved photography so much. If he could get a new camera as a gift, he must love it very much and thank him for a thousand times.Perfect! Smart! Di Qiuhe was very satisfied with his plan.Ding-dong. A new message. He lowered his head.White and Whiter: You don't need to do that. I already know. If you feel sad, you can just tell me and I would hear you out.A Bird Born in Autumn: \"?\" 'What's that about? What does he know? I'm sad? About what?'White and Whiter: I met your cousin in the Red Guest. He told me one thing or two about what you are going through\u2026 Anyway, you gotta take care of yourself out there in the foreign land. Don't dwell on these ideas like committing suicide or running away from home. Think about your family who care about you. Life is beautiful after all.Di Qiuhe: \"??\" 'Foreign land? Cousin? What?White and Whiter: You don't need to send me a gift in return. If you have money, you should go treat yourself. And, your cousin is a good person. He cares about you. You could talk to him if you have any trouble. Your family is far more important than what your idol could give you. Life will get better. Just have a little faith. ^-^Di Qiuhe: \"?!!\" 'What? What does that mean? Idol? What does he take me for? I am very down to the earth and I am every bit as good as that so called \"cousin\". Just a few days out of contact. What's going on with this little puppy?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Being Haunted (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkWhite and Whiter: Why do you stop talking? Are you angry?White and Whiter: Sorry, I was too self-assertive before. I shouldn't have gone to Red Guest to look for you.Having received another two messages, Di Qiuhe calmed down quickly and looked over all the messages He Bai had sent in complete earnest as if he was doing the reading comprehension section in the college entrance examination. Finally, he came to a conclusion that He Bai had paid a visit to Red Guest to look for him, the \u201cbuyer\u201d in his eyes!Red Guest, cousin... Jiang-Xiu-wen! How come He Bai considered Jiang Xiuwen more reliable than him?!Diu Qiuhe\u2019s brow furrowed. He typed angrily, and his eyes swept across the French window before sending the message over. Seeing the much thinner figure of him, Di Qiuhe paused for a moment and quickly deleted the text that was already edited. Rubbing his forehead and keeping silent for a few seconds, he switched to another mode and typed slowly.A Bird Born in Autumn: It doesn't matter. I know you care about me. ^-^A Bird Born in Autumn: Please don\u2019t stand on ceremony with me. If you feel embarrassed to accept my present, we can exchange gifts.A Bird Born in Autumn: Wait a minute, I have something pressing.On convincing He Bai, Diu Qiuhe dialed Jiang Xiuwen's number immediately and asked as soon as he got through, \u201cWhat did you say to He Bai?\u201dJiang Xiuwen: \u201c... hmm.\u201dDi Qiuhe: \u201c?\u201dTen minutes later, Di Qiuhe who got a good scolding put down the mobile phone indifferently and cast a look at the darkening sky outside. It\u2019s quite thrilling to have ups and downs in life. As social practice declined day by day, people as kind and civilized as He Bai were hard to find.Drawing a long sigh, Di Qiuhe picked up the phone again and made a call to the greengrocer, telling him to prepare one more box of fruit and send it to Red Guest Photography in B City. After that, he turned off the mobile phone reluctantly and slumped down in a chair listlessly. In view of the fact that his sockpuppet was likely to be revealed, Diu Qiuhe found that he couldn\u2019t contact He Bai at will ... it could only be done when the time comes!He Bai waited for a long while but received no words like \u201cI'm back\u201d from the buyer, only to be in receipt of another box of fruit by express delivery next afternoon. He Bai\u2019s mouth twitched slightly when he looked at the seemingly larger box. He took the cell phone out to call Di Qiuhe.\u201cSorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.\u201d\u201c......\u201dSo when he went to discuss cooperation matters with Yi Ka, its staffers were all taken aback by the \u201cbribe\u201d fruit in heaps the young photographer took with him with effort.\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of you.\u201d Lin Xia was at a loss how to react. She had never seen one who gave fruit to his cooperative partner on their first meeting before. If you called it ingratiation, it didn\u2019t make sense for this cooperation was proposed by Yi Ka and the party which needed to fawn was nobody but Yi Ka\u2019s members. As to bribery, it\u2019s quite unnecessary for He Bai to offer bribes, and such amount was far from enough. In addition, no way he just brought the fruits as a gesture of appreciation. After all, it was obviously not cheap, and this seemed way too generous for a gesture.\u201cMy friend sent me a lot of fruit, but I can't finish it by myself. So could you do me a favor and take some?\u201d He Bai looked embarrassed and raised his hands in a requesting gesture, \u201cI know peeps in fashion design industry pay much attention to your diet, so my request may put you in an awkward position. But it\u2019s a pity to let such fresh fruit go to waste, so... Sorry to trouble you. I really appreciate it.\u201dHe Bai gave a pretty good reason for sharing the fruit, thus winning the affection of everyone in the conference room, who got more and more friendly with the young adorable lad.Seeing how her \u201cart-obsessed\u201d subordinates readily captured by a bag of fruit, in surprise, Lin Xia\u2019s brow furrowed. She glanced at He Bai, smiling, pat the table and said, \u201cThe lunch break is just over. I\u2019m afraid that everyone is still in food coma, so how about having afternoon tea with Mr. He and getting down to business in an hour?\u201dThe crowd looked stunned and burst into cheers. Thanks to He Bai, they could take half an hour more break.Overwhelmed by their enthusiasm, He Bai was integrated into the team after a little chat.Lin Xia looked on, with an affectionate smile on her face, while plenty of thoughts crossed her mind. No wonder that Mrs. Ke spoke highly of He Bai. Young as he was, the guy was skilled at drawing others in by untactful but extraordinarily effective means, which could achieve much more remarkable success than that of socialites. Given that he was really a master photographer, such a capable and adorable person would be in great demand in the future.Wining and dining, they spent half an hour in idle chit-chat and completed the rest work efficiently in an atmosphere of harmony and warmth.\u201cThat's all. Before signing the contract, you shall shoot a set of sample photos for assessment. I hope you can understand, Mr. He.\u201d Lin Xia laid down the last condition of her company when she covered the folder.He Bai closed the contract and nodded in agreement, \u201cThat figures. You make me a generous offer. Given preferential treatment, I\u2019m supposed to hand in an utterly convincing work in return. Thanks ever so much for giving me this opportunity, Mrs. Lin. May I ask when the sample photographs will be taken?\u201dLin Xia looked at the time, her smiled broadened, \u201cIf possible, I hope you can start now.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d He Bai was astonished by her words because it was nearing four o'clock.\u201cYes, it\u2019s now.\u201d Lin Xia stood up and gestured towards the door, \u201cThe studio is ready, and models and costumes are all in place. Please follow me.\u201dThey seemed well prepared.He Bai couldn\u2019t help laughing. He stood up in a natural and poised manner and picked up the camera bag.Mr. Xu once told him the shooting skills requirements varied greatly, depending on your focus. When you focused on models themselves, you could use whichever skills you wanted, provided they photographed well. However, most of the skills became redundant when the focus was on their dress, and your goal was nothing more than to restore and explore the beauty of clothing.As a clothing giant, Yi Ka had many sub-brands, including luxuries designed for high-income groups and medium-end brands aimed at well-off families. The Little Mermaid he's going to shoot today was a new attempt by Yi Ka, which was a light-luxury brand targeted at teenage girls in high-consumption family.There was a considerable number of photographers able to shoot luxury brands, few of whom, however, corresponded to Yi Ka\u2019s brand style. He Bai was aware that what Yi Ka sought for was more his \u201cstyle\u201d than skills, so his task today was to reproduce the style Yang Fu's photos presented in the costumes.\u201cThe target market of Little Mermaid is girls at the age of 12 to 18, so its style features fantasy and innocence. Now the brand has yet gone on market, so your photos will serve as the first major hits, which counts for much.\u201d Lin Xia explained to him and handed over a document, \u201cToday you\u2019re going to shoot the princess series, our mainstay costumes. Here are the sketches as well as the original, revised and final versions of the series. Also, the cloth details, the characteristics of its decoration and its design elements are included within ... You have fifteen minutes to get to know them and this studio. A quarter later, the shooting will begin on time. Come on, I look forward to your work.\u201dTaking the document which symbolized trust and expectation, He Bai gave Li Xia a confident smile, \u201cThank you. I will try my best to hand in photos that satisfy you all.\u201dA smile spread across Lin Xia's face. Giving He Bai a pat on the shoulder, she tactfully retreated from the studio, leaving him a quiet working environment.The document was thick, and the content complex, with which He Bai were quite unfamiliar for he shot landscapes mainly in his previous incarnation, but he found it roused his enthusiasm. It\u2019s not only a daunting challenge but a rare opportunity for his development.When Lin Xia called him the other day, she only asked whether he would like to take costume photos for a newly launched girl brand, not mentioning that the positioning of the brand was light luxury. Light luxury, which means his photos were very likely to be printed on a variety of platforms accessible to high-consumption groups and served as a major boost to his development given that his photos were adopted by the brand. Besides, if he constantly occupied the post of Little Mermaid\u2019s costume photographer, he would gain entry into the fashion circle of photography and rose from an obscure photo-taker to become a real photographer in name and in fact!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: Being Haunted (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkIn the last life, He Bai had reached the peak of photography by taking photos of landscapes, and now, after his rebirth, there was another way ahead.Excitement stirred inside him, while he still kept a straight face.He Bai browsed through the file, and then strolled along the castle, tracery walls and swings in the dreamy studio, where he even found several cute rabbits in the corner.The studio was well matched with the theme of princess series. It must have cost a bomb, he guessed.Imagining that models in delicate longuette stood in this scene, He Bai stopped at the castle gate, opened the document again and examined carefully the sketches of the princess series.Lin Xia came in a quarter of an hour. He Bai returned the document to her immediately, let a shallow breath out and smiled at her, \u201cPlease start. I'm ready.\u201dAt midnight, Di Qiuhe turned on the mobile phone secretly. After some hesitation he gave up ringing He Bai up and checked WeChat with a rather sour face.A Bird Born in Autumn: Are you asleep?He received a reply within seconds.White and Whiter: No.Di Qiuhe wasn\u2019t pleased with the reply. Instead, he looked more ghastly.A Bird Born in Autumn: Is the summer vacation busy?White and Whiter: Yeah.The words choked in Di Qiuhe\u2019s throat. Deleting the half-edited sentence \u201cAre you too busy to send me a message when I show no initiative\u201d, he continued to type as his expression changed.A Bird Born in Autumn: Have you found a new part-time job? Is the work tiring?When chatting with Xiuwen last time, Di Qiuhe learned that He Bai had quitted Saint Elephant. There was no reason for him to be on the go recently. After all, the photo-taking job Di Qiuhe had introduced to him was quite easy, which could be completed in a few days. Also, the pay was pretty good.White and Whiter: I\u2019ve found another job. My life is quite full now.A Bird Born in Autumn: Which kind of job? Photo taking?White and Whiter: No, my task is to take first publicity photos of the mainstay costumes for a new brand that has yet to be launched. I was originally asked to shoot the costumes, but the person in charge made the final decision to let me take the publicity photographs, which kept me fully occupied recently.Di Qiuhe sat up from the bed with a frown. He Bai was taking costumes\u2019 publicity photos? Why did he have no appointment? It was close to mid-July, and the birthday celebrations of Mr. Jia Sheng\u2019s granddaughter would be held on July 23rd. Given that birthday photographs were arranged to be displayed during the banquet, the shooting must begin at least a week in advance. However, He Bai said he received no appointment. Was anything wrong? After all, Mr. Jia Sheng tended to fit everything into his schedule. If it continued to drag on, the screens were likely to go blank at the party.Thinking of this, Diu Qiuhe typed hurriedly to confirm it.A Bird Born in Autumn: Why do you turn off appointments of shooting? Such a cushy job will get you highly paid. You\u2019ve won favor on the Internet just now. There must be a lot of people who would like you to photograph them.White and Whiter: \u3010embarrassed\u3011 You living abroad should be informed what happened on the Internet, fancy that! In fact, it\u2019s a sheer exaggeration. I once worked on part-time basis at Saint Elephant, and the shooting appointment must be made through the company. Now I quit, so people who need me to take photographs have nowhere to arrange an appointment.White and Whiter: What\u2019s more, the job I'm doing now is in my eyes better and more promising than shooting by appointment. I like it very much. ^-^White and Whiter: So you see, opportunity could be found everywhere. Keep a good state of mind and work harder, things will get better little by little.White and Whiter: It\u2019s quite late. Why are you still up? Staying up can damage you girls\u2019 skin.Di Qiuhe looked sullen, his eyes fixating on the line \u201cthe shooting appointment must be made through the company\u201d. The Little Puppy was really vulnerable to bullying, which made him angry. Unaware that his former company had cheated him of a golden opportunity, he also tried to enlighten him, an unacquainted netizen, as to the philosophy of life.\u201cHow stupid you are!\u201d Diu Qiuhe felt like giving He Bai a scolding. He even hoped to drag him over and poke him in the dimple, asking why he was too silly to realize that he had been unfairly treated.The clock struck twelve when his mobile phone automatically rang the bell \u201cGood night, Dear Autumn. Kiss you\u201d, which was set to remind him to go to sleep.Affected, he continued to type smoldering with anger.A Bird Born in Autumn: I\u2019m about to. Don\u2019t sleep late. Good night. Kiss you.White and Whiter: Good night.Two minutes later, Diu Qiuhe was sure that He Bai would return no message. With a scowling look, he gnashed his teeth when thinking of Saint Elephant Company. In one hand, he regretted not mentioning He Bai\u2019s name but only evasively telling Jia Sheng the person he introduced was a new photographer of Saint Elephant, in case Jia Sheng got the impression that he pulled strings for He Bai. In the other hand, Di Qiuhe also got angry with Saint Elephant\u2019s cheating!Mr. Jia never went back on his word, so the reason why He Bai received no shooting appointments was only because Saint Elephant played a dirty trick! When he introduced He Bai to Jia Sheng, his description was as follows: a graduate of Q University and newcomer to Saint Elephant who took commemorative photos for B City TV station recently and enjoyed great popularity online. Throughout Saint Elephant, was there anyone in accordance with these premises except He Bai?\u201cHow dare you cheat my little puppy?\u201d Seething with anger, Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help giving a sneer. He picked up the phone and dialed Jiang Xiuwen's number heedless of the time. On getting through, he spoke bluntly, \u201cXiuwen, help me inquire about\u2026\u201d\u201cDi-Qiu-he! We are no friends anymore! I\u2019ve done with this!\u201d\u201cBeep\u2014\u201dDi Qiuhe put down the mobile phone, rubbing his ears that were almost deafened by the howl, and searched out He Bai\u2019s photo he had taken the day they had beefsteak with a slight sense of grievance. Having the picture enlarged, he jabbed a finger at He Bai\u2019s face and put on a ferocious act, \u201cEverything I have done is all for you. You heartless little devil, enjoyed my fruit but made no contact with me. I\u2019ll get even with you when I\u2019m back to B City!\u201dFlipping through He Bai\u2019s sample photos, Lin Xia exclaimed in admiration, \u201cYou are right about making less change in their tones. We are selling clothing, not retouching software. The texture and colors of the cloth need to be restored to its original state. You\u2019ve done a pretty good job.\u201dA dimple appeared on his left face when He Bai smiled. Spoken highly of, he glowed with pride and also got a little embarrassed.It always worked for Lin Xia. She put down the photos and said, \u201cMy original expectation of you is to be a qualified clothing photographer, but you actually gave me a surprise. Thank you for saving the money to hire another publicity photographer for us.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve paid me the wage of the publicity photographer, so I just pulled my own weight...\u201d He Bai bowed his head and humbled himself to be the foil to the generosity of the company, speaking, \u201cIn fact, I have a lot of shortcomings, and everyone's experience has made up for my deficiency. I will continue to work hard.\u201dHe was sincere in his last words. Others considered his photographs brilliant, while he knew that he still followed the shooting routine in his last life. Thanks to the meticulous help of other team members who had a deep understanding of costumes, he was able to jump out of his comfort zone and forged ahead to take photographs that satisfied everyone.\u201cYou're too modest. It\u2019s a remarkable achievement for you to take such great photos at this age.\u201d Seeing him really embarrassed, Lin Xia considerately concluded the topic and got down to business, \u201cMost of the princess series and publicity photos are finished, and the rest are likely to be completed soon according to your efficiency. So it\u2019s time to sign a long-term contract.\u201dShe took out a document and handed it over. Putting a pen on it, Lin Xia said with confidence, \u201cTake a look, and put your signature to it. I would like to treat you to dinner.\u201dHe Bai took the document and browsed it through. He signed it quickly, smiling at her, \u201cSister Lin, I hope we can have a cordial working relationship.\u201dHearing the different appellation, Lin Xia beamed with pleasure. She stood up and reached out her hand, \u201cWish us a good cooperation, He.\u201dHaving signed for the express delivery, He Bai looked at this familiar box, heaved a sigh and dialed Di Qiuhe's number.\u201cSorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.\u201dThe same result.Putting his cell phone down, He Bai crouched in front of the box and stared blankly, his hands holding up the face.It was half a month since the phone call. He Bai tried phoning Diu Qiuhe but couldn\u2019t get through all the time. Only the fruit sent on regular basis reminded him of his presence.It was getting hotter and hotter. He Bai wondered whether the guy in clover could endure the frowst on the border...The longer they were separated, the more blurred He Bai\u2019s memories for his harshness and childishness were, and the clearer Di Qiuhe\u2019s unpleasant care loomed within He Bai. Strange as it was, He Bai found him slightly anxious for Di Qiuhe.Unconsciously clicking on the last texts Di Qiuhe had sent, He Bai scanned them through. Suddenly his eyes fixated on one of his messages, which got him puzzled. Pondering it over, he rolled his eyes and edited the reply.He Bai: You childish, where\u2019s the appointment you said? Are you fooling me again?Di Qiuhe: I didn\u2019t lie to you.Di Qiuhe: How dare you wrong me? You\u2019re done, Little Puppy.Di Qiuhe: I\u2019m leaving for B city right away. Wait and see.Di Qiuhe: See you tonight.He Bai: \u201c...\u201dIsn't he powered off? Then who returned his texts? A ghost?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Being Haunted (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe hurried to call Di Qiuhe up, only to find his phone was turned off. The monotonously mechanical female voice suddenly sounded gloomily frightening. Rubbing his arms and looking around the empty dorm, He Bai promptly packed up two sets of clothes and called Niu Junjie, \u201cBro, are you, are you in B city? Our dorm is\u2026 is haunted by ghosts. I need you to take me in\u2026\u201dNiu Junjie was reveling away the time on a luxurious yacht, \u201cIs Bai speaking? Ah! Are there ghosts?\u201dAssistant Wang brought the mobile phone to Di Qiuhe and spoke in a low voice, \u201cBoss said the recent days were a bit inconvenient for him and that you could contact him by phone if necessary.\u201dAssistant An also came over, \u201cDear young master, it\u2019s time for boarding.\u201d\u201cI see. Get on the plane first.\u201d Di Qiuhe turned off his phone again after using it for three minutes only. He stood up in a good mood, put on his sunglasses and said, \u201cYou must be tired in these days. Both of you can have a holiday to take a rest when we return to B city.\u201dThe two exchanged their glance, and Assistant Wang replied, \u201cNot at all. You must have a lot of affairs to deal with when we get back. How about we work in relays? In this way, your burden could be lifted somewhat.Contemptuous of his intention, Di Qiuhe pretended to be moved by his words and nodded his agreement, \u201cUp to you. Lady first, so Assistant An takes a break first. Wang shall be on duty for several days.\u201dAssistant Wang replied it\u2019s his pleasure and flattered Di Qiuhe a lot. Then they got on the plane together.Niu Junjie rushed back to B City overnight, picking He Bai up with a box of fruit from a small hotel outside the campus.\u201cIs it proper for me to go straight to your home? I hear you have a small apartment in your name...\u201d He Bai finally got relaxed in his company. His reason was back, and a sense of shame flashed through his mind.\u201cIt's all right. My parents are still on the yacht. Don't be nervous.\u201d Niu Junjie turned the steering wheel in a skillful way, laughing at He Bai, \u201cBai, aren\u2019t you an atheist? How come you become scared of ghosts? It\u2019s said that ghosts are afraid of masculinity. Our dormitory building is full of boys and the masculinity there must be more than enough. Even ghosts dare not to get in.\u201dRemembering that he received texts from Di Qiuhe\u2019s phone which was powered off, He Bai went pale. Rubbing his face, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t believe in ghosts before, but...\u201d But even the rebirth had happened to him; he had no choice but to believe that nothing was impossible.\u201cBut what?\u201d It\u2019s quite rare for Niu Junjie to see such a spiritless He Bai. The spirit of brotherhood constrained him from falling into convulsions of laughter, and he thoughtfully changed the topic, \u201cDrop it. You know, the yacht is simply unfit for stay. It was fun to spend one or two days on it, while I\u2019ve passed more than half a month at sea and been sick to death now. In contrast, my parents are still in high spirits. But for your phone call, I couldn\u2019t have found an excuse to come back in advance.\u201dOn hearing his words, He Bai cast an envious glance at him. Throughout the two lives, he only embarked a yacht for the purpose of shooting a glacier, when he was nearly freezing to death, there was no such luxury as having fun on a yacht.\u201cDon't look at me like this, bro. Let\u2019s have a big meal! I\u2019ve brought a box of seafood from the yacht. We can have a barbecue when returning to my home.\u201d said Niu Junjie while his mouth was watering, \u201cI tell you what, my parents hired a wonderful cook. He\u2019s pretty good at making seafood dishes...\u201dAs Niu Junjie chattered on, He Bai couldn\u2019t help recalling the happy days in his last life when he had all kinds of delicacies at will. Thinking of today\u2019s toil from dawn to dusk to make money, he heaved a long sigh.He Bai now hardly pondered over the reason for his rebirth, but today, he would like to utter in affection: To hell with the villain that led to his rebirth!\u201cAtishoo!\u201dDi Qiuhe gave his nose a pinch and looked at Assistant Wang who had seen An off, asking, \u201cDone with the downtown house?\u201d\u201cYes, dear master.\u201dAssistant Wang stopped in front of him and answered respectfully.Di Qiuhe nodded. After a brief silence, his gentle mask disappeared, and a wicked grin emerged on his face, \u201cDo you know what \u2018serving me only\u2019 means?\u201dTrembling with fear, Assistant Wang recalled that Di Qiuhe had caught him in the wrong. He gritted his teeth and replied, \u201cYes, I do. From now on, I\u2019ll serve as the assistant of yours only.\u201d He was well aware that if he didn\u2019t make clear his position today, Di Qiuhe would definitely make life difficult for him in that he saw the young master in his true colors in addition to his guilty doings.\u201cA wise man submits to circumstances.\u201dDi Qiuhe flashed him a smile, \u201cYou seem to be the best among the wise men.\u201dBowing his head, Assistant Wang dared not to look directly into Di Qiuhe\u2019s eyes and acquiesced to the slightly sarcastic comment.\u201cSince you've made up your mind to be my assistant only, you might as well call me in another way.\u201d Di Qiuhe took a coin out of his pocket and fiddled with it, \u201cBesides, aren\u2019t you supposed to inform your boss, my dear dad, that Miss An is a member of Qin family?\u201dQin family?Assistant Wang raised his head suddenly and lost self-control, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely impossible! Assistant An was recruited together with me, so it\u2019s unlikely she...\u201d\u201cShe works for Qin Li.\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his hand to hold his face, his slender fingers constantly poking himself in the face. Though he looked casual, his eyes were so sparking that Wang dared not look into them, \u201cNot only she but her boyfriend works for Qin Li. Wang, you\u2019re made fool of.\u201dThe news was like a bolt from the blue. Assistant Wang was at a loss, \u201cHer, her boyfriend? Then I \u2026\u201d\u201cQin Li\u2019s usual ploy is honey trap, which tends to be of use. Her men also learn it well.\u201d Gazing out of the window at the sinking sun, Di Qiuhe pointed to the villa and the scenery that stretched out of window, and said faintly, \u201cMoney talks. The shameless can do anything to make money.\u201dAssistant Wang also looked out of the window, with his hands unconsciously clenched, and said reluctantly, \u201cYou are right. Money is really a good thing... Boss wanted to meet me next morning, Mr. Di.Di Qiuhe looked back at him and smiled to his heart\u2019s content, \u201cWell, tomorrow morning. It\u2019s a good time.\u201dAfter Assistant Wang left, Di Qiuhe had a simple dinner. Then he picked up a backpack and went out of the provisionally arranged villa, ready for a \u201cchance encounter\u201d with Little Puppy at Q University.\u201cNo, it\u2019s a sheer waste of ingredients. I wouldn\u2019t like to have loose bowels at night.\u201d\u201cBelieve me. It smells so good.\u201d\u201cTurn it over, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s scorched by fire.\u201dA vague noise caused by the collision of cooking utensils came.\u201cWell, I'm unskilled. Roast more, and I can cook well! Don't throw my meat away! It is edible if I cook it again!\u201dDi Qiuhe halted and cast a glance at the walls of a villa by the wayside.\u201cYou\u2019ve messed it up. If you don\u2019t stop, we\u2019ll have nothing for dinner. Just leave it to your cook. I\u2019m terribly hungry.\u201d\u201cOkay... How about we go swimming? You can put on my swimming trunks. It\u2019s too hot. Let\u2019s swim a lap first to cool us down. They\u2019ve changed the water inside. I guarantee you\u2019ll have fun!\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cTake off your coat and trousers. Let me see... You're thinner than me. This pair of swimming trunks may suit you, which I wore only once... Don't, there are few people in the yard\u2014you, me and my cook, all male. Don't bother to go inside. You can change the clothes here. If you mind me putting on it once, you can keep your underwear inside. But it may make you uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cI choose to cover the underwear with it. I hope you can follow me, in case I see something too personal!\u201d\u201cYou have already seen it before. After all, we\u2019re close friends\u2026 Oops, Bai, there\u2019s a bite of a mosquito on your back. Aren\u2019t you getting itchy? Ha-Ha, I\u2019ve mistaken it for a worm.\u201d\u201cDon't touch it! I do feel itchy!\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s brow knitted. He took out the phone and dial He Bai\u2019s number.\u201cBai, your phone seems to be ringing.\u201d\u201cLet me take a look... O, crap, it\u2019s a ghost\u2019s call!\u201cWhat the hell? Hmm, his name is Di Qiuhe.\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s patience suddenly snapped and he put the phone down angrily. Drawing a few steps back, he leapt over the parapet after a run-up, yelling at He Bai who wore nothing but a pair of swimming trunks under the tree at a short distance, \u201cLittle Puppy, put it clear, who is the ghost?\u201dBeep\u2014The villa alarm went off, and the searchlight at the corner of the wall shone down on Di Qiuhe\u2019s body.A banging sound came. He Bai was so scared that he couldn\u2019t help but let the cell phone loose, which hit a stone and fell into the swimming pool.\u201cAh!\u201d Niu Junjie bowed his head, staring straight at the swimming pool. He somewhat got into a panic, \u201cBai, the phone your parents left you is gone, so are the texts saved inside...\u201dHe Bai didn\u2019t realize his phone was gone until Niu Junjie reminded him. He looked at the empty palm and his mind went blank.\u2018Where's my phone?\u2019Throwing a glance at He Bai who was still gazing at his palm, Di Qiuhe frowned. He jumped off the parapet, removed his backpack and casquette, strode to the pool and sprang into it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Shitty Memory! (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkAs a loud crash came,Di Qiuhe jumped into the water, while He Bai\u2019s instep was dripping wet from the spray.\u201c... What is he doing?\" Niu Junjie was shocked by Di\u2019s sudden move. He looked down at the surface of the pool, baffled.He Bai shook his head and came to himself. It seemed that something occurred to him and made his face distorted, then he also jumped into the water.Another spray came, wetting Niu Junjie\u2019s face.Niu Junjie: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe fat cook running over with a barbecue fork, pushing Niu behind with a serious face, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Master, security is coming. That intruder seems mental disordered, do not approach him. I\u2026I learnt dog paddle when I was young, maybe I can go to save Master He\u2026\u201d\u201cRelax, uncle Hu, I knew that wall-climber, not an intruder.\u201d Niu Junjie patted the cook\u2019s shoulder and wiped away the water on his face. After a second-of-thought, he walked to the pool and jumped into it. Since He Bai, his good mate, vigorously helped to save the phone, he could not stand by!Uncle Hu: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe surface of the pool gradually resorted calm. After a short struggle with his mind, uncle Hu took off his apron, gritted his teeth and jumped into the water. Since his Master jumped, he had no excuse to escape, or he might well lose his job.The security that arrived: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe water in the pool was fresh and clear. He Bai immediately found Di Qiuhe floundering about in the water. He was totally speechless, instantly swimming to him. When Di Qiuhe noticed him, He Bai gave him a hint to stay there and threw his arms around Di\u2019s waist. He did kick and stroke in the water, trying hard to surface.After balancing himself, Di Qiuhe blinked and looked down at the arm seizing his waist. He suddenly moved his head closer to He Bai and gave him a smile.He Bai gave him a glimpse with a stolid face.Di Qiuhe smiled slightly, also clasping He Bai around his waist. They are attached so close, like glued together.He Bai stopped swimming for a while, resisting the impulse to tear him off. Then he looked up, trying harder to surface.Suddenly, there was a splash and something fell clumsily into the water. He Bai was dumbfounded, but held Di Qiuhe aside in time.Niu Junjie\u2019s eyes sparkled when he saw the other two. He beckoned them the position of the phone and then pointed to the ground. \u2018Did you find the phone? Now went back to the ground?\u2019Di Qiuhe took one look and buried his head in He Bai\u2019s neck.He Bai pushed his head aside with dislike and waved to Niu Junjie, and pointed to Di Qiuhe who clinging to him, then pointed to the surface: Stop looking now, this fool couldn\u2019t swim, take him to the ground first.Niu Junjie burst out laughing but got choked.Suddenly, another bigger thing was flung into the pool and floundered in the water, with cries for help coming from there.He Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe one attached to him suddenly moved. He Bai turned back, only to find that Di Qiuhe\u2019s face had gone red and eyebrows had frowned closely, with bubbles coming out of his mouth. He was shocked. After he calculated the time Di Qiuhe stuck in the water, he hurriedly took Di to continue surfacing.Di Qiuhe felt He Bai\u2019s movement and slowly opened his eyes which were smarting from the water. Gazing at He Bai\u2019s dimmed face, Di Qiuhe prodded his dimple with a finger. As his head tilted, he got closer and closer to He Bai\u2019s lips.He Bai stared at him, with his head falling backward in a hurry.But Di Qiuhe continued to get closer.He Bai patted him on the head with anger and managed to get out of the water with the help of Niu Junjie. After a long breath, he shouted to Di Qiuhe, who was also panting for breath: \u201cWhat was that? You want to get a thrashing?\u201dAfter a cough, Di Qiuhe finally could breathe normally. He turned to He bai with innocent eyes: \u201cI just acted like some romantic stories in TV: when you are almost suffocated, the other one will kiss you to transfer the oxygen. My little puppy, do you hate me so much that you even refused to give me a breath when I was dying?\u201dHe Bai didn\u2019t know how to respond, but he was even more furious due to Di\u2019s bold blame. He pulled Di Qiuhe by the pool and let him cling to the pool edge, scolding seriously: \u201cI didn\u2019t know you wanted to\u2026You knew you couldn\u2019t swim and you still jumped? That could have killed you! A non-swimmer should stay on the ground. You want to kill yourself, huh? Or you think you just have lived long enough?\u201dDi Qiuhe slicked his wet hair up and stretching hand to fondle He Bai\u2019s face: \u201cSorry, don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d\u201cYou want to deny quibble, don\u2019t you? Or what? Wind me up? Sorry?\u201d He Bai was a little bit surprised. He frowned and gazed at Di Qiuhe in disbelief: \u201cAre you real Di Qiuhe? Absolutely real?\u201d Di Qiuhe would apologize so frankly? That childish guy should have insisted until the end and winded me up, fancy him apologizing now!\u201cI'm terribly sorry to have worried you.\u201d Di Qiuhe pinched his face and stretched the other hand to show him something that had been held tightly: \u201cAnd\u2026sorry for your phone.\u201dThe old phone lay in his clean and fair hand. This scene should have touched He Bai a little.He Bai looked at his palm without taking the phone or saying anything, but his anger was fading.\u201cIt has been completely damaged by water.\u201d Seeing He Bai not take the phone, Di Qiuhe withdrew his hand and held the phone tightly again: \u201cSorry, I will get it repaired, if not possible, at least restore the data in it\u2026I know it is important to you, sorry again.\u201dHe Bai was not used to such an honest tone.Looking at him, He Bai filled his mind with a myriad of thoughts. Finally, he turned around with a long sigh and grabbed the phone from Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand. He sat on the edge of the pool and shook off the drips on his hand, saying: \u201cNever mind, it\u2019s just an old phone. Everything in it has been copied, so don\u2019t blame yourself, my fault after all. Come on, you cannot swim, better stay on the ground.\u201dDi Qiuhe observed his face without blinking, carefully analyzing all the moods behind it. He lowered his eyes and got out of the pool, sitting beside He Bai. De Qiuhe buddy bumped him, \u201cBai\u2026Bai.\u201dHe Bai picked up the dry clothes beside the pool to wipe the screen of his phone and responded casually.Di Qiuhe tilted his head and looked at him. Somehow he desired to hug He Bai\u2026and he did.\u201cHey!\u201d He Bai was almost pushed into the pool.\u201cSorry.\u201d Di Qiuhe rubbed his chin against He Bai\u2019s wet hair, with a vague sense of panic. The abnormal family relational deprived his ability to be close to others. Having dissembled himself for too long, Di Qiuhe, in face of this new person in front of whom he could be assured to put down his mask, would always act improperly, doing something that angered him.He liked his little puppy to lecture him energetically when he got mad, but he didn\u2019t want to see him feeling sad\u2026Therefore, Di Qiuhe felt awful-he had intended to be a good senior, good role model and good big brother to take care of him, but ultimately messed it up. Di Qiuhe\u2019s words were brimmed with so much remorse that He Bai was dumbfounded. He stopped pulling up Di Qiuhe\u2019s arm and instead, patted him on the shoulder as a comfort: \u201cForget it. I am indeed sad for the phone but I have copied all the data before so it doesn\u2019t matter. Anyway, \u2018keep the old, you get nothing new\u2019. Now I have an excuse to buy a new one. It\u2019 too old. Even if it didn\u2019t fall into water, it may go broken soon.\u201dIn his last life, this phone also didn\u2019t \u201cmake it\u201d through his sophomore summer vacation. Before the new term, it totally died. He Bai was anxious at that time. He quitted his part-time job ahead of schedule and took it for repair. However, it was stolen on the way to the phone store and left nothing for him to be nostalgic for.In the first few days of his rebirth, he led a messed-up life due to his shock. But instantly he saw this phone, he rushed out of school and bought a USB drive to copy all the messages in the phone.Now this phone just left him a month earlier in another way. It\u2019s OK, at least this time, he got a \u201ccorpse\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: Shitty Memory!(2)Translator: Sissy That WalkHearing what he said, Di Qiuhe grabbed He\u2019s arm tightly. His Adam\u2019s apple moved slightly, \u201cThis phone\u2026\u201d, he said in a low voice.\u201cIt belonged to my mum. After she and dad passed away, I continued to use it. Many daily messages of her and dad were kept in this phone, so I\u2019d like to browse them from time to time.\u201d He Bai explained in a few words and eased Di Qiuhe\u2019s arm to comfort him again, \u201cI conversed the screenshots of their messages into text files, so don\u2019t worry, and it\u2019s really my fault. Oh, by the way, why are you here?\u201dHow could text files be the same as the original messages?Di Qiuhe pulled back his hand obediently. He was glum deep inside to see He Bai trying to comfort him, bursting with various feelings and ideas that he himself could even not understand.\u201cI moved here and heard your voice when I passed by, so I came to you.\u201d He took the opportunity to change the topic and turned to the barbecue in the yard, \u201cWhat are you doing here? Visiting your friend? And\u2026who are you guys?\u201dThe security who had enjoyed the \u201cshow\u201d for a long time: \u201c\u2026We are nobody, just go on, please.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Niu Junjie and the cook who supported each other in water reminded others of their presence, \u201cAre you guys finished? Can we\u2026get on the ground and speak?\u201d Just now the atmosphere between He Bai and Di Qiuhe was weird, so he was not willing to interrupt them. Since their conversation was now at an end, he felt it safe to chip in.After all, the cook was really heavy and supporting him in water almost killed his arms\u2026He Bai was speechless and found that he had been so absorbed with the conversation with Di Qiuhe that he forgot there were other people in the yard. He hastened to jump into the pool and help them out.It was a false alarm. Having checked the alarming apparatus in the yard, the security left with strange expressions. Niu Junjie called the servants to lead Di Qiuhe and the cook into the house to get changed, while he and He Bai just wiped their body casually with towels. Draped in bath towels, they resumed their barbecue.\u201cWas that Di Qiuhe?\u201d Niu Junjie asked abruptly.He Bai gave him a strange glance, \u201cYes? You just called his name back then.\u201dNiu Junjie shook hands, \u201cNot the same thing. I used to see his videos and photos, now I see him in front of me. But I still want to confirm, as he seems a little bit different in the flesh after all\u2026\u201dHis voice faded. Suddenly, he turned his head towards the house and stealthily moved closer to He Bai, lowering his voice: \u201cBai, level with me, is that Di Qiuhe\u2026into you?\u201d Given the atmosphere between He Bai and Di Qiuhe, gee, it was impossible for others to interrupt them.He Bai looked at him with suspicion, \u201cYou are simply not in your right mind.\u201dNiu Junjie pressed down He Bai\u2019s shoulders and said seriously: \u201cDon\u2019t diver the topic. Tell the truth and I\u2019ll let it go.\u201dGlaring at him, He Bai threw Niu Junjie\u2019s hands and said in an earnest manner: \u201cMy dear friend, you should be weaned off indecent dramas, or you may be someone like Locke.\u201dLocke? That bold guy who had courted He Bai? He drew back his head a little with a cold shiver running down his spine. But he refused to give up: \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s different. I am asking you whether Di Qiuhe is\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d He Bai turned around and pushed a grilled shrimp into Niu Junjie\u2019s open mouth. He patted Niu on his shoulder and asked sincerely, \u201cWill you be into other two roommates?\u201dNiu Junjie trembled abruptly. Hand clamped over his mouth, he wanted to spit out that boiling shrimp.He Bai continued with a benevolent face: \u201cSo, never doubt our sexual orientation. Di Qiuhe likes girls, especially D-cup, leggy girls. He acted strangely just now because he blamed himself too much for the phone. Don\u2019t be silly, OK?\u201d\u201cD-cup leggy girls?\u201d Niu Junjie forgot his doubt instantly with bright eyes, \u201cWow, that guy has the same interest as me! No wonder he is the future poster man of our family, same taste, same taste!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have many videos about leggy D-cup girls, but you guys always refuse to enjoy them with me. However, Di Qiuhe is a mild person, if I invite him to share our experience in videos, will he\u2026\u201d Niu Junjie\u2019s filthy laughter interrupted his own words.\u201c\u2026Whatever.\u201dAfter changing clothes, Di Qiuhe saw that young man who had stood beside He Bai before bending his arm around He Bai\u2019s shoulder. He was speaking in high spirit. However, He Bai didn\u2019t resist at all, allowing his arms to \u201cintrude\u201d his body. He just roasted food on barbecue carefully, nodding occasionally, like a kind of echo.A sense of suppression attacked Di Qiuhe again, but seemingly different from the feelings before.He relaxed himself and loosened the ill-fitting clothes. Then he came to them with an increasing voice: \u201cBai, what are you roasting? They smell good.\u201dHe Bai and Niu Junjie glanced back as they heard his voice. Niu Junjie was gazing at Di Qiuhe\u2019s long legs, full of jealousy, \u201cDid you notice he\u2019s got a six-pack when his clothes got wet just now? Damn! I thought this gentle, mild guy must be weak and fragile.He Bai elbowed him and responded to Di Qiuhe. Then he told Niu Junjie in a low voice: \u201cThis is how you get along with your family\u2019s future poster man?\u201d\u201cCourse not!\u201d Niu Junjie immediately put on a serious face and freed his hands from He Bai\u2019s shoulder, grinning to Di Qiuhe. He also said in a low voice to He Bai: \u201cJust watch, man. My social ability is the best.\u201d Then he came to Di Qiuhe and rested his hands on Di Qiuhe\u2019s shoulder, saying loudly with a bright smile: \u201cHi, Qiuhe, are you hungry? Come on, have a taste of Bai\u2019s food. His cooking skill is not equal to uncle Hu, but not bad at least.\u201dHe Bai felt it too awkward to see him and turned back to continue his barbecue. The intertwinement of Di Qiuhe\u2019s annoying personality and Niu Junjie\u2019s weird behaviors, emmm, that\u2019s not too easy on the eye.\u201cOh yeah? Then I must have a taste.\u201d Di Qiuhe, who stopped avoiding Niu Junjie\u2019s arms, allowed Niu Junjie to put his arms around his shoulder. Di Qiuhe asked with a smile, \u201cSo, are you his classmate? I haven\u2019t known him for long, not mentioning his friends.\u201dSeeing him an easy-going person, Niu Junjie got more excited, \u201cMore than that, we are roommates! Good brothers! At first, I was not accustomed to the dormitory life, so he helped me make my bed for a long time and washed the sheet and quilt for me. He was a good mate.\u201d He thumbed up as he was talking.Di Qiuhe\u2019s smile turned stiff, but he covered it up soon. He followed Niu Junjie and sat down beside the barbecue. Watching He Bai\u2019s figure, he tried hard to clam down and asked: \u201cWell, he helped you wash quilt? That\u2019s so sweet, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cNot only quilt! Once I got sick and Bai asked time off to take care of me. He even washed my\u2026Oh, after that I counted him as my brother!\u201d Niu Junjie sat in front of He Bai, saying generously: \u201cSo, Bai\u2019s friend is also my friend. Just consider here as your own home. Feel free!\u201dHe Bai rolled his eyes, and swallowed a grilled meat.Di Qiuhe noticed He Bai sneak a taste, wearing a dangerous smile. He turned to Niu Junjie and moved closer, said moderately: \u201cBai is a great man, so we all like him. It\u2019s a pity that I only lived in dormitory for a short time due to my career\u2026\u201dAfter the cook came back, He Bai handed the barbecue job to him. He sat beside those two with a plate of meat in hand, only to find that they talked like good brothers.He Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201d I just left for a second to take some meat and add some coal, what happened to them?\u201cYeah! I thought he would be like other refined men, full of jealousy and hard to deal with, but I was wrong! I like his temperament, cheers!\u201d Niu Junjie raised a beer out of nowhere, excitedly.Di Qiuhe laughed and toasted with him, acting like an outgoing and generous person, \u201cYou flattered me, I\u2019m not as straightforward and free as you. I am still too constrained.\u201d\u201cOh man, that\u2019s so sweet.\u201d\u201cAll the words from my heart.\u201dThen, they kept toasting and drinking.He Bai gave Di Qiuhe a warning glance, indicating him to stop jerking his innocent roommate around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Shitty Memory!(3)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe gave a tender smile to He Bai and gazed at him with hands supporting the chin. Through Di\u2019s eyes, He Bai could see that he was tipsy, but also seductive.He Bai thought that he needed to jump into the water again to calm himself down.After the meal, it had already been dark. Niu Junjie was a cheap drunk, so he had succumbed to it and fallen on the table. Di Qiuhe on the other hand was also slightly drunk and dizzy. He Bai had tried to stop them from drinking too much but failed, so he was a little bit mad now. He called for the servants to carry Niu Junjie into house, and crossed his arms over his chest, watching Di Qiuhe rising from the chair wobblingly and then falling on the ground.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMy little puppy\u2026\u201d The drunk guy on the ground moved a little and stretched his hand, \u201cBai, sorry\u2026I love you\u2026\u201dHe Bai was baffled and pulled him up with a clouded face, patting his forehead, \u201cI must have been owed to you in my previous birth. Where there was you, there was ill luck. You will hassle yourself to death sooner or later!\u201dDi Qiuhe said something vaguely, with his body clinging to He Bai limply, rubbing against his face.He Bai pushed him away with dislike. When uncle Hu came, He Bai beckoned him over to help him.With a click, the room door was shut.Di Qiuhe, who seemed drunk and delirious just a second ago, woke up consciously now. He gave a look at the closed door, and then covered his eyes with hand. After a long sigh, he wrapped the quilt around himself unpleasantly.When he got up in the next morning, He Bai had already left for work. Niu Junjie invited him to stay but he refused politely and went home. After shower, he changed clothes and called his assistant, Wang. Then, he went to the Red Guest Studio directly.Frowned, Jiang Xiuwen looked his corpse-like friend lying on the sofa, asking madly, \u201cYou told me that you would be pretty occupied when you returned this time, but why do you lie on my sofa like a corpse now?\u201dDi Qiuhe turned around and watched him, asking in a weak voice, \u201cXiuwen\u2026am I really lame?\u201d\u201cYou finally realize that you are annoying and bothersome?\u201d, Jiang Xiuwen answered with a surprising face. Then he looked at him mildly, nodding, \u201cTrue indeed, you\u2019ve got a terrible temperament, but since you are aware of it, you can still make it up. Don\u2019t worry, take some medicine and you will get you chance to be normal.\u201dDi Qiuhe snorted in the blues and turned his back to him.It was strange that he should have not rebutted, so Jiang Xiuwen jabbed at him and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You seemed upset\u2026Your stepmother troubled you again?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Di Qiuhe shook his hand and buried himself in the pillow, \u201cJust wait.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his hand and pointed out of the window, \u201cToday, Saint Elephant Studio will be quite noisy, as Mr. Jia will come to confront them.\u201dJiang Xiuwen was confused at first, but then he was quite thrilled, \u201cConfront? By Mr. Jia? That\u2019s an evil day for Saint Elephant, isn\u2019t it?\u201d No wonder he was so excited. As door-to-door competitors, the unluckier the Saint Elephant was, the happier he was.By the afternoon, two low key SUVs parked at the entrance of Saint Elephant. As the car doors opened, an elder man and five or six middle-aged men got off.\u201cHere he is. His two sons, sons-in-law and an apprentice also comes. That\u2019s a big troop.\u201d\u201cJiang Xiuwen watched through the window, full of curiosity, \u201cHow had Saint Elephant offended him? Mr. Jia is noted for his good temper.\u201d\u201cBut also noted for shielding his children.\u201d Di Qiuhe picked up, leaning against the arm of sofa and watching outside, \u201cThey deserve it. Saint Elephant should have allowed an amateur to take birthday photos for his granddaughter. The birthday party is on the day after tomorrow, how can Mr. Jia not be angry after seeing such awful photos?\u201d Jiang Xiuwen gave an ill-mannered laugh, \u201cThat\u2019s insane. Mr. Jia has been devoted his life to photos. Who could be more particular than him about photos? Saint Elephant should have messed with his granddaughter like that.\u201d\u201cIsn't it just?\u201d Di Qiuhe responded emotionlessly, with hand reaching into the pocket and fumbling coins. He saw the manager of Saint Elephant hastily ushering Mr. Jia and others in, and then looked away, asserting: \u201cThe boss of Saint Elephant was very shortsighted and favored \u2018jobs for the boys\u2019. He will mess it up sooner or later.\u201dJiang Xiuwen was a little bit suspicious about that, \u201cBut I remembered that Saint Elephant hired a quite responsible director, who has charged everything. Could she allow the boss to do those stupid things?\u201d\u201cThat director has been suspended.\u201d Before he came back, Di Qiuhe had had this thing figured out. Since Jiang Xiuwen asked now, he told him all, \u201cThe director had intended to inform Mr. Jia that the originally decided young photographer had resigned, but Saint Elephant forced her to close her mouth, or they would fire her. Without any other means, she compromised and suggested that they could send Ma Xingtong to take the photos. However, somehow the boss believed Ma Xingtong\u2019s slanderous talk and allowed him to send his nephew, an inexperienced amateur, to take the job.\u201d\u201cHe might think that taking birthday photos is an easy job, which could be handled well by an amateur? Or they could resort to retouching?\u201d Since they were all in the same line, Jiang Xiuwen could guess the calculating of Saint Elephant\u2019s boss. This could work for an ordinary client. The worst situation was just a complaint. But when it came to Mr. Jia, it was totally ridiculous. As a professional photographer, he would have taken the photos himself if it had not been his terrible hand tremor.\u201cThey cannot blame anyone for their own stupid faults.\u201d Jiang Xiuwen shook his head and turned to his friend, \u201cBut how could you know those things? And, why didn\u2019t you tell me that before?\u201d\u201cYou ask me?\u201d Di Qiuhe turned around and looked at him, saying in a low voice: \u201cDo you remember the night when you hung up on me and said you were finished with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI have to go.\u201dJiang Xiuwen stopped him, \u201cTo where?\u201d\u201cHyping.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dDi Qiuhe waved his hand and took his bag, left.Jiang Xiuwen frowned, \u201cHe has become more mysterious during the time we haven\u2019t met\u2026\u201d But who was the photographer that Mr. Jia originally set eyes on? The young photographer that had left Saint Elephant\u2026Wait? A young man? Just resigned? That He Bai? The crazy fan of Di Qiuhe?He turned to the window abruptly, with hand scratching the window unconsciously.So, Di Qiuhe investigated all of this just to avenge for that fan? That was too much for him. Was there something wrong in his mind?Di Qiuhe\u2019s phone was off again. He Bai put down his cheap phone that was bought when he applied for another phone card. After packing up his things, he said goodbye to Niu Junjie. When he came back to dormitory, he knew that the haunting event was not real, so he was not afraid now.Li Ru called him suddenly the next day.\u201cHe, I have a presumptuous request.\u201d Li Ru said in a tired and hoarse voice, \u201cFirst I need to apologize to you. The day you resigned came a client, directly saying that he\u2019d like to book you, the young photographer who had taken anniversary photos for B City TV Station, to take the job. That client was influential, so the boss wanted to wield the opportunity to promote a new photographer, so he chose another in lieu of you without informing you.\u201dHe Bai was dumbfounded. The client that looked for him? The one that Di Qiuhe had said?\u201cIs this an elder man who wanted to take birthday photos for his granddaughter?\u201d He asked hurriedly.It threw Li Ru in surprise a little, \u201cHow do you know that? No, I don\u2019t mean that. It\u2019s just\u2026Anyway, the studio should apologize to you.\u201dFrowned, He Bai asked straightly: \u201cCan I interpret it as your business with that elder man is going wrong? What can I do for you?\u201d\u201cYes, it is. Ma Qun took the job this time, and Ma Xingtong directed him during the whole process. However, the photos were\u2026After being retouched, these photos actually had reached the normal standard of Saint Elephant, but the client himself was a professional photographer, quite sensitive to retouching, so\u2026\u201d Li Ru herself also thought her words untenable, so her voice got lower and lower, \u201cNow Saint Elephant hope that you can represent the studio to deliver an apology to that client and take another set of photos as compensation. The studio would like to pay you 5 times the original price.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s face clouded, \u201cAbove all, I don\u2019t care about that \u20185 times the original price\u2019; I will try to contact that elder man and compensate him with another set of photos, not in name of Saint Elephant, but myself instead. This chance was created by my friend, so I don\u2019t want to let him down and let him be complained by this older man; at last, I understand it is Saint Elephant that sends you to talk with me. They think that, to oblige you, I will help them to take care of this awful mess. But I can give you a definite answer, I\u2019ll not. Moreover, I will issue a statement on the Internet to clarify the fact that I have resigned from Saint Elephant. I don\u2019t allow Saint Elephant to use my popularity that I have gained through my good luck to do something going against my own principles any more. Saint Elephant deprived my opportunity, and now they want me to deal with the aftermath. This is an absolutely unequal treaty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Shitty Memory!(4)Translator: Sissy That Walk\"Xiao He\u2026\" Li Ru didn't know how to respond to his tough attitude.\"Miss Li.\" He Bai interrupted her and lowered his voice: \"I don't want to ask why you didn't tell me privately that a client had gone there for me. You have to listen to your boss, I understand. But that doesn't mean that I can give up my principle out of mercy. Saint Elephant ignores the demands of clients and only cares about its own development. This kind of studio cannot survive long. Do you want to waste your career in that hopeless place?\"Li Ru fell into silence. She recalled the recent suspension announcement and her years of devotion to making Saint Elephant stronger, all of which upset her\"I understand\", she took a slight breath and picked up again, forcing a smile: \"I still owe you an apology. This is also my fault. I will convey your idea to Saint Elephant, thank you, Xiao He.\"Then she hung up. Watching the off-line calling interface, He Bai relaxed his shoulders and gave a sigh, then a new message came.Li Ru: The elder man's contact number is 13XXX. After this mess, I will resign from Saint Elephant and try in other companies. Sorry and thanks, see you.He Bai was shocked and then type with a smile.He Bai: See you, and look forward to the next meeting.\"Master Di, you really decide to leave in advance?\" Assistant Wang was a little bit hesitant, \"The boss has begun to investigating Assistant An, and he wants to meet you. I don't think it is a good idea to leave now.\"\"No, it's very good.\" Di Qiuhe glanced at the hot issues and shut down the computer, saying emotionlessly, \"Oh, he wants to see me now and I have to go for him? And when he doesn't want to see me, I have to be kept under surveillance? What am I? A dog? The training is very tight. The crew has already urged me back during my days of absence, so I have to return now.\"After hearing what he said, Assistant Wang dared not to continue, so he packed up luggage quietly.\"You\u2026\" Di Qiuhe said abruptly.Assistant Wang turned to him instantly, ready for any orders, \"At your disposal!\"Di Qiuhe looked at his dumb face, and the pictures where his little puppy sat beside the pool with phone in his hand flashed in his mind. He looked down and shook his head, \"Nothing, just pack up the things. I'm going out for a while.\"\"The flight is tonight\u2026\"\"Don't worry, I'll make it.\" Di Qiuhe interrupted him and took his bag, \"You go to the airport first and don't forget to comfort Assistant An when you're free.\"Assistant Wang got rigid, and responded with a lowering head.A fragile woman was the best target to pick up. The \"honey trap\" was a good trap, but if you could follow this trap return a \"handsome trap\", that will be perfect.The sun had not set yet. The heat in summer still swept over the campus of Q University, making people fidgety.At the end of the road came a familiar figure. Di Qiuhe, who sat on the bench under the tree raised his head, gazing at He Bai. He passed Di Qiuhe by, obsessed with his camera. Di Qiuhe stood up with a smile and approached him. He stretched his remaining ice cream to He Bai's face, asking: \"If you behave well, I will buy you an ice cream.\"He Bai was shocked, staring at the pink strawberry-flavor ice cream, with a faint sneer hanging on his lips. He grabbed the ice cream and rubbed its package against Di Qiuhe's face. He grinded his teeth, \"Your childish behavior will buy you a punch sooner or later!\"\"Then go ahead.\" Di Qiuhe allowed him to wet his face and threw back his shoulder, \"I have a well-built body and will not be hurt, come on, punch me.\"\"There you go again.\" He Bai saw his forehead full of sweats and noticed the scorching weather, withdrew his hands and frowned. He brought out wet tissue from his camera bag and threw it in Di Qiuhe's arms, waving: \"Come on, go to my dormitory to enjoy the air condition. Why are you here? Want to see me for something? By the way, I cannot get through to your phone, why? I don't know whether it's your phone's problem or mine. I cannot contact you anyway.\"Di Qiuhe wore a smile, quite pleasant, \"What, you miss me? I shut down the phone as I don't want some annoying people find me. It won't happen again.\"\"I would rather miss the pancake sold in the south gate than miss you.\" He Bai said and went ahead alone, and continued, \"How is your training in the frontier province? Don't mail me fruits, I cannot eat them up. And, you said in the message that my photographing job was stolen by Saint Elephant. They messed it up. You'd better call that elder man and don't let him misunderstand you. I'll fix it, I was careless this time\u2026Why are you standing there still? Let's go.\"He turned back and found that Di Qiuhe didn't follow him, and his eyebrows rose, \"What're you doing here? Need I carry you with eight sedan-chairs?\"Di Qiuhe lowered his head and smiled, waving at him, \"Maybe next time. I've got a flight to catch tonight, gotta go. Don't worry about Mr. Jia, I'll help you fix it. My little puppy, on the Internet they all say I'm 23 now, but that's nominal age. I'm turning 23 this September.\"He Bai: \"So?\"\"When my birthday comes, I will make you willing to call me brother.\" Di Qiuhe announced with a big smile and waved his hand, striding away.\"What? Come back! Don't leave!\" He Bai was baffled and then tried to chase him, \"You ungrateful brat have to piss me off every day, don't you?\"Ultimately, he failed to catch the leggy Di Qiuhe. In a sweat, He Bai returned to the dormitory building, but was stopped by the supervisor of the building.\"You've got a package. A handsome boy wearing a hat delivered it here. I don't know what it is. He doesn't wear uniform or drive expressing car.\"A big box was pressed on his chest. He Bai lowered his head and examined it and immediately recalled Di Qiuhe's dress today. He smiled and thanked the supervisor, returning to his dorm.\"It's so heavy, what is it?\"After turning on the air condition, he tore of the package with scissors and opened the box.There were two boxes in it, a big one and a small one. He put down the scissors and checked the small one first. When he opened it, he was shocked.Two phones lied in it. One was the same type as his old one, and the other was the Apxle's newest phone, which was very expensive and perfect to show off.\"That guy\u2026\" He picked up the old one and turned it on familiarly. Then he was speechless, but eyes full of warmth, \"I've told him it's OK, he should have taken it serious\u2026\"It took some time for an old phone to turn on, so he put it down and opened that bigger box.A brand-new camera jumped into his eyes, the same type as the one Mr. Xu had lent him, but this one was the newest.With hand on the box got stiffed, he didn't know how to react.'What is he doing\u2026'Ding-dong, the old phone suddenly vibrated-a new message came.He was dumbfounded and put down the box lid and picked up the new but also old phone.He found that the operator was some telecommunication company and beside that was an unread message.So, he clicked it open.Brother Di: This is my new private number. This former one has become my working number, operated by my assistant. You can call this number to contact me. P.S.Sorry for the loss of your parents' messages. As compensation, I've decided to use the same phone as you so that we can create sweet memories as your parents'.Brother Di: Don't be too touched. This is what a big brother should do.He Bai was totally speechless, his mixed feeling about these expensive gifts disappearing instantly.'Sweet memories? Don't be so touched? Big brother?'Brother Di: My little Brother? Are you too surprised?He Bai: Screw you! You can never be my big brother! And, my parents' memories are about love, romantic love. Can our memories be the same as theirs? Totally different!Brother: I don't see any difference?How dare him contradict me!He Bai: I don't see anything same?Brother Di: Everything is the same.He Bai's face distorted with fury. The air condition was on, but his nose got sweaty. He Bai cannot help swearing: \"Go screw our memories! We can create nothing but shit! You dumb idiot! It is the unluckiest thing for me to know you!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: Candid Photos(1)Translator: Sissy That WalkAlthough mad, He Bai still replied a message to express his gratitude and asked what gift he would like in return.\"My little puppy.\" Di Qiuhe said pleasantly with a smile, \"I want you to make steak for me.\"He Bai restrained his desire to scold him and stood under the air condition to calm down. \"Change it up, steak is too cheap.\" The gift was a token of the other's regard, so he would not reject it, but the present in return must be in equal value. That's how friendship lasted.\"No, I insist.\" Di Qiuhe watched the passing objects outside the car window with a lazy posture, \"And I would like you to make a cake for me, wish me happy birthday and company me to set off fireworks on the riverbank.\"He Bai was confused, \"So you want me to celebrate your birthday with you?\"\"Yes.\" Di Qiuhe turned his gaze and played the coins in his hand. His eyes glittered with nostalgia for the days of yore, \"My mum passed away when I was four. Before that, she had promised me to celebrate birthday for me. Then my stepmother came\u2026At that time, my grandfather controlled the whole Huangdu, so she dared not to show her wicked idea on me in front of him. She appeared as an understanding wife and a loving mother, spoiling me as possible as she could. Every year she would hold a grand party for me, but I don't like them at all.\"He Bai ran his fingers through his unsmooth hair that had been dried by the air condition and sat back to the table. He lowered his voice, \"OK, I promise you. I'll celebrate your birthday with you and company you to set off fireworks.\" As he recalled, Di Qiuhe's brother Di Xiasong was four years younger than him, which meant his stepmother had been pregnant for several months when Di Qiuhe's mother passed away\u2026Father's liaison, mother's death, mistress's appearance and a younger brother's birth\u2026These were the dark secrets behind his family. No wonder Di Qiuhe was cynical and indifferent every time his families were mentioned, and his father was no exception.\"My little puppy, you really know how to make my happy.\" Di Qiuhe held the coin tightly and continued after a pause: \"But I was spoiled by Qin Li anyway. If it had not been my grandpa, I could have been a fop now. Year after year, I grow up yet my grandpa got older. When I was 14, my stepmother pushed father to take over Huangdu from my grandpa. Due to the sudden bouts of anger and anxiety, grandpa fell ill and stayed in hospital. At that time, I finally saw my father's guard to me and my stepmother's hypocrisy and malice. Several years later, my grandpa passed away, and my father ultimately controlled Huangdu. Half a year later, when I was 15, my stepmother, who believed that she had totally controlled my family business, started to marginalize me.\"Maybe the setting temperature of the air condition was too low, He Bai felt a little bit cold suddenly.\"So, my little puppy, don't block me again.\" Di Qiuhe's voice got milder with a touch of sadness and ingratiation, \"Or you can inform me first before you block me and tell me why. It would be better if you can tell me when to release me.\"He Bai: \u2026\"\"Given my miserable childhood, can you give me a chance to be your nice big brother?\"\"I trust you without hesitation, so you can also trust me.\"\"I'm getting to the airport, gotta go, bye.\"(The phone was bleeping)He Bai put down the phone and pressed his forehead, giving a long, bewildering sigh.So, after all this, Di Qiuhe wanted to convey one thought: he had a miserable childhood, so you should not blame him for his annoying temperate, and you should be generous, never mad at him. If you wanted to be mad, that's fine, but you couldn't block him and must tell him why you were mad. It depended on his mood that if he would improve or not. See, he had been so nice to you, so you had to be nice to him too. If you could call him big brother, that would be best.Maybe his feelings were a little bit different, but the core meaning was similar to that\u2026He Bai had never seen such a person who tried to ingratiate with others by his miserable experience but in a justified and confident manner! What a nerve!His heart was still softened shamefully. While He Bai said nothing, Di Qiuhe should have kept saying so much. It was obvious that he had foreseen that He Bai would be touched.He was such a Film Emperor who was good at exploiting others' sympathy.He complained in his heart, but still picked out the cheap phone that he had bought before from the pocket. He pulled out the SIM card and inserted it into the old type phone given by Di Qiuhe. Fortunately, this phone supported dual-cards, or he would have to bring two phones everywhere, which was indeed annoying.He sighed anxiously, and then put the cheap phone and Apxxx Phone side by side on the table, giving a sad sigh again.How should he deal with these two phones?The number Li Ru gave him belonged to Jia Zhang. The girl that took the birthday photos was his daughter.\"I know you.\"Different from his expectation, his attitude was kind and even somehow guilty, \"I have known the details from Qiuhe. I'm sorry to hear that you were fired by Saint Elephant.\"He Bai was baffled and replied cautiously: \"Fired? I\u2026uh\u2026Anyway, I am sorry.\" He Bai didn't know what story Di Qiuhe had told them. He said some vague words and then apologized.\"It's not your fault. It's Saint Elephant that has cheated both of us. That's far across the line.\" When he mentioned Saint Elephant, Jia Zhang was still angry. When he calmed down a little, he said: \"So, why did Mr. He came for me? You can be assured that we will not blame you, as you are totally innocent in this event. Don't worry.\"\"No, you've mistaken my purpose. I am not worried about being blamed.\" He Bai explained hurriedly and clarified his purpose briefly, saying with guilt: \"Anyway, if allowed, I hope to compensate your daughter by taking a new set of birthday photos, with my own name.\"Jia Zhang was silent. It was obvious that he did a double-take.\"He Bai was uneasy, fearing that his words might contradict with Di Qiuhe's story, which could make He's family blame him more. Therefore, all the words that he had prepared before had been in vain.It took half a minute for Jia Zhang to respond.\"I appreciate your work ethic, but I need to inquire my father and daughter first before I give you an answer, sorry.\"\"Of course, it would be better.\" He Bai released a sigh of relief, and didn't put down the phone until the other side hung up.Jai Zhang hadn't rejected, which was better than expectation. He smiled and called Di Qiuhe instantly. It was urgent to check if their words were consistent.\u2026But both of Di Qiuhe's phones died.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Candid Photos (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkThat damned confined training!He grinded his teeth angrily.An hour later, Jia Zhang called back, but it was the old gentleman that spoke.\"He Bai?\"He Bai was shocked by this old voice, hustling to reply, \"Yes, it is. Greetings, sir.\"\"Well.\" The old voice was smooth and indifferent without any emotions, \"I heard that you are Qiuhe's junior schoolmate? Which major are you in? How is your academic performance? And who is your photography teacher?\"His questions were a little bit strange.\"Yes, Mr. Di is my senior. I major in journalism. As for my grades\u2026I've never failed. And my photography teacher is Mr. Xu Yinrong.\" He answered as brief as possible as he couldn't figure out the elder man's mind.The old gentleman responded emotionlessly, and asked after a pause, \"When did you resign from Saint Elephant?\"He Bai told him the date and hold his breath unconsciously.\"I see.\" The old gentleman said and paused. It seemed that he turned around and said something to the person next to him, then replied: \"The birthday party will start at 8 pm tomorrow. The guests will begin arriving around 6. The birthday photos will be played in loop on the screen at 7. So, if you have confidence to give me a new set before 7 pm tomorrow, the job is yours.\"Then he hung up. An address was sent to He Bai a minute later.He Bai gazed at the address dully for 2 minutes and suddenly jumped from the chair as if his butt had been stuck by a needle. He hurriedly turned on the laptop and searched this address. It was a vacation resort on the outskirts, which featured an ecological garden. He Bai had an idea and packed up his things, taixing to Yika.\"You want to borrow elf series to take photos?\" Lin Xia frowned slightly. She never thought that He Bai should have made such an unusual request.He Bai understood the meaning of her eyes, and realized that he was too impulsive. So, he scratched his face and explained, \"It's just that an idea flashed in my mind. Elf series is not featured, so it is not selected as the promotional photos\u2026Sorry, I am too silly.\"He just thought that it was a win-win method. On the one hand, the elf series could be promoted, and Mr. He's photos could also be polished. However, in face of Lin Xia, He Ba realized that it was a stupid idea.The promotion of each brand had its own decided plan. Such an abrupt request was indeed unprofessional.\"Sorry.\" He Bai apologized sincerely.Looking at his poor and self-blaming look, Lin Xia was less unpleasant about his request. Instead, her heart was softened and felt a little bit amusing. She comforted He Bai with a mild voice: \"You are still young. It's normal for you to come up with some unusual ideas, which can give you more inspiration. That's good, tell me why you want to use elf series.\"Her better attitudes made He Bai feel more foolish. He lowered his head and told her all.\"Wait, who would wear the elf series?\" Lin Xia interrupted him when she heard a name.He Bai stopped the topic and answered: \"The granddaughter of Mr. Jia Sheng, Miss Jia Beilei.\"Lin Xia got excite. \"Jia Sheng? The famous director that won numerous international awards?\"He Bai was scared by her shining eyes and stepped back unconsciously. He nodded, \"Yes, I had intended to borrow elf series for her granddaughter's birthday photos\u2026\"\"How many people will see them?\" Lin Xia went straight to the point and became serious.Seeing she getting urgent and interested, He Bai felt the possibility and explained more specifically, \"This is the 18th birthday party for Miss Jia Beilei, so it will be quite grand. All the people who have cooperated with Mr. Jia may attend. These photos will be played in loop on the party, which means all of the guests can see them.\"All the people who have cooperated wit Mr. Jia could see them\u2026which meant, half of the people in the biz would see these photos, see our elf series! And they would definitely post some photos on Wei Bo, including the photos of girl of the day\u2026Indeed, this was a brilliant promoting chance! Besides, it could serve as a stepping stone for our princess series and little mermaid series! \"Let's do it!\" Lin Xia banged the table excitedly and picked up the phone on the table, \"I am asking the apparel department to bring you the elf series. By the way, bring the team that produced previous promotional photos. These are the birthday photos of Mr. Jia's granddaughter, make sure you nail it! Show him your best!\" He Bai was baffled and then ecstatic. He didn't expect that she could have given the permission so quickly, what a windfall!Therefore, when Jia Beilei and his father welcomed the legendary Photographer Mr. He, they saw a whole professional team. Jia Zhang was shocked by this grand team, but then satisfied with it. As a father, it was pleasant and proud to see they attached so much importance to her daughter's birthday photos.\"So, I can count on you about my daughter's birthday photos.\" He held He Bai's hand with a bright smile, more and more satisfied with this young man. After the handshake and greeting, He Bai turned to Lin Xia and introduced the team, \"Mr. Jia, this is the manager of Yika Apparel Company and its brand Little Mermaid, Miss. Lin, Lin Xia. She is my boss now. Knowing that I am going to take birthday photos for Miss. Jia Beilei, she gave me the whole team. If it were not her support, I would not have dared to take the task alone.\"This was a huge boost for Lin Xia and Yika, which satisfied Lin Xia. Hence, in turn she also praised He Bai's excellent skills and his \"brave request to take photos for Miss Jia Beilei with unreleased clothes\" during the greeting.Hearing their words, Jia Zhang could understand why she bring the whole team with her, but he didn't care about it. He knew Yika, whose brands were pretty good. Since He Bai had been quite serious and motivated to his daughter's birthday photos, it was not a problem to use several clothes of his company.\"I want to extend my gratitude to Mr. He and Miss. Lin, thank you very much.\" He said impressively. The he waved to a smiling young lady behind him, \"Beilei, come to greet manager Lin and others.\"He Beilei came over with a smile. She first greeted with Lin Xia politely and then looked that He Bai with a brighter smile, calling sweetly: \"Brother He!\"All of them fell into silence. Jia Zhang coughed awkwardly and pulled his daughter back, explaining: \"She was quite out-going, especially to handsome young man. No offence.\"This was the simplest interpretation for face-judgers, Lin Xia grumbled in her mind.It was a mysterious feeling for He Bai to be called brother suddenly. But he only replied vaguely, fearing that Jia Zhang might be unhappy about it. He told Jia Zhang just called him Xiao He.Jia Zhang accepted his advice and welcomed them into the resort.Along the way there were balloons and colored ribbons, but without any other guests. It was obvious that they had made the block booking.\"Book a whole holiday resort to treat guest? It was really a grand birthday party. You won a huge business for our company. You will get your bonus.\" Lin Xia said in a low voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Candid Photos (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai was surprised to find that such a stable and mature woman would also whisper. After that, he said: \"I hadn't thought that we could have such a big opportunity\u2026We have to get on with some serious hard work.\" So, what a huge opportunity Di Qiuhe had earned for him\u2026Lin Xia nodded, \"Yes, we must work hard!\"After a short talk, the car had arrived at the main building of this resort. Jia Zhang and his followers got out of the car and led other people in. He left after a few words, leaving two female assistants to company Jia Beilei. He made himself scarce in case he might burden them, as the time was already very tight.He Bai had found suitable locations on the way. After Jia Zhang left, he immediately asked the team to start. When the team headed to the locations to prepare, he brought the photos of elf series to Jia Beilei, telling her the arrangement of photography.\"Miss Jia, you don't have to pose for the camera later. The locations I chose are surrounded by trees, on which the fruits have ripened. So, you just need to take the basket and walk around, picking some fruit and flowers. The lighting operators will cooperate with you as best as he can, so will I. So, just relax.\"Jia Beilei was a tall, beautiful girl, who exactly matches the fairy-spirit design concept of elf series. She listened to He Bai carefully and browsed all the photos of elf series with blinking eyes, asking excitedly, \"Am I really the first to wear them?\"After all she was a just a young lady, who could not reject the attraction of beautiful clothes.\"Yes, you are.\" He Bai smiled at her. The dimple on his left face gave him some childishness, which would made anyone drop the guard and feel affectionate, \"You are very tall, Miss Jia, so the clothes suit you well.\"Jia Beilei smiled more brightly, \"Don't call me Miss Jia, that's too distant. Just call me Beilei or Leilei. The photos you took for sister Xiao Fu are very amazing, I like them. Will you take the same wonderful photos for me?\"He Bai was a little bit surprised, \"Jia\u2026Beilei knew Miss Yang?\"Jia Beilei rubbed her chin when she heard He Bai called Yang Fu \"Miss Yang\". She laughed in a low voice and replied: \"Of course. She is my future sister-in-law. She is engaged to my brother.\"There should have been such a relationship.He Bai nodded, \"Congratulations to them.\"He Bailei suddenly lowered her head and laughed secretly.He Bai: \"\u2026\" He wondered whether he had said something funny.\"You are exactly what sister Xiao Fu described-polite to the extent of 'straight'.\" Jia Beilei raised her head and burst out a red-faced smile, \"You are a good-looking young man, but speak like my father. That's so funny. Uh\u2026no offence. I just think you are amiable and good-temperate photographer, much better than those in Saint Elephant who are portentous.\"He Bai didn't know how to respond, so he just gave a smile. Nowadays, young men were also lively and changeable, which was difficult for him to be used to. In this term, Di Qiuhe was a good boy with consistent temperate--- always annoying.Photographing began in a joyful and harmonious atmosphere. As he said, He Bai didn't ask Jia Beilei to do any poses. He just allowed her to do whatever she wanted. For fear of her awkwardness, he also put a rabbit in her basket.Wearing the elf series suit and make-up, Jia Beilei's new appearance was even more beautiful. She carried the edge of her skirt and looked at the rabbit in her basket with surprise, asking with a slightly higher voice, \"How do you know I like rabbit? Thank you! This is the best birthday gifts I've received this year.\"He Bai paused for a while and stopped the make-up artist who had intended to say something, smiling, \"Good to see you love it. Go ahead, now the sunlight is brilliant.\"Jia Beilei nodded joyfully and went to the deep of the botanic garden with her rabbit. The lighting operator followed her hurriedly and spared enough space for He Bai to take photos.Lin Xia stepped forward to He Bai, who was adjusting his camera and told him in a low voice, \"Nice one on the rabbit, you are very considerate.\"\"\u2026\" He Bai just sympathized with an elder woman who sold rabbits, so he bought one. It was really a beautiful coincidence. He had intended to send the rabbit to his university's animal rescue association.Sunlight dipped into the garden through the gaps of leaves. A young lady with green chiffon skirt was wandering pleasantly. She might pick the fruit, held a flower or played with the rabbit, which was as beautiful as a fine painting. Occasionally, the shutter clicked, producing a harmonious sound with birds and butterflies.The sunset was near, and the last set of photos was finished. Except Jia Beili, who could enjoy blowing machine, other workers had been drown with sweats.\"Thank you for your hard work.\" Jia Beilei looked at the workers with guilt, with the rabbit in her arms, \"Sorry, I have been too fond of playing. You must be very tired.\"\"No, no, never mind.\" The whole team comforted her that it was fine.The manager of the resort showed up in time and led others to taking shower. He Bai still stayed with Jia Beilei and told her the key points of retouching in details, asking for her opinions.\"He, you are really responsible. I almost fall in love with you.\" Finally, Jia Beilei stopped calling him \"Brother He\". She sat down and allowed her assistant to remove make-up and take off the ornaments on the hair. She gazed at He Bai with much admiration, \"You are so amiable. When I go to the university, I will find a boyfriend as kind as you.\"\"\u2026You definitely will.\" He Bai stepped back and kept a distance. He didn't to be mistaken as a wretched man who wanted to abduct a girl.\"You have also worn out. Go have a rest.\" Jia Beilei said kindly.He Bai followed her advice and prepared to leave. But before that, he asked whether she had any plans this night.\"Yep. I have a party with my friends tonight. Personally, I would like to invite you, but you know, girlfriends party, so no boy.\" Jia Beilei cupped her face in her hands, sighing sadly, \"I know they will all like you, so it may be wise to not invite you. At least they will not distract your attention from me.\"\"\u2026Actually, I kinda want to join.\"Jia Beilei stared at him with shock, \"What? You want to take my girls?!\"How did she come up with this conclusion.\"No.\" He Bai was utterly dumbfounded. He explained, \"The 18th birthday is the most important one in your life, so I want to take some photos when you spend this special occasion with your families and friends. I can be disguised into a waiter, so you can ignore me completely.\"Jia Beilei blinked, \"Good idea, why haven't I thought of that before! You are really amazing!\"\"I thought it would be a rude request.\"\"Not at all! I like it!\"So, that was settled. After dinner, the working team left first while He Bai stayed here and continued his photographing.After a day-long training, Di Qiuhe turned on his phone secretly. After a thought, he chose to chat with his little dog on Wechat.Cute Bird Born in Autumn: Evening Bai, what're doing? ^-^He received He Bai's reply after ten minutes.Little Little White: Evening, I'm taking candid photos for beautiful girls.The water that Di Qiuhe just opened fell on the ground. He was overwhelmed by shock, confusion, and then anger and somewhat jealousy.Cute Bird Born in Autumn: What? Candid photos?!Cute Bird Born in Autumn: No!!! Stop!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Woof Woof (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai didn\u2019t reply, presumably engaged in \u201csecretly photographing\u201d the girls.\u201cYou bastard, little puppy!\u201d Staring at the chat page, Di Qiuhe kept tapping on the screen. Meanwhile, he kept picturing that little puppy crouching down in the grass or hiding behind the parterre secretly photographing beautiful girls in the way he once did to him.\u201cAlready told you to behave yourself. Why don\u2019t you listen to me?\u201d He started pacing back and forth out of rage and kicked the mineral water bottle away. The gentleness had gone completely, and instead he looked irritated.After pacing for a while, he couldn\u2019t help but send a message.A Bird Born in Autumn: Turn off your camera right now. Delete the photos and go back to sleep! No more secret photography! Reasons? That\u2026. that\u2019s because it\u2019s wrong to secretly photograph girls! Absolutely wrong! This is way over the line! What were you thinking?He was in the locker room right now as his training was just over and his vest was still sweaty. With his sweaty, newly cut hair and his furious face, he looked rather masculine and wildly sexy.When Wang Boyi walked in, he saw such a different Di Qiuhe. He halted his steps and stooped down to pick up the mineral water bottle on the ground. After pausing for a while, he stepped forward and whispered \"Mr. Di, the martial arts choreographer sends me over to check up on you and ask why you haven\u2019t gone out yet. Is the water supply got suspended again in the bathroom right next to the changing room?\u201dDi Qiuhe turned to look at him with abstruse eyes and didn\u2019t reply.Lowering his head, Wang Boyi looked away to avoid eye contact with him. His body slightly tightened when he saw his pectoral and abdominal muscles through the vest, \u201cAlso, tomorrow is Miss Jia\u2019s birthday. We have finished the preparation work for the coming media coverage and the studio needs to know when you would like to release it.\u201d As he was saying that, he gradually lowered his head as a sign of subservience.At the very beginning when he was threatened by Di Qiuhe, he simply felt unfair and unlucky that he should get the goods on him. But ever since he saw Di Qiuhe\u2019s secret crazy team, he had become completely convinced and had grown terrified of this man.There were a lot of showbiz-related marketing accounts and paparazzi teams operating on the Internet. On one hand, the stars hated them, on the other hand, they relied on them. Because they were usually the necessary evils whenever those stars needed help hyping up their events, propping up their popularities, or starting a smear campaign.This kind of business had only truly become a thing for these few years and it\u2019s the product of the rapidly developing Internet. He did not know much about them, but he had dealt with them several times when he worked for the big boss.They were a bunch of mean profiteers who actually took pride in what they were doing. He despised them and mocked them inwardly, but he never thought that the most fanatical bunch among them would be Di Qiuhe\u2019s men.No, to describe them as a group of people would be a mild understatement. In fact, they were rather like a bunch of loyal dogs raised by Di Qiuhe and would bite whoever Di Qiuhe asked them to. Among those dogs, there were respected commentators who appeared to be neutral, and there were also notorious jerks, Internet celebrities who either were famous for being funny or blunt-speaking. The mixed types made it almost impossible for people to realize that they all actually belonged to the same team.He finally realized that it wasn\u2019t bad luck that he got caught. It was because he had been deliberately targeted ever since he was assigned to Di Qiuhe.Di Qiuhe was only 23 years old this year, but many of his minions had been popular for seven or eight years. That\u2019s to say, Di Qiuhe had been controlling those people since he was a teenager at the age of fourteen or fifteen.That was simply too terrible a hypothesis, one which was beyond anyone\u2019s imagination.\"What are you thinking?\"Di Qiuhe asked in a such a composed and cold manner that his casual tone led people to feel like he didn\u2019t mean anything by asking this question. Wang Boyi was startled upon hearing this question, but he soon regained his composure. After taking a step back and a deep breath, he replied, \u201cYes, Mr. Di. I was thinking about when you organized the team.\u201d By now he had known a thing or two about how to deal with Di Qiuhe, which was that you could make mistake, but you should never lie to him. \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t me who arranged this.\u201d Di averted his eye contact. He put the phone into his pocket and opened the locker. \u201cThat\u2019s a gift from my grandpa.\u201dIn shock, Wang Boyi suddenly looked up at him.Who would have thought that it was actually a legacy passed down from the retired Chairman! Back then it was rumored all over the company that the retired Chairman had a deep affection for his grandson but was unsatisfied with his only son. To quash this rumor, the old chairman even went so far as to fire a large number of senior managers.He once heard from a laid-off senior staff that the retire Chairman had a very important resource in hand, and he did not pass it on to the next chairman but instead to his grandson Di Qiuhe. From a few occasional conversations he had with the chairman, he found that the sitting chairman seemed also suspicious about the authenticity of the rumor. However, after he had removed most of the senior staffs of Huang Du until there was virtually no one who had known about this grandson Di Qiuhe, Di Bian gradually dropped his suspicion as he had now controlled everything in Huang Du. On the contrary, the supposedly empowered Di Qiuhe after receiving the old chairman\u2019s secret heritage had become weaker and weaker ever since. A capable man, no doubt, but he seemed like such an easy target to be picked on.But all these were just facades! Di Qiuhe was not an easy target at all! He was a wolf in disguise!Maybe the team wasn\u2019t the only thing that Di Qiuhe inherited. The old chairman built Huang Du from scratch and he must have had some underhand resources. The current operation of Huang Du seemed so too legit and not at all smooth and aggressive like how it used to be when it was captained by the retired Chairman.\u201cTell the martial arts choreographers that my stomach feels funny and so I won\u2019t be having the midnight snack with them. I gotta take a rain check.\u201d After taking out clean clothes, he waved to Wang Boyi and turned around to the bathroom. \u201cAssistant Wang, you can think about me all you want, but you do well to keep your mouth shut. I am not the type to dwell on the unpleasant past but going forward you must follow my lead.\u201dWang Boyi suddenly realized that he had been in a trance for a while, and so he hurriedly replied in a respectful manner, \"Yes, Mr. Di.\" Maybe he had had some other thoughts about Di before, but now...... He dared not think about them anymore.The man in the mirror was very young, yet he was wearing a somewhat sullen look on his face. Di Qiuhe raised his hand to wipe off the mist on the mirror and curled up his lips a little bit until gradually a gentle smile broke out on his face.\"I am not angry.\"He tapped on the mirror and looked away from his phone beside the washbasin. He curled up his lips, \u201cNothing. A naughty little brother has been acting up recently, that\u2019s all. It takes time to discipline him.\u201dSnap.He took down the towel from his neck in one quick swing and hung it onto the steel towel rack. The gentle look on his face was no more and with a frown, he took out his phone to search for He Bai\u2019s number, then he dialed his number, all the while gritting his teeth, \u201cHow dare you take photo of these girls like a pervert? A brat like you deserves a good spanking! This kind of obscenity ends right now!\u201d\u201cHello?\u201d He Bai answered over the phone in bewilderment, and on the background were the birthday song and girl\u2019s laughter. \u201cWhy do you call me now. The training is over? Yeah, right. I\u2019m at Miss Jia\u2019s birthday party to take photos for her and Mr. Jia Er has just mentioned you. What did you tell him? Why would he think that I was fired by the Saint Elephant?Upon hearing that, all Di Qiuhe\u2019s anger and the strong desire to yell suddenly vanished. He racked his brain to come up with a logical explanation and yet found none. Coincidentally, he spotted the twisted look on his face in the mirror while he was turning his head around. His body froze a bit and he quickly covered the phone camera as if he was afraid of being seen by the man on the other side.\"Hello? Why aren\u2019t you speaking? Did you butt dial me? Wait, is that water splashing?\u201dIn the mirror was a man awkwardly covering the phone camera. It wasn\u2019t a pretty scene to look at.Putting down the phone, Di Qiuhe turned his back to the mirror. Then he leaned on the washbasin, and said with a cough, \u201cI just get out of the shower and water sound you heard came from the bathroom. Anyway, you said you are taking photos for Miss Jia at her birthday party?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Woof Woof (2)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cYes. I\u2019m still shooting now. Miss Jia and her friends are enjoying the party. They are singing Happy Birthday now.\u201d Being present at a birthday party surely put He Bai in a good mood and he was more talkative than before. \u201cHow about I shoot a set of photos for you at your next birthday party? Just like today, you could play with friends, and I will be taking photos around you.\u201d He thought it\u2019s more interesting to celebrate the birthday with more people. It would be a bit boring if there were only two of them.\u2018So that explains those photos...\u2019 Di Qiuhe finally felt relaxed and put on a smile on his face. But in his heart, he was poking the little puppy\u2019s dimples out of rage. \u2018He just doesn\u2019t know when to shut up,\u2019 thought Di Qiuhe.\"Well, as you wish. You can take as many photos of me as you want.\" Di Qiuhe turned around and looked at himself in the mirror. His short-haired reflection looked rather dapper. He paused for a while and rolled up the vest to look at his six-packs. Suddenly he felt embarrassed, so he pulled down the vest and turned around again to continue the conversation, \u201cIs everything going OK today?\u201d\u201cVery smoothly.\u201d He Bai\u2019s voice suddenly got clearer, along with the vague sound of him pressing down on the shutter. \u201cBut I have to stay up late tonight to edit these photos as it has to be done before 7:00 pm tomorrow. I am in a bit of a hurry. Right, you haven't told me how you lied to the Jia. And, going forward, would you please talk to me first before you lie to people? I almost failed to cover up your story today.\"\"It doesn't matter. I will be able to fix it if that happens.\" Di Qiuhe could almost picture that little puppy holding his phone with his shoulder while holding up the camera to take pictures. As he heard the voice getting clearer, Qi Qiuhe suddenly felt an itchy sensation in his ear, but he was not willing to switch his mobile phone to the other side. Instead, he smiled and said, \"Well, noted. I will make sure to run my story by you in advance. I didn't say too much, just mentioning how the Saint Elephant had been shamelessly taking advantage of your sorry ass\u2026\u201d \"Wait!\" He Bai's voice suddenly increased, and then a shuffling sound came from the other end of the line. \"Wait till I plug in this earphone.\"Picking up his clothes, Di Qiuhe got up, opened the door of the bathroom and went outside. \"Take your time. I\u2019m not in a hurry,\" said he with a pampering tone.After inserting the earphones, He Bai waited a second and said, \"Okay, shoot.\"\"Well, actually the Jia Family...\"The girls suddenly burst into laughter over something. Wearing a smile, He Bai talked with Di Qiuhe in a low voice, all the while raising up the camera to take photos of the birthday girl who was surrounded by other girls.The party wasn\u2019t over until eleven. From a distance He Bai waved to Jia Beilei who was escorting the guests to the door and with a bunch of photos he went back to the room that the Jia Family arranged for him.After taking a shower and changing into pajamas, he made a cup of coffee and turned on the computer provided by the Jias to start editing.The clicking sounds of the mouse and keyboard were amplified by the quiet night and through the current they passed to the ear of Di Qiuhe who was on the other side of the phone.Looking at the screen, Di Qiuhe noticed that they had been on the phone for several hours straight. He found it quite soothing when he pictured the little puppy working hard. Although it was his usual bedtime, he didn\u2019t feel like sleeping at all.\u2018Good luck with your work.\u2019He wished inwardly. Then he took out the other Apxxx cellphone which had the same color as the one he gave to He Bai. He logged in twitter and flipped through the to-be hot news, all the while twitching his lips and tapping his fingers.The sun was already hanging high in the sky, and the light managed to squeeze in through the curtain gap.After rubbing his eyes, He Bai turned off the desk lamp and leaned forward to sleep on the table.\"All done?\"Crack.Hearing that, He Bai immediately sat up straight, and in a panic his arms accidentally swept away bits and pieces on the table.\"Scared? Good morning, little puppy.\"To He Bai\u2019s ears, the voice sounded rather obscure and vague, but he was sure that it\u2019s Di Qiuhe.He looked around in horror and raised his hand to bang his forehead. \"Am I starting to hear things after pulling an all-nighter?\"\"It\u2019s not an illusion. We talked over the phone yesterday. Have you forgotten that?\"Although it was still vague, it\u2019s enough for him to make sense of the words being said to him.With eyes widened, He Bai hurriedly took out his cellphone from his camera side bag on the table corner. When he turned on the phone, he saw that they were still on the phone with each other. Apparently, this call had lasted for a long time. It seemed that he indeed forgot to hang up last night. One minute he was talking and the next thing he knew, he was back on taking photos and when he finally finished, he simply took down the earphones without disconnecting the call.He thought that Di Qiuhe had already hung up, but...\"Why didn\u2019t you hung up the phone?!\" Now completely awake after that initial shock, he very much wanted to follow the current to rip his head off. \u201cDo you know how much money you have wasted over that past ten hours?\u201cBut you didn\u2019t hang up, too\u201d\u201c\u2026.. that\u2019s\u2026 I forgot.\u201d\u201cMe too,\u201d after spinning a shameless lie, he quickly changed the topic, \u201cyou have been busy all night. You must be sleepy. Don\u2019t go sleep now. Eat something. I\u2019ve ordered you breakfast.He Bai felt that he was a bit slow in his response. Obviously, the lack of sleep has somehow hampered his ability to think.\"You ordered me breakfast? How?\"\"By making a phone call.\"\"What do you mean?\"\u201cI found out the phone number of the resort, gave them a call, and ordered the breakfast.\u201d\"Okay... But how do you know my room number?\"\"I told them your name, and the staff would find you.\"\"Hmm\u2026\u2026\"\"Sleepy now?\"\"A bit.\"\"Call me brother.\"\u201cAsshole\u201d\u201c\u2026. Aren\u2019t you sleepy now?\u201dRubbing his face, He Bai sneered, \u201cI\u2019m sleepy, not stupid. And I haven\u2019t finished the editing yet, so I can\u2019t sleep now. Got work to do. Thank you for the breakfast. I\u2019ll enjoy it.Di Qiuhe frowned, \u201cHaven\u2019t finished yet? How many photos have you taken?\u201cNot many, just dozens of them. Childish Di, it\u2019s very cute of you to order me breakfast. Thank you.\u201dAlthough Di Qiuhe rather enjoyed the way He Bai called him, he still pretended to be angry, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call me cute! Need a bit of discipline, don\u2019t you? You naughty puppy.\u201dHe Bai suddenly burst into laughter and quickly asked, \u201cHow does a dog bark?\u201dHaving never heard of him laughing so loud, Di Qiuhe froze for a while. He felt his ear getting hot and his heart racing. In a trance, he unconsciously replied, \"Woof, Woof.\"\"Good boy, I will treat you with bones.\" Having mocked him, He Bai stopped Di Qiuhe right there and then and immediately hung up the phone. Then he went to the bathroom to wash his face and waited for breakfast.\u2026\u2026Woof.Di Qiuhe took off the phone and stared at the screen.Di Qiuhe still could feel his ear burning and he felt as if he could hear the echo of his laughter.\"What\u2019s so funny!\" Grinding his teeth, he rubbed the ear and tapped on the chest. Holding back his desire to laugh, he continued with his furious face, \"What a naughty puppy. I really should be stricter with you! I gotta teach you a lesson when I am back.\"At 6 pm, all the resort lanterns were lit up. Along the way leading up from the entrance gate to the main building there were blooming flowers and trees decorated with ribbons. It was absolutely gorgeous. In front of the main building there was a red carpet spreading out from the inside with flowers flanking it\u2019s both sides.\"How lavish. Those flowers are transported by air, right?\" Looking out of the car window, the new person Wu Meng of the Bai Xiu Entertainment exclaimed, \u201cMs. Ouyang, thank you for taking me here. This is absolutely mind blowing.\u201dOuyang Linlin was retouching her makeup when she heard Wu Meng talking. Upon hearing what she said, she quickly pulled Wu Meng over to sit with her. After sneaking a look at the agent sitting at the front seat, she said, \u201cNo need to thank me. If it were not for the company, we wouldn\u2019t have been here. Well, stop looking around and get your glam fixed. We are expecting media coverage later.\u201dWu Meng obediently stuck out her tongue and started to reapply her makeup.The agent sitting at the front seat nodded in agreement. After the girls finished their glam, he said, \u201cOuyang, Meng, the company doesn\u2019t expect you to make friends with big shots here. We only hope that you don\u2019t make any trouble and get yourself some face time with these people. Bear it in mind that the Jia Family has only one girl, and so all the family members spoil her. You are about the same age as her. Don\u2019t get too much attention and steal her thunder. Understand?The girls kept nodding.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Woof Woof (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkThe agent said a few more words to Ouyang Linlin and told her to keep an eye on Wu Meng. Then she tidied herself up and got off with the invitation that the company gave to her and led them towards the area where red carpet ended.They entered the hall and handed the invitation to a waiter. After taking photos and signing their names, they were led by the waiter to the ballroom on the second floor.\"Wow, Tian! I saw Tian!\"The moment Wu Meng came in, she couldn\u2019t help but exclaim all the time with eyes full of excitement.Ouyang Linlin hurriedly pinched her hand to calm her down. She was really disappointed at what just happened.This little girl was almost perfect, what with her professional acting skills, sweet look and nice character and all. However, she could be really hysterical sometimes, always getting psyched over nothing. A typical fanatical groupie.After seeing that the agent turned her head back and gave her a warning look, Wu Meng promptly stopped yelling. Nonetheless, she still kept searching for her idol with her big eyes until she finally laid her eyes on a strange person.All the guests in the hall were well dressed in glamorous outfits. Even the waiters were wearing tuxedos with delicate makeup on their faces. But the young man who was talking with a hotel staff was wearing a short-sleeved shirt and casual pants. He looked very much out of place.How did that man get in? Was he a guest, too?She felt it strange, so she couldn't help but look at their direction.Having discussed with the person in charge about the streaming of the photos and inspected the location of the big screen on the spot, He Bai was preparing to tell the Jias that he was leaving.\"Mr. He, the lady over there has been watching you for a while. Do you know her?\" said the manager while secretly pointing to the direction of the hall.Surprised, He Bai turned around and followed his finger to look towards the hall. Incidentally, he met the eyes of a girl wearing a yellow gown.\u201cI don\u2019t know her. Probably she was wondering why I could be here dressing like this.\u201d He Bai replied with a laugh and gave the girl a nod before looking away. Then he followed the manager out from the side exit of the hall.Hearing what he said, the manager apologized with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s our fault. We forgot to prepare you a proper outfit. Mr. Jia has sent someone on it. He\u2019ll be back in no time.\u201dHe Bai was utterly surprised to hear that as he didn\u2019t actually mean anything by what he had just said. It seemed impossible to leave now since they are preparing his outfit. Clearly, the Jia Family wanted him to stay for the birthday party.But he was so sleepy...Half an hour later, with a tuxedo and a new hair style, He Bai was led into the hall by a waiter and he was arranged to sit next to the Jia Family.The moment He Bai stood next to Jia Zhang, all the eyes of the guests in the hall were fixed on him.He Bai: \"...\" He suddenly felt like a frog which was going to be toasted by other\u2019s gaze.\"Bai, I have seen your work. They are so good. Thank you! \" Jia Beilei let go the arm of his brother, ran past her father and held He Bai\u2019s arm. She kept shaking it out of excitement and said, \u201cI\u2019m so happy. I also want you to take photos for my on my next year\u2019s birthday.\u201d\"...\" Medium rare to medium well.\"I\u2019m glad you like it.\" He Bai gently took out his arm from her hands and distanced himself from her. Then he said hello to the others of the Jia Family with a smile.Jia Beilei looked at him with a sad expression, \"Bai, you promised me that you would never call me Ms. Jia again. Why are you standing so far from me? Is it because my perfume makes you uncomfortable?\"Coughing in a low voice, Jia Zhang was so embarrassed that he turned his head back, pretending that he didn\u2019t hear what his daughter just said.He smiled in front of them, but in fact, he was rendered absolutely speechless, \u2018Ms. Jia, please don\u2019t say more.\u2019 Those who were close to them were gazing at him in an odd way. It seemed that they were picturing something foul in their minds.Jia Zehang noticed his embarrassment, so he swept a look at his own sister with a sigh. He walked over and reached out to He Bai, saying \"Hello, Mr. He. My sister is very born socializer. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\"He Bai shook hands with him, saying that he didn\u2019t mind. Then he commended Jia Beilei for being so cute and honest.Upon hearing that, Jia Beilei laughed again and tried to hold his arm for the second time.\"Lei.\" Jia Zehang quickly grabbed her by the arm and winked at her. \"Grandpa and parents are watching you. Don't make Mr. He feel embarrassed.\" said he, while signaling her that all guests were watching her as well.With a twitch of eyebrows, Jia Beilei paused and finally regained her composure. Then she took hold of his brother's arm with a smile.Seeing that, He Bai felt relieved.\"Sorry.\" Jia Zehang apologized once more and led him to Mr. Jia who was surrounded by his family. \"Grandpa and the others were very satisfied with the photos you took. They want to thank you in person.\"\"Thank you very much. It\u2019s my fault. I should have come over earlier to say hello to you.\" He Bai replied in a rather courteous manner without appearing to be too intimate, lest people might get the wrong idea. \u201cBesides, I offered to do it, so I should thank you for giving me this opportunity.\u201d\"This is very kind of you.\"Jia Beilei felt nauseous standing aside listening to them exchanging compliments. The conversation between two prim men was as boring as it got.\"Grandpa, Mr. He is here,\" said Jia Zehang who stopped in front of Mr. Jia with He Bai on his heels.The gray-haired old man turned his head back and looked at him with gentle eyes.He Bai quickly tidied himself up and respectfully bent slightly over to greet him.\"Nice to meet you, too. Come sit over here.\" Mr. Jia waved to him. He then looked at his granddaughter and said with a gentle voice, \"Your aunt said that Fu has already arrived at the door. You should take Zehang and go greet her.\" After that, he looked at his children around him and waved them away, \"All right. Leave us. Go entertain our guests.\"Hearing that, they knowingly took their leaves, but not before they greeted He Bai first.He Bai thanked them one by one, feeling flattered. He felt like they were being way too nice with him. Like he was not a photographer who came to take photos, but a family friend coming over for a get-together.\"Bai, take a seat.\"Mr. Jia was in poor health. Now, he was drinking tea at the head table in front of the main stage.He Bai came to sit down next to the old man as told... Sitting this close to the family elder was usually a sign of friendship with the family.After instructing the waiter to serve tea for him, Mr. Jia asked, \"How old are you?\"It sounded like a weird way to start a conversation.\"Twenty-one years old.\" He Bai answered.\"Hm.\" The old man nodded and said, \"Thank you for the photos. Yesterday, you said that Xu Yinrong is your photography teacher. How long has he been teaching you?\"\u201cWe started taking photography class on the second semester of the freshman year and so he has been teaching me for a year and a half.\" He Bai replied with baffled face, wondering inwardly whether Di Qiuhe had said something he didn't know to the Jias, for he didn\u2019t know why else Mr. Jia will be so nice to him.\"One and a half year. You\u2019re a decent learner.\" Elder Jia nodded, looking more amiable. \u201cXu is a talented and passionate teacher. Keep learning. Don't let him down.\"He Bai nodded, but he was surprised at the way this old man called his teacher. Did they know each other? He never heard of that in his previous life.The old man also asked some trifling things, like his performance in school, his previous work, his future plan, his work at Yi Ka and how long he had known Di Qiuhe. He Bai replied one by one in details. As the conversation continued with the old man asking questions in a slow manner, he gradually got relaxed. In fact, he felt so comfortable that he would have told him everything without reserve.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Woof Woof (4)Translator: Sissy That Walk\"So your parents are war correspondents. That\u2019s tough. Considering the bad international situation in those years, those volunteer war correspondents are truly heroes.\" Mr. Jia was surprised upon learning his parents\u2019 professions. Then he asked out of concern, \"So where are your parents working now? There should be corresponding allowance for war correspondents after returning from the frontline.\u201dThe smile on He Bai\u2019s receded upon hearing this question, and then he replied, \u201cUnfortunately, my parents died in a terrorist attack... It\u2019s been many years.\u201dThey went there alive but came back in urns. People only managed to salvage a phone that his parents once used. Nothing more.Mr. Jia was struck dumb for a while. Then with a long sigh, he raised his hand up and patted him on his shoulder, \"So, all the more reasons to take good care of yourself.\"The tapping was very slight, but He Bai still could feel the genuine concern from the old man, so he nodded with a smile, \u201cOf course.\u201dThe time went by quickly when they were talking. It was already 6:50. When Jia Zhang went up to the stage together with the senior host, they attracted everyone\u2019s attention.Noticing that, He Bai stopped talking and together with Mr. Jia, they looked towards the stage.After the host finished his festive opening remarks, the birthday party began. The first part was to play the video of Jia Beilei\u2019s growth. The childhood photos of her appeared on the big screen one after another, while Jia Zhang talked a lot about her childhood as the host requested. Together with the guests, he watched how a little girl grew to be that beautiful woman in the video.Then the screen suddenly darkened. The host excitedly pictured how she would live an exciting and meaningful life after she grew up and then after the host expressed his best wishes to Ms. Jia, a new photo was shown on the screen with back ground music.The moment the photo appeared, it caught everyone\u2019s attention. The deep green reminded everyone of the Mother Nature and those people in fine outfits were immediately drawn to this ineffable beauty.The girl in green tulle dress was wearing a wreath and was sitting on the branch of a low tree. The bare feet were swaying, and her hands were stretching upward as if she was plucking something. However, her face is directed at the camera with confused eyes, looking very innocent, like a beautiful fairy who accidentally spotted a stranger barging in her territory.There was a moment of silence on the scene, and it was soon followed by the muffled exclaims of the women.\"She is gorgeous!\" Wu Meng was so excited that her face flushed, and her hands unconsciously tighten her skirt, \"I, I... It\u2019s pretty! I want to look that good!\"Ouyang Linlin was calmer than her, but her eyes were also glued to the photos. The focus was not on people, but on the elegant dress that perfectly brought out the girl's body line. It was really good-looking. Every woman would kill to look that pretty.After sneaking a look at the male guests, she found it quite hypocritical that those otherwise high and mighty gentlemen who looked down on newbies should have their eyes tightly fixed on the girl in the photo. They were so full of shit! They only care if you were pretty. Only if you were pretty. They were no more than a bunch of lecherous creatures.Before the audience were able to snap out their trance, the next photo appeared on the screen.It was the same forest setting, but this time the girl didn\u2019t wear the previous long dress, and was instead wearing a short slip dress with irregular hem. The girl was stepping into a stream with a basket and her delicate ankles had immerged into the water. With slender vines around her arms and right leg and with unfastened curly hair, she stooped down to pick up the petals drifting from the upper stream.People looked at the flock of birds flying over above her head and in a trance, they felt like they could almost hear the chirping sound of birds among the gurgling sound of water.The green was manifested in various shades. It was truly a beautiful sight to behold.It was getting quieter and quieter in the hall. All eyes were glued to the photo. As they enjoyed the beauty of the current photo, they were also savoring the memory of the last one, all the while looking forward to the next photo.Excellent. These photos were amazing works, either from a professional perspective or from a personal view. They were simply flawless. In those pictures, Jia Beilei looked like a beautiful creature between an innocent girl and a sexy woman that, instead of provoking erotic desires, stimulated people\u2019s innermost yearning for beautiful things. Even if for a second you were to have that impulse to embrace this beauty, you would immediately dismiss this idea out of shame.\"So beautiful.\" Yang Fu exclaimed with hands cupping her cheeks. \"I would like to be photographed by photographer He one more time.\"Jia Zehang covered her eyes and unpleasantly swept a look at the male guests around. With a frown, he said, \"This set of photos should not have been played at all. My grandpa has already planned to cancel this part. But...\"\"But photographer He saved the day!\" Yang Fu pulled down his hands and continued to hold her cheeks. \u201cZehang, don\u2019t be jealous. I think Lei is very happy to have those photos for her birthday party. Look at her. She was laughing like crazy.\u201dHearing those words, he looked towards his sister who was being surrounded by her friends. Apparently, she was enjoying this. He let out a sigh and poked at her forehead, \u201cYou smart ass. If you like, we could ask him to take wedding photos for us when we get married.\u201dYang Fu grunted, \"How long would that be!\"\"We can do this anytime if you want.\" Jia Zehang held her hand and gave it a kiss, \"Let's get married soon?\"With a flushed face, Yang Fu gave him a stare in a flirtatious manner and ignored his question.Jia Zehang laughed, but deep down he wrote down He Bai\u2019s name. Since this person could make his fianc\u00e9e and sister happy, he was willing to promote the young photographer as a way to thank him.After the photo was played, the host reappeared on the stage, only to find that the guests were not as enthusiastic as they had been minutes ago when they looked at him. Instead, they were now looking at him with a tad of disappointment.The host felt upset. The audience's love really was as flimsy as people said.The birthday party continued, and the photos were played on loop in random order. The attention of the guests slowly shifted.Finally, it was the time for the birthday girl to make her speech. Jia Beilei walked to the stage under the escort of his brother and graciously greeted everyone present and extended her thanks them. After that, she suddenly changed the topic and started talking about the previous set of photos.\"Today I want to take a few seconds to thank a person who made those pictures possible. His name is He Bai. If it weren\u2019t for him, I wouldn\u2019t have looked so good in the pictures.\" She smiled slyly, and the guests applauded.\"Now, let\u2019s welcome Mr. He to come on to the stage and give us a few words.\" Jia Yulei made an invitation gesture to He Bai who was sitting under the stage, and a beam of light immediately followed and illuminated where he sat.He Bai, who was in the process of pouring tea for Mr. Jia, was struck dumb by this sudden attention.\"Go.\" Mr. Jia took away the teapot in his hand and smiled at him. \"Lei likes you very much.\"\"...\" He was not sure that he could handle such affection.The guests looked at Jia Beilei's eyes and were surprised to find that her beloved photographer was surprisingly the strange young man who was once seen with the Jias before! They were also stunned by the fact that this man, who looked no more than 20 years old, was to be credited for those fascinating pictures. They were wondering why they haven\u2019t heard of such a genius before. Standing up under everyone\u2019s gaze, He Bai felt like his hands were sweating.He had always been a man of low profile and right now he simply didn\u2019t know what to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Fake Tumble on a Level Ground(1)Translator: Sissy That WalkIn the previous incarnation, as a landscape photographer, He Bai spent all his life exploring around, which brought him into contact with mountains, rivers and people who had same hobby. As a man of means, he was so self-willed to have hired a distinguished assistant at a high price to help him deal with external affairs since he won fame. Therefore, he was totally unaccustomed to any big occasion, and the grandest event he had experienced in the last life was nothing more than the International Photography Awards Ceremony, during which he received an award and made a causal acceptance speech on stage... Shamefully, the speech was written by his assistant.A beam of light focused on him. When he took a step forward, the light moved ahead in the meanwhile.Under the stage sat a large crowd of well-known actors, singers, popular celebrities... as well as those old artists who had been on good terms with Mr. Jia, bosses, screenwriters, producers and investors of major entertainment companies/ brokerage houses/record corporations/TV stations, and a variety of businessmen who had cooperation with Jia family... Most of all, there were definitely some photographers who were of high prestige in the entertainment circle...He Bai dared cast no glance at the auditorium. Anyone who sat there was richer and prestigious than he, thus much more qualified to have a \u2018casual\u2019 speech on stage. In contrast, He Bai, a sheer newcomer to photography, seemed not to achieve an acceptable standard.Jia Beilei stood on the stage staring at him smilingly, and the host, even not knowing him, looked friendly with an expectant face.He Bai threw a quick glance at the auditorium when he stepped on the stage. When the light beam disappeared from his head, he forced a polite smile, went forward and held Jia Beilei in a tender embrace. Then he shook hands with the host and took the microphone from him. Turning around to face the audience, He Bai comforted himself:It doesn't matter. Those people were neither stars nor giants but some obscure models, the thing in his hands were no microphone but a camera, and the reason why he came on stage was to communicate with his \u2018models\u2019 so that he could spot the best angle for shooting.\u201cGood evening, everyone.\u201d The tension was gradually eased, and He Bai\u2019s smile became natural, \u201cI'm He Bai, the costume photographer for Little Mermaid of Ika Costume. It\u2019s both my great honor to have taken a birthday photograph for Miss Jia yesterday and to be recognized now.\u201dHe Bai turned around to look at Jia Beilei when he took out a handkerchief-folded rose from his pocket and handed it to her with a gentleman's etiquette, \u201cHappy birthday. May you stay beautiful forever.\u201d When he was dressed before, he got bored and fiddled with the handkerchief, only to find it difficult to restore it to the former state. He had no choice but to fold the handkerchief in the shape of a rose and stuff it into the pocket. Fortunately, he did so, or he would find nothing to ease the embarrassment.Well dressed, He Bai looked like a refined elite. He slightly bent down, his hands stretching ahead. The dress sleeves were rolled up a little, revealing the white shirt cuffs and his delicate wrists, which looked so charming that anyone would like to give a touch.Surprised at the flower in He Bai\u2019s slender and white hands, Jia Beilei ran her eye over his face and hands when she cheerfully grabbed the flower and pounced on him excitedly, \u201cOh my god, how handsome and romantic you are! Thank you! I was wrong. You are not a prig like my brother. Instead, you are much more romantic than him. If only you were my brother!\u201dThe guests were shocked and burst into sincere laughter.Jia Zehang\u2019s face fell. He was on the verge of rushing to the stage.Covering her face and bending down, Yang Fu laughed so much that she nearly cried when she saw the reaction of her future sister-in-law, \u201cHa, what a lovely girl Lei is. Ha-ha, Mr. He\u2019s face goes pale. He must be scared. A poor guy, ha.\u201dJia Zehang took her in his arms and patted her on the back to get her breath back, replying, \u201cBeilei is more than willful. There\u2019re so many guests today. Rumors about her will certainly go around tomorrow, and those newsmen are surely gonna report the thing as exaggerative as possible!\u201d\u201cDon't be angry. There\u2019re a large number of celebrities here. As long as one of them posts a Weibo to praise Beilei for her forthrightness and commends those two for their instant friendship, the reporters are unlikely to cook up fake news. If they dare to, they\u2019ll be scolded.\u201d Yang Fu was more philosophical about it than Jia Zehang, and she continued to soothe him, \u201cYou\u2019ve worried too much. Considerable big bosses sit under the stage, so how come reporters write without basis at the risk of ruining their career? Besides, don\u2019t you Jia family have the ability?Jia Zehang calmed down, and his anger subsided as he saw He Bai try to make up for his sister's \u2018brave utterance\u2019 with a joke and the flexible response of the host, while his face was still sullen.\u201cWhat a little devil she is to call a random stranger brother while me, a prig!\u201dSeeing him jealous of He Bai, Yang Fu couldn\u2019t help laughing again. She wasn\u2019t in conscience tell him that Mr. He was not \u2018randomly chosen\u2019. If he were less young and more mature, many would lose their heart to him. Fortunately, Lei didn\u2019t understand love now, or things would be hardly wound up.Jia Beilei\u2019s words made He Bai relaxed a lot. He took up the thread of the conversation to stabilize the situation, and expressed his good wishes for Ica\u2019s Little Mermaid brand and gave a brief publicity. When all this was finished, He Bai seized an opportunity to get off the stage.After a hesitation, he went to Mr. Jia\u2019s table and made his farewells.\u201cMy driver is at your service.\u201dUnexpectedly, Mr. Jia did not ask him to stay but arranged a car to drive him to campus.\u201cYou've been busy with Lei\u2019s photograph. It\u2019s time for you to have a rest.\u201d Mr. Jia was very considerate to arrange a waiter to pack He Bai\u2019s things up. Having a short conversation with him, Jia ordered Jia Zhang to send He Bai out of the door.\u201cYou must be tired these days.\u201d Jia Zhang patted him on the shoulder, took out a red gift box and put it in his hand. He Bai intended to refuse it while Jia Zhang prevented him and said, \u201cYi ka sent a team over with an eye to publicizing their brand on the party. I gave Yi Ka what they wanted, and Yi Ka paid for it. Everything was settled, so I didn\u2019t go any longer. But your situation is different. You come for Beilei only, so please accept the pay you deserve.\u201dThe box felt quite heavy. There must be piles of money inside. He Bai felt it inappropriate and continued to say, \u201cMr. Jia, you don\u2019t have to. I took pictures of Miss Jia with the purpose of compensation...\u201d\u201cThe one that needs to compensate Beilei is Saint Elephant, not you.\u201d Jia Zhang squeezed the box into his hands and retreated, with his hands at the back. He gestured towards the car, \u201cIt\u2019s quite embarrassing to tug each other at the gate. Just take it as the reward for that set of party photo. I\u2019ll be angry if you refuse it again.\u201dHearing Jia Zhang\u2019s words and seeing someone was about to come out, He Bai had no choice but to accept it and thank Jia Zhang again.\u201cUncle Jia gets it. Welcome to our house when you are free.\u201d Jia Zhang smiled, and he looked warm and friendly.He Bai was stunned by his self appellation. Then he responded smilingly and got into the car.It\u2019s nine o'clock when He Bai arrived at the dorm. He removed the dress and tie, took out the gift box and unpacked it carefully. One, two, three, four, five stacks... There was also a shopping voucher of a chain store, whose face value was unknown, as well as a bunch of bits and pieces the birthday gift box originally held.He Bai worked for two days and earned fifty thousand yuan, which was enough for his tuition and living expenses in the next two years... It was generous of Jia family to pay him so handsomely.He Bai heaved a sigh of relief and gave his forehead a rub. He took a chocolate ball from the gift box and ate one, reclining in a chair with his eyes closed.The entertainment circle was a sheer vanity fair piled up with money\u2026 He wondered how on earth Di Qiuhe, the childish guy, lived an easy life in it. It's quite amazing. Was he surrounded by something like \u2018main character halo\u2019?\u2026 Maybe he wasn\u2019t. After all, no main character would die so young like him.Lost in thought, he actually fell asleep in the chair and waked up until he turned over and rolled to the ground at midnight. Then he took a bath in a daze and climbed to the bed to continue his sleep.Probably because he stayed up late, or falling to the ground affected his sleep quality, or perhaps he thought about something during the day, He Bai couldn\u2019t sleep well when he lied on the bed and had been constantly dreaming.\u2018The lights on a clock tower were shining, that familiar figure falling, and a white arm slowly retracted. Then the picture changed suddenly where Di Chunhua cried her heart out in despair. A fit of dizziness overwhelmed He Bai when the picture switched again... a ward, a middle-aged man who was ill in bed, and a hysterical middle-aged women standing in front of the bed.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Fake Tumble on a Level Ground (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkThere occurred vaguely a shrill cry of a woman, but her voice was completely unclear to He Bai. All of the sudden, he suffered weightlessness, and his brain released a wake-up message. In the last picture, a bony man in a multicolored shirt appeared from the street corner with a needle-like thing in his hand, and rushed towards a tall man standing in front of the green grocery.\u201cDi Qiuhe!\u201dHe Bai opened his eyes and sat up, and his mind was in a whirl. He suffered a blackout, his fingers fumbling around under the pillow for the mobile phone. No sooner did his sight recover a little than he dialed Di\u2019s number.He got through immediately, and Di Qiuhe\u2019s joyful sound came, mixed with whistles of vehicles, \u201cWhy do you call me so early? Do you miss me? I thought you would sleep in.\u201d\u201cDi Qiuhe.\u201d He Bai pressed his forehead, every scene in the dream crossing his mind over again. His voice unconsciously lowered, \u201cWhere\u2026 where did you buy the fruit you sent me before?\u201d\u201cAre you craving for fruit?\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows and switched the mobile phone from one hand to the other in good mood. He gestured for Wang Boyi to step back a little and continued, \u201cI have no training today, and I\u2019m in the open air. If you would like fruit I can go buy for you in a moment.\u201d\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He Bai swallowed hard and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, only to find his temperature was somewhat abnormal. He got sick probably because the air-conditioning of the resort worked all the time and he stayed up late to retouch the photographs when the temperature was sometimes hot and sometimes cold, He Bai suspected. He felt uncomfortable and covered his forehead with a hand, saying, \u201cDo you remember what I told you once? I can tell people\u2019s fortune and have predictive dreams occasionally. Last night I dreamed of you...\u201dDi Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help but raise his mouth, smugly snorting, \u201cOkay, I know you miss me very much. I\u2019m free today, so if you want something, I\u2019ll buy you, my little bro...\u201d\u201cDoes the green grocery where you bought fruit call Cloud\u2019s Home?\u201dDi Qiuhe became silent.\u201cIts owner is pretty fat and wears a gold ring on his finger. There\u2019s a tree in front of the shop.\u201d He Bai tried to recall the dream and revealed everything what he could. He had no idea why he was so reckless to tell Diu Qiuhe this. After all, it sounded highly suspicious, and he was likely to be regarded as a spirit by Di Qiuhe if they were right. If not, he might be considered a madman. Both could do harm to He Bai, but intuition told him he had to be honest. Otherwise, Di Qiuhe would be in danger, just like his \u2018jumping from a building\u2019 before rebirth.Di Qiuhe was only twenty-three years old, and he deserved to live longer than his last life. He Bai felt that the dream he had last night was a signal. There occurred a \u2018butterfly effect\u2019, and he played the role of the small butterfly in Di Qiuhe\u2019s border trip. If he died young owing to this small change, He Bai would never forgive himself.There was complete silence, and nothing could be heard except their sounds of breath.\u201cBai,\u201d Two minutes later, Di Qiuhe\u2019s voice came when his tone was no longer gentle and smiling but became serious \u201cWhat else have you seen in your dream?\u201dHe Bai was relieved somehow. He reclined in the bed and quickly replied, \u201cI also see you stood in front of the green grocery when a boney man in a colorful shirt dashed out of the corner and injected you with something.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be virus.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere have been several cases where XK23 infectors injected their blood into other people\u2019s body to spread the virus on purpose. The crowd stole across the national border from our neighboring countries, whose whereabouts were hard to find. So the isolation treatment didn\u2019t work at the very beginning, and it caused a great deal of panic in the area.\u201d He Bai was shocked. He hurriedly sat up and suffered a second blackout. His voice raised unconsciously, \u201cXK23? Is it the virus which has an 80 percent fatality rate? Since you\u2019re so clear, why are you running around? Aren\u2019t you afraid of death?\u201d\u201cDon't worry.\u201d Di Qiuhe smiled again and soothed He Bai, \u201cI\u2019m not running around. Everybody is allowed to have a free time. There have been three months since the infection, and we\u2019re very safe now. I remember the incident was widely reported and heatedly discussed, so I thought you knew it.\u201dHis rebirth happened after that, so no wonder he could hardly remember it. After all, more than one decade passed since he heard the news for the first time.The fact choked He Bai up. He said after a silence, \u201cAnyway, You\u2019d better go back soon. Safety comes first.\u201d\u201cIt doesn't matter. I\u2019m going to the hospital to have a vaccine. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d said Di Qiuhe, in order to pacify him. Waving at Wang Boyi who stood guard outside the alley, Di Qiuhe gestured for him to hail a car. Then he leaned against the wall, looking at the green grocery opposite, and continued, \u201cIt has been a long time since the virus incident came to an end, but now a fugitive reappears and intends to do harm to people. It\u2019s rather suspicious, and I suspect I\u2019m his target, so staying away is of no use. My safety can\u2019t be guaranteed until the bad guy gets captured.\u201dHe Bai frowned, \u201cDo you mean... you plan to lure him out?\u201d\u201cYeah, if I\u2019m lucky enough to succeed... Little Puppy, what kind of reward do you want as my lifesaver? How about sharing my surname and being my little brother?\u201dHe Bai suffered from dizzy spells, which he thought was all Di Qiuhe\u2019s fault!\u201cNo, thank you. If you really want to return my goodness, the only thing you need to do is to transfer all your savings to my account so that I could rise to wealth overnight. Besides, aren\u2019t you suspicious of my words? Aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019m a liar or a bad guy your stepmother sent?\u201dDi Qiuhe burst into laughter and teased He Bai mercilessly, \u201cYou? A bad guy? Little Puppy, you must have some misunderstanding of yourself.\u201d He Bai was so simple-minded that he could hardly hide his emotions and was vulnerable to bullies. How come he was a bad guy? People as crafty as Qin Li would never allow such an \u2018innocent\u2019 \u2018spy\u2019 to work for her. In addition, as an old saying goes, rather believe it to be true than not. Since there might be danger, he\u2019d better pay more attention.\u201cWell, get up and have a breakfast, Psychic He.\u201d Seeing Wang Boyi come back in a taxi, Di Qiuhe stood up and went over, with a cranky smile on his face, \u201cI\u2019m ready to sort the bad guy out. When it\u2019s over, I\u2019ll buy you fruit. Be a good boy.\u201dHe Bai hung up simply and got up to wash his face. Then he went to see a doctor after asking for a sick leave from Yi Ka.Niu Junjie hurried to the hospital and found He Bai was put on a drip. After touching He Bai\u2019s forehead, he got anxious, and his voice raised, \u201cNo wonder you sounded as if devoid of vigor. You told me it\u2019s because you slept in. It\u2019s a total lie. If I don\u2019t go to the dorm to look for you, you could be dead in the care of nobody.\u201d\u201cBe quiet. I was wrong. Come and sit down.\u201d He Bai dragged him down, smiling with apology to the patients around, and soothed him, \u201cIt\u2019s just a minor illness. I\u2019ll get well after this infusion. Please don\u2019t, don\u2019t shout, I know I was wrong. Come on, what\u2019s going on?\u201dSeeing He Bai was not very weak, Niu Junjie finally rested assured. He frowned and said in a lower voice, \u201cYou become popular again, much more popular than before! From last night on, the entertainment circle kept posting photos on Weibo like crazy and left no room for other things. Netizens have gone insane. Tell me, what\u2019s your relationship with Miss Jia like?\u201d\u201cWell...\u201d He Bai stopped, vaguely aware of something, and explained, \u201cNothing at all. She\u2019s my client, and I'm her photographer. I just took a set of birthday photographs of her.\u201d\u201cThen why does the little girl call you brother?\u201d Niu Junjie felt strange and intended to scold him but finally gave up when seeing him feel wretched. He said, his brow furrowed, \u201cYou poor guy, the girl is doted on by the whole Jia family. You\u2019ll suffer a lot if you get entangled with her!\u201dNiu Junjie worried about this, which made He Bai relieved. He replied, \u201cDon't worry. They are all nice people. Miss Jia simply likes pretty faces. She is a vivacious girl, and it\u2019s just her joke to be my sister, of which her families are well aware. Yesterday her father also told me not to take it seriously when he saw me off, so I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Niu Junjie was in a half-and-half state of belief and doubt.He Bai nodded hard and told him what happened last night to calm him down.Hearing his explanation, Niu Junjie\u2019s worry was finally lifted. He cheered up immediately and said with joy, \u201cYou\u2019ll become a star soon, Bai! My god, what an excellent set of photos you\u2019ve taken! Those celebrities, especially female ones, all spoke highly of you! It\u2019s a pity that your Weibo account is for private use. If not, you would have had considerable fans. Now netizens are actively finding you out in that they would like to see whether the talented photographer possesses superhuman powers!\u201dHe Bai didn\u2019t care about it. He asked, \u201cWhat's going on with Yi Ka?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Fake Tumble on a Level Ground (3)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cYi Ka's chairman must be grinning from ear to ear! Its official WeiBo account shared Jia Beilei\u2019s blog immediately to claim the Elf Series and extended their thanks to stars who raved about it as well as to go public on the news that Yi Ka was about to set up a girl brand Little Mermaid. They must have hired a group of Internet ghostwriters to post online comments in their favor, and now the topic of fairy\u2019s skirt has blown up on social media.\u201dAs expected. It seemed that the publicity of Elf Series was a success. Smiling, He Bai felt gratified at the news.\u201cAnyway, you, Yi ka and Jia family are all real winners, while your former company is down on its luck.\u201d Niu Junjie suddenly changed his tone of voice and made a face. He snickered when he picked out the mobile phone and enabled WeiBo to show him something, \u201cThis morning, your photographs became Trending 1 after one night\u2019s sharing and reposting, and an Internet celebrity said she was eager to make a shooting appointment with you and, hmm, and tagged Saint Elephant in the meanwhile.\u201dHe Bai's expression changed, \u201cShe tagged Saint Elephant? How does Saint Elephant respond?\u201d\u201cNo response. They just play dead.\u201d Niu Junjie learned from He Bai that Saint Elephant grabbed his work, which incurred his displeasure a lot. He chuckled, \u201cIt\u2019s also because you have only a few dozen of inactive followers on WeiBo. Therefore, few have noticed the statement you posted before you left Saint Elephant, which left netizens the wrong impression that you still work for the company. These photographs have drawn much more attention than the sidelights you took for the TV station, and you suddenly become Yi Ka's clothing photographer, which arouses a lot of curiosity among netizens who are ready to dig the reason up.\u201dHe Bai took his cell phone and browsed through the trending topics, which gave him a general understanding of the ins and outs of the matter.Netizens acted so efficiently that it took them only half a day to find out some clues. For instance, Ma Qun complained about the preferential treatment He Bai had received on his personal WeiBo account; a staffer who was suspected to be employee of Saint Elephant groused about the company; The Jias came to Saint Elephant to ask for an explanation; the director of Saint Elephant resigned all of the sudden; there occurred some anonymous revelations from Saint Elephant staff that He Bai was treated unfairly, pushed aside and forced to quit his job. Finally, someone exposed that He Bai was actually the Q University guy who Di Qiuhe said was bold enough to take photos of paparazzi the other way round. Besides, Di had introduced He Bai to Miss Jia to take birthday photographs for her, while the job was grabbed secretly by Saint Elephant.A variety of details as well as the timeline was dug up. After an analysis, netizens found that He Bai left his job the moment Saint Elephant undertook the job of taking birthday photos of Miss Jia, and finally came to the conclusion that Saint Elephant actually drove He Bai out in order to snatch the business away from him. And the reason why Di Qiuhe failed to watch the completion of He Bai\u2019s cooperation with Jia family closely was because he was forced to log off WeiBo and was in no mood for anything, thus leaving Saint Elephant an opportunity to take advantage of...Saint Elephant had gone too far!Never did they see such a shameless company!The netizens who thought they found out the truth got angry immediately, especially Di Qiuhe\u2019s fans. They started to defend He Bai and made up their mind to ask for justice for \u201ctheir idol\u2019s lovely younger schoolmate\u201d!\u201cThe comments section is temporarily shut down on Saint Elephant\u2019s official WeiBo account. I guess viewers bombarded it with complaints.\u201d Niu Junjie shook his head and sighed in an insincere way, \u201cThat\u2019s why we are told to behave with integrity. You see, Saint Elephant is done for.\u201dHe Bai logged out in a mixed frame of mind.He was to some extent attached to Saint Elephant. After all, it was Saint Elephant Company that offered him a place to work when he lived in dire poverty. But his attachment to the company was due in large part to Li Ru. Now that Li Ru quitted her job, Saint Elephant was nothing but a place with people he hated. Furthermore, with regard to today\u2019s plight, Saint Elephant only had itself to blame. He Bai was simply worried about Mrs. Li\u2019s reaction.Seeing He Bai upset about it, Niu Junjie knew he was moved to pity. He put his arm on He Bai\u2019s shoulders, laughing, \u201cYou\u2019re getting popular, and your social prestige must be rising now. I guess there are countless stars and celebrities dying to make shooting appointment with you. Don\u2019t forget to promote me when you make a fortune in the future.\u201d\u201cI promote you? Your parents are filthy rich.\u201d His words greatly amused He Bai. He naturally shifted the topic away from Saint Elephant and stopped thinking of the hot news online.It was at a hospital on the border.Having sent the crew members away, Wang Boyi gently closed the door of the ward and said to Di Qiuhe reclining on the bed, \u201cThe Internet is full of hustle and bustle when Ma Xingtong and his nephew become the targets of attack now.\u201d Curious to know why Master Di took up the cudgels for a younger schoolmate, he was sensible enough to keep his curiosity suppressed.Di Qiuhe stroked the bruises on his arm, gave a nod and said, \u201cTell them to make Bai\u2019s statement a Trending Topic and expose the two people\u2019s bullying of Bai at Saint Elephant. Don\u2019t post the set of photos Ma Xingtong and Ma Qun took for Miss Jia until the thing is discussed heatedly. Try to pick out as beautiful pictures as possible, and remember to cover Miss Jia's face with mosaic.\u201d He indeed planned to uphold justice for He Bai but had no intention to make a young girl\u2019s unsightly photos seen everywhere.\u201cMosaic?\u201d Wang Boyi was confused, \u201cHow can we prove the person in the photo is Miss Jia when mosaic is added?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a mole on her arm, which Bai shot in close-up when he took that set of photographs. He also asked the make-up artist to draw a vine flower to cover it. Netizens are perceptive enough to recognize her.\u201d explained Qiuhe with a sense of pride when he mentioned He Bai. Seeing Wang Boyi nod, he continued, \u201cReport to my father on the attack today. Now that the criminal has been caught, my suspicious dad will certainly make every attempt to find out the villains behind. As long as he looks into it, the Qins can\u2019t stay out of trouble.\u201d Wang Boyi took out his cell phone immediately, ready to ring somebody up.Di Qiuhe was quite satisfied with his attitude. He closed his eyes and signaled to Wang that he needed a rest.Wang Boyi went away obediently.When the ward door closed, Di Qiuhe snapped his eyes open, groped for the mobile phone and called He Bai. When his call was put through, Di Qiuhe feigned grievance. \u201cBai, as you predicted, I was attacked. The man wanted to flee. I caught him but hurt my arm...\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019ve been attacked?\u201d Niu Junjie\u2019s voice came. He shouted blusteringly, \u201cYou got hurt, didn\u2019t you? Are your injuries severe? You and Bai are really a well-matched pair of brothers. The one has a fever and is put on a drip, and the other hurt his arm.\u201dDi Qiuhe stopped pretending immediately, frowning and asking, \u201cHad a fever? Is Bai ill?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Fake Tumble on a Level Ground (4)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cYes, he is. It seems to be caused by the alternation of heat and cold, that is to say, air conditioning sickness. Fortunately, his temperature has come down. He has gone for a pee.\u201d Niu Junjie explained it to Di Qiuhe and kept rattling on, \u201cI am ready to move back to our dorm and stay for several days. Bai always forgets to take medicine, so he\u2019s getting better slowly. Other two roommates aren\u2019t here, one in the countryside and the other, abroad. Neither can be counted upon, so I have to take care of him. By the way, have you seen the news online? Bai is a celebrity now, Ha-Ha. When you\u2019re back, how about we go out for a meal to celebrate?\u201dDi Qiuhe looked at his arm, on which there was a pretty small bruise. Thinking of He Bai\u2019s slightly hoarse voice during the morning call, he leaned to the wall and heaved a silent sign, his shoulder drooped. \u201cSure. Let\u2019s enjoy ourselves when I\u2019m back. Please take care of Bai and make sure he takes medicine on time.\u201d Aware that Bai\u2019s voice was quite abnormal before, Di Qiuhe opinionatedly believed that it was because he woke up just now. He also felt the sleepy voice so cute...He was a pretty awful friend.Diu Qiuhe raised his hand to massage his forehead. He said several words and hung up before He Bai came over. He looked at the time and calculated the distance from his location to B City when an impetuous idea crossed his mind.Wang Boyi finished his reporting and was ready to buy some food for Di Qiuhe when his master pushed the door open and ran out, giving a command, \u201cBook a ticket for me. I\u2019m going back to B City!\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Wang Boyi caught him up in haste, utterly baffled, \u201cBut you have a training tomorrow, dear master. And the police will come at any time...\u201d\u201cYou stay here to deal with them. I\u2019m coming back in the evening and won't miss training.\u201d Di Qiuhe pressed the elevator button, \u201cI\u2019m going to the green grocery for some fruit. Book me a flight. We\u2019ll meet at the airport very soon. Be quick.\u201d After saying this, he strode into the elevator and pressed the switch, leaving Wang Boyi outside.Wang Boyi: \u201c\u2026\u201d If he had no idea that Master Di was single and had no intimate friend of the other sex, he would have thought Di Qiuhe was about to court a lass thousand miles away...Having a hurried meal outside, Niu Junjie drove He Bai to campus, murmuring, \u201cThere\u2019re someone cooking and washing clothes for us in my house. I don\u2019t know why you insist on coming back. Even staying in a hotel is better than living in the school. Here you have to go to the boiler room when you would like a cup of hot water.\u201d\u201cYour parents have come back. How could I bother them when I\u2019m sick?\u201d He Bai explained, and then said, \u201cMy fever has gone. I\u2019m feeling well. There\u2019s no need for you to look after me. Besides, your quilt isn\u2019t aired, and your sheet is still dirty. How could you sleep on it? Go straight home later to keep your parents company, will you?\u201dNiu Junjie kept silent in disapproval... But it didn\u2019t work. He Bai urged him towards the car and drove him to return home. Unfortunately, he forgot to bring the key to his dorm, thus unable to go in.\u201cThe other two will read you a lecture when they come back!\u201d Niu Junjie said indignantly. He bought a large bunch of food and requested the housemaster to give them to He Bai. After that, he drove home with a long face.Watching Niu Junjie\u2019s car running far away, He Bai smiled, went downstairs and fetched things from the housemaster. Then he took the Thermos flask, heading for the boiler room. The water dispenser downstairs broke down, while no maintenance worker would provide home service during the holiday.The sun blazed down, while He Bai didn\u2019t feel hot at all. He strolled along, with a full flask in his hand.\u201cLittle Puppy.\u201dHe Bai raised his hand to touch the forehead, puzzled. Strange as it may, something was ringing in his ear, and he suffered from delusions when his fever was obviously gone.\u201cWould you like it?\u201dAnother shadow loomed up beside his, and a delicate but strong hand was reached over him, with a large mango inside.He Bai stopped, stared at the mango for three seconds, and turned around to look at the person behind, frowning, \u201cYou childish guy, Why are you here?\u201d\u201cI got hurt and came back to get sympathy from my father.\u201d Di Qiuhe wore no hat this time but a T-shirt, a pair of running pants and canvas shoes. Short hair made him look pretty handsome. He poked He Bai in the dimple with the other hand, smiling, \u201cPity my father went out. My plan failed. So I turn to you. Could you please take me in?\u201dHe Bai got rid of his hand and cast a glance at his bruised arm when his anger faded. He rolled his eyes at Di Qiuhe, \u201cWhy are you so silly to seek sympathy without inquiring about your dad\u2019s whereabouts in advance? ... Come on, hurry to my dorm where there\u2019s air conditioning. You\u2019re sweating a lot.\u201d\u201cDon't you think I look sexy when sweaty?\u201d Di Qiuhe walked closer to He Bai, grabbed the flask from him, shook it and sighed with emotion, \u201cIt has been many years since I fetched hot water last time. I really miss it.\u201dHe who flaunted his wealth really needed a spanking!When Di Qiuhe recollected what hot-water fetching was like, He Bai looked at a bag of fruit in his hand, his brows raised, \u201cYou brought it from the border, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Di Qiuhe also raised his eyebrows in a more charming manner than He Bai, \u201cThis is bought on my way here. I\u2019ll get embarrassed if I come to visit you empty-handed. The fruit I selected are all your favorites. Am I good enough?\u201d\u201cSo good that I want to be your elder brother!\u201d He Bai answered back and stopped at the college supermarket, asking, \u201cHave you had lunch?\u201dDi Qiuhe covered his stomach with his hands, \u201cI\u2019m starving. I feel I can eat an elephant up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d He\u2019s really good at seizing an opportunity.He Bai forced a smile, flinging his head back at ease, \u201cKeep up. Your brother will go buy an elephant for you.\u201dDi Qiuhe caught him up, completely putting his dignity on the shelf, \u201cIt\u2019s really kind of you, brother. I would like the elephant you made by yourself.\u201dHe Bai: \u201c...\u201d\u201cBrother?\u201dHe Bai opened the freezer at the door, took an ice cream from inside and staffed it into Di Qiuhe\u2019s mouth. Then he strode into the door to pay, keeping as far from Di Qiuhe as he could.The Ice cream is milky, in which raisins were sandwiched. Di Qiuhe pulled it from his mouth, took a look at the brand name and smiled, with his eyes narrowed. Just as he expected, Little Puppy adored him a lot. It was obvious that he had inquired about his favorite ice cream brand.They got some food and went back to the dorm. He Bai took out a small electric rice cooker, plugged something in and started to cook noodles for Di Qiuhe.\u201cWhy do you plug this in?\u201d Di Qiuhe seemed awfully curious about it. He squatted in front of the rice cooker and kept touching the appliance.He Bai put the noodles in boiling water, beat an egg in, and began to unpack sausages, answering, \u201cThe switch will trip when excessive electrical devices are used in the dorm. Now it is equipped with air conditioning, so we have to pay more attention, but with it, everything will be okay.\u201dDi Qiuhe nodded. He stared at the bruise on He Bai\u2019s hands, which was caused by injection, and somehow had a sudden impulse to hold his hand and blow onto it to relieve the pain. Aware of what he was thinking about, he jumped out of his skin, walked to the air conditioning as if he was hot and talked nonsense, \u201cIt\u2019s too hot. What\u2019s the temperature of the air conditioning?\u201d\u201cIs it hot?\u201d He Bai looked up at him, found out the remote control and threw it over, \u201cI\u2019ve had an injection just now and did not switch the air conditioning to lower temperature. You can make it several degrees lower if you feel hot.\u201dDi Qiuhe immediately stopped pressing the button of the remote control and put it back, saying as if nothing had happened, \u201cActually, it\u2019s not too hot. I just need to wash my face.\u201d He walked to the washstand on the balcony while speaking. When he raised his eyes, a pair of underwear hanging on the window frame greeted him.A thump came.Di Qiuhe tripped up on the level ground, as if a fake tumble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: A Clap (1)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? \u201c He Bai heard the voice and raise his head, and then he turned his head promptly as if he hadn\u2019t seen anything when he saw Di Qiuhe falling on bottom. He then turned sideways to pull and rummage the bag of stuffs that Niu Junjie had bought. \u201cI remember there were spices, where it is...\u201dDi Qiuhe got up, rushed into the bathroom and slammed the door all at a dash.\u201c...\u201d How nimble he was.He Bai put aside the shopping bag and sighed. Certainly, man surely is a creature with high self-esteem no matter how puerile he is. It was too embarrassing to be seen slip and fall before the bathroom or so...Di Qiuhe firmly pressed his hands on the door handle of the bathroom, his face and ears were blushed, his heart was pounding and his forehead was sweating....It was the slippery ground that should be blamed!He raised his eyebrows and wondered which one should be mad at.The pup must have had mopped the floor today! The wet floor was the cause that he slipped! Furthermore, the under, underwear...How could it hang on the window frame? Shouldn\u2019t it be hung on the clothesline pole? The underwear at the window frame can be seen whenever people wash hands there, let alone the students outside as they may look up...What the hell!Next second, he snapped the door, went to the window frame as he was boiled over, and reached out his hand...then he grabbed the hanger hook with two fingers and took down the underwear, turned to He Bai, who remained squatting on the floor stewing noodles, and said, \u201cHow could you...hang it on the window frame! Have you had no idea that it may be seen by the students passing through downstairs!\u201dHe Bai looked up at him.It was seen that a handsome young man with broad shoulder and long legs stood with his back in the light, he wore an imposing posture and frightening expression, while he pinched a hanger which hung an underwear on his hand carefully and took it half a meter away from himself awkwardly.What a weird scene?He Bai was about to laugh as his mouth slightly curled up. However, looking at Di Qiuhe\u2019s blushed ears and such a malicious expression Di made and recalling the scene that Di had fell on asses, he struggled in mind for a bit, suppressed his laughter and solemnly replied, \u201cEven if I hang my underwear on the clothesline pole, one may walk through under it as one need to wash face there.\u201d As a matter of fact, the washed clothes in their dormitory were hanging on the clothesline pole, underwear was no exception. But he was so tired in the past two days that he washed his clothes in haste and hung the underwear on the window frame for being disinclined to hang it on clothesline pole...but he was never intended to irritate the kid born with a silver spoon in his mouth\u2014the endearing Childish Di.Oh, no, this was a good topic to distract attention from the disgraced Film Emperor.\u201c...But, but hang it on the window frame was terribly rude! One can catch a sight of it if one look up when washing faces. Di Qiuhe felt a bit hot as he raised his voice, and his back seemed to be sweated. He couldn\u2019t help conceiving himself walking under He Bai\u2019s white underwear, then he gave the rein to his imagination until he thought that the hanger may be broken down abruptly and the underwear crashed to...\u201cIt is prohibited to hang it on the clothesline pole!\u201d He was agitated and raised his voice while he was unaware of all this, just like the sternest parent in the world. \u201cYou have to change the hangers! Buy some steel ones! Plastics can be easily broken! In short, socks and jocks are prohibited to hang on the window frame for they may be seen by the students passing through by below. It may have a bad influence. Go and buy a vertical clothes hanger and put it in the corner!\u201dHe Bai looked at him in disbelief. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible to put a vertical clothes hanger in such a narrow dormitory?\u201dDi Qiuhe looked around the bedroom of four, focused on Niu Junjie and the other one\u2019s beds, and then he paused and frowned, \u201cYou can move out.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize a dormitory of four can be so troublesome and inconvenient? All in all, it\u2019s bad enough!A \u201csplash\u201d sound.He Bai threw the sliced sausage into the electric cooker and stirred, and he took out the disposable bowls and chopsticks and said, \u201cNo way, I\u2019m gonna live here for four years, moreover, LaoDa and the others don\u2019t mind seeing my underwear when they wash their faces. Everyone gets used to it. Why do you care about this so much?\u201dThat was to say, the little pup\u2019s underwear had been seen out by all the others in the dormitory?The news was a real Thunder Clap!Di Qiuhe felt like a fire burning in his heart, though he could not figure out where the fire came into being and why it burnt. What he knew was that he was unhappy. Just not feeling well! He used to hang his washed underwear on the clothes hanger back in the days he lived in dormitory, just as everyone else did.\u201cSo how long are you gonna hold my underwear?\u201d He Bai laid the bowl of filled noodles on the table, went straight to take the clothes hanger from Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand, and hung the underwear back on the window frame. He then turned around and pressed on Di Qiuhe\u2019s back to push him toward the table, said in a manner like coaxing a wayward child, \u201cEat noodles first, The Godmother (Lao GanMa, a China-brand chili sauce) is at the corner of the table, please help yourself as you wish. Our neighboring buildings are all boy dormitories. What\u2019s the matter of seeing an underwear? Didn\u2019t other boys see your underwear in your dormitory before? By the way, all your clothes were washed by housekeeping aunts and your wardrobe was tidied by these aunts when you lived in apartment. Why didn\u2019t you consider it was inconvenient to have your underwear to be seen by the aunts at that time? Besides, your stepmother had bought you some socks and jock to show her virtue when you lived in Di family\u2019s house? Anyway, all of my close-fitting clothes were bought by my mother when she was still alive. Just calm down, that\u2019s nothing but a piece of cloth.\u201d\u201c...\u201d The noodles were so delicious as he finally realized he was hungry, but suddenly he felt low. He Bai was right, his underwear had been seen by so many people. No wonder He Bai disliked it.\u201cNot anymore.\u201d He sat down and pinched his chopsticks, and said in earnest, \u201cI\u2019ll wash my underwear myself. And I\u2019ll buy some new ones and throw out all the old ones.\u201dHe Bai stared at the back of Di Qiuhe\u2019s head, speechless for a while, and raise hand and patted Di perfunctorily for two times and boasted, \u201cWell, Childish Di is really matured as you know to wash underwear by yourself. That\u2019s pretty good.\u201dDi Qiuhe put his chopsticks into the noodles bowl, turned his head while raising his eyebrows and staring at He Bai in anger. \u201cYou have to wash it yourself, too! Except the guys in the dormitory...you are not allowed to display your underwear to others!\u201dHow could he chatter on such a stupid topic.He Bai hold Di\u2019s head and turned it back, and then he said angrily, \u201cEat the noodles! Don\u2019t be naggy like an amah.\u201d He was not a psycho. Why should he display others his underwear? And how their conversation got so far here? Can\u2019t Di Qiuhe and he have a healthy and normal chat?Di Qiuhe was ready to get up with his tensed muscles, then he said in a warning voice. \u201cWhat am I look like did you say? An amah?\u201d He Bai was so naughty that he even dared to provoke his big brother\u2019s dignity.\u201cSit down and eat! Just behave yourself!\u201d He Bai took a decisive action to press Di down, patted him on the back of the head, and let go and stepped back. He Bai then took out pajamas from the cupboard and warned Di, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that again. There\u2019s ice water in that bag. Please eat and drink to calm down. I\u2019ve been getting injections all morning and I smelled like somewhat liquid medicine. I need to take a shower first, and you shall eat noodles! He then turned back to the bathroom and ended the boring conversation.With a \u201ckada\u201d sound, the door locked inside, and then came the sound of running water.Brother\u2019s anger for protecting dignity was temporarily quenched.\u201cWhat a devil...a little haughty pup.\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his hand and touched the back of his head, looking at the blurred frosted glass on the door of the bathroom and the underwear that had hung back on the window frame for quite a long time. He took out his cell phone and started typing.Di Qiuhe: Assistant Wang, I may have a fever. Please prepare me some antipyretics.Di Qiuhe: Xiuwen, what should I do if my brother doesn\u2019t listen to me?Wang Boyi\u2019s call came right away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: A Clap (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkJiang Xiuwen texted back: kill him and eat him.Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows, then powered his cellphone off and picked up his chopsticks. Such a valuable time for him to cultivate brotherhood with the pup shouldn\u2019t be disturbed.The bathroom\u2019s door opened when he had eaten half bowl of the noodles. He Bai, in a singlet and underpants, full of smell of soap, walked out while wiping his hairs dry. Di Qiuhe was stunned as shown in the way he held the chopsticks, but soon he recovered and ate the noodles faster.\u201cAre you full?\u201d He Bai came up to Di and looked at the bowl. He frowned at Di\u2019s devouring appetite, then took and opened a pack of noodles served with soy sauce out of his shopping bag, and poured some hot water and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. You have to eat more than usual as you\u2019re training every day. I would have stewed more noodles if I knew better. The noodle is pretty good. You can have a taste. And it doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t finish it. I\u2019ll finish the rest.\u201dWatching He\u2019s proficient movement in dealing with instant noodles, Di Qiuhe wandered his eyes over He\u2019s singlet.With He Bai stooping to put down the water bottle, his broad singlet collar loosed, revealing almost half of his chest and two delicate nipples.Crash.The chopsticks in Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand fell to the ground.\u201cYou brat...\u201d He Bai couldn\u2019t help looking up at him, then picking up the chopsticks on the ground and threw them into the garbage can, and getting a new one for Di and telling him, \u201cDon\u2019t lose this one. We are running out our disposable chopsticks saved in dormitory.\u201d\u201cIn, in fact, it can be used if it is washed.\u201d Di Qiuhe turned his head to avoid Di\u2019s eyes, took over the new chopsticks and rubbed, fixed his eyes on the noodles\u2019 bowl as he dared not turn around and stuttered, \u201cPup, even, even if there are only two of us, you\u2019re still supposed to behave yourself.\u201dHe Bai was confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He then reached his hands out and pulled out a sausage from the shopping bag. He unwrapped the package, took a bite and chewed, half leaning on the table and looking at Di Qiuhe.The singlet was really loose that Di could even see the waist from the cuff once He\u2019 hands reaching out, by the way, the thin hand holding sausage were really pretty, as well as the lips...Di Qiuhe was engrossed in eating noodles at once, and his heart was burning again, but he was still dim about what was it for. What he only knew was that he didn\u2019t know how to describe today\u2019s pup, somewhere was wrong...\u201cYou are not pup!\u201d His eyes lit up all of a sudden, then he put down the chopsticks and put his hand on He Bai\u2019s face, turning the face around and pinching the side of the face. \u201cTell me, are you wearing a mask? Where is the genuine pup? What have you done to him?\u201dWhat the hell?He Bai rolled his eyes to him and pulled his hand away, then sliced the sausage into two halves which had bitten twice, stuffed the half bit one in mouth and the other half in Di Qiuhe\u2019s mouth. And finally He Bai patted Di and asked, \u201cWhen will your father come home?\u201d It\u2019s too late to find a ride here. Watch your time.\u201d Di was afraid to look after the mischievous Childish Di. It was better to send Di away.Di Qiuhe was stunned just like a bucket of cold water poured down on him, then he raised his hand pulling out the sausage from his mouth, looking at He in disbelief, \u201cAre you chasing me away?\u201dHe Bai gave him a gentle smile and said, \u201cHow could I? It\u2019s just a reminder: you should go back early so as can have a ride. By the way, don\u2019t forget your plan of evoking sympathy.\u201dThe underwear, the singlet, the pleasant smell of soap, the heart-burning...all the manifold feelings faded away. Di Qiuhe calmed down right away, moved his eyes away from He\u2019s dimple, and bowed his head and looked at the noodles in the bowl. Then his voice lowered, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to stay at all.\u201d\u201c...\u201d What was the matter with such a sudden chagrin?\u201cI had sold the downtown apartment.\u201d Di Qiuhe put the sausage in the bowl, picked up the chopsticks again and stirred the noodle soup. \u201cI know that my father is in City B, but he doesn\u2019t want to see me. After all, he has to rely on the Qin family to stabilize Huangdu. To do this, he must first stabilize my stepmother, and that\u2019s why he can\u2019t meet me--the eldest son, who is hated by the stepmother...\u201dHe Bai dedicated to watch his performance.\u201cI have to stay in the villa where I met with you last time if I go back to City B, but it\u2019s empty and dirty, I\u2026\u201d He took a soft sigh, managed to smile at He Bai, followed by a bitter curl of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m so miserable, right? I could only talk to you even if I come back.\u201dClap.He Bai raised hand and slapped on Di\u2019s cheek.Di Qiuhe was stunned in his sad expression.\u201cA mosquito.\u201d He Bai withdrew his hand, showed the mosquito\u2019s body in his palm and blew it off. He looked at Di up and down, and turned to find some electric mosquito repellent.\u201cYou...\u201d Di Qiuhe was exasperated once again and then the feeling moved to his hand. His itchy hand was intended to hold and beat the pup.\u201cCongratulations. I\u2019ll let you stay for you put on a genuine performance.\u201d Then He Bai plugged in the electric mosquito repellent, turned around and climbed onto Niu Junjie\u2019s bed, rolled up and held down the mattress. And next he dragged the chair over to the window below the balcony, laid down the mattress to have it a sunbath, and returned to the wardrobe to get out a clean sheet and quilt cover and threw them on his bed. Finally, he climbed up and changed the sheet and quilt cover in a skilled manner.Di Qiuhe looked up at his thin legs stretching out of the bed. He had a little expectation as well as fear, and he finally asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cMake your bed.\u201d He Bai changed the clean sheet and quilt cover, took up the old ones and put them out of bed. He then went to the washstand and put them in a bucket and said to Di Qiuhe who followed him, \u201cYou can stay in my bed, and I in Lao San\u2019s. Such a sunny day should dry up the sheet and quilt.\u201dDi Qiuhe nodded in amazement and looked at him arranging everything in a systematic manner. He was filled with an inexplicable mood little by little, and then he came up to He and apple-polished, \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Actually, we can sleep in a bed so that you don\u2019t need to wash these sheets.\u201d It\u2019s well for brothers to sleep together and talk through the night.\u201cAre you sure the single bed can fit us two?\u201d He Bai started pouring washing powder into the bucket and looked back at Di. \u201cDo you want to help me?\u201dDi Qiuhe was suspecting the possibility of them sleeping together, then he nodded without any hesitation.\u201cThen you shall finish the noodles, then pour out the water in the bowl, and finally add some seasonings to keep eating.\u201d He Bai splashed the water on hands to Di\u2019s face, pressed his shoulder and turned him around when he closed his eyes, and pushed him into the dormitory. \u201cShut up and keep quiet until you\u2019re full.\u201dDi Qiuhe obeyed, raised his hand to wipe off the water on his face. Di looked back at He Bai after he took two steps, who was focusing on washing. He couldn\u2019t help smiling and humming back to the dormitory, going on eating noodles in a good appetite.He Bai heard the gibbering tune and rolled his eyes with a laugh. Di seemed like a child as expected as Di always did whatever he liked. A naive Childish Di.Ten minutes later, Di Qiuhe came with the noodles.\u201cFinished?\u201d He Bai threw the washed sheet into the basin and continued to wash pillowcase and quilt cover.\u201cNo.\u201d Di Qiuhe showed He the bowl, then scooped some noodles with chopsticks and fed He in an upright look, he then said, \u201cIt was you said that you\u2019ll finish it if I cannot. Here you are.\u201dNevertheless, He overestimated the mental age of Di Qiuhe.He Bai tilted his head back and said, \u201cPut it on the table, please, I\u2019ll eat it after washing these.\u201d\u201cThen it may be cold.\u201d Di frowned.He Bai explained, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter as it is dry mixed noodles.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re sick. That\u2019s not good for you.\u201d Di Qiuhe did not give in, and stretched forward the chopsticks.\u201c...\u201dThey stalemated for half a minute, then He Bai made a compromise and opened his mouth to eat the noodles. He was regretting that he had taken such a childish guy in his dormitory.Di Qiuhe looked at He\u2019s cheeks while He chewing the noodles, and he was flirted once again. Although the chopsticks were new, the noodles were half eaten by him. Now the pup had not loathed to eat the noodles that he had eaten without hesitation...the pup admired himself as expected! To such an extent that didn\u2019t mind his saliva at all!Being in a delighted mood, his IQ, which was suppressed by EQ, was finally went back to normal level, then he said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I had heard the gossips online. Jia family will then issue a statement, explaining those birthday photos. I will never allow the Saint Elephant Studio and online gossip to impact your work.\u201dHe Bai stunned, then he asked after swallowing the noodles, \u201cDid you call Jia family again?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Di Qiuhe rolled up another bite of noodles and fed it to He, telling He in an unintentional manner, \u201cI called Elder Jia. Besides, Miss Jia has just grown up. It is too young to marry her off in Jia family\u2019s view.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: A Clap (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai swallowed the noodles and wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s it got to do with Miss Jia? She just turned eighteen. No normal family will marry an eighteen-year-old daughter off. She is still a kid.\u201dAlthough had heard the fact of the online incident \u201cAcquainting Elder Brother\u201d from Elder Jia, Di Qiuhe finally dispersed the strange depressed feeling from his heart until now he saw the pup\u2019s wholly casual looks. He then fed He Bai again and said in earnest, \u201cPup, it\u2019s not good to fall in love at an early age.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d He Bai nodded. Girls of seventeen to eighteen-year-old are fragrant and innocent, whereas may easily be deceived by some play boys. Therefore, it\u2019s better to have parents supervising the girls or try to avoid an early love. If she does like someone, it\u2019s better to first inspect the guy\u2019s character before establishing a relationship.Di Qiuhe\u2019s smile turned even bigger and he fed the pup with more gusto as he saw the pup agreed with him.Hence one fed, the other one ate. And when the sheets were cleaned, they had had a chat of the online gossips, and the noodles were finished.The wind from air conditioner was blowing, and the washed sheets were hung on the clothesline pole, dripping water from time to time. Under the window, a mattress was lying on a chair, being heated by the sun.\u201cShall we?\u201d He Bai searched out a horror film and opened a bag of snack for Di Qiuhe. He then took up a mango and dragged over a garbage can, peeling the mango with a knife and saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been longing for watching this film, but I have no time. Now is the time. Would you like to watch a horror film?\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Di Qiuhe narrowed a chair toward He Bai, feeling that everything was fresh at this time, and he talked more than ever before he realized it. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Well, I can shoot some horror films later if you enjoy this genre.\u201dHe Bai recalled the classic horror film that Di Qiuhe had invested and performed, which would run a few years later, he nodded with a smile, \u201cGreat, your film must be excellent.\u201d Profitable, of course.Di Qiuhe was in a good mood for he was fondled once by He, then he picked up a snack and fed it to He, filled with the idea that \u201cI should be nice to pup if pup worships me to such an extent.\u201d And then he made an implicit promise that, \u201cI will pick up splendid script and perform it well.\u201dStaring at the snack for almost three seconds, He Bai then craned his neck and ate it. Then he cut off a piece of mango and fed it to Di, shamming a smile. \u201cThen I\u2019ll wait. Eat now, keep quiet, and hold on to a normal state. \u201cDi Qiuhe raised his eyebrows looking at He Bai and craned his neck to eat the mango from He. Di was pleasant, which can be sensed from his unconsciously pampering voice. \u201cTake it easy, it won\u2019t be too long.\u201dHe Bai quivered once and then took a pack of snacks and stuffed it in Di\u2019s hand.Di Qiuhe held the snack and sighed in \u201cdistress\u201d while he was cheerful actually. He took his mobile phone and sent a text message to Jiang Xiuwen.Di Qiuhe: My brother is so clingy. What should I do?Jiang Xiuwen: Kill yourself and make your brother a dinner.Ah, what a jealous man.Di Qiuhe put away his mobile phone and leaned closer to He Bai, who was concentrating on the film.It was time for dinner when they got through the film. He Bai made some easy bites to feed them up, then found another film to go on watching with Di Qiuhe.At ten in the evening, He Bai turned off his computer, took off the dried sheet and quilt and made the bed. Then he turned off the light and laid down on Niu Junjie\u2019s bed, he yawned and said to Di Qiuhe, who was already lying on the bed, \u201cGood night.\u201dDi Qiuhe turned sideways looking at He\u2019s blurred figure, smelling the scent of He Bai on the sheet and quilt, kept smiling and whispered, \u201cGood night, pup.\u201d I wish you\u2019ll dream about me.There was no reply. And a few minutes later, he heard some smooth breath.Di Qiuhe waited for a while to make sure that Di was asleep. He then got up with great care, took off He Bai\u2019s pajamas and put on his old clothes, looked around at the sleeping He Bai, said a goodbye in mind, and opened the door and left.After begging the supervisor of dormitory to open the door, he walked out of the building, took out his mobile phone and powered it on.He then received a large number of missed calls and text messages of Wang Boyi at once.He picked up one missed call and dialed it.\u201cThanks god, master Di, I finally get on the phone! Have you just got off the plane? I\u2019ll send a car to pick you up.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Di Qiuhe looked back at the dormitory building in the dim night and showed off in his unintentionally relaxed voice. \u201cI stayed here for a longer time than expected for He Bai missed me so much. Thus I had to reschedule my ticket.\u201dWang Boyi turned his voice up in surprise. \u201cYou mean, you\u2019re in City B now? ! And you want to hurry back tonight? But you have a training session of marching on foot tomorrow, if you don\u2019t have a quality rest...\u201cI know. Send a car in time to pick me up. That\u2019s all.\u201d Di Qiuhe hung up the phone, looked back at the room where He Bai was, and stepped outside the school.The gossip online had thoroughly fermented. After He Bai\u2019s announcement was found out, his Weibo fans soared by more than 100,000 overnight, and were still increasing. Several younger generations of Jia family and the official account of Yi Ka apparel followed his Weibo for the first time, and forwarded his statement to support him silently.Shortly afterwards, another batch of B-list celebrities also followed his micro-blog, and blogged to support him. It was as if they and He Bai had become good friends at the first meeting at Jia family\u2019s dinner party.Compared with the boisterous situation happened to He Bai, the Saint Elephant Studio was somewhat miserable. The Weibo of Ma Qun and Ma Xingtong were all dominated by netizen, while the netizens who paid for the feature of photo reply having tacitly updated the photos taken by Ma Qun for Miss. Jia\u2019s birthday under their account.He Bai sat in the back row of the bus and cannot get through Di Qiuhe. He then kept on surfing the photos circulated on the Internet. He realized that the boss of the Saint Elephant who had consented Ma Qun to take birthday photos probably had shit in head.Where did their confidence come from? Insisting on booking a novice Ma Qun to be the main shoot, who was at low level even in the composition of a picture. Was it because the company going too well?He shook his head, opened his Weibo homepage, ignored the praising comments of netizen. He first back followed the Weibo of Jia families and the official accounts of Yi Ka apparel, then posted a thanks message to his supporters, and finally he posted a message to appease Di Qiuhe\u2019s fans after thinking for a while.White and Whiter: Thank you, fans of Di\u2019s, for your support and encouragement. Your idol now is a good eater and sleeper, all is well. And he is working hard to make a new start. Take it easy and bless him.After a brief lull, the Weibo was soon discovered and reposted by Di Qiuhe\u2019s fans, and the number of He Bai\u2019s fans soared...While He Bai, who was preparing to get off, was unaware of all this.Little Mermaid had come to the final preparatory stage before going to the public, and He Bai had generally accomplished his work. Whereas he went to company every day, and was ready for new ideas that may come out of the Publicity Department.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a dedicated costume photographer like you.\u201d After the successful publicity of the fairy series, Lin Xia was much less stressed and treated He Bai in a more affable manner. \u201cYou should have a good rest as you just recovered. You\u2019ll be called if something important happened. There\u2019s no need to come day by day.\u201dHe Bai slouched in the sofa, said in a wilful tone, \u201cSister Lin, are you trying to drive me away for I enjoyed company\u2019s air conditioner and WIFI? No way, I won\u2019t go for I\u2019m one of the Little Mermaid. I deserve these resources!\u201dLin Xia was amused by his words. As soon as she was intended to amuse him back, He Bai\u2019s cell phone rang on the desk. She then shut up and motioned him to answer the phone.He Bai picked up the phone and saw that it was an unknown number. He answered in doubt, \u201cHello, who\u2019s that?\u201dLin Xia was sensible to get up to avoid listening to his conversation.\u201cHold on!\u201d He Bai\u2019s facial expression became weird all of a sudden, motioning Lin Xia to stay, and he asked as confirming over the phone, \u201cExcuse me, you mean to take a set of photos for your daughter, Miss Di Chunhua, by taking the advantage of the Little Mermaid\u2019s main Princess collection?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Summer Cold (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkLin Xia sat back immediately at the moment when He Bai said this.The man on the other side of the phone said a few words more, and He Bai got more and more confused. He looked at Lin Xia, while trying to make sure on the phone with a slower pace, \u201cI understood. You mean you would like to have your daughter choose her favorite set of clothes to take photos in all of the clothing series to be launched currently by Little Mermaid?\u201dLin Xia frowned and her eyes were shadowed with a shade of unhappiness.\u201cYes. I\u2019ve heard that Mr. He and my son Qiuhe are good friends. So if we cooperate successfully, then Qiuhe will be very happy as he loves his sister so much.\u201d Qin Li got a gentle and pleasant voice, yet she spoke in a directive tone which was usual to a superior.He Bai saw that Lin Xia was displeased, and he guessed that Lin Xia was not quite willing to lend out the princess series. Therefore he replied in a good manner, \u201cMrs. Di, I and Qiuhe are indeed good friends. But I think public and private lives should always be kept separate. I am now just a photographer of the clothes of Little Mermaid, so I can\u2019t decide if the clothes should be lent out or not. Thank you for your appreciation and invitation. I will definitely convey your request honestly to the person in charge of Little Mermaid. And once there is a result the person in charge will inform you instantly. Thank you again for your love and support towards Little Mermaid. Good-bye.\u201d He hung up right after the speech and looked at Lin Xia.Lin Xia was consoled a little bit by him, and she asked, \u201cIt was Qin Li the chairman\u2019s wife of Huangdu who wanted to borrow the Princess collection?\u201d He Bai nodded and showed her the number on the phone.Being in charge of a luxurious clothing brand, Lin Xia had a whole picture in mind of all the contact details of those wives from the upper class of city B. So after a glance at the last few digits of that number, she was quite sure that it was Qin Li\u2019s daily working number. She frowned and thought for a while, \u201cI\u2019ll handle this, you don\u2019t need to care about it anymore. If she calls you again, just brush her off like before.\u201dHe Bai said yes and asked tentatively, \u201cThen what about Mrs. Di\u2019s request to borrow the Princess collection\u2026\u201d\u201cNot gonna happen!\u201d Lin Xia replied firmly. She then said ironically, \u201cWe have been promoting our brand for so long by saying \u2018unveiling the secret Princess collection upon the day we launch it.\u2019 As long as she was sane she would never have come here and made such an unreasonable request. Besides, the Princess collection is the highlight of Little Mermaid, so the company has already decided who to wear it first a long time ago. Not even I can decide it. That\u2019s why there is only one answer to her request, which is no.\u201dHe Bai was struck by thought after hearing it. He recalled the scene of Di Qiuhe falling down from the building in the last life and how Di Chunhua looked like when she cried her heart out in front of the reporters\u2019 cameras. He also recalled the cute look of Di Qiuhe eating noodles in his dormitory, and suddenly wanted to protect him. He frowned on purpose and asked her in confusion, \u201cBut Ms. Lin, why didn\u2019t Mrs. Di ask you directly if she wanted to borrow the Princess collection? Why did she call a newly-appointed photographer like me? And why did she mention the friendship between me and Di Qiuhe? What did she mean? If she wanted to seek for a favor through my friendship with Qiuhe, then she should have called him first and asked him to tell me. It would be better that way. I don\u2019t see it\u2019s making any sense the way she handled this matter. But if she just wanted to borrow the clothes and then patronize the work of Qiuhe\u2019s friend, which was me, she should also have gone to you first. She should have complimented me in front of you and then it might work. Now she went to me directly without contacting you so that I still needed to tell you about that. No matter if she could borrow it or not, I would be suspected of taking Little Mermaid as my own wardrobe and doing favors on my own will. Then you wouldn\u2019t be happy about that. This is purely sowing division between us. So what does she want for all of this?\u201dLin Xia was quite confused by his speech. She hadn\u2019t thought that much, but now she couldn\u2019t help thinking about it further.Of course, as the wife of Huangdu\u2019s chairman and the manager of the department of artists reserve, Qin Li would never have done such a stupid thing. Her phone call today was very improper, either out of private or public reason. If she wasn\u2019t by He\u2019s side when he was answering the phone, she would definitely had felt unhappy about him making an unreasonable request when he mentioned it. Although she wouldn\u2019t do anything to He, but if there was a discord between them, it would somehow affect their cooperation and that would be very harmful to the future work.Little Mermaid was a new brand and it wasn\u2019t easy to find the right photographer. Now a great success was right at the doorstep, if He went into a quarrel with Little Mermaid because of this clothes-borrowing incident, then the popularity of Little Mermaid would probably be halved, as it relied heavily on He Bai\u2019s photography technique.Moreover, she heard that, as a stepmother, Qin Li didn\u2019t have a good relationship with the oldest son. Now she suddenly made such an improper phone call to the good friend of the oldest son, and also in the name of the oldest son. That was really confusing.Let\u2019s assume that the phone call was not made by Qin Li out of stupidity, but on purpose...then not only did she want to set the oldest son up, but also she wanted to set the good friend of him up. So she aimed at driving a wedge between the oldest son and his good friend?She was struck when thinking about that and had a feeling that she might have found the truth. Women know how bitchy they peers could be. Qin Li must have hated the son left by the first wife so much that she wished he had been isolated by all of his friends and family.Even if she had already had a conclusion, Qin Li asked cautiously, \u201cHe, how long have you known the oldest son of Huangdu? Has he got many friends around him?\u201dHe Bai shook his head honestly and kept forging a poor image of Di Qiuhe, \u201cNot for so long. And I think you have already heard that Di was my senior. His family was not in a good condition, and ever since his grandpa died he has been...I never saw any other friend of him anyway.\u201dThe more uncertain the answer is, the more space to speculate.Lin Xia slightly frowned and her eyes were filled with sympathy. \u2018Ever since the grandpa died he has not been in a good situation...That\u2019s why people always say with a stepmother comes the stepfather.\u2019 For all these years, no one ever knew that there was an oldest son in Huangdu. That was definitely because of Qin Li.Di Qiuhe had always been regarded as a great kid of great personality and capability. He was a senior who took good care of his junior student that he even introduced a great job to him, yet he didn\u2019t have any friends around. Maybe, it was because of the interference of the stepmother that he dared not to make any friends.Now Di Qiuhe had terminated the contract with Huangdu and left the Di family. He finally made a new friend but the stepmother again...The more Lin Xia speculated, the more sympathetic she was towards Di Qiuhe. She looked at He Bai\u2019s innocent face and sighed, \u201cHe, Mrs. Di\u2019s phone call was definitely not friendly, and you should keep distance to her and try not to have any contacts with her. Since Di Qiuhe could introduce this deal with the Jia family to you, he must cherish you a lot. So you should cherish his goodwill as well. I think you should tell him about what happened today.\u201dHe Bai didn\u2019t expect that his camouflage was so successful, so he nodded right after and said that his senior was doing good and he would keep their friendship, also telling him about today\u2019s story honestly.Lin Xia was satisfied with his words and told him some other stuff about work, then she left to deal with the clothes-borrowing issue of Qin Li.Watching Lin Xia leave, He Bai recalled the tone of Qin Li in the phone call and labeled her as unfriendly. Then he took out his phone and wrote a message to Di Qiuhe.\u201cYour stepmother just called me to borrow the Princess collection for your sister to take photos. My boss rejected and felt sympathetic about your situation.\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s call came immediately.He Bai was astonished for a second then asked surprisingly, \u201cGee! You turned on your phone?? Is the training over?\u201d\u201cYeah, the martial coach just returned me my phone.\u201d Di Qiuhe leaned on the tree with sweat all over his body. His camouflage was totally wet and his face was full of fatigue, yet his voice was quite steady. He asked, \u201cMy stepmother called you? What did she say?\u201dHe Bai roughly repeated the phone call and told him about his conversation with Lin Xia, then asked with confusion, \u201cMs.Lin left with a terrible face. It looked like she was going to handle some kind of national affair, which was super weird. I\u2019ve never seen her that way.\u201dDi Qiuhe had already analyzed his words and got the whole picture of that story. He couldn\u2019t help laughing and praising him, \u201cNice job, puppy.\u201d\u201cHuh? What do you mean?\u201d He Bai got even more confused.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Summer Cold (2)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cThe brand positioning of Little Mermaid is a light luxury. As its brand leader, Lin Xia must have maintained a good relationship with the executives of Yi Ka Apparel, probably even related in blood. Now you have built a good image of me in front of her, also you smeared my stepmother at the same time. That was equal to bringing shame to my stepmother in front of all the upper-class wives of B city, and also consolidating my image of a poor kid bullied by his stepmother.\u201d Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help smiling at the thought of He Bai defending him. He slightly laughed and continued, \u201cMy stepmother wanted nothing but getting closer to you so that she could get to know my current situation thus she could trick me accordingly. That\u2019s why she called you. She bribed my former roommate like this before, so you don\u2019t need to respond to her at all. She tried to play the same trick this time, but she failed to consider about Yi Ka Apparel. She deserved that. As for Lin Xia\u2019s expression\u2026puppy you should never underestimate women\u2019s sense of justice and their deep hatred towards some ethical issues.\u201d\u201c...\u201d He Bai was so enlightened and asked, \u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m laughing because you are adorable.\u201d Di Qiuhe unbuttoned the collar of his camouflage uniform and looking up at the burning sun. He spoke slightly in a slow and gentle voice, \u201cBai, you really have a terrible sleep look, and you snore like a piggy.\u201dIn the very beginning, He Bai was touched by his voice, but later on, he was irritated by Di\u2019s words and hung up the phone. He sneered and thought, \u201cSnore? For so many years that I have lived through, no one ever said I snore! How dare this dumbass try to fool me? Never!\u201dListening to the engaged tone on the phone and thinking about the angry look of the puppy right now, Di Qiuhe bowed down his head and laughed for a while. He then called Wang Boyi and told him, \u201cGo check to whom will Little Mermaid lend the Princess collection, and spread some pieces of news about how Di Chunhua bullies her classmates and how Qin Li connives her daughter\u2019s bullying behavior. Let\u2019s cheer my father up.\u201dWang Boyi said yes and asked as he didn\u2019t really get it, \u201cWhy would the boss be happy when seeing that kind of news?\u201d Well, in order to be a reliable assistant, you have to keep it up with your boss\u2019s mind, or you will fuck it up sooner or later. Wang was obviously trying to keep it up like that.\u2018It is absolutely a good thing that your subordinates like to use their brains and raise questions when they don\u2019t understand.\u2019 Di Qiuhe was in a good mood, so he explained a bit, \u201cYour big boss is trying so hard to take control of the Qin family and Qin Li. If there appear some unpleasant rumors about his wife and daughter, he will definitely add fuel to the flame secretly. And of course, he will pretend to worry about the situation of his wife and daughter and act like a good husband and father. Now such a nice chance is at his doorstep, why wouldn\u2019t be happy about it?\u201d\u201cYes, he would.\u201d Wang Boyi was speechless and got a deeper understanding of family love in rich and powerful families. If all of those assumptions were true, then what kind of human was the boss who set traps to his own wife and daughter? He trembled and felt abruptly lucky that he betrayed his big boss.\u201cGo get things done if you understood.\u201d Di Qiuhe wiped out the sweat on his forehead and hung up his phone. He took out a coin out of his pocket and played it with his eyes squinted.He sneered and thought, \u201cHow dare she try to get to puppy. It seems that somebody is going too far off the line.\u201dSoon a week had passed, Qin Li called twice to try to connect with He Bai, but got all rejected by him politely. Maybe she had realized something, or Lin Xia had responded to her, Qin Li finally stopped her action when it entered August.The countdown had begun for the market news conference of the Little Mermaid. The publicity department finally started to change ideas quite often and He Bai was getting busier gradually.Just three days ahead of the news conference, the news of the daughter of Huangdu\u2019s chairman bullying classmate at school broke out on the internet all of a sudden.The news was quite detailed in describing the evil behaviors of Di Chunhua, such as always escaping from school events by feigning sickness, throwing her weight about, bullying students from ordinary families relying on her money, being rude to the teachers, forming cliques with the reason of helping students become celebrities and messing up school discipline, etc. All of those improper behaviors were pointing to the misguiding of Qin Li as a mother to her daughter so that she was raised up as a bully at school.This news was soon brought up to the top news board. Many students who knew the truth spoke up in the comments. They said that Di Chunhua had done way more bad things than those, yet money talks! Those bigger things were covered by her family, so those things we saw right now were just side dishes.For example, Di Chunhua once forced a newly-assigned teacher to kneel down and apologize to her, just because she scolded her once in public. Also, Di Chunhua once pushed a girl who was more popular than her off the stairs, which almost disfigured her face. In the end, her family paid a lot of money and forced that girl to change her school and leave B city.The netizens were attracted by this scandal, but all of a sudden, it just went 404 before they could discuss it at all. And those heating topics disappeared too as if they had never existed.There must be something shady going on in this. Someone was paying the PR to handle this!The netizens were shocked then thrilled. They all went to the official Weibo account of Huangdu and asking for the details. However the official account had closed its comment, so they could only stay curious as they had nowhere else to share their enthusiasm.Without exposure, the heat of the news was soon cooling down. In that night, a Weibo account that was famous for its righteousness and neutrality posted a piece of anonymous breaking news. It said that Qin Li and her daughter were so shameless that not only did they let the PR cover the news, they also went to the school to threaten the school principals. How dare they do that!The person in the know was a student at school. And according to her words, she must be an introvert girl. She claimed that she was the child of a teacher and was in the same grade as Di Chunhua. And the young teacher who was forced to kneel down was her relative who was forced to resign. Probably out of the grievance for her relative, she spoke out a lot of deeds Di Chunhua had done at school, and she said that it was true that Di Chunhua pushed a student off the stairs. That girl was now in D country for medical treatment, for she had got mental issues.Finally, the netizens had found a place to vent their raging anger about the scandal, so they rushed into this Weibo post and started to voice their comments. More and more breaking news showed up in the comments, and this post was right about to go up to the heating news board. Yet suddenly, it got deleted again. The poster sent a sticker of \u201ctoo weak to provoke\u201d and then disappeared.Once and again. Now the poster dared not to show up all because of the excessive behavior of Qin Li and her daughter. And the speed of their PR operation also proved that all those breaking news were true!Now the netizens were furious, and the public opinions had fermented, and you could see people talking about Di Chunhua incident at all the comment sections of heating Weibo posts that they almost occupied the platform. At the same time, a group of people showed up and said it was totally reasonable that Qin Li had brought up a daughter like that, as she once bullied the son of the first wife so harsh.Therefore, the public opinion has turned from \u201copposing the bully of the rich daughter to the students\u201d to \u201cchecking out those bad things done by the stepmother\u201d. Those secrets of the Di family were digged out by netizens by all means and became the topic of their gossiping.\u201cBullshit! Full of bullshit!\u201d Di Chunhua smashed her phone to the ground and her mind was blown up, \u201cThey were all licking my ass before and trying so hard to appease me when they want to become a superstar. Now they are cursing me so hard like that! What a bunch of bitches!\u201dQin Li was also quite unsettled and impetuous, she jumped on her after hearing that, \u201cJust shut up! What the heck did you just say? Who taught you those dirty words? For how many times have I told you to stay low at school? Look at you, causing trouble every day as if you\u2019re crazy, finally someone has turned you in. Now you are labeled as a bully who bullied both the student and teacher, how am I supposed to find you a husband when you grow up?\u201d\u201cMom!\u201d Di Chunhua said in a lower voice, but also with some disturbance and anger, \u201cI was so wronged! I didn\u2019t do that!\u201d\u201cDid you force that teacher to kneel down? Did you push that student down the stairs?\u201d Qin Li tried so hard to keep herself calm down, indicating Chunhua to sit down next to herself. She eased her temper for a bit and said, \u201cChunhua, now you are a big girl, you have to understand that people will talk. You can, of course, look down upon those who are inferior to you, but you should always keep it to yourself and never show it up! Rumor can never really hurt you, but it can cause damage to your interests. This time you should have learned a lesson and please behave yourself in the future. That bastard Di Qiuhe is indeed a pest, yet he does one thing better than you, which is with his camouflage. He is just so good at it that people all think he is the one getting bullied.\u201dDi Chunhua was very resentful, \u201cMom! So you want me to copy that bastard? Never!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to copy him, I just want you to learn to only show them the good side of yourself.\u201d Qin Li tapped her and cuddled her into her arms then said, \u201cIt just happened so instantly. I talked with the headmaster the day before and clarified the whole thing, but the disclosure of me threatening the headmaster came out right on the other day. I couldn\u2019t even help you through the channel of the school. Besides the trick of putting it up to the heating news board then deleting it, which worked the netizens up into a frenzy. That was just so well-planned and quick. There must have been someone behind the scene.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Summer Cold (3)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cWho was that?!\u201d Di Chunhua went explosive again and raised her voice, \u201cWas it Di Qiuhe the bastard? I knew it must be him! I\u2019m gonna ruin him.\u201cWhat did I just tell you?\u201d Qin Li grabbed her and thought about the phone call from her assistant An. Her eyes flashed and then she said in a low voice, \u201cNo. It can\u2019t be Qi Qiuhe. He is not that powerful. This drama of blowing a breaking news then deleting it might look easy, but it needs a lot of connections and money to practice. Di Qiuhe doesn\u2019t have them.\u201dDi Chunhua was struck hearing it and she asked immediately, \u201cThen who could it be to pick on me?\u201dSuddenly someone knocked on the door, and heard the nanny saying, \u201cMadam, Sir has just returned and is looking for you.\u201dQin Li couldn\u2019t help but sneer for a second, and then changed into her calm face soon. She dragged Di Chunhua up and spoke to the nanny, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m coming.\u201d\u201cMom?\u201d Di Chunhua was terrified by her sneering, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you and dad?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Qin Li looked down at her and touched her hair with a gentle smile, \u201cChunhua, always remember that all of mom\u2019s tolerance and sacrifice now are for you and Xiasong to have a future that you don\u2019t need to obey anyone. So please just stand for the moment, okay?\u201dDi Chunhua barely understood her yet she nodded.In the border province, Di Qiuhe leaned on the window and was playing coins in his hand.\u201cSo you mean assistant An wants to be with you?\u201dWang Boyi\u2019s eyes were full of complexity and nodded, \u201cYes, she said she has already shown her sincerity.\u201dDi Qiuhe raised his eyebrow and looked at him with a faint smile. He asked, \u201cThen what about your decision?\u201dWang Boyi bent down his head and went silent. He then looked up at him after a bit of struggling and said firmly, \u201cI will listen to you.\u201dThat was out of expectation but reasonable.Di Qiuhe nodded and put those coins into his pocket and replied, \u201cThen you can go back and console her. I will give you a short vacation.\u201dWang Boyi unconsciously relaxed his slightly tightened body, and then a trace of self-mockery flashed in his eyes as he realized his change. He answered respectfully and then turned and left.After he had left, Qi Qiuhe took out his phone and opened his secret WeChat account after a second of hesitation.The message was from White and Whiter, \u201cHow have you been lately? Do you feel better now?\u201dIt was from two days ago but he still hadn\u2019t replied. It had been millions of times that he deleted those words in the reply column after typing them. He couldn\u2019t help but felt a bit suffocated when he unconsciously thought of the way puppy squatting on the ground and cooking noodles for him.This kind of clueless feeling made him confused and agitated, and he didn\u2019t know how to get rid of it.After a few minutes, he finally came back to himself and sighed slightly. He fell on the couch and then dialed Jiang Xiuwen\u2019s number.\u201cShoot, I would love to help if you want to kill your brother or yourself this time.\u201dHearing a good friend\u2019s voice, his suffocated mind got a little bit better. He asked, \u201cWhat would you do if you just met a new friend and was being totally nice to him but he tricked you with a secret account?\u201dJiang Xiuwen was struck for a bit and swallowed his sarcasm. He sat straight and asked, \u201cSo you were busted by puppy?\u201d\u201cNo. I am just asking. What would you do if you were tricked?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019d punch him and never speak to him again.\u201d Jiang Xiuwen answered without hesitation.Di Qiuhe went into silence.\u201cNow you want to be a good man and no more cheating?\u201dDi Qiuhe remained silent.Jiang Xiuwen rolled his eyes. According to his understanding of his best friend, if he refused to speak then it was definitely because he was in a bad mood and mad at himself.\u201cThat outcome I just mentioned is based on the situation that he finds out the truth first.\u201d He stopped for a second and continued to say in a lower tone, \u201cBut if the cheater could tell the truth and apologize sincerely, I might just punch him but wouldn\u2019t just cut off the relationship.\u201dYet Di Qiuhe still remained silent.Jiang Xiuwen had to suspect, \u201cHey you dumbass! Are you off the line or fooling me?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Di Qiuhe finally talked, with a normal tone but sounded crestfallen, \u201cThen what was the case when you are with someone and always feel hot and sweaty? Were you sick?\u201d\u201cHot and sweaty?\u201d\u201cYeah. Also tend to be emotional and stutter.\u201dJiang Xiuwen\u2019s face went funny and asked, \u201cTell me first, with whom you would have those feelings?\u201d\u201cMy brother.\u201d Now he sounded like he was in a good mood.\u201cThat puppy?\u201d Jiang Xiuwen suddenly felt a bit choked and asked again, \u201cA boy?\u201dDi Qiuhe was a little bit mad, \u201cHow can a brother be a girl?\u201dJiang Xiuwen turned away his head and took a deep breath. He grabbed his phone tightly and then continued to ask, \u201cWhat else symptoms do you have aside from feeling hot and sweaty? Such as heart bouncing, face blushing, legs relaxing or wanting to touch him and hug him and so on?\u201d\u201cNo heart bouncing.\u201dJiang Xiuwen relieved.\u201cSometimes my heart will bounce, but it\u2019s just normal that my face blushed because it\u2019s hot summer. And my brother is so cute, don\u2019t you want to touch your brother in a friendly way?\u201d Di Qiuhe answered naturally and also with some dissatisfaction, \u201cWhy are you asking so much? I thought you know a lot since your mom is a doctor. Now it seems that I have expected too much from you.\u201dJiang Xiuwen covered his phone and screamed silently for a bit then went back to the line with a serious voice, \u201cYou just got a hot fever and it\u2019s no big deal. You don\u2019t need to take medicine, just drink some cold water and relax.\u201dDi Qiuhe doubted, \u201cDrinking cold water for a hot fever? And how come I only get hot fever when I am with puppy?\u201dJiang Xiuwen was racking his brain and fooled him, \u201cWell, now it\u2019s hot summer, I bet you are quite excited going to meet your brother. Also it takes a while for you to go there by car and walking, so you will definitely feel hot when you meet him. That\u2019s totally normal, just drink more water.\u201d\u201cNow it makes some sense.\u201d Di Qiuhe answered with a thoughtful expression on his face.This retarded...how dared he to say \u201cNow it makes some sense.\u201d Look how gay he had become for his \u201cbrother\u201d! He deserved it all!Jiang Xiuwen cursed secretly and tried so hard to comfort Di Qiuhe in a more certain tone. Finally he fooled all of his questions about his pure puppy love.After the call, Jiang Xiuwen was covered with sweat. He fell on his couch and thought about the look and personality of He Bai, and also the personality and bad behaviors of his best friend. He was so in despair.It was so screwed up. His best friend was gay. And he had fallen for a mysterious junior.His best friend was already calling him \u201cbrother\u201d all the time now, and this was because he was still innocent. What if he finally became not innocent...How could he get He Bai who was getting more and more talented and outstanding? He was such a bad dude and with all of those dishonest past. He would write his name backwards if they didn\u2019t end up as enemies. And once he failed to get him\u2026That would be the end of the world!No way! He would never let his best friend get it before he came up with a sound idea.He stood up and cursed Di Qiuhe thousands of times at heart and then started to search for gay relationship tips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: He was Screwed (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkThe day before the press conference of the Little Mermaid, the heat in regard to Di Chunhua\u2019s disclosure online had faded drastically under the instruction of Di Bian. The Netizen\u2019s attention can be diverted by some other hot topics, then everything concerned would be left behind. But that very night, Di Chunhua went online to compete for Darwin Award. To everyone\u2019s surprise, she posted a Weibo, accusing He Bai of not making a clear distinction between company and his personal interests, alleging He of being instigated by Di Qiuhe to take no pictures of the Little Mermaid\u2019s main collection for her. Besides, she warned He not to be triumphant, and such rags were only for beggars. No big deal to her at all! Anyone who disgraced her should be doomed!The post was deleted within just five minutes, however, the tactful netizen had taken screenshot.Netizen one: How can Photographer He be involved in the affair? Miss, are you trying to divert our attention? How could it be possible that a company\u2019s photographer in charge of clothes lending matters. Photographer He was made a scapegoat. Are you ashamed? Come on. No one knew that you were refused to borrow the clothes if you don\u2019t tell, okay?Netizen two: The Little Mermaid has been publicizing for a long time, addressing that the Princess collection will be unveiled on the very day of the press conference. How could you ask them to lend you the garments before that day? You may take it for granted that everyone else should spoil you like your mother. They just did a right thing. How could it be blamed on Di Qiuhe, as does He Bai. How could they always run into fool and be such a scapegoat.Netizen three: Rags? For beggars? I\u2019m afraid that Miss Di may put on gold on a daily basis. I hope you keep your words that never ever wear Little Mermaid\u2019s clothes afterwards.The ironic comments came one after another and were connected to the Little Mermaid.Shortly afterwards, Yi Ka apparel made an official statement, explaining the process of borrowing clothes, and then thanked Di Chunhua for her affection and support for the Little Mermaid, retrieving the Di family\u2019s reputation in a gentle manner, so as not to an awkward extent to both sides.Unexpectedly, Di Chunhua looked for trouble once again. She posted a new one saying that her account had been usurped, and the last post was not sent by her.Netizen: \u2026You treat us like fool?If you have made a reasonable explanation from taking advantage of Yi Ka\u2019s statement, you\u2019ll get over it smoothly. How dare you give us such a stupid excuse to fool us all. Are you trying to give a slap in Yi Ka\u2019s face who had just spoke for you, or to destroy your family\u2019s reputation?\u201cThat\u2019s true! My account was usurped! Which bitch did it to me!\u201d Di Chunhua screamed and smashed her new mobile phone one more time.With her face as calm as water, Qin Li was thinking over every single possibilities. But the more she thought about it, the more irritated she became.She had sent someone to investigate Di Bian, but there was no clue. If Di Bian did usurp Chunhua\u2019s account, what did he do that for? She had done everything he wished, such as, letting the Qin family to be tractable by stopping making trouble in Huangdu. By this time, Di Bian had gradually come around and changed his mind. . . No, it couldn\u2019t be Di Bian. Although he put interests as the paramount, he still loved both his son and daughter on the premise that the interests could be ensured.As such a big company, Yi Ka apparel shall never offend her, one of its major clients, for a few Weibo posts sent by her daughter. Thus those Weibo posts will not lead to any substantial damage to Chunhua except for a few more scolds.It was more like a prank against her daughter than a conspiracy.So who had usurped the account? What was his or her purpose of sending those Weibo posts? Only her assistant and service staff of Yi Ka knew the process of borrowing clothes, whereas the one who could get daughter\u2019s Weibo account. . .She frowned and looked at her daughter and asked, \u201cChunhua, have you ever told your classmates about your Weibo account? Are there any of them who don\u2019t get along well with you?\u201dDi Chunhua\u2019s thought was taken away in an instant. After a moment\u2019s reflection, she nodded and expressed her resentment.\u201d Yeah! Quite a few!\u201dThe mother and daughter were further misled, they had made various analysis of Di Chunhua\u2019s several classmates. At the same time, the Little Mermaid brand\u2019s market release had been grandly launched as planned. Countless big celebrities were present, shining on the scene.As a costume photographer of Little Mermaid, He Bai was arranged to show up with the costume designer of the Little Mermaid, receiving congratulations from guests and praises from the boss. Only then did he know that Zhu Ke, the owner of Yi Ka apparel, was Yang Fu\u2019s aunt, who had made a great contribution to his getting of the current job.\u201cThank you, Miss Yang.\u201d He found Yang Fu and gave her a sincere thanks after the reception began.\u201cIt\u2019s me that should thank you for all that. In order to express her heartfelt thanks for helping her find such a talent as you, my aunt has given me a lot of benefits.\u201d Yang Fu held her wine cup and muffled her voice with her hand over her lips, being approachable and friendly.He Bai smiled and thanked her for her kindness and understanding. He made fun of her words and cut the formalities.Over the main stage, Zhu Ke and Lin Xia proposed their toast, glanced at the He Bai, who was smiling and talking with Yang Fu, and asked, \u201cWhat do you think of him?\u201dLin Xia also looked at He Bai, smiling and nodding, \u201cPretty good, but Yi Ka apparel may be unable to stay him for long.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zhu Ke was surprised.\u201cHe gets progress so fast that costume photographers can never be his career\u2019s destination. Sister Ke, we shall get ready to look for the next costume photographer for Little Mermaid.\u201d Lin Xia said with some regret that she blessed him on the one hand while felt pity for couldn\u2019t keep him in the Little Mermaid on the other. \u201cWhen he came to Yi Ka to seek cooperation, the samples he took could only be regarded as qualified or slightly superior than qualified. Amazing as it was, I could see that he had to practice more before saving up enough experience. That\u2019s why I gave him the opportunity to take publicity photographs. I meant to let him practice and learn more, as well as work with the team. But I never foresee that...\u201dJu Ke got interested and asked, \u201cForesee what?\u201d\u201cConsequently, he managed to overcome the problem of inexperience during the short period of time of taking propaganda photographs.\u201d Lin Xia said, smiling resignedly and shaking her head. \u201cI thought he would encounter sorts of difficulties, or struggle for a long time in shooting, and then grow up step by step...I underestimated his efforts. He is the person who determines to be perfect once he undertakes the job. He is gifted, young and prepared to learn and practice more. Such a promising person will not be limited to be a costume photographer forever.\u201dZhu Ke took another look at He Bai, somewhat could not conceive such a young man working like a horse.\u201cSister Ke, have you seen the elf collection of photos of Miss Jia?\u201d Lin Xia asked unexpectedly.Zhu Ke moved her glance, took back her sight and nodded, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s marvelous. That\u2019s good enough for the Big Four fashion magazines.\u201d\u201cBy the way, sister Ke, do you think how many celebrities here now would like to recruit him?\u201dBeyond all question, a great many! In particular those female celebrities and fashion-engaged ones. It was estimated that 80% of them yearned for such a genius whose skills were better than Facetune as He Bai.\u201cI see what you mean.\u201d Zhu Ke sighed in her mind and looked at Lin Xia with some regret.\u201d I\u2019ll seek out a qualified costume photographer...I\u2019m sorry, I meant to alleviate your workload, but it seems to have caused you some trouble.\u201dLin Xia smiled and answered, \u201cI have never thought it\u2019s a trouble. Thanks to He Bai that the Little Mermaid got such an instant hit. He\u2019s not a trouble but a mascot.\u201dZhu Ke relaxed and smiled when she saw Zhao Xia did not take it to heart, she then nodded and replied, \u201cRight, he\u2019s a mascot.\u201d Once the mascot set foot in the entertainment circle, and became a popular choice among numerous fashion photographers. The Little Mermaid, as the first brand he served, shall definitely shine in reflected glory.Three hours later, the release and opening reception came to an end smoothly. Then the Little Mermaid\u2019s first flagship store opened in a luxury shopping mall. The rich ladies, who had been drooling over the Little Mermaid for a long time, snapped up the limited edition of princess and elf collection at a stormy speed, online and offline.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: He was Screwed (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkTen minutes later, an honorable lady from G district with some political background posted a picture on her Weibo, and she @Yi Ka apparel and the official account of Little Mermaid. She thanked Yi Ka apparel for the sponsorship of her daughter\u2019s engagement dress, which was highly appreciated by her daughter.There was a slim lady with her back to the shot in the picture. She was wearing a white-pink gradient fantasy tulle dress, with her hair coiled, and a pink diamond ring on her finger hanging by the side, holding flowers in her hand.Spectators online soon recognized that the dress she wore belonging to the Princess collection launched today, and was the most expensive one named Cinderella among the whole collection. The masses were truly shocked.Netizen one: This is the first one who wears the princess collection. How quick! Amazing.Netizen two: The ragging dress that Miss Di Chunhua disliked is truly lovely. The bride is gorgeous in her dress. Though targeting at maiden consumers, the apparel of Little Mermaid seems to be suitable for young girls in their early twenties.Netizen three: If the bride can put it on so quickly, the honorable lady must have got the dress from the Little Mermaid in advance through some special channels. Maybe she has signed some kind agreements. I can\u2019t tell what the honorable lady may think at the moment if she knows that her daughter\u2019s engagement dress is said to be rags worn by beggars.Netizen four: The lady must be feeling annoyed. What a happy thing it is for her daughter to get engaged. She even got a special dress that\u2019s off the market for her daughter, who shall be as beautiful as a princess\u2019s, and to be the unparalleled first \u201cprincess\u201d. To her surprise, someone brings contempt upon herself.Netizen five: Haha...no wonder the Little Mermaid did not lend the dress to Di Chunhua, such a bad-mannered playgirl. How could she match the daughter born by the combination of a scholarly family and a political bigwig? Who is the real princess and who is not can be differentiated at a glance. Haha...Qin Li\u2019s face was twisted with anger when she scanned the comments below the Weibo post.She just couldn\u2019t believe that! This was this ultimate goal of this trap! Recently, the Qin family was planning to develop the market in district G, and had invested quite some money to pull strings and make contact with the officials in that district. Now her daughter had offended the local bigwig by saying that \u201cragging dress for beggars\u201d. The Qin family was bound to be targeted against!\u201cDi Bian!\u201d She clenched her fist and shook her hands in anger. \u201cI always value our couple\u2019s mutual affection, I\u2019ve never doubted you. But you, treating my Qin family as a thorn in the eye, set us up. For the sake of disgusting my family, you went so far as to take advantage of our daughter!\u201d Now our daughter was bearing the name of a fake princess who had offended the genuine one. It would be difficult for her to marry a good man in the future.It was the first time that Di Chunhua saw her mother mentioning her father in such a hateful tone, she felt more frightened than ever before. Then she rushed to hug her mother in a panic. \u201cMom, please don\u2019t. Dad would never do that to me. He loved me so much. No, it must be a mistake. I know, it is Di Qiuhe!\u201d Right, Di Qiuhe must have had instigated dad! Mom, don\u2019t quarrel with dad, I\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m afraid\u2026Qin Li came back to herself and saw her daughter was frightened. She subdued her anger and hugged her daughter, comforting while gnashing her teeth, \u201cYes, it\u2019s Di Qiuhe\u2019s fault. Mom and dad are at peace. Don\u2019t worry. You are our little dove. Don\u2019t be afraid\u2026\u201d No way! The kids were far from being matured. Their surname was Di. They should get whatever they deserve. I had to endure everything. Di Bian, if you dare to reap profit at our children\u2019s cost, then you shall not blame me for not caring about our couple\u2019s mutual affection anymore!Day by day, there were new hot topics online. With the cancellation of Di Chunhua\u2019s Weibo account, the bubbling and gurgling gossip of \u201ca playgirl of the slack rich family\u201d had finally came to an end.Though it was over, Di Chunhua earned a bad reputation in the views of people concerned in the long run, while Qin Li\u2019s image of a \u201cgood wife\u201d had also been shadowed by a \u201cvicious stepmother\u201d.The Qin family began to take a low profile approach, while Di Bian was retreiving the rights of Huangdu step by step. Qin Li concentrated less on dealing with Di Qiuhe and more on family issues.\u201cSorry, the subscriber you dialed is off.\u201dHe Bai put down his mobile phone and frowned.It had been nearly a week that he failed to get through Di Qiuhe or receive any text messages\u2026Was the training come to the final sprint?He had no idea, and he shook his head and sent Di Qiuhe another text message, asking where Di was going to celebrate his birthday. Then he went to Yi Ka with his camera.For princess and elf collections were sold in limited editions and had no restocking if sold out. Thus the Little Mermaid had recently launched several other capsule collections to make up for the vacancy. Furthermore, for the autumn was coming, he had to prepare a new round of publicity for new autumn clothes. He kept busy once again.At the end of August, the sales of Little Mermaid kept rising steadily. The photograph for autumn clothes had shot while the effect of these finished photograph was excellent. These photographs were even employed by a fashion magazine abroad, which was a good chance for the Little Mermaid to make a free publicity. Lin Xia was so delighted that she applied for a large bonus for He Bai, and then gave him a vacation in advance, telling him that he could come to the company only on weekends or when he had no classes in the later term on the priority basis that he had finished his due work.He Bai thanked her and accepted it with gratitude, he stopped going to Yi Ka every day after finishing his work.September approached, students returned to school one after another, and the school was getting busy.On September 1st, He Bai and Niu Junjie picked up Wang Hu and Chen Jie, who had returned to school on the same day, in the airport and the railway station. They had a good meal outside, chatted about their vacation experiences, and then came back to school to unpack their stuffs for the coming junior year.On Friday, September 5th, the classes of first week in junior year ended. He Bai parted his roommates and took a bus to the airport.He landed at ten pm, and then he cabbed toward a hotel nearest to Di Qiuhe\u2019s training base. After checking in, he had a good sleep.He got up early On September 6th, rented a kitchen from the hotel manager and set about baking cakes.He made a plain fruit cake after quite a flurry. He looked at the cake with disappointment, put it in a box and started to cook \u201cbirthday noodles\u201d.It was dark when he was ready. He then went out to buy two fireworks, called a car, moved everything to the car, and told driver the address of the training base.He took out his mobile phone as the car started, there were several missed calls from Di Qiuhe. He thought for a while, replied Di a text message.He Bai: I was stayed by my teacher at night, and I didn\u2019t pay attention to the phone. What were you calling for?Di Qiuhe dialed him right away, but he hung up, and then sent Di another text message.He Bai: I can\u2019t answer your call right now. I\u2019m in the library.Di Qiuhe: May you come to celebrate my birthday? Shall I book you a ticket?He Bai looked sideways at the unfamiliar city scene outside the window, smiled and typed back: I have my weekend off, and it is convenient to see you. You should concentrate on your training. I have bought the ticket. Don\u2019t worry.Di Qiuhe: When? I\u2019ll send a car to pick you up.He Bai: Ten a.m. tomorrow. Just in time for lunch there.Di Qiuhe: OK, I\u2019ll wait for you.Di Qiuhe: Don\u2019t get conned by strangers if you come. Don\u2019t accept water and food from others. Keep your wallet and certificate close.Di Qiuhe: Keep me updated about your itinerary. Do you come to stay with me or in a hotel?Di Qiuhe: Stay with me. Hotel is not safe for you.Excuse me? The hotel owner shall be pissed off by these words.He Bai couldn\u2019t help laughing and answered, \u201cYou amah.\u201dDi Qiuhe: What did you say?Di Qiuhe: What do you mean?Di Qiuhe: You pup want to be punished again? You know what you are gonna get for being naughty!He Bai: Then I won\u2019t come. Happy birthday, bye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: He was screwed (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkAs soon as He Bai's message was sent out, the message prompt rung out frantically. He was amused by such a response, then set his mobile phone mute and put it into backpack. He rubbed the red and swollen injure on hand that engendered by oven, took a look at the Bento box on his legs and started humming at ease.The night grew darker. And half an hour later, the desolate place ahead finally came out the silhouette of the training base. He Bai asked the driver to park the car by the river outside the base. After paying the fare, he got off and moved the fireworks to a tree.\"Young man, will your friend come soon? Should I accompany you until that? The driver looked at the ignorant face and expressed his worry for He Bai. Young men should also protect themselves outside today.He Bai soothed with a smile, \"Take it easy, my friend is in that base, and he will come out right away. We have an appointment to set off fireworks here.\"The driver took a look at the distance between the base and here and the fireworks at He's feet, relaxed a little bit, and said a few more words of exhorting He Bai to be careful before drove off.He Bai turned around and sat down against the tree after he saw the driver off, and his eyes started to wander around.From time to time, his mobile phone rang, but he ignored and beat off mosquitoes in leisure. Until midnight, he then took out his phone without haste, clicked on a short message and called the number back.\"Won't you come? Do you really mean to break your words, Pup!\" As soon as the call got through, Di Qiuhe's urgent voice came over.He Bai raised his eyebrows and smiled, found out the fuse of the firework, pulled out a lighter, and asked, \"Childish Di, was the building you live in facing the river outside the training base?\"\"What?\" Di Qiuhe was stunned.\"You told me your room is on the fourth floor. . . Oh, I see, the light is on at this late hour. Do you know that people who rest late are prone to have kidney failure. You ought to be careful.\"Di Qiuhe realized that He Bai was here, and his breath became heavy for nervous, \"You, you are outside the base? You are here! Are you here already? You, you wait for me, I'll pick you up in.\"\"No.\" He Bai pressed on the lighter and got close to the fuse, and then lit it and ran away. He yelled at the phone when the first sparkle went up, \"Childish Di, look out of the window!\"Bang. The firework exploded, illuminating the sky.A familiar tall figure showed up in the only window that lighted up of the fourth floor. He Bai waved his hand over there and cried out to his phone, \"Happy Birthday, Di Qiuhe! Congratulations on being one year older!\" Young as they were, of course, were fond of surprise and excitement. He Bai thought that his surprise for Di was ingenious, and the Childish Di may be moved to tears.Bang.Bang. Bang.The firework kept exploding.Di Qiuhe's heart beat as fast as the booming fireworks.He looked at the dim figure bouncing under the gorgeous sparkles. He was moved, and then raised his hand and held his chest.\"Pup, you've got me catch a summer cold again.\"\"What?\" The sound of the firework was so loud that He Bai couldn't hear clearly.Di Qiuhe kept his eyes on He Bai, not even took a look at the sparkles of the firework. He felt a lump in his throat and a heat in his eyes. The impulsion of catching and embracing tight the smart little \u2018liar' lingered in his heart. He then gritted his teeth and said, \"You're screwed.\"\"What did you say?\" He Bai still had not caught word by word.\"You're screwed!\" Di Qiuhe raised his voice and growled, his eyes tinged with ruthlessness. \"How dare you to deceive me, you\u2026you're screwed!\" As for what would happen, no one had any idea. Someone must be screwed here today.He Bai heard it clearly in quiet as the firework had just finished. He grunted and laughed, \"There are two fireworks, I have lighted one, and one left. Now that you say so, I'll light it myself.\"\"Stop!\" Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows and blurted out.\" If you dare to light it, I'll never let you go back to City B!\"He Bai sneered and hung up the phone. Such a naive man, whose childish words could never be a threat to anybody.Di Qiuhe, with his broad shoulders and long legs and buzz cut hair style, ran here at his fastest speed, panted and stared at He Bai sitting on the ground without saying a word.He Bai paused as he saw Di, and then looked at Di's muscular body in a bit jealous, and shook head. \"Your fans praise you're a gentle and cultivated man who looks like an Adonis, but look at the muscular man in a vest and buzz cut hair standing here now, it's...\"Di Qiuhe stepped forward and looked down at him.\"What do you want?\" He Bai reared his head back and put his hands in front for defense. \"You look like a fighter! I come to celebrate your birthday and take great pains to prepare you a surprise. Really?Di Qiuhe looked at the bites left by mosquitoes on He's arms, turned his head sideways and wiped the tears in his face, then bent down and pulled Di's arm all of a sudden. He pulled Di up and held Di tight in his arms, rubbed his head around Di's neck, gritted and gnashed. \"Don't do this for me next time.\"As the shoulder bumped into Di Qiuhe's pectoral muscles, the pain therefrom stiffened He Bai. He then grimaced in pain and struggled, and said in a sour tone, \"Next time? Are you kidding me? Let me go. Are your muscles made of iron? Well, happy birthday. A 23-year-old man should try to be mature. That's enough to express your joy and gratitude with a gentle hug, while shouldn't employ brute force at will.\"Di Qiuhe strangled He's waist and lifted him off the ground.\"Fxxk!\"He Bai felt his dignity as a man was challenged and then he was irritated. \"You childish Di! Let go of me and calm down!\"Di Qiuhe rubbed He once again, then put He on the unwrapped firework, squatted down to see the cake box and two Bento boxes beside the firework, saying nothing.\"Overjoyed?\" He Bai was confused by Di's behaviors. He rubbed his shoulder and jumped down from the firework, got closer to and patted Di on the shoulder, asked gingerly, \"Are you really moved to tears...Please don't, though I've had such an expectation\u2026Well, we are mature man, you can just laugh when people prepare you a surprise...\" If he had known that Childish Di was so vulnerable to surprise, he would not have prepared all these.Di Qiuhe looked up at him in a serious face and had no sign of tearing at all.He Bai relieved.\"Is that a cake in the box? You made it yourself? Di Qiuhe said something at last, in a steady and normal tone, which was exactly abnormal to some extent.He Bai, feeling nervous, took a step back on the quiet and nodded, \"Yes, I made it.\"\"Where did you do it?\" Di kept asking.\"The hotel.\" He answered.\"When did you come?\" Di asked in a more serious tone.He Bai swallowed a mouthful of saliva, \"Last night, right after class.\"Di Qiuhe nodded to signify he heard it, then he turned around and untied the ribbon on the cake box.\"How can I feel breathless?\" He Bai thought and coughed, went over to crouch in front of Di, took out birthday candles and disposable stuffs from his backpack, and said, \"I'm not good at making cake. It may not be tasty. Please put up with it. Here you are, blow candles first and make a birthday wish.\"It was the most plain candles come in number shapes. One numbered \"2\" and one \"3\", garish and ugly.The ugly candles inserted on the shoddy cake, making it a stronger eyesore. Di Qiuhe, however, viewed it as the best cake he had ever seen.He Bai ignited the candles with a lighter, looked at and waited Di Qiuhe in hope, and then raised camera, \"Come on, blow the candles and make a birthday wish.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Are you shy?\" He Bai moved his head out from behind the lens.Di Qiuhe took the opportunity to bow his head and blow out the candles. He then closed his eyes and made the wish, \"I hope the Pup will call me brother for good.\"He Bai was stunned and moved back to press the shutter. Then he shot an angry glance at Di. \"How can you play tricks! I'll forgive you one time for your birthday.\" Besides, the birthday wish won't work if you say it out loud. It serves you right that you have wasted it.\"Di Qiuhe was still wearing a serious face. After taking a deep look at He, he took a picture of the cake with mobile phone, then removed the candles softly, hesitated for a moment with the knife. He then put down the knife and picked up the Bento box.\"What's in it?\"\"Birthday noodles.\" He Bai thought Di may didn't want to eat dessert at night as Di gave up cutting the cake. He picked up the other Bento box as well and said, \"The boiled noodles can't keep long, so I made two cold noodles in sauce instead. Shall you make do with it? Anyway, it\u2019s the thought that counts.\"The hot and sour flavor of cold noodles greeted them as soon as the boxes were opened, which was extraordinarily appetizing.\"Here you are, chopsticks.\" He Bai took out a pair of disposable chopsticks from his backpack and handed them to Di. He then took one for himself, sat down on the ground and ate, and mumbled, \"It's difficult to make a cake as it cost me one whole day. I had only have some ingredients of the cake at lunch and dinner to sustain me. I'm about to starve to death.\" In his mind, the birthday was over after blowing the candles and making a birthday wish, and that was the reason he complained without scruple at this time.Di Qiuhe watched He eating the noodles, some grieving and pleasing feelings emerged in his heart. The he bypassed the cake, sat down beside He, then took apart his chopsticks and ate noodles, and whispered, \"Thank you.\"\"We're best friends. Never mind.\" He Bai pounded him on the shoulder with a laugh, pretending to be an amiable buddy.Di Qiuhe tensed up for a moment, then he relaxed gradually. Then he moved sideways, keeping out the sudden night breeze from the river for He.After finishing the noodles, they set off the remaining firework together. And then they went back to Di Qiuhe's room with cake in hand and dirt on their buttocks, braving the curious gaze of the base's night watchman.Upon putting the cake on the table, Di Qiuhe asked He Bai to take a bath first, then he bathed promptly. And Di walked to the bedside in nervousness to some extent.The bed was broad enough to accommodate the two of them. Therefore, He Bai lay directly in bed without saying some polite greetings. He was too sleepy at the moment as he got his hand full for a day and just ate his fill. When Di Qiuhe came out at last, he managed to say a good night, and fell asleep at once.He wore the familiar baggy vest pajamas with an untidy collar, revealing half of his chest.Di Qiuhe's gaze swept the white skin, which seemed like glowing in the light. His hands turned off the lamp faster than he ceased the reverie in his mind. Then he took several deep breaths, went around the other side of the bed in cautious, behaved himself by lying down along the bed and closed his eyes.Here came a \"patter\" sound.He Bai, with his bold sleeping posture, turned over and put his arm on Di Qiuhe.Di Qiuhe opened his eyes right away and tensed up, then looked at the man beside.It was dark inside the room, and he could only make out He Bai's head on the pillow and the whole figure.Di Qiuhe felt sultry even if the air conditioner blew cold wind.The summer cold he was suffering seemed to be aggravated. \"No, I can't infect the pup.\"He held his breath, trying to turn sideways, and grabbed He Bai's arm to put it carefully on the bed.The skin touched was softy, and it was comfortable for it's cool against his sweating palm.\u2018...I did hope to hold it at the rest of my life.\u2019He Bai moved unexpectedly, and Di was so frightened as to let go of the hand. Then He Bai's arm fell freely into the bed while bounced once or twice....The quality of the mattress was beyond belief.\"What's going on?\" He Bai was awakened, opened his eyes half awake, raised his hand and fumbled Di Qiuhe's head close by, frowning and mumbling. \"Something is wrong, Childish Di. Why are you talking less today? Be good. Quit tossing and turning and sleep.\"He talked to Di in a ferocious manner, coaxed him like a child while bringing him closer, patted him twice, and fell asleep once again.It was too close for Di that he could even feel He's smooth breath right on his forehead. His shoulders were hugged by He and their legs skin to skin, and he could smell the same fragrance of body wash on He same as his own.He Bai had a good night's sleep, whereas Di Qiuhe was stiff right now, with sweat running down like raindrops.\u2018The air conditioner must have had a malfunction.\u2019He opened his eyes as he couldn't relax a bit, let alone fell asleep.His symptom got worsened which caused him having trouble breathing\u2026the Pup smelt pleasant\u2026he was desperate to get closer\u2026As He Bai moved again against expectation, Di Qiuhe lay back hastily, gasped and tumbled out of bed in awkwardness, picked up the phone on the bedside table, and ran out of the door without turning round.The wind was cool in the balcony at night. Di Qiuhe drank a whole bottle of ice water and held the guardrail for a while. He found Jiang Xiuwen's number and dialed it. Then he frowned and complained after it got through, \"It's no use of drinking ice water at all!\"There came Jiang Xiuwen's grumpy voice. \"What's up at such an ungodly hour? Ice water? Why do you drink ice water?\"\"It was you said that ice water would cure me. I drank plenty, but it's useless!\" And I've got hotter!Jiang Xiuwen was wholly sobered up when he heard this. He then asked, \"How do you catch a cold in the night? Do you go back to City B to visit Pup?\" Jiang Xiuwen thought, it was said that Di was busy, because the training was drawing to a close. Was it a hearsay?\"No, I don't.\" Di Qiuhe quieted down by lowering his tone.\"But the Pup came to me.\" He then flaunted, with joys and shyness. \"He came to celebrate my birthday and made me a cake and birthday noodles. He did it all day for me! He was so tired that I took him back to bed after lighting the firework.To bed, to bed, to bed\u2026Jiang Xiuwen forced himself not to make any assumption, then he took a deep breath and continued his nonsense, \"It may be you had stayed up late that it aggravated your symptom, that's why the ice water won't work, just supply yourself enough sleep. By the way, you should sleep in sofa but not the bed, to avoid infect to He Bai. It was you said that he had a hard day, and he must be weak now. You have to keep a distance with him! What's more\u2026\"Whatever Xiuwen said always made sense. Then Di Qiuhe was soothed, who nodded like chicken pecking rice. Yeah, Xiuwen was right. Now he must have a good rest, a rest without distraction, to entertain the Pup in a spirited condition.After hanging up the phone, for taking good rest to take better care of his younger brother, he went back to sleep on the sofa. It was hard to tell whether it was the psychological effect or the body signaled the need for rest. He fell into a deep slumber as soon as he lay down.In his dream, he seemed to be cuddling something soft, and then they rolled over and over\u2026\"Qiuqiu, good morning, my darling.\"The familiar alarm rang, he opened his eyes sharply and sat up, staring at his crotch in shock, and kept repeating the scenes he had dreamed of last night. How embarrassing!Why did I dream of the naked Pup?\"Qiuqiu, good morning, my darling.\"The alarm sounded again as it wasn\u2019t turned off.A hand reached over, picked up the phone that had fell under the sofa, and turned off the alarm.Di Qiuhe was numb and was about to look at the person standing beside the sofa. However, the more he moved, the stronger he sensed the mucus between his legs. Then he froze even more.\"Di Qiuhe.\" He Bai's voice sounded over his head, without any emotion. His white thin fingers click on Di's phone and asked, \"Would you mind telling me, why the voice message I sent to my Wechat friend \u2018A bird born in autumn' could be heared in your phone, and it is your morning alarm ringtone?\"The dim dream scenes gushed out again. Looking at He Bai's feet and ankles on the dark floor, Di dazed for a few seconds, then he reached out and grasped He's hand holding the phone and gripped it gradually.He was screwed.He was clearly aware of it.He\u2026He was perhaps screwed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Farewell (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai looked down at Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand and then his lowered head. He found himself quite calm somehow, so calm that he could still noticed that Di Qiuhe had two cowlicks.It was said that children with two cowlicks were smart\u2026He came to himself and tried to pull back his hand, but failed. He just suddenly sat cross-legged on the ground and examined Di Qiuhe\u2019s face from bottom to top carefully, \u201cNo explanation?\u201dDi Qiuhe didn\u2019t expect that he would sit down so their sight met accidentally. Di Qiuhe immediately looked away as if He Bai\u2019s eyes had been burning. He squeezed his legs together while still clenching He Bai\u2019s hand tightly. Then his ears gradually turned red.What the hell was his reaction? Play dumb with me? Play dead? Or blow me off with silence?He Bai stretched the other hand to try to throw Di Qiuhe\u2019s clenched hand away, asking indifferently, \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing? A cute girl with a big cock\u2026?\u201dDi Qiuhe resisted He Bai\u2019s hand and kept stiff.\u201cI guessed it right, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Seeing his reaction, He Bai gave up his last illusion that Di Qiuhe might be a friend or something of \u201cA Cute Bird Born in Autumn\u201d. He threw Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand away cruelly and scolded, \u201cBullied by stepmother? Wanna suicide? Wanna run away from home?\u201dDi Qiuhe got more and more embarrassed and curled on sofa in a shy manner. He scratched the trousers at the knees and said in a low frightened voice, \u201cI can explain.\u201d\u201cThen go ahead.\u201d He Bai threw the phone on the ground, giving him a fake smile, \u201cBut if you tell one more lie, I will kick your ass and make you vomit up all the cold noodles you ate yesterday.\u201dDi Qiuhe quick glimpsed He Bai\u2019s bare legs and the phone beside him. His body burst into flames while the heart turned cold. The emotion impact was so strong, so he said by instinct, \u201cI have to go to the bathroom.\u201dHe Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNature is calling.\u201d Di Qiuhe suddenly was like a puppet who gained spirit. He should have talked fluently and dared to make an eye contact with He Bai for a moment. He said quickly, \u201cEven a criminal who is being interrogated will be allowed to go bathroom.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d There was something in his words.He Bai thought with a sneer.Scared by his sneer, Di Qiuhe was frightened again. The spirit he had gained just now fled away. He lowered his body as if all his spirit were drained. He lowered his head, \u201cI am so sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to\u2026\u201d No, with hindsight, he exactly meant to tease him\u2026He suddenly felt guilty.After hearing his unfinished words, He Bai immediately understood his meaning and couldn\u2019t help bursting out. He shouted angrily, \u201cJust go!\u201dDi Qiuhe turned around and gave him a frightened look like a shocked muscular rabbit.He Bai grinded teeth, \u201cIsn\u2019t the nature calling? What, do you need me to get you in the bathroom and take off your pants for you?\u201d Who was the one got cheated? Why did a lair now wear a poor face while He Bai looked like the bad guy? That\u2019s unfair!Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help imaging the scene where He Bai took his pants off. He blushed in a sudden and strode to the bathroom, closing the door shily.Bang\uff01He slammed the door.He Bai banged the sofa, \u201cWhat? You little liar should get angry!\u201dThe door was opened and then shut gently.He Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201d He was even angrier.He Bai took a deep breath and tried to calm down as he heard flushing in the bathroom. He noticed Di Qiuhe\u2019s phone beside him. He didn\u2019t give up and took his phone on the nightstand, sending a WeChat message to the \u201cCute Bird born in Autumn.\u201dDing-dong.Di Qiuhe\u2019s phone rang.He Bai totally lost his mind.\u201cDamn childish Di Qiuhe!\u201d He shouted and began changing clothes.It was all fake\u2026bullied by the stepmother, running away from home, suiciding\u2026All his lies! And study in Japan? No wonder the boss of Red Guest Studio was the friend of film emperor. He really did a great job in acting like a considerate brother caring about his little sister! There should be some cheers for him!He stuffed the clothes into his bag and picked up the phone, reviewing his chats with \u201cCute Bird Born in Autumn\u201d, and he got more furious. He finally couldn\u2019t control his anger and came to the door of bathroom, kicking the door hard, shouting: \u201cDi Qiuhe, I want to see you outside now! Just you and me! I will kick your ass!\u201dAs he heard it, Di Qiuhe who was changing underwear slipped and lost balance.Then there came a great thrashing and crashing,Followed by a groan.He Bai was shocked by this sound and pulled the doorknob, directly rushing in, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened\u2026to\u2026you?\u201dHe found that Di Qiuhe reclined in the bath with legs spread. Some body lotions remained on his body and his hand carried an underwear. His two legs and\u2026some parts were all bare, only a fallen towel covered his body, tastefully half naked.Di Qiuhe instantly sat up and closed the shower curtain.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d He Bai stepped back and didn\u2019t really know where to look, asking, \u201cWell, are you OK? Um\u2026Actually it is not wired at all to take off underwear before pee, it\u2019s really not wired\u2026Although you lied to me and I am angry, you can be assured that I will still keep my principles and will never leak your privacy\u2026Well, just take your time\u2026I\u2019d better go out.\u201dHe said as he was stepping back. But he didn\u2019t notice that behind his feet lay a small bar of soap, so\u2026\u201cOh, my!\u201d He Bai shouted and slid, also losing balance. His hands were groping subconsciously, trying to hold something, it just so happened, his hands landed on the curtain, then\u2026Bang! He pulled the curtain pole off, which exactly fell on the head of Di Qiuhe who was standing up to see what happened.Finally, He Bai bent and held the edges of bath, keeping balance. Di Qiuhe, on the other hand, was totally baffled by this mess, and the towel that had covered his body had gone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: Farewell (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai raised his head.While Di Qiuhe looked down.They looked at each other.\u201cWell\u2026nice body.\u201d He Bai said calmly in a dumbfounded and objective tone.Di Qiuhe was frozen. He noticed that He Bai was gazing at his intimate area and didn\u2019t know what to do. Neither covering this private part nor displaying like nothing happened was appropriate. His ears and neck all turned read, \u201cGlad you like it\u2026\u201dHe Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201d God, what had I said\u2026Di Qiuhe: \u201c\u2026\u201d Oh no, I poured my heart out.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe facial cleanser stood on the edge of the shelf finally fell with a clatter.It seemed that the dead time began to run again. Both finally moved. He Bai turned around and went out while Di Qiuhe covered his body with curtain.\u201cJust get washed\u2026This curtain is really of poor quality, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He Bai stammered.Di Qiuhe turned his head sideways with a red face, \u201cYeah, yeah, it is\u2026I need to change a new one.\u201dThey washed up respectively quietly and came to the canteen courteously to have breakfast. They dared not to have any eye contacts, forgetting the cheating mess for now.\u201cHave a walk outside?\u201d After the breakfast, Di Qiuhe took a car key and invited him cautiously.He Bai, who was pretending drinking water, was baffled. He nodded, \u201cWell\u2026of course. You are the boss today.\u201dSo, they got into the car awkwardly. They drove to see some famous spots around the training base and took many photos. He Bai also posted a happy-birthday message on Weibo before Di Qiuhe, attached was Di Qiuhe\u2019s photo with his new style-brush cut.Near the sunset, Di Qiuhe took He Bai to the airport.\u201cCall me when you arrive.\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cThank you, for celebrating my birthday with me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d\u201cI had a very nice day.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cThe bath\u2026\u201d\u201cNever mind! It\u2019s just a little accident.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI am going to the security check. See\u2026see you.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Di Qiuhe stopped him and stretched his arms, giving him a nervous and expectant smile, \u201cCan you hug me?\u201d He Bai looked at him. This was the first eye contact after the morning mess. He paused and stepped forward to hug him. He Bai patted his shoulder, \u201cHappy birthday. And wish you a successful filming.\u201dDi Qiuhe tightened his arms with satisfaction and buried his face into He Bai\u2019s neck, rubbing against him. His eyes were full of tenderness and of course, sadness. He said in a low voice: \u201cFilming will start soon, so I will be quite busy then. I may not have much time to visit you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s OK. This film is important for you.\u201d He Bai patted him again, like a mild senior comforting and encouraging a young man, \u201cTrue friendship will last, no matter we meet or not. You can make it.\u201d\u201cNot just friends.\u201d He rebutted.He Bai turned into a serious face, \u201cI will never call you big brother.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDi Qiuhe laughed slightly and rubbed his lips against He Bai\u2019s hair. He closed his eyes and allowed his body to completely fall on He Bai, sighing, \u201cI know\u2026This film will be shot on many locations, and this is just the first one. Then there will be country K, J, district D\u2026and at last, city B. If everything goes on fine, it may take me at least 3 months to go back to B. My little puppy, don\u2019t miss me too much.\u201dHe Bai rolled his eyes and pushed him away, laughing, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s just 3 months. I will not miss you at all.\u201d\u201cYou are such a heartless person.\u201d Di Qiuhe also let him go. He stood straight and jabbed at He Bai\u2019s dimple, also laughing, \u201cI will mail you special local products whenever I get to a new place. I may inform you or not, so remember to sign for them.\u201d\u201cNot fruit again.\u201d He Bai teased like a good brother. But the embarrassment was finally gone. He told Di Qiuhe, \u201cDon\u2019t skip meals, and looking forward to your new film.\u201dDi Qiuhe nodded. He was so desperate to hold his hand and kiss him, but he didn\u2019t. He said, \u201cI heard that your Little Mermaid collection photos have been published on international magazines, congratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThey looked each other but didn\u2019t know what to say. The atmosphere was subtle.He Bai pulled his bag and said, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna go.\u201dDi Qiuhe was nodded reluctantly, with hands in his pockets, clenching. However, he still wore a mild and cool smile, \u201cJust go, don\u2019t miss your plane.\u201dThe plane took off. He Bai browsed the magazine on the plane and scratched his head. It seemed that he forgot something very important. That\u2019s wired.A couple of hours later, the plane landed. He Bai turned on his phone and saw dozens of messages of Di Qiuhe.He raised the eyebrows, smiling delightfully.Di Qiuhe: Thank you for celebrating my birthday with me. I am very happy.How many times he had thanked me\u2026? He Bai thought.Di Qiuhe: I\u2019m sorry to cheat you with my WeChat alt.He Bai\u2019s smile suddenly frozen.Di Qiuhe: Thank you for forgiving me so quickly. You are truly my cutest little puppy^-^He stared at the \u201c^-^\u201d on the end of the sentence for a while and then moved to the next message.Di Qiuhe: I will not lie to you again.Di Qiuhe: I promise to make you happy in the future, not make you angry.Diu Qiuhe: Mua~That familiar \u201cMua\u201d again.He narrowed his eyes and looked up at the dark sky with no stars. He had decided to forget it at first, but finally, he chose to strike back and began to type.Di Qiuhe was now full of bashfulness, pleasance, waiting his beloved to reply his messages. And then his phone vibrated. He quickly opened the message interface.He Bai: No thanks.He Bai: And thanks for your reminding, I haven\u2019t forgiven you yet.He Bai: Is it funny to wield my sympathy and trick me to send you a shameful voice message?He Bai: And set that voice message as your alarm?He Bai: Do you think this ^-^ is cute?He Bai: I begin to regret that I didn\u2019t kick your ass now.He Bai: Farewell, film emperor^-^.Di Qiuhe, who just had his first serious crush, was heartbroken.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Drinking Three Cups of Wine as Punishment (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkOnce again, Di Qiuhe was blacklisted by He Bai, together with his exposed alt WeChat account.\"So, you\u2019re saying...\", cautiously asked Jiang Xiuwen after spending some time pondering over this new information, \"since you realized you are in love with him, you have never got a chance to say something or do something about it? So\u2026 why did you say you\u2019ve broken up with him? \"Bang!After giving the sandbag a hard punch, Di Qiuhe straightened up and took off the boxing gloves. Then he picked up the phone right beside him, turned off the speaker and put it to his ear, murmuring, \"Well. I thought it was just I was suffering a summer cold\u2026 \"Jiang Xiuwen: \"...Maybe I can explain it.\"\"Ok, you give it a try.\" Sitting on the ground, Di Qiuhe took a towel from the bag and wiped away the sweat. Then he warned him with a rather gentle tone, \"If you dare fool me again, I will make you spit out the fruit that I sent you in the same way you ate them.\u201d\"...\" It seemed that the breakup took a heavy toll on his friend. Normally, he would just sneer at him, but now he began to threaten him.\"Why don't you explain? You don\u2019t want to help me?\" asked Di Qiuhe.Upon hearing that, Jiang Xiuwen who was looking for an excuse to hang up the phone froze for a second, then replied with a strained laughter, \u201cNonsense! We are old pals. About that..... I was just so shocked. Let me put it this way. You have never shown any sign of homosexuality, and then, all of sudden, you are gay. I\u2019m just dumbfounded. Besides, you don\u2019t have many friends and you never fall in love with anyone, so I\u2019m afraid you are just temporarily lost. What if it\u2019s an illusion?\u201d\"I want to kiss him, hug him, sleep with him and I dream about him all the time. Are these all illusions?\"For a moment, words escaped Jiang Xiuwen, and then he burst into coughing.Di Qiuhe listened to his coughing with an abstruse expression on his face.A minute later, Jiang Xiuwen stopped, then he asked sincerely, \"Qiuhe... Are you serious?\"Serious?With eyes slightly closed, Di Qiuhe was reminded of the little puppy eating cold noodles while sitting on the ground, and also the slight swelling on his hand and the tasty fruit cake. In the end, he thought about the first time they met. At that time, the little puppy was crouching by the roadside like an idiot.\"I wanted to be nice to him. I wanted him to live the life he wants. Moreover, I wanted to be a part of his life.\" He said in a casual tone which was not to be mistaken for insincerity. \"Those have been my desires long before I figure out what it is that I feel about him. That\u2019s why I wanted him to be my little brother, because in this way I would have a legitimate reason to be nice to him.\"Jiang Xiuwen kept silent while listening to him.\"Now I still want to be nice to him. I want him to live the life he wants.\" With a pause, he added in a matter-of-factly manner, \"I still want to be a part of his life, but I want more. I want him to be by my side, and I want to be with no one but him.\"Jiang Xiuwen held the phone with mixed emotions, then he whispered with a sigh, \u201cQiuhe...\u201d He knew well about his friend. If he was determined to do something, he would see it through. Though technically he didn\u2019t promise to love him forever, the message couldn\u2019t be clearer.One wanted to be nice to the other and occupy the other\u2019s life. \u2018This is clearly not a simple crush.\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand how he could fall so deep in love as they had only known each other for less than three months and he only just figured out what he wanted in life yesterday.\"So, Xiuwen, take care of him for me while I\u2019m out of B City. Don\u2019t let anyone make trouble for him.\" There was a commotion over at the entrance of the training hall and then they heard Jiang Guanshan\u2019s voice wafting through the air. Di Qiuhe swept a look at that direction and added quickly, \u201cKeep an eye on Qin Li. She knew our relationship. I\u2019m afraid she would make trouble for him. His career is on the rise. I don\u2019t want him to get into any troubles because of me.\u201dWith a frown, Jiang Xiuwen said, \u201cThe Qin Family has some troubles entering Area G, so they have been quiet recently. Qin Li is conducting psychological warfare against Di Bian. If she has no time for you, then I doubt she would pay much attention to He Bai.\u201d\u201cJust in case. It\u2019s best to be on the safe side.\u201d Noticing Jiang Guanshan had entered the hall, Di Qiuhe put down the towel and got up to welcome him. Before he hung up the phone, he said, \"Just take care of him for me. Uncle Jiang has got here. I gotta go.\"\"Wait! Have you thought this through? As an actor, if you and He Bai were to be together, what would your father think about that? And what about the public...\"\"I will deal with it. If he is willing to be with me, I wouldn\u2019t hide him behind my back. Gotta go, bye.\" Di Qiuhe hung up and put the phone into his pocket. At that time, Jiang Guanshan had already approached him and they had a hug.Jiang Xiuwen put down the phone after he heard beeping from the other side. He fell back into sofa and rubbed his forehead with mixed feelings.Di Qiuhe sounded very serious and without the least hesitation. It was obvious that he had already thought this through and was prepared to face all the potential challenges in the future. But, \u2026. looking at the cellphone and camera on the table sent from Q university this morning, Jiang Xiuwen miserably covered his face with hands.He didn't dare to mention this to Di Qiuhe.His friend was prepared to face the potential consequences, and yet He Bai was trying to draw a line between them. What a complicated relationship. This was truly a shitty situation.How about sending it back?Sitting up straight, he put the camera and phone back into the box and put the lid on carefully.\u2018Send a message to inform him of this after sending it back. Best let him dream about it for a while.\u2019 In fact, he was partially responsible for this mess. He would apologize to He Bai in person later in hope that it made things easier for his friend to pursue his girlfriend, hmm, boyfriend\u2026\u2026After a whole day of classes, the four roommates got together for dinner. Later, Wang Hu went to play basketball and Chen Jie went to library. Seeing that they were alone, Niu Junjie quitted the game, grabbed a chair and sat next to He Bai. He asked cautiously, \u201cBai, you and Qiuhe\u2026\u201d\"I blacklisted him.\" He Bai replied matter-of-factly. He looked at him with an emotionless face and said, \"You have only met twice. We\u2019re going to live together for two years. Recently, there are a lot of news about people poisoning their roommates. \"Niu Junjie was dumbfounded. Immediately he forgot about the future spokesman for his family. He held the shoulders of He Bai and solemnly proclaimed, \"A liar should be punished! Good for you. Don't be sad. Let\u2019s have some midnight snack. My treat.\"\"Thank you.\" With a smile, He pointed at his computer screen. \"I have a lot of work to deal with. You should go with LaoDa and LaoEr and bring me something if you\u2019d like.\"\"Okay, okay, no problem!\" Niu Junjie answered without hesitation. Then he returned to his seat, took out of his phone and typed quickly.Niu Junjie: Qiuhe, Bai is in rage. It\u2019s very bad! What have you done? Did you really just use an alt WeChat account to mess with him? Bai doesn\u2019t look like a man who will get so easily offended.Di Qiuhe had been waiting expectantly for a reply, but his heart sank when he finally got it. Thinking about the message that Jiang Xiuwen sent earlier, he slouched, feeling even worse than a while ago. Depressed, he started typing the following message:It\u2019s my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have kept deceiving him with that back-up account after I bought back the autography. How has he been recently? Is he busy at work? Has he been eating properly?Niu Junjie: Everything is fine. His career is on the rise and he got more bonuses than he can count. He asked another half bowl of rice for dinner and said Elder Xu finally promised to teach him new things. Everything looks good. But he still gets mad whenever he thinks about you.Di Qiuhe\u2019s heart sank at the word \u201cmad\u201d.Niu Junjie: Dude, tell me the truth. How did you offend him? I can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t tell me the truth.With a sigh, Di Qiuhe replied.Di Qiuhe: I told him I am a girl.Niu Junjie: That ... is not that bad. Buying back your own autography can be quite embarrassing. It\u2019s quite understandable that you want to hide who you really are. Bai won\u2019t get offended over this. Besides, he is the one who sold out your autography. Both of you have made mistakes. I don\u2019t see why he will get mad at you over this.Di Qiuhe: I also tricked him into sending me gifts and voice messages.Niu Junjie: Gifts? Those photos? That's fine. You also gave him a gift in return. Sounds fair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Drinking Three Cups of Wine as Punishment (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe slowed down his typing thinking about something. If you noticed his pause, you would know he was deeply upset about what he had done before.Di Qiuhe: The point is that I didn\u2019t tell him the truth when I got the chance. And there is also the voice message.Niu Junjie: What about it?After taking a deep breath, Di Qiuhe said: I lied to him about how I was bullied by my family and how I wanted to commit suicide in desperation, just so that I could get him to send me messages like \"Qiuqiu, Good Morning. Good Night. kiss you.\"Niu Junjie froze for a while and typed: ... Dude, what\u2019s wrong with you?A normal person wouldn\u2019t coax his friend into sending such intimate voices. What a bad past of him. This Di Qiuhe looked reliable. Who would have thought that he would be this crazy.Di Qiuhe wiped his face and started beating himself up: I also set those voices as my alarm and he heard it when he came over for my birthday.Struck dumb, Niu Junjie turned his head to sweep a look at He Bai, and then quickly turned back. He tapped so hard on the screen that it felt like it\u2019s gonna break any minute: How dare you set those disgusting voices as your alarm?! Moreover, Bai was not supposed to hear them! He was nice enough to show up at your birthday party and that is how you repay him? What the fuck, man! You deserved it! Dude, you\u2019d better keep a distance from him, otherwise you would be dead.Di Qiuhe with a pale face: Is there a way to fix this?Niu Junjie: No way. What with your lies and those shameless voices, the best you can do now is to run away.Di Qiuhe: But I don't want to run away. I hope Bai would forgive me. Do you think it\u2019s possible?Upon hearing that, Niu Junjie fell into deep thought. He sneaked a look at He Bai who was busy working on his photos and continued typing: Of course. For starters, you can drink three cups of wine as punishment. Then you will offer a humble apology and shouted \"Boss, it\u2019s my fault.\" three times to him. Last, you are to serve him for three months. Only then will it pass. Don't worry. Bai is very kind. If you apologize sincerely, he would feel it and forgive you sooner or later.After a while of pondering, Di Qiuhe typed determinedly: Ok.Niu Junjie nodded in satisfaction: Good luck.Feeling confident, Di Qiuhe replied: Thank you.After plotting like two sneaky thieves, both of them felt quite good about themselves. Niu was glad that he had done Di a favor, while Di was delighted that he found a way to get his lover back.At the beginning of the new semester, students were required to re-select their optional courses. He Bai logged in the campus network and a bunch of private messages from A Bird Born in Autumn popped out. With a sneer, he clicked \u201cDelete\u201d without hesitation.Sitting next to He Bai, Niu Junjie clenched his hands tightly and took out his mobile phone: Bai didn't read them. He simply deleted them all!With a twitch of eyebrows, Di Qiuhe put on a serious look: I\u2019ll keep sending.So, during the entire process of course selection, He Bai was bombarded with countless private messages over and over again.Noticing that, Niu Junjie couldn't help but pretend to be curious and asked, \"How come you have so many private messages? Why don\u2019t you read them? Maybe some of them are notices from the school. \"\"Have you received a notice from the school?\" He Bai turned to look at him.Niu Junjie shook his head, \"No.\"He Bai deleted all the newly private messages as well and said with a smile. \"We are in the same class. If you didn\u2019t receive any notice, neither will I. So, it\u2019s unnecessary to check those spam messages. Besides, it\u2019s fine if I miss any notice, because the monitor would inform us again in the class group chat.Niu Junjie: \"...\"\"Anything else?\"\u201cNo\u2026 nothing.\u201d Niu Junjie sat up straight and texted a message quickly when he got the book: Dude, Bai is too smart. There is nothing I can do. I\u2019m sorry.Di Qiuhe fell back into the lounge, put down his phone, and then with a long sigh he picked up the script.The deputy director came close to Jiang Guanshan. He swept a glance at Di Qiuhe who was concentrated on studying the script at the corner and praised, \"Jiang, you are a good judge of character. Di Qiuhe is very mature for his age and he is hardworking. He has got a lot of potentials.\u201dJiang Guanshan nodded with a smile, \u201cHmm, he has grown a lot lately.\u201d It seemed that the early training had paid off.Di Qiuhe, on the other hand, was staring blankly at the script. He kept folding up and down the corner of the page, all the while thinking: Bai would forgive me, Bai wouldn\u2019t\u2019 forgive me. Bai would forgive me \u2026..He Bai simply ignored the incoming Weibo messages. After posting a Weibo to advertise the Little Mermaid autumn new arrivals, he turned off the computer. Then he took out piles of posters of TV series, films, MVs from his backpack and started poring over them.Since this semester, Teacher Xu had talked to him once. Xu thought He Bai had got the hang of taking portraits and all he needed was to accumulate experience going forward. Now he could learn new skill on how to take group portrait \u2026. like the ones on those piles of posters.As far photography was concerned, it was easy shooting a personal portrait, but difficult shooting a group of people. Elder Xu assigned him a new task to take one group portrait every week. The workload sounded less than before. However, it was actually more difficult.It was simple to capture a person\u2019s unique features in a photo. As long as you keep shooting, you would eventually come out with a good one. While a group portrait might sound simple, when you put several people into one image, it was anything but easy. When you were cramming several people into a photo, there were several factors that had to work together to make it a great image.Each person has their special traits, and if you want to capture the traits of more than two people into one image, you must first have a good command of the basic photographic skills and also the ability to balance the configuration of the photos.As a group portrait was to cram several people into one photo, if you were not paying attention, your photo would lose its focus. He Bai had solid photographic skills, but he was quite new with the portrait photography, and he needed to gain more experience in taking a balanced picture.What should he do if he lacked experience? Practice more, read more, study more in order to accumulate more.After knowing his weaknesses, he immediately went to the library with a pen and paper.There were thousands of excellent group portraits throughout history, and you could easily find piles of outstanding works in the library. He spent a whole day studying the works, and as he did that, he was getting more and more confused. When he came out from the library with the intent to shoot the schoolyard, he was frustrated to find that he had no inspiration at all after seeing such a pile of group portraits. If anything, this experience had disrupted his otherwise organized way of thinking.The students walked up and down, and the click sound of the shutter rang again and again, but none of the photos turned out OK. After half an hour of fruitless shooting, he put down the camera with a sigh and left the school.Taking photos for a single person was indeed different from taking group portrait, and it was impossible to start with the basics like taking snapshots. Let alone establishing a theme, he even had no idea how to balance a picture.If you want to cram two people into a photo, then you must consider how they should be appropriately posed.How to balance a photo with three people in it?When taking photos for a crowd of people running back and forth, where should he focus on to make it look harmonious, while at the same time brought out each character\u2019s distinct features?There were too many questions, and he could only solve them one by one. Firstly, he needed to picture how he wanted to pose the group and frame the photo. Well, in this field, the most successful and commercialized example were those various posters of major movies and TV series.There was more than one protagonist in a movie or a TV series, so their posters were typical group portraits. Except for a small number of matting posters, the rest all featured carefully arranged configuration and well thought out poses. They were definitely worth learning.Niu Junjie was lying in bed quietly observing how He Bai was absorbed in writing and painting under the light of table lamp, and then he took out his phone.Niu Junjie: Bai did not check the Twitter message.Di Qiuhe: He hasn't slept yet?Niu Junjie: Yeah. He was working on new photography assignment given by his teacher. By the way, don\u2019t let your friend send camera back over and over. It\u2019s a waste of money. Bai has bought a new camera already.For a while, Niu Junjie didn\u2019t get any reply. Feeling frustrated, he typed: You just focus on your filming. Let me know when you come back. Let\u2019s have a meal together with Bai. You could apologize to him in face. Then he would forgive you. Get some sleep.After a few minutes, Di Qiuhe sent a message back: I see, thank you.Niu Junjie: We are brothers. You are welcome.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Drinking Three Cups of Wine as Punishment (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkGetting no reply from Di Qiuhe, Niu Junjie sneaked a look at He Bai who was concentrating on study and scratched his hair out of frustration.One wanted to apologize. The other was still in rage and not in a mood for reconciliation. How to fix that?After escorting the doctor to the door, Di Qiuhe took a sip of water delivered by his assistant, and then asked, \"How are things over there at the set?\"\"Director Jiang lost his temper, scolding the crew in charge of properties and fired them\". Assistant An stood in front of him nervously and replied in a flattering way.Di Qiuhe nodded as a reply. Then he put down the water bottle and said, \"Let\u2019s go. Back to the set.\"Assistant An froze for a second and swept a look at his wrapped, wounded arm. \"But, your injury... Director Jiang said the following scenes are all action-intensive ones. Your arm was wounded. We could put off the shooting, so you can have a rest for two days.\"\"No.\" Di Qiuhe waved his hand and said casually with a move of his arm. \"It\u2019s not a big deal. I am the lead actor. If I call one day off, I will slow down the shooting progress. I can\u2019t do that.\"Assistant An persisted, \u201cWhy not? The director said so himself that you could take a break...\u201d\"I don't want to rest.\" Di Qiuhe cast a sideways glance at her and said with a determined tone. \"Assistant An, I know that you care about me. Thank you for that, but I don't want to repeat myself.\"Assistant An took a step back the moment she met with Di\u2019s emotionless eyes. Then she bowed her head and said, \"Sorry, sorry.\"Di Qiuhe looked away and strode out.It just so happened that Wang Boyi came back with a list and he was struck dumb when he saw Di Qiuhe coming out with a poker face. Then he swept a look at assistant An who was right behind Di. With a twitch of eyebrows, he quickly looked away. When Di Qiuhe approached him, he quickly turned around and tried to catch up with him. He said while walking, \"Mr. Di, I have all the things you want. Do you need to send them right away?\"Upon hearing that, Di Qiuhe\u2019s face softened a bit, but he shook his head and said, \"No. Bring me a recorder pen and a notepad later. I have other things to send.\"Wang Boyi nodded, then he looked back at the assistant An who was right on their heels and sighed inwardly.The next day, He Bai ran into the courier when he went out for lunch and signed for a big box and other two small boxes.\"I guess the big box is stuffed with fruits.\" Holmes Niu said while rubbing his chin, then shouted at Wang Hu and Chen Jie, \u201cBrothers, move this box to the dorm! We have enough deserts for this week. Let\u2019s thank Bai for sharing this with us!\u201dWang Hu and Chen Jie looked at each other and shouted at the same time, \" Bai, Thank you for this!\" After saying that, they suddenly burst into laughter over something and move the box to the dorm as quickly as they could like they had never eaten fruits before.He Bai: \"...\"A classmate saw this while passing by and murmured in jealousy, \"Look at this. Someone\u2019s definitely got a sugar daddy. If not, how could you explain these. Why did he always disappear at weekends. How could he afford fancy outfits and new cameras all of a sudden. And now, he even receives gifts every day\u2026\u2026Pooh, disgusting toy boy.\u201dHe Bai fixed his eyes on him looking emotionless and said, \"Why not say it out loud? Huang Wei, do you really think your post will stay anonymous forever? You spread rumors about me. Aren\u2019t you afraid the counselor would come to you?\u201d\"What, what anonymous posting? What are you talking about? I didn\u2019t spread any rumor!\" feeling guilty, Huang Wei stuttered out his rebuttal and then dragged his bag belt and ran away.Seeing him running away, He Bai was reminded of the fact that he got kicked out of school in his previous life for theft. Then with a frown, he went to sit down on the bench in front of the dormitory. While waiting for his roommates, he opened the rest of the two small boxes in his hands.The wooden boxes were of ethnic style. They looked unadorned, but very sturdy. There were a recorder pen and a note in one box, and a tumbler with a note under it in the other one.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 Confused, He Bai picked up the notes in the boxes and unfolded them.Di Qiuhe: Bai, I am sorry. There is a recording in the pen. Please listen to it when you are alone.Di Qiuhe: Bai, I am sorry, I have drunk three cups of wine as punishment. I have had it on tape and stored the video in the memory card under the cup. To show my sincerity, I sent the cup to you, so you could tell me whether you are satisfied with its size. If not, I will use a larger cup next time.\"...\" Is he an imbecile? Three cups of wine as punishment? Video? And cup? How much did the courier fee cost him?He Bai stared at the two boxes for a while with mixed feelings. Finally, he stuffed the boxes into his backpack forcefully, and then walked towards the dormitory. He wondered why they had not come out yet.Niu Junjie retracted his head and gave a high five with Wang Hu and others. He happily took out his phone to send a message to Di Qiuhe: Bai has received the two small boxes. Good for you. Keep it up!Di Qiuhe: Thanks. I will.After putting away his phone, Niu Junjie wrapped his arms around the necks of Wang Hu and Chen Jie and exclaimed, \u201cLet\u2019s go! Your big brother is in a good mood today. Let me treat you with seafood!\u201dWang Hu and Chen Jie got away from him and laughed. \"Big brother? How dare you call yourself \u2018big brother\u2019 in front of us? You\u2019ve been very cocky recently, LaoSan. You should be punished.\"Niu Junjie struggled to break free and ran outside. He then waved to He Bai who was looking at this direction. \"Bai, run away! LaoDa and LaoEr have gone crazy!\"\"You are the crazy one,\" replied He Bai as he approached him.After dinner, Niu Junjie took Wang Hu and Chen Jie to the badminton hall, leaving He Bai alone in the dormitory to work on his assignments he took back.He was busy with the works until 9:30. He Bai swept a look at the time. It was late, but none of them came back. With a frown, he made a call to them.\"We are having nigh snacks. We\u2019ll be back in a jiffy,\" yelled Niu Junjie with all the noises going around in the background. \"Would you like something to eat? I can bring it back for you. When you are done, you can go watch some videos for a rest. Don't go too hard on yourself!\"\"Ok, bring me a bowl of porridge.\" He Bai was touched by his considerate roommate, and then he shouted, \"No drinking, please. It\u2019s bad for your stomach. Come back early. Don't be too late.\"Niu Junjie nodded in agreement.With a smile, He Bai hung up the phone. After taking a shower, he sat down in front of the table to get all the materials organized. He was preparing to turn off the computer when he noticed the two boxes at the corner of the table. Then he paused and picked them up.He hesitated for a while, not knowing what he should take first between the recorder pen and the memory card. Finally, he chose to watch the drinking video in the memory card first.He clicked on Play and could see nothing first. Then Di Qiuhe appeared in a strange room, wearing a camouflage uniform and with a bottle of wine and a cup on his hands. He sat up straight in front of a small table in the middle of the picture like a national leader who was going to announce some important decisions. With a serious face, he bent down and apologized sincerely, \"Bai, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault.\"He Bai: \"...\"\"I shouldn't lie to you. I\u2019m sorry that I didn't apologize to you in person last time. Now, I would drink three cups of wine as punishment,\" said Di Qiuhe seriously. Then he opened a new bottle of wine, filled it up and drank up.He Bai couldn't help but look away and frowned.He couldn\u2019t bear himself to watch this act of sanity.After a cup of wine, Di Qiuhe\u2019s face immediately turned red. His watery eyes looked quite attractive.After finishing that, he turned the cup upside down and looked at the camera with a solemn face. He said, \"This one is for our relationship!\"He Bai: \"...\" He was rendered speechless.\"This one is for betraying your trust.\" After drinking up another cup full of wine, his neck turned red.He Bai took a deep breath and held up his phone. It was all he could do not to make a call to Di Qiuhe immediately to ridicule him.\"This is the third cup.\" It looked like the alcohol was beginning to take effect as Di Qiuhe\u2019s voice was getting slightly muffled. However, he tried to remain steady. With a serious look, he kept his hands still and proposed a toast. \u201cCheers for our encounter!\u201dOnce again, he drank it up. After that, he dropped down the cup and looked at the camera with a solemn face. \"Bai, I\u2019m sorry!\" said he. Then he took out an A4 paper from under the table and wrote something on it. After that, he showed the paper to him.He Bai saw three scratchy characters on the paper: I am sorry!He Bai was dumbfounded when he saw that. He couldn\u2019t help but pick up his phone, pulled Di Qiuhe\u2019s number out of the blacklist and called him.\"Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.\"\"...\" fuck!Putting down the phone, he wiped away the tear on his face and swept a glance at the video which had finished playing. Then in a rage, he blacklisted Di Qiuhe\u2019s number again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Xiao Bai (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkHaving been shocked by the video, He Bai didn\u2019t want to check the recorder at all. His intuition told him that the content in that recorder would be his nightmare.Filming set, deep jungle, frontier province.\u201cCut! This shot passes!\u201dJiang Guanshan waved his hand. First it was silence, then came the loud, thrilling cheers. The staff all surrounded Di Qiuhe, who had already worn out. They gave him a towel, checked whether he had been injured and praised him for his excellent performance in that chasing shot.The supporting actor, Yang Wentian, drank the water given by the assistant, watching Di Qiuhe with a smile, who had picked himself up. Yang thumbed up and praised, \u201cYou\u2019re amazing. The shot where you avoid the broken glass is impeccable.\u201dDi Qiuhe restored his normal breath and responded with a fist bump, smiling, \u201cYou have refused to use substitute and completed your fighting shot between the roofs of two running trucks. If such a brilliant actor says I\u2019m awesome, then I\u2019m really super awesome.\u201dAs an action movie actor, audience were familiar with Yang Wentian, but he didn\u2019t play in a hitting movie. Therefore, his popularity was just so-so and the resources given to him were also barely satisfactory. He was often marginalized and mocked directly and indirectly by some popular actors. He had thought that Di Qiuhe, as a popular star and a young mater of Huangdu, must be arrogant. But he found that Di Qiuhe was actually mild and easy to get along with just as the hearsay-Di Qiuhe didn\u2019t put on airs or emphasized his relation with Huangdu, showing great respect to this senior.The indirect praise by Di Qiuhe satisfied him a lot. He wore a more sincere smile and said in a milder manner, \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of cake. My shot on the car roofs just seemed dangerous, but the whole team was ready to get my back, so nothing risky. But yours is different. The trajectory of the broken glass was uncontrollable, but you really took the risk and rejected substitute, very professional attitude. Amazing!\u201dDi Qiuhe squinted a smile and lowered his head, rubbing the nose. It seemed that the compliment from the senior made him shy.\u201cAfter all this work you should still have energy to compliment each other? You don\u2019t look tired, how about another shot?\u201d Jiang Guanshan shouted behind the camera, and the staff broke up with smiles.Di Qiuhe and Yang Wentian looked each other and also burst out laughing. They became closer virtually. Then they came to Jiang Guanshan together.After the director\u2019s summary, Di Qiuhe backed to the makeshift resting area. He entered his room and asked the Wang Boyi who was coming towards him, \u201cHave anyone wanted me?\u201dWang Boyi didn\u2019t attend the night shot, so he just got up. Hearing Di Qiuhe\u2019s question, he checked the working phone that Di Qiuhe gave him, shaking his head, \u201cNope. The team said Qin Li has been quite well-behaved recently, nothing happened.\u201dDi Qiuhe nodded and let him leave. Having washed up, he reclined on the bed and took out his private phone from the drawer. It was dead. Frowned, he found the charger and connected the phone.It took a little more time for an old phone to turn on. After all-night work, he had been extremely tired. When the phone finally turned on, he had closed his eyes unconsciously and almost felt asleep.Ding Dong.The ringtone of messages rang one after another.He opened his eyes abruptly and became wild awake quickly, raising the phone in front of his eyes.There were three messages. One from Jiang Xiuwen, one from Niu Junjie, and the last one was a missed call.He rubbed his dilated eyes and checked them one by one.Jiang Xiuwen: Don't be discouraged. I will apologize to He Bai and intercede for you in a couple of days. You can only chase him step by step. Focus on your film first.Niu Junjie: Xiao Bai had checked the things you mailed, but he was quite indifferent. I couldn\u2019t see through him. Try harder!His shining eyes dimmed, and he checked that missed call reminder. Actually, he didn\u2019t attach much attention to it, thinking that it must have been from Jiang Xiuwen who didn\u2019t like sending messages. It was not necessary to scan carefully.But He Bai\u2019s bark was always worse than his bite. Being indifferent and showing no thoughts might be his best response\u2026 \u201cOr maybe I should go back to city B another time and talk to him seriously\u2026and buy him some food and things he likes\u2026\u201d, he thought.Then, he gradually lost his consciousness again. Just as his eyes almost closed, his blurred sight swept over the dimmed screen, and he saw \u201cHe Bai\u201d vaguely. He was surprised and again became clear-headed.He touched the screen and saw two words, \u201cHe Bai\u201d, stood in the top of the screen, middle of the brief message. On the end of this message was the time of this call\u202610 p.m. yesterday!Di Qiuhe sat up with rounded eyes. He repeatedly checked the content of this message with disbelief.\u201cIt was him! He Bai called me at 10 p.m. yesterday.\u201d It seemed that Di Qiuhe just finished a shot and took a short break at that time\u2026but he didn\u2019t bring his phone!He\u2026didn\u2019t\u2026bring\u2026his\u2026phone!So he missed He Bai\u2019s call.He hit the bed and looked at the time. He Bai must have gotten up now. Di Qiuhe rubbed his face to cheer up and called back cautiously.\u201cSorry, the number you dialed is no longer in service.\u201dHe was baffled and called again hurriedly.\u201cSorry, the number you dialed is no longer in service.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSo\u2026he had been blocked again? Because he didn\u2019t answer the call?He pressed his head unconsciously.He Bai was willing to call him probably because his heart had been softened and ready to forgive him. But Di Qiuhe\u2019s phone was dead\u2026he missed the call\u2026And then got blocked again\u2026His brain got blank for a while and then the relationship tips sent by Jiang Xiuwen flashed in his mind. In \u201cOne hundred behaviors lovers hate\u201d, there was \u201cNot answering the call!\u201dHe lowered his shoulders and suddenly something occurred to him. He immediately got out of the bed and turned on the computer, connected campus network and searched for the account of He Bai. He sent a bunch of explanation messages. Then he logged on his Weibo alter that he had registered recently, clicked his only \u201cspecial attention\u201d, and then another bunch of messages were sent again.These were not enough for him. Di Qiuhe took out the camera and began to record apologizing videos again.Yep. He Bai called him after watching his \u201capologize by drinking three shots\u201d video. So if Di Qiuhe sent more videos, he would call again?Xu Yinrong took off his presbyopic glasses and frowned for a while. He looked at He Bai whose eyes were full of anxiety, asking, \u201cI told you to hand me one photo each week, why do you give me ten now?\u201dHe Bai scratched the belt of the camera bag and came up with numerous excuses and reasons in his mind. However, ultimately, he said honestly, \u201cBecause\u2026I think none of them is satisfactory.\u201dHe felt upset as he said, so he lowered his head gradually, \u201cI have mastered the basic theory for group portraits photography, but when it came to practice\u2026\u201dXu Yinrong glanced him, saying nothing. He tiled the photos in front of He Bai and asked, \u201cThen you tell me what their problems are.\u201dHe Bai raised his head and carefully examined these photos one by one, criticizing himself without any consideration, \u201cThe color processing and the composition proportion are bad. The primary has been confused with secondary, and no theme is highlighted. Some portraits are even taken on the wrong angle, which has led to proportional distortion\u2026Sorry, sir, I will redo it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Xiao Bai (2)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cRedoing is also in vain, as you are on the wrong track.\u201d Xu Yinrong shook his head and said, \u201cIf the full marks are 100, then your photos only deserve 0. Last time you asked me how to improve disordered composition, and I suggested you to refer to some posters. You clearly missed my points.\u201dHe Bai was baffled and couldn\u2019t help leaning forward. His posture and expression revealed his desire for the answer, regardless of all that harsh criticism.And that was exactly why Xu Yinrong liked him---not afraid of criticism, willing to learn and to hear others\u2019 opinions, not stubborn and able to improve when he found problems.\u201cPosters are all well-designed, which means the portraits on them are the results of deliberate cooperation of photographers and objects, but your photos\u2026\u201d Xu Yinrong slowed his tone unconsciously, and tapped the photos on his table, suggesting, \u201cYour photos are still shot in a single-portrait way, and all of them are captured. Couldn\u2019t the captured group portraits photos be excellent? No, instead, there are a lot, but they\u2019re elusive. Most of the group portraits photos, especially the commercial ones, require the cooperation between photographer and object. So, Xiao He, you have to learn to instruct the model to follow your photographing track, rather than be obsessed with capturing models.\u201dWell, that was very illuminating.Staring at those ten photos on the table, He Bai recalled his experience in shooting portraits during this period. He got a sense of dawning comprehension.Indeed, he had been used to shooting landscapes, so he always thought subconsciously about capturing, about how to one-sidedly follow others instead of cooperating. As nature would never cooperate with anyone, if you wanted a desirable landscape photography, you would have to wait there day and night, for the perfect moment that nature seldom gave.When it came to portrait photography, he also gave models their heads and he captured them with camera, hardly asking them to cooperate with him.\u2026So he had been taking photos with the landscape pattern, which meant essentially there were no breakthrough and progress.\u201cSir\u2026\u201d When he realized it, he got flurried.Xu Yinrong raised his hand to stop him and took a photo collection from his book case. Sitting back, he presented this collection to He Bai and tapped the first photo, \u201cThis is my first group portraits photo. At that time, I was just an inexperienced journalist. I followed my senior to take pictures for the news about police escorting criminals to home. This photo was criticized harshly by him.\u201dHe Bai looked at it. It was a black-and-white photo with a low resolution. In the picture, the police were queuing up to get into the cars, looking loosened up and tired, without any sense of tension when they escorted criminals.\u201cThe domestic conditions were not good at that time, so escorting criminals was a tiresome work. On their arrival, the police and criminals were all worn out.\u201d Xu Yinrong explained and turned to another page, \u201cThis one was shot by him, which was adopted by the newspaper.\u201dIt was also a blurred, black-and-white photo, but it adopted close-up photographing, only included one policeman and one criminal. In this photo, they were looking right at the camera. Although the policeman seemed tired, but he stood straight and used his strong, stable hands to hold the criminal, while the criminal was avoiding the camera and lowering his head, full of regret and shame.\u201cI captured this photo.\u201d Xu Yinrong turned to his photo to let He Bai look at it again. Then he turned back, \u201cWhen took this photo, my senior asked that police men to pose as if he had subdued the criminal. As they knew this photo would be posted on newspaper, they both expressed their real feelings subconsciously. The policeman would like the readers to see justice, while the criminal was shameful for his guilt.\u201dHe Bai gazed at the eyes of these two men, feeling a little bit terrified.\u201cLater, this criminal behaved well and pled guilty actively, so he got abatement on penalty and was released from prison prior to the expiration of the sentence.Then, He Bai looked at his own photos, frowned.\u201cXiao He, a good photographer not only can discover the traits of each model and capture them, but also can make full use of these traits when you see them and let them form the picture that you want most.\u201d\u201cPhotographers are not only the recorders and onlookers, but also the participants and controller. Due to the multiple objects, group portraits photographing are uncontrollable, but you\u2019ve got your eyes, hands and mind, so you have to use your eyes to discover them, use your hands to capture them, and after all, I hope you can use your mind-when you discover the beauty of your objects, control it, enlarge it and deliberately arrange it.\u201dHe Bai finally got his messy mind clear and found a direction. After digesting teacher\u2019s words silently, he looked at the photos on the table again, releasing a deep sigh. He raised his head and smiled to Xu Yinrong, saying seriously, \u201cSir, I will hand the desirable photos next week!\u201dSeeing him begin to understand, Xu Yingrong leaned against the back of his chair with satisfaction. He waved his hand, \u201cThen go get it. Do a good job this time.\u201d\u201cI will!\u201d He Bai stoop up with a bright smile. He collected the photos on the table and ran outside urgently.Xu Yinrong shook his head and burst out laughing. He took a look at the calendar, sighing, \u201cOnly a few months left. Hope he can make it\u2026\u201dAfter he got out of Xu Yinrong\u2019s office, He Bai rushed back to the dorm, grabbed his wallet and went out. He bought a Polaroid as quick as possible and ran to the biggest funfair in city B. He bought the ticket and entered. Next, he bought a large white board and wrote \u201cFree Photography. Instantly Take the Photo After Shooting. Assigned Poses Only! Group Photo First!\u201d Then he stood in front of the fountain with heaviest population, and waited.After ten minutes, there were some look-on people, but no one asked for a shoot.He Bai looked at other stalls and bought a large box of lollipops, adding \u201cStudent Practice, With FREE Lollipops. He chose a less populated place and continued to wait.Another five minutes later, a couple came out of curiosity.He Bai got excited and quickly scanned the clothes and other things of this couple which could reveal their traits. The composition proportion for two portraits photography flashed in his mind and gave him endless inspiration.\u201cOnce I went to a remote landscape. Local people called it \u201cLove Fountain.\u201d It was said that if a couple drank the water from the fountain together, they would never part.\u201d He gave both a lollipop first. Then he smiled at them as he adjusted his camera, showing his left dimple, \u201cWhen you drink the water of that fountain, you have to pose in a special way. Do you want to try it?\u201d\u201cThe girl already adored his dimple and nodded without hesitation, saying, \u201cOf course! Although my boyfriend is a little dumb, but it\u2019s great to be with him forever.\u201dThe tall boy beside her gave her a wry smile, and petted her heavily.The girl stared at him and fought back.He Bai looked at them and recalled the modeling of those two Love Stone at the remote landscape, then grinned. He didn\u2019t teach them how to pose until they called a stop on their cute bantering.The first couple left with satisfaction. Followed by a gang of girlfriends who had watched this also came, then came a mother and son, father and daughter\u2026After the last family photo, he had given out all the lollipops. He put his white board away and stretched himself.The results were good today. He planned to come again when he was free.The next day, He Bai received a call from Jiang Xiuwen.\u201d\u201cYou are in the Q University not?\u201d He was surprised.\u201cYes\u201d Jiang Xiuwen replied with sincere attitude, \u201cI come to apologize for lying together with Di Qiuhe before. Sorry!\u201dHe Bai looked at the small box he just received and sighed in his heart, saying, \u201cAll right, where are you, I\u2019m coming now.\u201dThey met at the playground and He Bai took him to the tea bar in north canteen. They found a quiet place and sat down.After the waiter sent their drinks to the table, Jiang Xiuwen organized his words and said, \u201cMr. He, last time at Red Guest, I arbitrarily decided to fabricate a \u201ccousin\u201d to cover for Di Qiuhe\u2019s alt account, I am very sorry for that.\u201d He came to apologize in person and with a modest attitude. His sincerity was adequate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Xiao Bai (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai looked at him and recalled the \u201capologize by drinking three shots\u201d video. His mild heart was softened. After a few-second silence, he said, \u201cI accept your apology. As for Qiuhe\u2026I will talk with him later.\u201d After these days, he had basically cooled down. Besides, blocking and farewell were just tricks to frighten him so that he could remember this lesson and never did it again. \u2018Now Jiang Xiuwen came to apologize for his friend in person while Di Qiuhe had also learnt from it, so, it\u2019s time to move on.\u2019\u201cThank you for your forgiveness.\u201d Hearing that, Jiang Xiuwen finally breathed a sigh of relief. He hadn\u2019t expected that things could go on so smoothly. Gazing at He Bai\u2019s gradually mature face and recalled Di Qiuhe\u2019s determined, \u201che-is-the-one\u201d face, he couldn\u2019t help saying something nice to talk his friend up, \u201cMr. He, Qiuhe is a little bit childish. Sometimes he might go too far, but he bears no ill will. He had intended to use the joke to get closer to you. He is kind of dumb and adopted the inappropriate method, and his complicated family background has also made him\u2026Anyway, if he does anything stupid in the future, don\u2019t hesitate beating and scolding him. He won\u2019t resist, just hope you do not ignore him again. He doesn\u2019t have many friends and susceptible to friends\u2019 emotions, so even if he is sad, he will not show it.\u201dHe Bai was baffled by his last words. He remembered that Di Qiuhe was clearly happy at his birthday night, but he just restrained his happiness and did not know how to express it, making him even less talkative than usual. He had great sympathy for Di Qiuhe, sighing unconsciously. Then he smiled to Jiang Xiuwen and said, \u201cI see, thanks for your reminding.\u201d\u201cNot at all\u201d, Jiang Xiuwen said hurriedly, full of gratification and anxiety.His friend had an infallible eye for He Bai, who was really good. But as considerate as He Ba, who was also blessed with such good temperament, such strong ability, and such a handsome face...Anyway, he worried about whether Di Qiuhe could capture the heart of such an excellent boy. It would be slightly easier if He Bai was gay, but what if he was completely straight\u2026Then that would be tragic and miserable. Back to the dorm, He Bai recalled all the things happened in these days and sighed again. He took out the box he received today from his bag.He Bai felt speechless but also thought Di Qiuhe was funny.Di Qiuhe\u2026was so childish that he could only use such childish way to apologize. What a blockhead.While roommates were out, he inserted the card into computer and played the video.\u201cXiao Bai.\u201d Di Qiuhe was in a more plainly furnished room. He sat on the bed with boxer shorts and night trousers, as well as a serious face.His skin was even more tanned in just a few days. And an injury lay on his arm, a scar on his forehead. Yet his eyes became more powerful, but now they were mixed with unease and ingratiation. This kind of contradiction made him lovelier. \u201cI was on the set when you called me yesterday, so I missed it, sorry.\u201d He stood upright as he was saying, \u201cJiang Xiuwen told me that apology must be full of sincerity. I am afraid that you will miss the messages that I have sent you on Weibo and campus network, so I recorded this video. I have to continue my filming tonight, so, I cannot drink. I will compensate you these three shots next time, sorry.\u201dHe Bai looked at Di Qiuhe\u2019s tired, bleary red eyes and then turned to his dark circles. Finally, there went his last anger.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Di Qiuhe sat in a more overcautious manner and said with a stiff face, \u201cTo not make it worse, I decide to confess one more thing.\u201dHe Bai was shocked and then frowned. \u2018Did he cheat me for something else?\u2019\u201cAfter pissing you off, I secretly contacted Niu Junjie and asked for the ways to obtain your forgiveness. It\u2019s not spying on you or inquiring about your privacy. If you feel offended, I will stop, sorry.\u201dWith complex expressions, He Bai gazed at this guy who was apologizing seriously. Finally, he shook his head and took out his phone, removing Di Qiuhe from the blacklist.\u201cI will never miss your call again.\u201d Di Qiuhe promised at the end of the video, and smiled at the camera. He looked dumb, but mild, \u201cXiao Bai, look forward to our next meeting.\u201dAs the video was over, He Bai had already worn a smile. After a thought, he took out the recorder.There was only one recording in it. He found it and played out.\u201cXiao Bai, I\u2019 sorry.\u201dFamiliar opening remarks with apology.\u201cIt is my fault to cheat you into sending me voice. Please accept my apology.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s smile was frozen and he felt an uneasy sense of foreboding.\u201cXiao Bai, good morning, mua~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cXiao Bai, good evening, mua~\u201dHe Bai buried his face in his hands.\u201cAnother compensating recording.\u201d The mild deep and mellow voice paused, and then tinted with shyness. He said slowly, \u201cXiao Bai, Let me scoop you up and cuddle you with a warm kiss!\u201dBang!He Bai turned off the recorder indifferently and took a deep breath. He took the phone and blocked Di Qiuhe again. But he recalled the words of Jiang Xiuwen and cancelled the block, turning off his phone.He shouldn\u2019t believe that Di Qiuhe could become normal. What? Is him a girl? \u2018Cuddle and kiss? We are two men.\u2019Another night shooting was over. Di Qiuhe took his private phone from Wang Boyi, still no He Bai\u2019s call. He lowered his eyes disappointedly.\u201cMaster Di.\u201d Wang Boyi said with hesitation, having noticed the conflict between his boss and He Bai. He handed Di Qiuhe his own phone, \u201cI browsed news about Huang du today and found this accidentally\u2026Although this picture doesn\u2019t show his whole face, but I think he is your junior schoolmate at Q University\u2026\u201dDi Qiuhe, who had leaned against the chair casually, suddenly sat upright, and grabbed his phone. Wang Boyi: \u201c\u2026\u201d Such a bandit action. And the gifts his boss mailed to Q University\u2026People who didn\u2019t know the fact must have thought that he was coursing a girl.There was a pink Weibo homepage on his phone. Telling from the profile photo, the blogger was most likely to be a beautiful girl. The verified information showed that she was a GuFeng music (some kind of newage folk that contained the elements of both Chinese modern and ancient songs) singer with a lot of works and hundreds of thousand fans. The top blog was a publicity, and the second one was a newly released travelling blog, which contained nine photos. The first seven were landscape photos, the eighth one was a couple photo and the last one, was obviously a candid photo.Di Qiuhe recognized immediately that the person standing sideways on the camera was his little puppy. Then he clicked the picture with a speed seemingly quicker than his brain responses. He gazed at this person in the picture and touched him at his dimple.Wang Boyi pretended not seeing his action and said, \u201cThis blogger said she and her boyfriend met this student who took free photos for visitors when they dated in the fairyland. She said the student was kind and had wonderful skills. They also got free lollipops after that. When she posted this photo, many recognized that this student was Mr. He and attracted a lot of fans, who made it a hot issue on Weibo.\u201d\u201cXiao Bai is amazing, so wherever he goes, he can be the focus of others.\u201d Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help smiling and said with a proud tone. He was about to save the picture when he realized that this was Wang Yibo\u2019s phone. He cancelled the saving and returned the phone, then he took out his own.Wang Yibo accepted phone and was a little bit surprised. Master Di felt better now? But why?Ding Dong. Just as he took out his phone, a message came. Di Qiuhe frowned and hesitated on whether he should open Weibo or check the message, then he chose to check the message reluctantly.Jiang Xiuwen: I have talked with He Bai. He has accepted my apology and said that he would contact you later. Seize the chance.Di Qiuhe was shocked. He immediately found He Bai\u2019s phone number and called him without any thoughts.\u201cSorry, the number you dialed has been switched off.\u201dIt was \u201cswitched off\u201d, not \u201cdoes not exist\u201d!He recalled that in the picture, little puppy\u2019s profile was so beautiful, and he subconsciously curled up his lips when he was adjusting his camera. Di Qiuhe wanted to see him right now. He turned to Wang Boyi and pressed his shoulder, saying seriously, \u201cI am going back to city B!\u201dWang Boyi withstood his hand and pain, his body turning stiff, saying, \u201cBut your filming\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter night shooting, I got a one-day break. Book the plane ticket for me, I\u2019ll make it!\u201d Di Qiuhe cannot restrain his desire anymore and his eyes even began to shine. He said hurriedly, \u201cI go back to pack up and prepare gifts now. Just book the ticket as quickly as possible. There is only one night shooting to go, hurry up!\u201d Then he strode back to his room.Wang Boyi: \u201c\u2026\u201d Master Di was somewhat wired\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Why does the Bird Go Missing? (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkThe weather got cooler and cooler after the arrival of an autumn rainy spell. Major shopping malls stopped selling summer clothing and put autumn wear up for sale. Also, main fashion magazines kept abreast of seasonal changes and focused on recommending fine products of leading brands.Lin Xia opened Vision and carefully spread the folded page right in the middle. Touching the clothing picture that belonged to her company, she let out a contented breath and smiled at He Bai who sat opposite her, \u201cThe magazine is running your photo again. Congratulations!\u201d\u201cCredit for it must go to costume designers and the whole team.\u201d He Bai never claimed credit for himself, only an adorable smile could be seen on his face whenever he was praised.Lin Xia smiled at him affectionately, \u201cYou always speak in sweet words. For this reason, everyone has been pampering you. Tell me, what are you rushing over for?\u201dSeeing Lin Xia read his mind, He Bai gave a shy smile and took a stack of invitation letters from his backpack to show her, replying in a fawning way, \u201cSome people have invited me to take photographs. I turned them down previously, while... I hate to bother you, but could you help me deal with them?\u201dAs Little Mermaid became the hottest brand and his photos frequently appeared on major platforms, more and more people came in admiration to make shooting appointments with him. As a student, He Bai felt it difficult to attend simultaneously to his studies and work, and no extra time was left to him for anything else. Besides, once he relented and took an appointment, he could hardly stop even if he would. After all, if he agreed to take photos of one person but refused to another, he or she would see it as sheer contempt.What was more, he was skilled in photography but lacking in experience, and... he had a striking weak point. From a long-term perspective on career development, he wasn\u2019t supposed to take overly advantage of his popularity at present, and what he needed most was to strive to enrich his mind.Aware of He Bai\u2019s difficulties, Lin Xia was on one hand gratified that he trusted her company completely and took on no extra-official jobs without their permission; on the other hand, she felt sorry for him in that it quite embarrassed him, a young guy who had few connections in this industry, to afford to turn down those stars who had a lot of contacts in entertainment circle. Softened up, she helped decline a number of offers to shoot in the name of person in charge of Little Mermaid brand and under the pretext that He Bai would be in breach of contract if he took photographs privately.However, only He Bai and Lin Xia knew whether the contract stipulated that He Bai was not allowed to make private shooting.\u201cWho are they?\u201d Lin Xia glanced at the pile of invitation letters, pulled them over and flipped through the letters, which got her both annoyed and amused, \u201cIt\u2019s really... Those b-list celebrities say nothing but that they look forward to cooperation with you later when we decline their invitations, and some stars just express euphemistically that they hope you can give priority to their business once you are willing to take shooting appointments in the future. In contrast, these starlets who has newly entered entertainment circle and won mediocre popularity were extraordinarily enthusiastic about inviting you to take photos of them. Knowing that you stay at the campus, they have the impudence to send the invitation letter to your university. They\u2019ve really gone too far.\u201d\u201cThey probably do this without the permission of their agent.\u201d He Bai scratched his face and made a guess.Hearing his words, Lin Xia gave him a quick glance. In her heart, she knew that it was not the case. Those unknown actors had no resources and totally counted upon agents and their company to give support, so they didn\u2019t dare to act rashly in case their agents and the company would be irritated. No doubt that these invitation letters were wrote by agents who considered He Bai a newcomer with no contacts and tried to sound his bottom line out. How stupid they were even not to realize that He Bai was backed by Jia family and Yi Ka! No wonder they remained obscure until now.But there was no need of explaining it to He Bai who was destined to serve high-end customers and would have no contact with those rash starlets and chaotic brokerage companies. It\u2019s simply unnecessary to tell him the reason behind, which was good for nothing but would get He Bai annoyed.Sneering at those unqualified actors and agents, Lin Xia threw the letters into the trash can and soothed He Bai, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this. We\u2019ll help you deal with them. By the way, you come just at the right moment. There is a piece of work for you, so I want to ask whether you would like to do it.\u201dA piece of work for him? Why did Lin Xia have to ask him first? As autumn clothing publicity came to an end, his shooting had been wound up. What else could be done?He Bai looked at her, perplexed.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, It\u2019s not shooting appointment.\u201d Lin Xia eased his mind and took a document out to show him, smiling, \u201cI suggest that you should accept the offer. It will be to the benefit of your career prospects. Of course, it\u2019s up to you. The man gave us three days to decide, so you can give full consideration to the job.\u201dOut of curiosity, He Bai opened the document and browsed through it rapidly. He couldn\u2019t help crying out in surprise, \u201cWhat? Jun Chen invited me to shoot the cover for his MV? Why me? Is there something wrong with him?\u201dAmused by his reaction, Lin Xia burst out laughing and chimed in, \u201cI also wonder why you, an unknown newcomer, should tickle the fancy of Jun Chen, the famous singer who has regular photographers at hand.\u201d In addition, he offered to let actresses wear Little Mermaid costumes when starring in his new MV in order to achieve cooperation with He Bai. In this way, original private appointment was transformed into the cooperation between Jun Chen\u2019s Studio and Little Mermaid brand, bypassing the provision of \u201cNo private shooting\u201d which had served as their pretext before.He Bai leafed through the document, which left him all at sea.He had never shot MV cover and had no idea what to do with it.Walking out from Yi Ka\u2019s building, He Bai hesitated for a while and got on a bus to the amusement park as planned. With work to do at weekends and lessons to take in working days, he could only squeeze practice into his negligible amount of free time.Seating himself in the bus, He Bai took out his phone, enabled the browser and did a search on \u2018Jun Chen\u2019.It brought up a lot of items. The first one was his introduction.Jun Chen, a man of twenty-seven, was a former singer of Yangyao Record Company and now is in charge of Jun Chen\u2019s Studio. He made his debut at the age of 20 and has created a large number of masterpieces, thus known as \u2018Young God of Song\u2019. His records sell like hot cakes in H area every year ...He Bai skimmed through the materials and counted up how many albums the guy had released. Frowning, he struggled to recall songs that had prevailed in the previous incarnation and finally guessed out which album Jun Chen was going to release this time.... But if he remembered rightly, Jun Chen would make \u2018Dear\u2019 his album theme. It was done in honor of his deceased family and thus meant a lot to him. In the last life, the cover of this album seemed to be an old photo which He Bai had noticed many times from some music apps. He vaguely remembered a netizen revealed that it was Jun Chen\u2019s most cherished picture, behind which there was a quite touching story\u2026Why did Jun Chen change his mind this life? What did he want to do? That album had hit such an all-time high that CCTV (national TV station) played it regularly. He Bai had no idea why he asked a newcomer to shoot its cover.He Bai racked his brains but failed to figure it out. When he put down the mobile phone and was ready to turn it off, Di Qiuhe gave him a call.The ring he heard a few days ago\u2014\u201cLet me scoop you up and cuddle you with a warm kiss\u201d\u2014sprang to mind as if a conditioned reflex and was constantly resounding. He Bai raised his eyebrows, hung up without hesitation and sent Di Qiuhe a text.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Why does the Bird Go Missing? (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai: I don\u2019t want to hear your voice for the time being.Di Qiuhe: I miss you.He Bai: \u201c...\u201dHe Bai: Mind your language, or I\u2019ll add you to my blacklist again.Di Qiuhe didn\u2019t reply his message in a long while.Di Qiuhe: Where are you? What are you doing?The conversation eventually went on the right track, with which He Bai was satisfied a little, so he kept typing: I\u2019m on a bus and ready to do my shooting homework. How\u2019s it going at work these days?Di Qiuhe: Fine. To be honest, it\u2019s a bit tiring, and my face was almost scarred.He Bai was shocked, and a feeling of pity emerged in his heart. Aware that Di Qiuhe was kind of acting pitiable, he couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for him. Less grim-faced, he returned the message: Be careful you don\u2019t hurt yourself when acting your role, and remember to dine on time and have a good rest. Also, don\u2019t bother to send me anything again. Given free time, you might as well spend it in sleeping. In addition to the hot and humid climate on the border, I hear that it\u2019s quite tiring to act in an action movie, so you must take care of yourself, in case you get sick.Di Qiuhe: It's very kind of you, Little Puppy.The line\u2014\u201cLet me scoop you up and cuddle you with a warm kiss\u201d\u2014crossed He Bai\u2019s mind again, which raised goosebumps on his skin. He quickly typed: Why are you speaking such sappy words? Please behave in a normal way!Di Qiuhe: ... hm.Did his text upset him?He Bai awkwardly moved his bottom, did some thinking and tried to soothe Di Qiuhe serious-faced: You are indeed a nice friend except that you lied to me. Well, just this once. You\u2019re forgiven. When you go back to B city, I\u2019ll treat you to a dinner.Di Qiuhe: I would like you to cook steak for me. I can help wash the dishes!This guy was really good at seeking favor.He Bai rolled his eyes and made a perfunctory reply as if Di Qiuhe had been a little child: Okay. I cook steak, and you wash the dishes.Di Qiuhe: You\u2019re so sweet, Bai.He Bai felt it difficult to continue the conversation and decided immediately to end the senseless chat, thus typing: I\u2019m getting off the bus. Let\u2019s drop it. Work hard and take a good rest every day. TTYL.Di Qiuhe made no reply. Looking at the amusement park ahead, He Bai stowed his cell phone away into the pocket, got up and walked towards the door. No sooner did he erect the whiteboard than visitors who came to take pictures swarmed around him immediately and inquired when he usually came over.\u201cI come here whenever I\u2019m free, not on a regular basis. So you don\u2019t need to come specially waiting for me. After all, tickets for the amusement park are pretty expensive.\u201d He Bai handed out lollipops to these enthusiastic girls and answered them in a gentle way, \u201cMaybe I will go to another amusement park next time. Anyway, I really appreciate your support and will try my best to take good pictures of you all.\u201d He smiled habitually after saying this.\u201cGod, how lovely he looks! What a handsome man! I made cookies for you, so please take my picture first. I\u2019m your super fan!\u201d The foregoer screamed excitedly, while she was too shy to get close to He Bai. Blushing scarlet, she jumped up and down emotionally.\u201c... Thanks ever so much for your love.\u201d Dumbfounded by her \u2018lovely\u2019 praise, He Bai felt quite warm.When he started the practice, He Bai had completely not expected that he would have fans, to be exact, fans extraordinarily enthusiastic about his shooting. After getting a line on his location, not only did they wait for him every day but also they have created a topic \u2018He\u2019s daily photographs\u2019 on WeiBo and refreshed it from time to time.Fortunately, they were thoughtful enough to cause no disturbance when he was practicing and would leave obediently after getting a little benefits.He Bai took a collective photo of these lovely fans and accepted several inexpensive gifts they brought. Soft-spoken to sending them away, he continued to practice photographing.An hour passed before he realized it, and there was only a lollipop left. When he was ready to knock off, a slender strong hand holding an orange was stretched over from behind.\u201cCan I trade you my orange for your lollipop?\u201dThe voice sounded familiar, so did the scene.Amazed by that, He Bai turned around immediately to look at the person behind, letting out a cry of astonishment, \u201cWhy are you here? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in the set?\u201dWorn out by the journey, Di Qiuhe looked quite tired. He smiled at He Bai and raised his peaked hat habitually. Seeing He Bai\u2019s eyes grew wide, Di Qiuhe fought down an impulse to embrace the guy and replied, \u201cAlthough you have forgiven me, I think it necessary to make an apologize to you in person. Luckily, the director gave me one day off, so I bought a ticket and went back to see you.\u201dHe Bai stared at him, and for a moment he didn't know what he ought to say.His new drama play had begun shooting. No doubt that Di Qiuhe, the leading hero, must have run off his feet. It was quite rare for him to take a day off when he didn\u2019t seize the opportunity to have a rest but chose to get back! Never had He Bai seen\u2026 seen such a bad and\u2026stupid person. How stupid he was!Seeing He Bai staring at himself without a word, Di Qiuhe thought he had yet to cool down, his smile fading. The guy bowed his head, took a cup out of his backpack and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry. I can drink three cups of alcohol as forfeit...\u201dThe man who always got on his nerves suddenly became well-behaved and even kind of pitiable. He Bai was stuck for words...\u201cNo drinking. It can damage your health.\u201d He Bai frowned, grabbing the cup from Di Qiuhe and throwing it into the trash can next to him. Then he bent down to put the whiteboard away, carried the camera and picked his backpack up, glaring at Di Qiuhe accusingly, \u201cHave you had lunch?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2026\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t lie to me again, will you?\u201dDi Qiuhe gave up lying and replied honestly, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201dIt was past two o'clock in the afternoon, while Di Qiuhe didn\u2019t have lunch yet. It was really... He Bai found the guy was always able to irritate him. Maybe they were ill-matched in horoscope!\u201cTip your cap forward, and keep up with me!\u201d He Bai couldn't help giving Di Qiuhe a glare, and turned around to go outside. Taking a few steps forwards, he found that Di Qiuhe was lagging behind, which made him seething with rage. Considering that he was an actor, He Bai tried hard to restrain himself from giving Di Qiuhe a scolding. He walked back, pulled his arm and berated him in a low voice while dragging him down the street, \u201cWhy you stand still? Wouldn\u2019t you like a meal?\u201dDiu Qiuhe felt as though his arm went limp when He Bai touched it. Catching a glimpse of the dimple on He Bai\u2019s face, which was faintly discernible while he was speaking, as well as his sparkling eyes, Di Qiuhe was eager for a touch of them but soon restrained himself and replied honestly, \u201cI see a bathroom over there, and I want to...\u201dHe Bai halted hurriedly.Di Qiuhe bumped against He Bai, his chest rubbing against He Bai\u2019s back. Despite several pieces of clothing, Di Qiuhe felt his heart was beating much faster. He took a firm grip of He Bai\u2019s shoulder as if he had knocked him down, and asked nervously, \u201cDoes your back hurt? If you are in a rush, I can take care of that later.\u201d\u201cShut it!\u201d He Bai freed himself from Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand, turned around and grabbed his arm again. While stepping back, he ground his teeth and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. How could you delay the call of nature? It\u2019s bad for your health. Go pee now, and then I take you to dinner. \u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Why does the Bird Go Missing? (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe followed He Bai obediently and broke into a smile. His eyes were fixated at the man beside him, and his heart palpitated with indescribable excitement. Cared about by his beloved, He Bai became extraordinarily well-behaved and nodded shyly, \u201cOkay. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\u201cYour tone of voice sounds a little strange\u201d. He Bai looked back at him suspiciously and stopped, letting go of his hand. Then he gestured a public restroom and said, \u201cOver there. Tell me what you would like so that I can order a restaurant.\u201d\u201cOrder whatever you like.\u201d Di Qiuhe was as good as gold and wore a smile all the time. He also warned, \u201cI\u2019ll finish soon. Don\u2019t run around.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a kid, and I won\u2019t run around.\u201d He Bai frowned and felt that there was something odd about Di Qiuhe\u2019s words, which put He Bai on his guard. He looked at Di Qiuhe on full alert and asked, \u201cIt strikes me that the note in your apology video... So you give up the brotherhood play now and start to act father-and-son one? Let\u2019s not mince words: I want neither a son as old as you nor a father at my age.\u201dDi Qiuhe was stupefied, and his heartbeat was restored to normal rate. Since he realized he was sweet on He Bai, Di Qiuhe had been restraining himself from giving it away. But at the moment, the idea cropped up again. He sounded He Bai out in a joking way, \u201cWhat if I want to put on a husband-and-wife play?\u201dHe Bai\u2019s expression changed greatly. He stepped back, looked Di Qiuhe up and down with a frown, and fixed his eyes on the lower half of Di\u2019s body, replying in a low tone, \u201cSure, but you may lose your \u2018bird\u2019.\u201dDi Qiuhe, A Bird Born in Autumn, noticed He Bai\u2019s sight, which made his heart leap once more. Feeling a physiological reaction took place on his penis, Di Qiuhe leaned sideways hurriedly and asked without thinking, \u201cWhat do you mean? Why may I lose my bird?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201d He Bai sighed.\u201cWhy?\u201d Di Qiuhe put his coat straight.He Bai shifted his gaze to Di Qiuhe\u2019s face and gave a gentle smile, \u201cNow that you want to be my wife, how could you continue to have your \u2018bird\u2019?\u201d\u201cPerhaps you can start by going to women's restroom and adapt to your new identity little by little?\u201d He Bai smiled broadly.Di Qiuhe\u2019s penis cooled down, so did his happiness and bashfulness about seeing He Bai.\u201cDear Little Puppy,\u201d Di Qiuhe turned his head and stared at He Bai, teasing him in a husky voice, \u201cPerhaps you would rather have an escape in the amusement park?\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cOr,\u201d Di Qiuhe looked around and smiled gently, with his eyes narrowed, \u201cyou want to hit the headlines: \u2018A popular gay photographer kissed has-been star Di Qiuhe in the amusement park\u2019?He Bai\u2019s smile faded, and there occurred a blank expression on his face. He took out the mobile phone, \u201cIt seems that someone only deserves to be blacklisted.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd there\u2019s no need to dine. I might as well go back to school to have a rest.\u201dDi Qiuhe took a step forward in alarm to hold He Bai\u2019s hand and looked at him genuinely, mouthing something \u201cIt\u2019s quite arduous to woo you, but I only have myself to blame.\u201d Then he said to He Bai sincerely, \u201cLittle Puppy, my profound apologies for that. Let\u2019s go out to lunch\u2014my treat.\u201dHe Bai replied politely, \u201cIf you insist...\u201d\u201cAnd dinner\u2014my treat.\u201dHe Bai signed, \u201cThe days fly. Autumn is around the corner...\u201d\u201cI treat you to hairy crabs!\u201dHe Bai stopped, patted him on the shoulder and said with affection, \u201cGo pee, in case you get something wrong with your cock.\u201d\u201c... Thanks for your warning.\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his hand to pinch He Bai\u2019s cheek, and turned around, a smile reappearing on his face. He stepped into the public toilet in a hurry and couldn\u2019t help but bow his head, brace his fist against the lips and burst into laughter when thinking of He Bai\u2019s aggressive manner. Overwhelmed with satisfaction and delight, Di Qiuhe felt his tiredness of the journey vanished without a trace.Eventually, they didn\u2019t have hairy crabs for there were no restaurant had crabs available near the amusement park.He Bai chose a restaurant at random and ordered an easily digested wheaten food for Di Qiuhe as well as a dessert for himself. While they were having the meal, He Bai asked Di Qiuhe about his work on the border.\u201cYang Wentian plays the secondary lead?\u201d He Bai was somewhat surprised at the news. Seeing Di Qiuhe cast a constant glance at his lips, He Bai rolled his eyes at the guy, forked a blueberry on the cake into Di\u2019s plate and said, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. Focus on your noodles. I\u2019ll order you another if you would like blueberries.\u201dDi Qiuhe took his eyes off He Bai, forked the blueberry into his mouth and pointed to his own lips, smiling and saying, \u201cThere is cream on the corner of your mouth.\u201d So lovely that Di Qiuhe wanted to kiss on.He Bai wiped his lips with a napkin, finding that there was indeed cream. He gave an embarrassing cough and changed the topic, \u201cThen who was casted in the female lead? Judging from what you said, Director Jiang chose actors based on their ability instead of popularity, so the main female character shouldn\u2019t be any of those actresses popular among people, should she?\u201d\u201cNo, she shouldn\u2019t. The female lead is a new talent.\u201d Di Qiuhe reached out his hand to fork a blueberry from He Bai\u2019s plate and smilingly enjoyed it when He Bai looked at him as if he were a robber. Then he forked a piece of shrimp meat from his own plate into He Bai\u2019s dish and continued, \u201cUncle Jiang originally had two scripts at hand, and he planned to give up the first one and shoot the other if there were no actors suited to its roles. The newcomer was casted in the female lead of the second play. Now Uncle Jiang shoots the first play and lays the second one aside. Given that this play contains few of her scenes, Uncle Jiang made her the female lead.\u201dA newcomer who was casted in the female lead of the second play directed by Jiang Guanshan? Something occurred to He Bai. He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s her name? Why Director Jiang singled her out?\u201d\u201cHer name is Dong Ni, and she hasn\u2019t graduated yet. It was a student of the director who introduced her to Jiang Guanshan.\u201d answered Di Qiuhe. Seeing He Bai seemed to be attracted to the actress, Di Qiuhe got jealous and added, \u201cAs far as I know, there\u2019s someone who pulls strings for her. She is said to be the mistress of a big shot. Although Director Jiang appreciates her ability, he actually doesn\u2019t like her.\u201dDong Ni?! As He Bai recalled, the infamous actress hyped her love details with Di Qiuhe for months, and it was finally confirmed that she was a big shot\u2019s mistress and Di Qiuhe was used as a pretext.He Bai\u2019s expression suddenly changed. Handsome as he was, Di Qiuhe tended to behave like Goofy. He Bai took pity on the guy from the bottom of his heart and said, \u201cQiuhe... you... you\u2019d better keep away from Dong Ni, in case you two are hyped as a couple.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Why does the Bird Go Missing? (4)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe paused to consider He Bai\u2019s words, his eyes sparkling, and felt him out, \u201cWhy? A much-reported romance among the costars can facilitate the movie promotion. It\u2019s a usual tactic of the entertainment world.\u201d\u2018However, it\u2019s not a tactic but a trap.\u2019\u201cQiuhe, you\u2019d best have loft aspirations and prove yourself via your ability instead of a romance.\u201d He Bai said in all sincerity. Thinking of those actors who had an affair with Dong Ni and was fixed good by the big shot, he felt genuine compassion for Di Qiuhe and explained it to him, \u201cAs you said, Dong Ni was someone\u2019s mistress. If you have a romance with her, the man may be irritated and can sort you out... Now that you\u2019re no staffer of Huangdu, you have to proceed with extreme caution. Do you understand?\u201dIn the last life, if the big shot hadn\u2019t been brought to justice, those dark secrets about Dong Ni wouldn\u2019t have been made to public, and Di Qiuhe could have been down on his luck. After all, the news had hit the headlines on political columns rather than entertainment ones, and people who had close contact with Dong Ni, without exception, were interrogated, so was Di Qiuhe. Having suffered from an unexpected misfortune, Di Qiuhe got heartfelt sympathy from a number of netizens, who shed tears of compassion for him.It never occurred to He Bai that his rebirth actually led to an earlier encounter of Di Qiuhe and that scourge. He was at fault.Di Qiuhe was kind of disappointed to hear He Bai\u2019s explanation and to see his sympathetic look. He couldn\u2019t help but fork another blueberry away from his plate and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have a sense of propriety. You may rest assured that, with my step-mother keeping her eye on me, I daren\u2019t have any romance.\u201d In addition, since he fell in love with Little Puppy, it\u2019s necessary for him to draw the line at romance.He Bai\u2019s attention was immediately diverted away from his behavior of snatching the blueberry. He asked, \u201cYour step-mother? Why?\u201d\u201cI am the eldest son of Di family.\u201d Di Qiuhe deliberately forked a piece of shrimp meat and flashed it in front of He Bai\u2019s eyes. He didn\u2019t had it until the act gave rise to He Bai\u2019s discontent and answered in a satirical way, \u201cThis identity itself is of great value. In addition to inheriting Huangdu Company, I can also choose to form a matrimonial alliance with another wealthy and influential clan. Taking the power of my future wife\u2019s family into consideration, my father would be more likely to be on my side, which runs counter to my stepmother\u2019s wishes. In order to prevent this from happening, she will ruin my reputation by hook or by crook so that ladies of noble birth would despise me and disdain to marry me. To that ends, what do you think my stepmother will do?\u201d said Di Qiuhe when he forked another piece of shrimp meat to flash it before He Bai.He Bai rolled his eyes at Di Qiuhe, forked a piece of shrimp meat into his mouth from Di\u2019s plate and swallowed it smilingly in reprisal for his former act, replying, \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to guess. If I were her, I would definitely make up innumerable romances about you and find ways to convince the crowd that you have a bunch of notorious gossips girlfriends.\u201dWhen He Bai spoke of this, a long list of Di Qiuhe\u2019s gossip girlfriends in the last life sprang to mind. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh with contempt for strife occurred in those rich families. Glancing at shrimp meat in his dish, He Bai readily cut Di Qiuhe the other half of the cake and said gently to the guy who maintained a good name, \u201cHelp yourself to it.\u201d Poor kid, he must be full up before he could score a triumph over adversity.Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows and stared at He Bai for a while when he reached one hand out to pinch He Bai\u2019s cheek, \u201cYou are so cute, Little Puppy.\u201d\u201cCute, cute your ass.\u201d He Bai pushed his hand away and smeared cream over his face.When Di Qiuhe filled up, He Bai took him straight to the airport and booked a room in a nearby hotel.Di Qiuhe\u2019s face darkened, \u201cHow could you drive me away, Little Puppy?\u201d Be that as it may, he didn\u2019t like being a burden on his sweetheart and followed He Bai obediently into the hotel.\u201cDo you honestly think I\u2019ll drive you away?\u201d He Bai turned his head and rolled his eyes at Di Qiuhe, pushing him into the room. Then he ran a bath for Di Qiuhe, snatched his luggage, searched his pajamas out and pushed him into the bathroom, \u201cGo take a bath and then have a sound sleep. You\u2019ve had dark circles under your eyes.\u201dDi Qiuhe was taken aback.\u201cI\u2019ll wake you up when it\u2019s time for dinner. What time are you leaving?\u201d\u201cFour o'clock in the morning. I have to reach the set by eight.\u201d answered Di Qiuhe in front of the bathtub when he was pushed into the bathroom.On hearing what Di Qiuhe said, He Bai gave him a pat on the head and said unhappily, \u201cSince you\u2019re going to act at eight o\u2019clock tomorrow, you shouldn\u2019t have taken me to watch a movie or play games and left in the small hours. Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s detrimental to your health? Tell me, when did you knock off yesterday?\u201dDi Qiuhe was about to speak.\u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t lie to me again.\u201dDi Qiuhe bit his tongue.\u201cTen o'clock?\u201d He Bai made a conservative guess.Di Qiuhe laid his clothes down and pushed He Bai out, \u201cI'm going to take a bath. Please go out.\u201dHe Bai clung on the door case and replied, his teeth clenched, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you finished your work at midnight and just slept for a few hours before you got on the plane!\u201dDi Qiuhe tried to pull his hand away and kept avoiding eye contact with him.\u2026 A thought crossed He Bai\u2019s mind. He roared, \u201cYou must have had a long night! You told me in the video that you were acting the movie and thus missed my call, but I called you at about 10 p.m. and you obviously talked to me on video at dawn! Besides, you wore a vest and pajama bottoms then, and your hair was still wet. No doubt that you just finished a bath and were ready to sleep!\u201dSpeechless, Di Qiuhe stepped forward, carried He Bai in his arms as though he was a child and took him out of the bathroom. After that, he loosened his grip, ran back to the bathroom and closed the door, shouting in a seemingly guilty voice, \u201cI\u2019m bathing. It\u2019s too loud to catch your words!\u201dWhat the hell!He Bai was driven up the wall and returned the roar immediately, \u201cBe quick! Then go to bed! Staying up for acting and fatigued by the journey, you is very likely to die young!\u201dThere was a brief silence inside, and then a small voice came.\u201cI\u2019ll try my best to outlive you.\u201d\u201cDon't wish me evil!\u201d He Bai answered back and yelled, \u201cIf you dare talk nonsense again, I\u2019ll cut your bird off!\u201dDi Qiuhe who was taking off his pants immediately caught hold of his belt and whispered after a hesitation, \u201cYou have nothing to use when it\u2019s cut off...\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d He Bai was all ears.\u201cNothing. I say I would like a poached chicken for dinner.\u201d answered Di Qiuhe. He took his clothes off, headed for the bathtub and put his head into the water to hide his blushes. After that, Di Qiuhe gave a sudden bellow of laughter.He had He Bai\u2019s forgiveness... What a nice thing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And the moment he touched the soft and cozy bed, his brain immediately sent out the signal of sleep.\u201cBai.\u201d His eyes were a bit dried out and he really wanted to close them. Yet looking at He Bai who was standing by the bed, he just was loath to take the short time being together with him to sleep. He forced himself to stay awake and said, \u201cIt\u2019s still early, shall we watch a horror movie together? We can have dinner right after it.\u201d\u201cNo! Just go to sleep!\u201d He Bai stared at him in a serious face, and he looked quite unhappy as his eyebrows tightly knitted, \u201cI will just send you back if you keep staying up.\u201dHis serious face made Di Qiuhe laughed, so he stopped teasing him and moved to the other side. He tapped the other pillow and asked, \u201cAre you tired? Wanna join?\u201dHe Bai didn\u2019t reply and dragged the quilt to cover his face. Later on, he tapped his body as if he was babysitting a baby, and then threatened, \u201cClose your eyes and mouth or I knock you out.\u201dNow he couldn\u2019t see anything at all, but he could feel that his chest got tapped over the quilt. That was really something new and peculiar.Di Qiuhe slowly lifted up his mouth and turned over his body. He then dragged down a bit of the quilt and held He Bai\u2019s waist all of a sudden. He curled up himself and snuggled his face against his waist with his eyes closed.\u201cHey!\u201d He Bai lost his balance because of the cuddle that he wanted to kick the ass of this naughty boy who refused to sleep. But the moment he raised his hand, he realized that the brat had already loosed up his arm and put one arm on his leg, the other on the bed.Was he asleep now?He Bai\u2019s lips twitched and he pushed the head on his waist slightly. There he saw a totally relaxed sleeping face.Falling asleep so fast...he rubbed his face and surrendered after all. He took Di Qiuhe\u2019s arm off and walked to his backpack and took out an album. He hesitated for a second then put the album back, walking to the bed to tuck the quilt for Di Qiuhe.What a tight sleep with not even one single dream.Di Qiuhe unconsciously rubbed against the soft pillow. His eyelids moved a bit and then his eyes opened slowly.His eyesight got gradually clear and he saw a familiar figure sitting on the armchair by the window reading a book. Beside him stood a lamp set with the dimmest light.His tense body gradually relaxed after sleep and he looked at Bai who was reading under the light. His eyes softened and his face were covered with a smile.The dear puppy was still here and he didn\u2019t run away.He blinked and slowly moved his eyes.Puppy\u2019s hair looked so furry under the light. He had a full forehead and round eyes, with a nicely-carved nose and a chubby nose tip. His lip line was so plump that you want to rub them. His face was a little bit chubby and if he smiled his eyes would curl up and you could see a dimple on his face.\u2018How come I didn\u2019t find out that puppy\u2019s face was so delicate?\u2019His slender fingers turned the page and made some rustling sound.His move on the arm stretched out his shoulders, and his cotton shirt turned into a soft curve. His white T-shirt popped out from the shirt, and you could see part of the line of his collarbone. Going upward, you could also see his beautiful neck. Even his Adam\u2019s apple looked much adorable than the others\u2019.The room was very quiet and curtained that no views from the outside could be seen. The spot where puppy was sitting was the only place with light in this room, so it looked quite warm and made you want to get closer.He moved his body and put his arm back under his head to look it up, and then he lifted the other arm to outline his shape. He really wished that time could go slower so that he could stay longer quietly with this man.Maybe now he was dreaming, he thought. Would there be any better dream other than waking up seeing your lover staying by your side?Another page turned, finally the book was read. The man on the armchair suddenly raised his arm up, massaging his bending neck.As if struck awake from a lost dream, Di Qiuhe put his numb arm down and slid back to the quilt. He closed his eyes and counted to three, then he stretched himself and opened the quilt to sit up. He then smiled at the one who looked towards him and said, \u201cMorning, puppy.\u201dThe one sitting on the armchair was struck for a second and rolled his eyes and said ironically, \u201cSave it and get up for food. I\u2019m starving.\u201dThere went the sweet dream. Di Qiuhe got up immediately and jumped to the man who was just about to get up with the book. Following his desire from his heart, he rubbed his head against his shoulder and cling on him like a koala. He murmured, \u201cI\u2019m still sleepy.\u201d\u201cMe as well! Then sleep more after we get food. It\u2019s almost midnight and I don\u2019t know if the hotel still serves food.\u201d He Bai pressed his belly and complained while trying to get away from his intimacy.Di Qiuhe was struck and got off his arm on him and said with his eyebrows frown, \u201cIt\u2019s already midnight? Why didn\u2019t you wake me up for dinner?\u201dHe Bai looked at him in a poker face and put the album back to the bag without speaking a word.Di Qiuhe looked at his unconsciously tense lips and his heart was gradually filled with joy. He raised up his eyebrows and jumped on him again. He grabbed his neck and said, \u201cLittle puppy, was it because you just love me so much that you didn\u2019t want to wake me up?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather love a pig than you! Go brush your teeth and wash your face. Don\u2019t you ever rub your eye gums on me?\u201d He Bai was pissed off and tried to pull his arm off himself, \u201cHurry up! Just be quick cause I don\u2019t wanna die of starvation.\u201dDi Qiuhe cracked a smile and pinched his face. He then let him go to the bathroom and said, \u201cLittle puppy, you don\u2019t need to hide your affection towards me. I won\u2019t laugh at you as I am very generous...um, what do you want to eat later?\u201d\u201cI want to eat your flesh and drink your blood!\u201d He Bai replied angrily. He thought he was just so stupid to not go back just for this childish dumb-ass, and he hoped that no dorm checking tonight.The two of them went back to the room after having some random food. He Bai went directly to the shower and Di Qiuhe took out his phone to send messages to Jiang Xiuwen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then looked at the bathroom door feeling very excited yet uncertain.Ten minutes later, He Bai went out in the white hotel robe and was wiping his hair. He yawned and said, \u201cGo wash yourself up and sleep. We gotta get up early tomorrow.\u201dDi Qiuhe said in dismay, \u201cOkay...\u201d Puppy didn\u2019t wear the pajama he left in the bathroom. That was just so disappointing!The matching pajama plan failed.However, more disappointing was waiting. He Bai had already fell asleep when he finally finished his carefully cleaning. The \u201clying-on-the-same-bed-and-romantic-talks \u201c scene he was dreaming of ended without even a beginning.He looked at the quilt pile and turned off the light silently. He then pulled the quilt and lay carefully next to his lover, reaching out his hand secretly.Right after He Bai fell asleep he got woken up by his move. He turned over unconsciously and went right under his stretching arm.Di Qiuhe\u2019s body was frozen and he could feel the warmth in his arm. He relaxed his body carefully and turned his head to take a deep breath. Then he moved a bit forward more cautiously and laid his arm under that one\u2019s waist. He kissed his head buried in the pillow and closed his eyes after some breaths.That was expected to be a sleepless night, yet he went asleep so fast, and he even dreamed of one trace of warm white light.\u201cQiu, morning with kisses.\u201dDi Qiuhe opened his eyes on the first beep of the alarm. He immediately took his phone and turned it off. Seeing the one next to him still in a sound dream, he relieved and got up carefully.Not wanting to wake up anyone, he didn\u2019t even turn on any light when he was packing the bag and doing the washing. He was like a thief for the whole time.After everything was packed, he put his luggage to the doorstep first and then walked back to the bed with his socks on. He squatted down to look at He Bai\u2019s sound sleeping face and left a soft kiss on his left dimple carefully.Sweet dreams, Bai.He said silently and touched He Bai\u2019s soft hair on his forehead softly, and then he stood up and left.\u201cClick.\u201d The door was closed.He Bai knitted his eyebrows and he looked as if he was barely awake. In the end, he surrendered to the sleepiness and fell into the dark again.He slept until the next morning. He Bai looked at the greeting message sent by Di Qiuhe 30 minutes ago, massaging his forehead with eyebrows tightly knitted.He didn\u2019t even notice that Di Qiuhe got up. He didn\u2019t really sleep so tight usually.He put off his hand and called back, but only heard a turned-off notice.Maybe he had already started the shooting at that time. He put down the phone and took a deep exhale. He then pushed back the quilt and got off the bed.\u201cPadak.\u201d A little box was swept by the quilt and fell down to the ground.He stopped for a second from getting off the bed and bent down to pick up that box.Seeing the familiar ethnic style, he didn\u2019t even need to wonder who had left it.\u201cThis guy...\u201d He sighed but couldn\u2019t help smiling, and then opened the lid gently.There stood an adorable golden dog in the middle of the box, who was smirking at him. A tip was stuck on the neck of the dog, and there was an ugly camera drawn on it. So, that was a dog with a camera on his neck.Bang!He Bai\u2019s smile was replaced by grievance, he clenched his teeth and said, \u201cChildish Di, you asked for it!\u201dHe handed in the photography assignment for the new week, and Xu Yinrong gave him a nice score of 90 in satisfaction.\u201cWell done.\u201d He closed the name book and took off his reading glasses. Then he smiled and shook his head, looking at He Bai who sat there and just took an obviously relieved breath and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve made great progress, and I can tell that you are making a lot of effort. So you don\u2019t need to do any assignments for the next two weeks.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s smile was frozen for a second and he asked doubtfully, \u201cNo assignments? Then what about my daily performance...\u201d\u201cJust make up the assignments in the future.\u201d Xu Yinrong put the name book back and explained to him, \u201cI know you have got a new job and you must be really occupied. Then I am not giving you more pressure as working in the field is the best assignment for you.\u201dHe Bai was so touched and he stood up to fill his teacup and then served the tea to his teacher. He said sincerely, \u201cThank you so much, Mr. Xu. Once I finish my work I will definitely make up my assignments as fast as possible.\u201d The official Weibo account of Little Mermaid had just announced its cooperation with Jun Chen and Mr. Xu already knew it today. He even suspended his assignments. It seemed that Mr. Xu had always been following his career development, which was so diligent of him.Xu Yinrong was dumbstruck by his tea serving gesture and looked up to get the tea. He sat up and sipped the tea, then took out a red packet from his drawer to him. Xu tapped his hand and said, \u201cKeep going.\u201dHe Bai looked at the red packet in his hand and was dumbstruck, \u201cMr. Xu, what do you mean...\u201d\u201cJust take it as a gift for apprenticing.\u201d Xu Yinrong looked at his dumb stricken face, turning his serious look into a smile and said, \u201cGo to your class. I will introduce two seniors to you when we have time. When I am not available in the future, you can just go to ask them if you have any questions.\u201dListening to his words, He Bai\u2019s heart was beating faster. His eyes were filled with incredible surprises and he asked carefully after a deep breath, \u201cMr. Xu, so you mean...you want to have me for your official apprentice?\u201d As far as he knew, Xu Yinrong had said a few years ago that he would never have any more apprentices. But look what was going on now\u2026Xu Yinrong stopped smiling and looked at him with his eyebrows frowned, saying deliberately, \u201cWhat? I\u2019ve given you the apprentice gift and you think I\u2019m joking? Or...you don\u2019t want an old guy who has not many years left to live like me as your master? Fine, give me my red packet back. \u201d\u201cNo!\u201d He Bai immediately put the red packet into his bag and took a deep bow to Xu Yinrong. He prepared another cup of tea and kneeled down abruptly, and then raised the teacup above his head and said respectfully to Xu Yinrong, \u201cMaster, please have the tea.\u201dA teacher and a master were just different on the term, but their relationship was totally changed by this transition.Xu Yinrong smiled with satisfaction and drank up the tea. He then helped him get up and tapped his shoulder, saying benignly, \u201cI am old and I didn\u2019t really want to have an apprentice. But you are truly a good student and I don\u2019t want to give you to someone else. Just keep studying with all of your efforts as I don\u2019t have many years left to teach you. And I might be a bit more strict to you, so please don\u2019t blame me for that.\u201dLooking at his grey hair and the wrinkles on his face, He Bai felt a little bit sad yet he smiled even brighter and nodded vigorously, \u201cNo worries, master. I will devote myself to it and always be with you in your long-live life.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Apprenticing (3)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cSave your flattering.\u201d Xu Yinrong laughed because of him and took out a name card from the drawer to him and said, \u201cWhat a coincidence that your new job is somehow related to your second senior. If you have any doubts about your new job, just ask him for some advice. I\u2019ll talk to him and he will take good care of you.\u201dSomehow related to his new job? Could this second senior be from Jun Chen studio?He Bai was confused and looked at the name card with curiosity. His eyes opened so wide when he saw the name on it that he almost threw it away, \u201cXu, Xu Ying? Is he the one who focuses only on...ugh...\u201d\u201cYes, exactly the one who focuses only on body art photography.\u201d Talking about this apprentice, Xu Yinrong\u2019s facial expression went hard to tell. He sighed while shaking his head, \u201cHe is talented and working so hard. And he really has some talent on the portrait. But...forget about it. At least he is still on the right track and is still working on something serious. Don\u2019t worry, although he is a little bit too wild, but he is definitely not evil. He is still a good boy.\u201d\u201cOh, okay, well, I don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m not worried at all.\u201d He Bai grabbed the name card tightly and cracked a fake smile, while dripping a salty tear secretly at heart.Xu Ying...he knew him from the last life! And he couldn\u2019t have stayed farther from him!From a professional and art-appreciating perspective, Xu Ying\u2019s body photography is brilliant and beautiful and totally not erotic. But...but this dude fell in love with his body occasionally on a photography exhibition, and he said Bai was the model he had been searching for a long time. He begged Bai so hard to let him take some photos for him and it was just impossible to avoid him.In order to get away from Xu Ying, he even took his luggage and stayed a few months on a cruise. But now this dude had become his senior? \u2018This is pure tragedy and it couldn\u2019t be worse.\u2019Had he known it before he would never take the job at Jun Chen.Xu Ying, the man who was looking for beautiful bodies all over the world and insanely holding photography exhibitions, had become a photographer of Jun Chen in this life! How did this happen? Why would things go like this?Wait...there were rumors from the last life saying, Xu Ying actually had found two beautiful bodies before he met him. And they were said to be male and they were all working in the entertainment industry. Therefore, Xu Ying never spilled out a word about those two just for keeping their privacies.Yet now Xu Ying had weirdly become Jun Chen\u2019s photographer, so one of the two beautiful bodies could be\u2026His body trembled and he immediately opened his computer to search for photos from Jun Chen.He closed the webpages after two minutes with a painful look, starting to pray for Jun Chen.Xu Ying had his special taste for choosing the bodies. He was particularly fond of those people with long legs, slim bodies, fair skins and those who had different personalities than their looks. And Jun Chen had white skin, long legs with a shape of a model. He also looked a little bit cold yet gorgeous, which was right hitting on Xu Ying\u2019s G-spots.Shit...he should have never taken that fucking job!Yet despite of his unwillingness, he had already taken it. Since the Little Merimaid had already signed the contract with Jun Chen, what was expected was already on its way.The office door opened with a click. He Bai\u2019s body was frozen for a second and he looked it up to the door, trying his best to keep a calm face.\u201cJunior?\u201d There came in a tall guy with a serious face and low sound voice, yet his eyes were totally different. He looked at He Bai for three seconds and then turned to shut the door immediately. He dragged a chair and sat next to He Bai, frowning and asking him with his stereo-like voice, \u201cDo you want me to take some pictures of you, junior?\u201d\u201c...No, thanks.\u201dThat was like last life all over again. He Bai abruptly stepped back and pushed all those documents on the table to him and said quickly, \u201cThese are all the clothing pictures of Little Mermaid for this cooperation. You can check them and see if they are okay or not. If not we will do our best to make any changes. Besides, when will Mr. Jun come here? I would like to talk to him regarding the shooting for the cover page.\u201d\u201cYou can talk to me about that. I know all the requirements of Jun Chen.\u201d Xu Ying took those documents without even one single look and kept asking, \u201cDo you want to take pictures, my junior? You don\u2019t need to do full nudity, you get to keep your panties.\u201dDifferent location and time it was, but those were exactly the same lines from the last life , and especially his face and tone were god-damn the same.He Bai clenched his teeth and took out his phone from his pockets. Then he heavily struck the phone on the table and threatened him, \u201cSenior, I dare you to say that again to our master.\u201dXu Ying was shocked for a second and continued to make excuses, \u201cJunior, our master might have told you some false information before you came here, and I have to clarify that all I have photographed are just art. He might just have some misunderstanding about me.\u201d\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t. I appreciate your art too.\u201d He Bai interrupted him and replied in a more serious face, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be part of your art.\u201dXu Ying kept silent for a few seconds, refusing to take no for an answer, \u201cPeople\u2019s mind changes.\u201d\u201cNot on this matter.\u201d He Bai fought back.Xu Ying looked at him sadly.He Bai swept his clothes and said sincerely, \u201cSenior, I know the way you choose your model. I can\u2019t change my appearance and I\u2019d like to ask if there is anything contradictory in me that make you so insisted on shooting it. I will change it for sure.\u201d\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. You can never change something about your aura.\u201d Xu Ying sighed and looked at him in a complicated way, \u201cA young body with a matured soul, do you think you change something like that?\u201dHe Bai was struck and started to be vigilant, yet he slowly calmed down after that.No. Xu Ying couldn\u2019t see anything through. He didn\u2019t reborn when he tangled with him in the last life. Then what did that mean that he said so\u2026\u201cAre you saying that I look young but I am actually an old guy inside?\u201d He Bai looked at him with a poker face and grabbed his phone, \u201cSenior, don\u2019t make me become a snitch who tells things from behind.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Apprenticing (4)Translator: Sissy That WalkXu Ying looked at him deeply and sighed again, \u201cThe third one now...aye...\u201dHe Bai\u2019s mouth twitched and asked immediately, \u201cWho were the former two?\u201d\u201cJun Chen and Di. Junior...\u201dXu Ying regained his vigor and pleased him with sparkling eyes, \u201cI heard that you are quite close to that Di Qiuhe?\u201dHe Bai looked at him in surprise, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the second person you didn\u2019t convince is...\u201dXu Ying nodded and looked at him with great expectation, \u201cSince you are so close to him, can you please persuade him for me? I mean we have the same master and I can show you my personal collection if we make it.\u201dPersonal collection of a photographer who specialized on Body Art. He Bai didn\u2019t think he would like to see it.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not close to him at all. We are merely nodding acquaintances.\u201d He Bai lied naturally and looked at him in a persuasive way, \u201cSenior, there are hundreds of thousands of beautiful bodies out there, why are you refusing to let go of this one, wait, these three ones?\u201d\u201cBut these three are the most attractive...\u201d Xu Ying looked back at him in sorrow as if he was about to cry, \u201cWait, it was two. Why are you showing up here? Junior, had I known you are this type, I would, I would...\u201d\u201cYou would do what?\u201d The door was opened again, and Jun Chen stood by the door in casual wear, asking with his cold voice.\u201cI would betray our master!\u201d Xu Ying waved his arm and looked back more sadly when he realized that it was Jun Chen who was asking. He asked relentlessly after thousands of failures, \u201cJun Chen, wanna take photos?\u201dJun Chen sneered, \u201cNo. And you can just fxxk off when the contract ends.\u201dXu Ying pounded the table and said in distress, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have taken my personal collection with me that day!\u201d\u201cThank God that I saw your damn collection that day!\u201d Jun Chen pressed the throbbed veins on his forehead and stopped sneering. He looked at He Bai, stood up and walked to him. Then he reached out his hand and said politely, \u201cNice to meet you Mr. He, I am Jun Chen, and it\u2019s nice to cooperate with you.\u201dHe Bai took a look at Xu Ying who was despised by his employer yet still being disappointed at his \u201cthree trees\u201d. His mouth twitched and then he collected the documents and shook his hand while replying politely, \u201cThank you so much for your invitation, Mr. Jun. It is nice to cooperate with you.\u201dThe two of them greeted each other tacitly as if Xu Ying didn\u2019t exist.Xu Ying looked at his two loving trees in sorrow and came up with a new idea when he saw He Bai\u2019s phone on the table. He looked at the two who were starting to talk about work and secretly grabbed the phone. Then he pressed it and found out it was unlocked. His gaze sharpened and opened the contact list and found Di Qiuhe\u2019s number, and sent a message immediately. He later deleted that message from the record and put it back with a satisfactory smile.During the break on the shooting set, Wang Boyi gave Di Qiuhe his phone when he was having a rest and said in a low voice, \u201cMr. Di, the team has called and said the Qin family is up to something new again. And it seems that they are trying to have a marriage with Liu family from Dieyou Records.\u201d\u201cDieyou?\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows and scanned the network of the Liu family in his mind and smiled, \u201cThat was quite thoughtful of the Qin that they take the Liu seriously. So how is Qin Mingqiang the old fox gonna unite by marriage with the Lius? With their daughter or son?\u201d\u201cWith the daughter.\u201d Wang Boyi answered. He abruptly changed the topic when he saw some staff passing by and said in a louder voice, \u201cAssistant An has just caught a bit cold, and I will take her to get some pills. You don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201dHearing the words, those staff looked at them and sighed secretly.What a nice guy Di Qiuhe was! He was serious at acting and he had a great personality that he treated his subordinates so nice. Huangdu was just so blind that they ended the contract with such a cash cow of boundless future. Also the boss and his wife of Huangdu....tut tut tut, that\u2019s why people say nine out of ten stepmothers are evil.Those staff walked away shaking their heads. Di Qiuhe looked at Wang Boyi and curled up his lips, saying, \u201cI got what you said. Just tell them to relax because the marriage between Qin and Liu won\u2019t work. And, you can console assistant An more and tell her don\u2019t be so sensitive.\u201d\u201cThank you for your consideration. I will talk to her.\u201d Wang Boyi nodded and passed him his personal phone, saying, \u201cThe phone buzzed when you were on set, and I suppose it should be a message.\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s gaze brightened and he took the phone and waving at Wang to ask him to leave. He leaned his body so that to cover the phone screen, and then opened it when there was no one around.He Bai, \u201cI want to take a set of nude photos for you. Are you keen?\u201dDi Qiuhe got suffocated all of a sudden and pressed the phone on his chest. He opened the bottle nearby and drank half of it directly. He stood up with a blushed face and greeted Jiang Guanshan shortly, then rushed to the restroom and washed his face with cold water like crazy.How come puppy suddenly have this kind of request? It was just, just a few days that he didn\u2019t allow him to take photos secretly. And now he...nude...nude photos? How could he take that kind of photos and what if they were leaked out...But if he really wanted then it was not absolutely forbidden\u2026He looked at his sopping and blushed face in the mirror, turning back and leaning awkwardly against the sink. He then checked each compartments in the restroom carefully, and took out his phone to read the message after making sure that they were all empty.He Bai, \u201cI want to take a set of nude photos for you. Are you keen?\u201dHis eyes flashed and his fingers were rubbing the phone screen. His heart was beating so fast and his mind was rehearsing every kinds of reply.If he said yes directly, would puppy think he was too frivolous? But if he refused directly, then puppy must be really sad...so, so he should just tease him and pretend to be torn. And then accepted it reluctantly after he had got some benefits\u2026The water on his finger rubbed on the screen. He wiped it out and slid over that message which he thought was ended. There he saw the message under,He Bai, \u201cI want to take a set of nude photos for you. Are you keen? If yes, please contact number 13XXXX. He Bai\u2019s second senior, Xu Ying. P.s. My little junior He Bai finally agreed to let me take photos of him. So you don\u2019t need to worry that I might be a pervert or fraud, cause I am a real body art photographer!\u201dPadak. The water drop on his hair dropped down and smashed on his eyelid that he was forced to close his eyes.He wiped out the water on his face slowly and held the phone tight. He then took a deep breath and opened his eyes and scrolled the message all over for many times. Later on he dialed Jiang Xiuwen\u2019s number and called him. When the call was connected, he clenched his teeth and said, \u201cHelp me check out on a dude called Xu Ying! Kill him! Must kill him! Dig out his eyeballs first and then chop his hands and then kill him! How dare him to covet little Bai. I\u2019m gonna tear him up!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then scrolled down the Weibo page with while rubbing his chin. \u201cThe Xu Ying you were mentioning, is he the exclusive photographer in Jun Chen Studio, who was replaced by He Bai? Well, has your He Bai offended any classmate or hindered anyone? Why did someone say that relying on close relations with teachers, He Bai grabbed his classmates\u2019 scholarship by revising his grades through pulling strings?\u201dDi Qiuhe calmed down promptly and frowned, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Who said that? When did it happen?\u201d\u201cAn anonymous person, just now, and these slanders are updating. Let me see...Oh, there\u2019s something new. The blogger also claims that He Bai was financially supported by a rich woman, and he bullied classmates, rode on rich classmates\u2019 coattails, asocial...That\u2019 s all. There\u2019s definitely a pushing hand, otherwise, it won\u2019t go viral so fast. Jiang Xiuwen asserted, and then asked, \u201cShall I dispose it?\u201d As the saying went: Love me, love my dog. He shall undoubtedly do a favor to his friend\u2019s lover. How could he not pay back to the one who hurt the person he cared about?Di Qiuhe frowned, and he replied after a moment of pondering, \u201cLook it up first, and I have to ask XiaoBai about how to deal with it.\u201dJiang Xiuwen was stunned when he heard it, and then he said in despise, \u201cQiuhe, you\u2019re definitely going to be hen-pecked.\u201d Di was obedient to He Bai to such an extent even if he wasn\u2019t courting for He at the moment, you could only imagine when they actually became a lovebird one day. It was estimated that Di shall have no limits and boundaries when treating with He Bai and things related to He.\u201cHow can I be hen-packed?\u201d Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows and was somewhat dissatisfied. \u201cXiaoBai would never like me to call him...Anyway, never ever say the word before him. He is a man like us, and he shall be upset if he is named that way.\u201dSo was this the point?\u201c...Okay, I see. Let it be hen-pecked \u2018husband\u2019.\u201d Jiang Xiuwen responded reluctantly, realizing that he had made a terrible mistake. Di had already had no limits and boundaries to He, even if there was, it would be set by He Bai.Jun Chen grabbed the garment photo album under his arm, raised his hand to support his face, and kept his voice down, \u201cHe must be texting Di Qiuhe with your mobile phone.\u201dHe Bai looked away, nodded his head expressionlessly, grudged and calmly replied, \u201cHe is dead in my heart.\u201d Ten thousand times of torture could not setoff the fault of using his cell phone without authorization.\u201cWhen we finish talking, he will surely come to you and confess about it.\u201d Jun Chen put down his hands and leaned back in his chair to look at Xu Ying, who was trying to look like nothing had happened, then Jun Chen gritted and said. \u201cThen he will lie to you, saying that he has obtained Di Qiuhe\u2019s permission, taking advantage of his absence to fabricate lies and play dumb.\u201dHe Bai looked at Jun Chen, who unconsciously clenched his hands that seemed to be intended to beat someone, paused and asked, \u201cDid he use your phone to text your friends?\u201d\u201cNot a friend.\u201d Jun Chen squinted, giving a grim expression. \u201cIt\u2019s my cousin who just goes to high school.\u201d\u201c...\u201d The Second senior disciple of his was a real Darwin Awards\u2019 fan.\u201cSooner or later, we\u2019ll get him.\u201d Jun Chen turned his back to Xu Ying and looked away. He then lowered his head, picked up the album, and turned it over quickly. Finally, he nodded in satisfaction and said, \u201cThe Little Mermaid is so thoughtful that it provides comprehensive style of garments. There is nothing to change.\u201dAs Jun Chen got down to business, He Bai restrained his mind and answered, \u201cOnce the matter regarding to clothes come to an agreement, there will follow the formal shooting preparation period. Mr. Jun, I\u2019d like to confirm with you first that whether I should shoot the album cover or the MV cover of a song?\u201dWhen Jun Chen Studio first sought cooperation with the Little Mermaid, they simply mentioned the appointment of shooting MV cover for they only made a tentative invitation, and they did not finalize the album cover and MV cover together.He had never dealt with these things before. When he first learned about the invitation, he thought MV cover and album cover were the same thing. He\u2019d even struggled with it for a long time and believed that the common practice had been inexplicably changed somehow.Luckily, Lin Xia explained to him later that the concepts of the two covers were totally different. He then was relieved and realized that the common practice had not changed much. Jun Chen Studio would probably end up using old photos for album cover. All he had to do was shooting the MV cover.However, he was relieved too soon. When the two parties formally talked about the contract, the Jun Chen Studio demanded him to shoot all the covers needed for the album. That was why he got confused again as he could not figure out what the other party meant, so he asked the question.\u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly both the covers.\u201d Jun Chen replied, he then paused and added, \u201cBut I have a reservation option for the album cover, which means I may give up using your photos and choose another cover for the album if yours do not meet my expectation. Sorry.\u201d\u201cI understand that. And it should be so.\u201d He Bai relaxed quite a lot as he had a clear idea of the situation. He then questioned in a smile, \u201cMay I have the honor to appreciate your new album in advance before the shooting starts?\u201dHe Bai\u2019s professional attitude of asking for listening to the contents of the album, to grasp the overall tone before taking photos, pleased Jun Chen. With a slight smile, he got up and made a gesture of invitation, and then said, \u201cAs you wish, please.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201d He Bai got up and saw Xu Ying coming over. Recalling that there was such a scourge, the smile on his face froze. He frowned and took his mobile phone, lowered his voice and said, \u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later, Second senior disciple.\u201dThe guilty Xu Ying was stunned, and looked at Jun Chen involuntarily.Then Jun Chen sneered without even looking at him, opened the door and went out first.\u201cThat\u2019s the expression! Perfect! Shame that he\u2019s dressed!\u201d Xu Ying sighed again.He Bai stepped out and paused, then quickened his pace. No wonder Xu Ying was the most notorious photographer in the field. Whoever could tolerate his wicked ideas?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: A Hen-pecked \u201cHusband\u201d (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkThere were ten songs in the album. The theme song Wish expressed children\u2019s yearning for and love for their parents. The other songs were senior\u2019s love for their later generations, love between couples, and wanderers\u2019 love of their homeland. The tone of the whole album was warm and a little bit sentimental, and only the last one Pets depicted pets\u2019 love for their owners, cheerful and light-hearted, which was a relief for the whole album to some extent.Throughout the afternoon, He Bai was indulged in the music, allowing emotions to be driven by musical notes, sad and joyful at times.\u201cOur master said that the junior disciple was adept at getting the point and had broadest love in his heart. I have faith in that he\u2019s able to shoot the cover you desire.\u201d Xu Ying came out behind Jun Chen somehow, looking through the window with Jun Chen to the corner of the room, in which sat He Bai, who had headphones on. Finally, Xu Ying looked normal and soothed, \u201cI\u2019ve seen his works, which are in accord with the style of your album. You should set your mind at rest.\u201dJun Chen did not sulk this time, looked some distance away, and finally whispered back, \u201cI hope so.\u201dThe songs evoked emotions which induced memories further. He Bai, who lost his parents when he was a teenager, called to mind the warm and sweet days with his parents unwittingly. He couldn\u2019t help shedding tears, and finally came out of the room with red eyes.Jun Chen had already left, whereas Xu Ying got closer to him right away and tried to play tricks.\u201cGive it up, I will never throw you a bone by allowing you to shoot me naked, even if with an underpants on.\u201d He Bai ceased Xu\u2019s wishful thinking before he spoke out, then grabbed his collar and pressed him against the wall. Then He raised his fist in a threatening way, and asked faintly, \u201cIs my mobile phone fun to play with, Second senior disciple?\u201dXu Ying was so frightened that he started to hit the wall. \u201cJun Chen, you betrayed me!\u201dHe Bai began to fondle him.Xu Ying, like a frightened girl who was assaulted, with a manly stern look, crossed his chest and eluded, then exclaimed, \u201cWhat are you doing, Little Brother? We are fellow disciples, you, you can\u2019t harbor malicious intentions to me. It\u2019s incest!\u201d\u201cFull of lust and pornography! Behave yourself!\u201d He Bai picked up Xu\u2019s cell phone from his pocket, squinted to find Xu Yinrong\u2019s number, typed and sent a quick text message, then gave the phone back and patted Xu Ying on the shoulder in smile. \u201cWell, you shall know the feeling of your phone being fiddled with by others.\u201d Then He Bai walked away, leaving him a grim figure.Xu Ying was stupefied and then turned on his phone to the short message page.Xu Ying: Master, I\u2019d like to take naked photos of the senior disciple. Would you please intercede for me?\u201cOh no! Master hates me to caste eyes at close relations. How could you...\u201d He fell into breakdown and couldn\u2019t help beating the wall.At this time, his mobile phone rang. It was Xu Yinrong.His hands trembled, his heart rate grew faster after a sudden tremble, his forehead broke out into cold sweat, and he walked around in anxiousness.\u201cBy the way.\u201d He Bai came back, smiled and reminded Xu, \u201cI have texted master with my phone, telling him that you are only working here because you are up for no good for Jun Chen. And unfortunately, you have been denounced and will soon be fired. Second senior disciple, it\u2019s the time to fend for yourself.\u201d\u201cWhat! How can you be such an asshole!\u201dXu Ying came to a halt. He was dying for digging a hole to bury himself at this point.The ring ceased, and then rang again. Xu gritted and answered, \u201cHello...No, no, no, master, listen to me...No, no, I haven\u2019t compelled anybody or take secret photos...Please! I was wrong! I refuse to repent to Big Brother!\u201dThe day was getting shorter in the early autumn. Jun Chen was in a daze, sitting in a rattan chair on the balcony of the second floor of the studio, at the time when He Bai came to him.He Bai gave a sign to stop staff from informing Jun Chen, and glanced at the music scores and some old photos scattered on the table beside. Then he found a suitable angle, set the camera ready and adjusted the light. Finally, he pressed the shutter.Click.Jun Chen came back to earth and looked back.He Bai pressed the shutter again, shooting the way Jun Chen looked back in doubt, then put down the camera and smiled at him. He Bai went over and turned over the old photos on the table, picked out the one had been selected as the album cover in his previous life, and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201dJun Chen looked at the photo, paused, and answered, \u201cMy parents.\u201d\u201cYour parents?\u201d He Bai was puzzled. He looked at the photo in which only stood one person and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the other one?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my father, he\u2019s taking photos.\u201d Jun Chen smiled and yearned. \u201cThere were many hills in my hometown. My mother loved flower, and she often went for a walk in the hills after dinner. My father worried about her so much that he accompanied her every time... He borrowed a camera from a neighbor, and this photo was taken by my father before the landslide accident.He Bai was affected, looked down at the pretty lady in a long skirt, who was bending down to pluck flowers, then moved his eyes to the overcast sky in the photo, and stayed mute for a few seconds for he felt sorry about the accident.\u201cI was studying abroad and longed to see them, thus I requested them to take some photos to send to me... It was because of me that they went up the hill in that gloomy day.\u201d The sentiment of attachment to his parents was replaced by bitterness and guilt, then Jun Chen said in a lower voice. \u201cFor the sake of showing me at their best, they specially wore their favorite clothes and borrowed a technical camera from neighbor...\u201dThe sun was about to set in the west and the sky was covered with sunglow.He Bai looked at Jun Chen, who was sideways on the setting sun. He Bai recalled how he kept reading his parents\u2019 text messages for comfort, and then an impulsive thought came into his mind. He suggested, \u201cMr. Jun, let\u2019s sweep the tombs.\u201dJun Chen was stunned. \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d\u201cWell, where are your parents buried?\u201d\u201cOn the hill of my hometown, they loved it there...\u201dHe Bai bowed his head to pack up the music scores and old photo. \u201cIs your hometown in C province?\u201d He then asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: A Hen-pecked \u201cHusband\u201d (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkJun Chen nodded while he could not keep up with He, then he hesitated, \u201cRight now? The air tickets and high-speed rail tickets may be sold out at this time...\u201d\u201cThen go by train.\u201d He Bai put the music scores and old photo into Jun Chen\u2019s hands and smiled, \u201cAirport was only available in several major cities in the days when your parents escorted you away from your home to study, and there was no high-speed railway station. You had left your parents by train, why don\u2019t you go back to them the same way now?Jun Chen\u2019s heart sank, then he lowered his head, looking at the old photo on the music scores.Perhaps he was moved by He Bai, or it was the emotional backlog from creating the album that finally reached the critical point, or it was the opportunity he finally got to face up to the pains and guilt buried in his heart along these years...\u201cFine.\u201d He nodded, gripped his hands slowly, and looked up at He Bai with his red-rimmed eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go back by train. I\u2019m gonna visit them.\u201dThey took leave without delay, despite the studio\u2019s work or next day\u2019s classes. They drove to the railway station, and finally got on the train to C province when night fell.The train travelled slow, and it was a torture to them. To Jun Chen, however, the several hours passed were the most peaceful moments in his mind over the years.He took with him the music scores and the old photo. Seeing that there were few people in the carriage, he came to a more quite place and told He Bai about the past in detail.He Bai opened his ears to listen and snapshot from time to time, trying to be an ideal listener and recorder.They took a taxi later, and then went on foot. Jun Chen detoured to buy some flowers, but when he got to the foot of the hill, he loathed these stereotyped flowers, which had been carefully cultivated. \u201cMother won\u2019t like it.\u201d He thought. Then he gave it to He Bai, and plucked the wildflowers by the roadside. Finally, he bunched it up in a clumsy way.At dawn, along the bumpy mountain road, they finally arrived at the two graveyards that were adjacent to each other on the hillside. The graveyards had been watched by specially-assigned person, because it looked neat and tidy without weeds around.Jun Chen halted at ten steps away. He flattened the wrinkles in his shirt, groomed his hair, and then proceeded with flowers carefully.He Bai sensibly stopped, and then he looked around to seek a place where he would not bother Jun Chen, waiting in peace.It was a misty morning in the hill, with dew on the grass-blade. Jun Chen, who was on the go overnight, somewhat dispirited after casting off his daily glamorous appearance. However, only before his parents, Jun Chen could find the true self.He bowed his head at the gravestones, standing and whispering, with the flowers in his hands. Somehow he had not put it down.The sun was rising while the fog dispersing. When the first ray of sunlight broke through the thick fog and shone on the gravestones, Jun Chen, who had kept mute for long, stooped down and placed the bouquet at last.Click.The scene was fixed.At this time, Jun Chen, who was stooping down to present flowers in front of the tombstone, overlapped with the pretty lady, who was plucking flowers in the old photo. One of them dressed up to console her homesick son and the other came back to his parents regardless of the hardships of travel and his personal image, only because he missed them.It was all about love.In the morning breeze, He Bai put down the camera, laid the delicate flowers handed over by Jun Chen on the grass land, and fell back two steps and laid on his stomach. He then took a photo through the gap of the flowers, of which Jun Chen was sitting and playing the harmonica before the tombstone.It was noon when they went down the hill. He Bai was scolded by roommate through phone call, while Jun Chen received urgent calls from assistant. They looked at each other and said nothing, then rushed to the airport without any delay and bought tickets to B city.In the evening, He Bai handed over the album cover he had edited. Most part of the old photo was the same, as he had only edited some defects. On the back side of the cover, Jun Chen stood in the rising morning twilight, bending over to the tombstone to lay a bouquet. It was covered with flowers where the new and the old photo overlapped, and there were some butterflies or things like that dancing to the music played by Jun Chen.Ten minutes later, He Bai received a short message with a simple \u201cthank you\u201d from Jun Chen. He Bai knew that his cover had been adopted. He was content for his work, however, he was long-awaited by his roommates, who went into madness upon seeing him.\u201cXiaoBai, you\u2019re screwed! How could you skip classes!\u201d Niu Junjie rushed to him and shook him on the shoulder. \u201cDo you know someone is smearing you online? Everyone is waiting for your response, but you skipped classes. With this misstep, they are abusing you even more now! And some fence-sitters are wondering whether you\u2019re the bastard described in the gossip!\u201dWang Hu frowned and raged, then he inferred, \u201cIt must be our classmate who initiated the slander, because he knows XiaoBai well. And it\u2019s impossible for others to know that much.\u201dChen Jie calmed down and analyzed, \u201cIt mentioned the scholarship at the very beginning. Thus I suspect that XiaoBai was the block to the person who failed to get the scholarship, while Huang Wei was the only one in our class who didn\u2019t get the scholarship because of XiaoBai.\u201d\u201cI knew it was that son of a bitch!\u201d Niu Junjie released He Bai and rolled sleeves in anger. \u201cHe called me a good-for-nothing 2G Rich, fxxk him!\u201dWang Hu soothed him right away. \u201cCalm down. We may be recorded a demerit for fight!\u201dChen Jie urged either, \u201cLaoSan, it\u2019s unwise. It would be better to ask the counselor to handle the affair, because we are the victim of the incident now. If we resort to fisticuff, we\u2019ll be the villain who are in the wrong and ashamed into anger to revenge. Other classmates know XiaoBai well, thus they don\u2019t believe the stories at all, while only the netizens who have no idea of the truth are tricked.He Bai was confused, he tried to digest the information in their words and made a conclusion, then he was surprised, \u201cHuang Wei slandered me online? When?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: A Hen-pecked \u201cHusband\u201d (4)Translator: Sissy That WalkThe three paused, looking at him at the same time. Then, after realizing the doubts shining through He Bai\u2019s eyes, they couldn\u2019t help rushing to him, and became even more furious. \u201cWhile we\u2019re scratching our head in anxiousness about how to counterattack the nasty snobs, you have no idea of the ferocious battle online! \u201cDo you want to piss us off?\u201dHe Bai hurriedly begged for mercy, picked up his cell phone at the same time. Then a number of notifications above the screen came to his eyes just as he was about to open Weibo.\u201cWell, why are there so many unanswered and unread notifications?\u201dThe other three who were rubbing him looked at his screen then. They recalled what the guy here had done, including stayed out while lost contact all night, and how he skipped classes today. Everything he had done had crossed the limits of their endurance. Finally, they pressed him to the ground and hammered him.How irritating! A workaholic like him, sparing no attention on other matters, should leave school early than others once they got enough credits!Ten minutes later, He Bai hid in the bathroom with messy hair. First of all, he called Xu Yinrong to justify himself about his work and missed classes. Next, he opened all the missed calls and messages, looking through ten lines at a glance. He was relieved to find it all from his roommates and Di Qiuhe. Finally, he called Di Qiuhe back.\u201cYou are calling back finally?\u201d The call got through at once, but Di Qiuhe was...\u201cI couldn\u2019t get in touch with you all day and night, huh?\u201dDi Qiuhe had a soft and pleasant voice, talking in a relaxed and calm tone. And he tended to elongate his last syllable, which made him sound like he was careless about everything, but that was attractive and seductive...Even Di did not speak out, He Bai knew that this guy was angry, very much.\u201cWell.\u201d He cleared his throat and softened his voice, explained, \u201cI was busy with my work today, and my phone was in my backpack, that\u2019s why...\u201d\u201cSaint Elephant.\u201d Di interrupted him.He Bai was stunned. \u201cWhat?\u201d Why did he mention Saint Elephant suddenly?\u201cThe person who slandered you online is Huang Wei. He\u2019s your classmate. It\u2019s Jin Cheng, boss of Saint Elephant, who assisted him make the post hot. But this is only the first step. Then Jin Cheng is about to ask one of the receptionists of the Saint Elephant to frame you that once she was sexually harassed by you. They intended to smear you thoroughly.He Bai was startled. How long had he left the Saint Elephant? Why did the boss who he had never met hate him so much? Why? Just because of the Jia family?\u201cLiu Huanhuan wants to meddle and intervene in, but I have already let Xiuwen find a way to warn her. She dares not do anything.\u201d Di Qiuhe continued, his voice became fainter and calmer. \u201cYou told me to focus on shooting, I obeyed; You told me to keep early hours, I obeyed; You told me not to deliver you anything, I obeyed. Whereas I told you to behave better in B city, you went MIA and played traunt. Pup, I\u2019m incensed.\u201d Di hang up the phone the moment he finished talking.\u201cHello? No, Qiu...\u201d\u201cDu, du, du\u201d\u201c...\u201dHe Bai stared at the screen of his mobile phone and imagined Di Qiuhe hanging up the phone with a sour face. That was really a headache to him.\u201cI\u2019m screwed. Childish Di gets angry. It\u2019s my doomsday!\u201d He Bai thought.There came a knocking sound.\u201cXiaoBai, are you constipated? What\u2019s taking you so long? Do you need glycerine enema? Niu Junjie said outside the bathroom. He then sighed in earnest, just like a parent who regretted after punishing his disobedient children, \u201cXiaoBai, we\u2019re not bullyragging you on purpose, it\u2019s just that your behavior last night went too far.\u201d Everyone was worried about you. Don\u2019t worry, we will face up to the slanders online with you, those are just rumors, our classmates know you very well. Take it easy.\u201dHe Bai, felt warm in the heart yet speechless at the same time, picked up his phone and opened the door. He took a look at the three concerned roommates outside, sighed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have worried you. Don\u2019t care about the slanders. I\u2019ll manage it right away.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Niu Junjie was stunned. \u201cThat\u2019s it? Do you have any idea?He Bai nodded, rubbing his hands and clenching his fists, and sneered, \u201cQuite a lot.\u201d Huang Wei, Saint Elephant, you were definitely playing with fire with your intrigues and plots.Turned on the computer, He Bai logged on to the Campus Network first, and checked his academic achievements in each semester and screenshot the records. Then he opened his personal email box, and screenshot the photo-editing correspondence had sent to Saint Elephant during part-time employment there. Next he turned to the short message page on the phone to screenshot his monthly salary notification text. Finally, he called Xu Yinrong to ask for the roster record of the students\u2019 grade registration, screenshot and pixelated the irrelevant names, and RARed them together with the rest screenshots.The other three gaped at him doing all this.\u201cWhat else is there online besides revising my grades, vying for scholarships and being a boy toy?\u201d He Bai opened his Weibo, ignored the influx of comments and private messages, and uploaded screenshots one by one, while asking his roommates without even looking back.\u201cBullying classmates?\u201d Niu Junjie recalled blankly.Wang Hu looked at He and added, \u201cRiding on rich classmates\u2019 coattails.\u201dChen Jie set right his glasses and said. \u201cAsocial, uncooperative, and immoral. Besides, you skipped classes.\u201dHe Bai nodded to show that he caught on, started typing and humming, \u201cHow ridiculous Huang Wei is! No one in our class has not revising the grades of homework, and he has done it twice. In addition, the scholarship is evaluated by our teacher and issued by the school. How can I vie for it? He must have forgotten what the counselor had warned him last time. He doesn\u2019t even know why he doesn\u2019t have scholarship. He deserves to be a cat\u2019s paw.\u201cMost netizen thought the revision of homework is quite normal, the most talked one is that you\u2019re being a boy toy.\u201d Chen Jiewei frowned and said, \u201cIt took only a few months for you from a Saint Elephant\u2019s retoucher to the Yi Ka apperal\u2019s garment photographer, and it happened that both of the person in charge who recruited you were women, thus Huang Wei...\u201d\u201cScrew him and his dirty mind.\u201d He Bai checked the edited content once, rectified the wrong word, and clicked on Send. Then he looked back at his three roommates and smiled, \u201cWell, the troubles online have been settled. Would you like to have a night snack? It\u2019s my treat.\u201dThey looked at each other and suspended thinking about the annoyances online, nodded and echoed, \u201cOf course, barbecue or kebab?\u201dDuring having night snack, He Bai texted Di Qiuhe multiple times, but got no response. He wanted to call but was afraid of distract Di from filming. Gradually, he became restless.It was strange for him. After all, there were few things in the world could disturb him.\u201cHa-ha-ha, now the table has turned for Huang Wei after only an hour or so! It serves him right! \u201cNiu Junjie took his cell phone, laughed and patted on his thigh frantically. He was overjoyed to the extent that he almost overturned the barbecue tray. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius! XiaoBai. As soon as your salary screenshot is sent out, comparing with the photo-editing quantity during employment, the netizen are shocked. They express that talented and hardworking like you are, you ought to live like you\u2019re supported by someone!He Bai widened the distance from Niu with the phone, and then poured him a glass of iced orange juice. \u201cDrink it and calm down.\u201dNiu Junjie ignored and kept on leafing through the webpage. He was even more hysterical when he saw something else. \u201cHa-ha-ha, the monitor told Huang Wei to keep his phone on, because counselor would like to have a talk with him tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cLet him be.\u201d Wang Hu patted He Bai on the shoulder and pulled the barbecue tray inward. \u201cHe has suppressed all day and night. I\u2019m afraid he may wreak Huang Wei if we don\u2019t let him abreact.\u201d\u201cHe gets what he deserves! Sooner or later, I\u2019ll sack him up!\u201d Niu Junjie looked up and responded unexpectedly, then looked down at his cell phone, bursting with laughter. \u201cThis netizen are right on! He Bai makes decent money now, and it happens that the client he is working for is a fashion brand. What\u2019s wrong with him wearing some expensive clothes? It\u2019s pure jealousy! How could Huang gossip his own classmate! A skilled liar as he, he would certainly do well if he is a tabloid editor, and he\u2019s definitely a dissipation of national education resources!\u201dHe Bai packed up his phone and decided to invite LaoSan to have a few more night snack, because he was deeply touched by LaoSan\u2019s reaction.On the filming set, Di Qiuhe finished today\u2019s workload. He took over his personal phone from Wang Boyi on his way back to room. He then opened the door and clicked his screen, looking through casually.There were more than 20 unread messages from He Bai! Never happened before! An unprecedented grace! It was outright unreasonable!He stood at the door, keeping the motion of pushing the door with one hand and clicking the phone with the other, numbed for half a minute.\u201cChildish Di?\u201d Wang Boyi, who lived in the room next to Di\u2019s, seeing him keeping his body unmoved, tempted and reminded in earnest, \u201cYou\u2019d better take an early rest as we\u2019ll fly to D zone tomorrow.\u201dDi Qiuhe was surprised like wakening from a dream. He looked at Wang in an unfathomable expression, nodded and opened the door in a weird and prudent manner.Bang.The door was shut.Wang Boyi frowned with doubts.The way Childe Di just walked...as though he was strutting?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: Getting into a Dispute (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe leaned against the door and bowed to browse over the texts before the light was turned on.He Bai: Are you really mad at me?He Bai: Sorry for worrying you.He Bai: I've been working all the day, so I set my phone to vibration mode and put it into the bag, thus not knowing you\u2019ve texted me.He Bai: I skipped class and paid a visit to C Province together with a client.\u2026He Bai: The problem online was resolved. Thank you for helping find out the truth.\u2026He Bai: Are you still on the set? Get some rest when it\u2019s finished.Di Qiuhe examined these texts over and over again, his expression keeping changing. Considering that Little Puppy was sincere in what he was saying, he eventually accepted his apology. Letting out a smiling groan, Di Qiuhe put on the light, walked to the bedside and reclined on the pillow, slowly typing: I just finished my work and will fly to D district tomorrow. I\u2019m relieved that you are aware of your mistake. Be a good boy, Little Puppy, or I\u2019ll\u2026His phone beeped. Another text message came.He Bai: You must be knocking off this time, aren\u2019t you? Still angry?He Bai: Are you going to work at D district? I have couple days off for National Day holiday. Shall I go to see you?Di Qiuhe sat bolt upright, stared at these two texts for about ten seconds, deleted the words he already edited and gave He Bai a call immediately. No sooner did he get through than he began to talk, \u201cLittle Puppy, I hope you aren\u2019t lying to me! See you on October 1st!\u201dDi Qiuhe finished talking before He Bai said \u201chello\u201d, which made him burst into laughter. Di Qiuhe was so easy to be content that a little sop filled him with childlike delight.Peals of gentle laughter came in a seemingly affectionate way when Di Qiuhe felt his ears were somehow burning. He raised his eyebrows and tried hard to appear fierce, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny? It\u2019s you who made a mistake, so you\u2019re supposed to make an apology! And, it\u2019s necessary to\u2026 to give some compensation!\u201cOkay. I was wrong, and thank you for forgiving me. You\u2019re so magnanimous.\u201d He Bai coaxed Di whiling checking photos he had taken today, \u201cIt's not a lie. D district is very close to my hometown, so I can also go home to mourn for my parents after seeing you... Hey, wait a minute.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s smile faded when he had the picture enlarged. He frowned unconsciously, tried to distinguish the two women who appeared in the corner of the picture, and asked hesitantly, \u201cQiuhe, is there any relative of your family or Qin family in C Province?\u201dAt the very beginning, Di Qiuhe was delighted that He Bai would come to D district, but his joy was replaced by an indescribable nerviness when He Bai said he was about to go home to visit his parents\u2019 tomb. Before he figured out why, he was, however, told to \u201cwait a minute\u201d, which put him on tenterhooks. He thought He Bai might go back on his words\u2026 Unexpectedly, the guy only asked him a question.Having experienced an up-and-down physiological activity, Di Qiuhe strangely calmed down and answered, \u201cNo, there isn\u2019t. Why do you ask me this?\u201dHaving the phone wedged under his chin, He Bai quickly searched the Web for Qin Li\u2019s photo, made a meticulous comparison between two pictures and then replied, \u201cI\u2019m organizing the photos I took at the airport of C Province today, only to find that there\u2019s a woman who bears a striking resemblance to your stepmother in the corner of one picture. What\u2019s more, she is accompanied by a teenage girl, who I suspect is your sister Di Chunhua. I\u2019ll send you the photo. Turn on your computer and make sure whether they are your stepmother and sister or not.\u201dDi Qiuhe was surprised, for things were beyond his expectation. He slightly frowned, answered \u2018yes\u2019 and turned on the computer.One minute later, He Bai sent the photo over. Di Qiuhe followed his instructions to enlarge its right lower part and saw at a glance Qin Li and Di Chunhua carrying luggage among the crowd.\u201cAre they your stepmother and younger sister?\u201d asked He Bai.\u201cYes, they are.\u201d Di Qiuhe\u2019s brows furrowed when he tried to figure out why they went to C Province. Suddenly something flashed through his mind. He strode toward the wardrobe, knocked the suitcase down and took out several business plans from the interlayer that Di Bian had given him. Di Qiuhe flipped through one of them and couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cLittle Puppy, you are really my lucky star.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He Bai asked, looking puzzled.A smile spread across Di Qiuhe\u2019s face. He stood up, took the plan to the bedside and sat down, looking out of the window at the night sky. A smirk emerged on his face when he answered in a low voice, \u201cThe couple who always makes a public display of affection eventually gets into a dispute.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to send you a present, Little Puppy.\u201d Di Qiuhe stopped smirking immediately, as if he had always been serious.\u201cDon\u2019t go crazy.\u201dDi Qiuhe browsed through the business plan and asked happily, \u201cWould you like D district\u2019s specialty or jade from the border?\u201d\u201c\u2026 No, thanks, I just want to know what you laughed at.\u201d\u201cWell, I'll send you both.\u201d Di Qiuhe made the final decision when he closed the document.He Bai frowned but asked patiently, \u201cWhat did those two go to C Province for? For travel?\u201d\u201cDo you want to know?\u201d Di Qiuhe\u2019s voice was soft and gentle.\u201cYes, I do.\u201d He Bai replied. There was a blank expression on his face.\u201cThen beg me.\u201d Di Qiuhe got cocky.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cOr call me \u2018sweet\u2019 and say goodnight to me.\u201d There was joy in his voice.He Bai kept silent for seconds, then took a deep breath and roared, \u201cGo to hell! I\u2019m not leaving for D district! I\u2019ll work an extra shift on National Day! Goodbye!\u201dHis voice rose to such a deafening pitch that Di Qiuhe shook like a leaf and unconsciously moved the mobile phone away. After he moved it back, Di Qiuhe dared not tease He Bai, explaining, \u201cI was only kidding, Bai. My stepmother went to C Province because\u2026\u201d\u201cBeep\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDi Qiuhe was dumbfounded. He put down the cell phone and carefully dialed He Bai\u2019s number again.\u201cSorry, the subscriber you dialed is power off.His heart sank.Di Qiuhe stood for several seconds, his head bowed. He searched out Jiang Xiuwen's number, dialed it and asked in a shrill tone, \u201cI got on Bai\u2019s nerves. He switched off the phone and told me he wouldn\u2019t come to D area to see me. Now what?\u201dJiang Xiuwen: \u201c\u2026 You can go to hell.\u201dHis words drove Di Qiuhe to despair.Having had a sound sleep, He Bai turned on his phone, only to find that Di Qiuhe sent him more than 30 text messages last night and that the last one was sent over at 1 a.m.He frowned and typed hard: Sleep early next time, or I\u2019ll give you a thrashing!\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s text came immediately: Just this once, sir.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: Getting into a Dispute (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkIt was quite surprising that Di Qiuhe should learn to act like a good boy. He Bai\u2019s face turned less clouded. He flipped through those texts and forgave the guy for his smugness yesterday, typing to ask: What are you going to do with it?Di Qiuhe: Report to my father accurately, letting them fight like cat and dog.Recalling the chaotic situation in his family, He Bai frowned and replied: Remember not to put yourself into trouble.Di Qiuhe: Don\u2019t worry. I can handle it.Entertainment company as it was, Huangdu sat its foot in some hot lucrative industries, such as real estate of C Province, which was a gold mine they had been coveting. The business plans Di Bian gave Di Qiuhe were about programs that Qin family strongly supported in Huangdu, and the reason behind lied in the fact that Di Bian hoped Di Qiuhe could ruin those programs at the right opportunity so that Qin family had little say in how Huangdu was runIt was obvious that Di Bian resolved to drive Qin family out of Huangdu despite the cost, in which his dissatisfaction with Qin family was fairly manifested.And now, Qin Li who was supposed to take a holiday with his daughter abroad actually appeared at the airport of C Province without Di Bian\u2019s permission, and Qin\u2019s staffers seemed to follow her, which deserved rumination.Considering that Qin family hoped to form a matrimonial alliance with Liu family recently, Di Qiuhe made an informed guess: Qin Li was quite dissatisfied with Di Bian, so her calculations changed accordingly. Previously, she made every effort to push Di Qiuhe aside so that she could achieve compete dominance in Huangdu and they four could live a happy life. However, she now aimed at appropriating Di\u2019s belongings to back Qin family, involving Qin family in entertainment business by means of matrimonial tie to compete against Huangdu, and finally living a happy life with her two children.That was to say, Qin Li excluded Di Bian from her future planning and saw he as an enemy now.\u201cDoes he work for Qin Mingqiang?\u201d Di Qiuhe pointed at the man in the corner of the photo who stood five meters away from Qin Li and asked Assistant An.\u201cDefinitely, he...\u201d An Xixi cast a sidelong glance at Wang Boyi, biting her lip and replying, \u201cHe\u2019s my ex-boyfriend\u2019s uncle. Although he holds a rather lowly position in Qin\u2019s Company, the man was in fact a trusted subordinate of Elder Master Qin.\u201dHer words brought no reaction from Wang Boyi, who stayed calm and didn\u2019t seem to care her former cheating. \u201cYour ex-boyfriend appeared to have every confidence in you by telling you this.\u201d Di Qiuhe tapped the photo and paid no heed to An Xixi who went stiff with embarrassment. Then he looked at Wang Boyi and said, \u201cGo to tell my father that I\u2019ve received a photo on which there occurred Qin Li, and you caught sight of her accidentally.\u201d\u201cYes, Master Di.\u201d Wang Boyi complied respectfully.Seeing Wang Boyi even hated the sight of her, An Xixi bowed her head, dejected.After two assistants left, Di Qiuhe picked up his phone, found out a number he hadn\u2019t rung for a long time and dialed it.\u201cHello, who\u2019s speaking?\u201d A husky, gravelly male voice came.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Uncle Ke.\u201d Di Qiuhe walked to the window and went straight to the point, \u201cStrife between Huangdu and Qin family has begun. It\u2019s high time Huading had its day by targeting the real estate of C Province.\u201dAfter a brief silence, an infectious laughter came, \u201cAwesome! I can\u2019t imagine this day will come so soon. Qiuhe, you\u2019re much more determined and industrious than I expected.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Di Qiuhe looked back at the golden dog on the table which was seemingly one of the pair with that he gave He Bai and flashed a smile, \u201cI\u2019m just luckier than you expected.\u201dBy late September, He Bai almost finished his work at Jun Chen\u2019s Studio.\u201cYou\u2019ve had a long tiring month.\u201d Jun Chen poured He Bai a cup of scented tea and reclined in a rattan chair. Bathed in the afternoon sun, his arresting appearance seemed not so striking as before. Instead, there occurred an air of fairyism on him. \u201cThere\u2019s only one MV cover left. Time flies, doesn\u2019t it?\u201dSince the trip to C Province, the two struck up a friendship and talked more openly.\u201cDo you think I won\u2019t ask you for a red packet when you say so?\u201d teased He Bai. He rubbed his shoulders, took a sip of the tea and heaved a sigh of relief, asking, \u201cWhy I haven\u2019t seen Xu Ying these days? Where did he go?Speaking of this man, Jun Chen became grim-faced and turned his head, replying coldly, \u201cHe went somewhere to take pictures.\u201d\u201cTake pictures?\u201d He Bai got puzzled and sounded him out after a brief silence, \u201cHas he had a new target?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Jun Chen answered with no emotion, \u201cHe\u2019s bound to leave here sooner or later, thus necessarily finding another way out. Maybe it\u2019s good for both of us, for his ideal life is nothing more than to take photos he likes and hold lively photo exhibitions, while the boring and regular shooting work here will surely get him bored, which I\u2019m not glad to see. How about you? Would you like to join my studio and succeed him as my exclusive photographer?\u201dHaving worked together with Jun Chen for these days, He Bai found that he was the sort of person who seemed difficult to get along with but in fact cherished friendships greatly. Aware that Jun Chen was only kidding, He Bai smiled and shook his head, replying, \u201cNo, thanks. I like to photograph different people, so it\u2019s unlikely for me to stay at a regular place and shoot one person only.\u201dJun Chen cracked a faint smile and sighed, \u201cYou two are quite alike in your disposition\u2014both unwilling to shoot only one person\u2026 Well, it\u2019s not a bad thing. At least, we can keep a feeling of freshness for each other and have cooperation later.\u201dHearing his words, He Bai cast a sidelong glance at him and shifted the topic, \u201cIs the pet model for tomorrow\u2019s MV ready? I hope it isn\u2019t a big dog which is difficult to get along with, in case neither the director nor I could handle it.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s ready.\u201d Jun Chen took a mouthful of tea and added, \u201cYou may rest assured that it\u2019s a docile dog which has shooting experience. So you\u2019ll have no problem in taking photos of it. By the way, could you give me a hand to create some hype for the album?\u201dHe Bai paused and then asked with puzzlement, \u201cHow? What can I do for you?\u201dJun Chen raised his eyebrows and said smilingly, \u201cI heard that you were vilified on the Internet a few days ago. Although you clarified what the truth was, things that happened between you and your former company were dug up, which flooded our screen for many days. Would you mind me, a has-been singer, creating some hype for my album with the aid of your popularity?\u201dHe Bai was amused and answered, \u201cDefinitely not. Just do whatever you want.\u201dBased on his place in the entertainment world, there\u2019s no need for Jun Chen to ride on He Bai\u2019s coattail. Instead, he intended to take the opportunity to help clarify why He Bai skipped class that day. In addition, it would inevitably raise He Bai\u2019s profile in the entertainment industry and pave the way for his future development!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: Getting into a Dispute (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkLater on, when those Z-list celebrities sent him invitation letters, He Bai could turn them down in Jun Chen\u2019s name and didn\u2019t need to trouble Little Mermaid.Above all, Jun Chen was taking a bit of a risk in inviting him, one who had a half-negative image online, to help promoting the album. How loyal and generous he was!After receiving the news from Wang Boyi, Di Bian flew to D district in person and met Di Qiuhe secretly, of which Qin Li had absolutely no inkling.\u201cWhat\u2019s it all about?\u201d Di Bian asked directly without inquiring after Di Qiuhe.Glancing at people following Di Bian, Di Qiuhe feigned a hesitant and worried look. He took out enlarged photos from the backpack, handed them to Di Bian and said after a hesitation, \u201cDad, you must know I made the acquaintance of a junior schoolmate months ago and had a good relationship with him. He worked at Yi Ka. The other day, he went with Jun Chen, a singer, to C province... The photos were taken by him accidentally at the airport. You can have a look.\u201dDi Bian took the photos and browsed them through, his brows furrowed. He turned around to hand them to his subordinates, looked at Di Qiuhe and questioned him, \u201cSince they\u2019re taken several days ago, why don\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201dDi Qiuhe slightly drooped his eyes, as if upset by Di Bian\u2019s tone of voice, and replied, \u201cI haven\u2019t noticed before that there are Aunt Qin and Chunhua in the pictures. It\u2019s Assistant Wang who spotted them and reminded me of it. Later on, he told me that Aunt Qin originally said she would go on holiday abroad with Chunhua. I felt that something was amiss, so I... Dad, even Assistant Wang can get in contact with you, but I can't. I really feel a bit defeated.\u201d Speaking of this, Di Qiuhe gave a self-mocking smile and threw his head back, without looking at Di Bian.At this time, Di Bian\u2019s subordinates finished checking the photos and signaled at Di Bian from under the table that these pictures were neither retouched nor faked.Di Bian\u2019s face fell, and at the same time his suspicion of Di Qiuhe was allayed. Seeing him look sad, Di Bian felt a paternal love well up within him. His expression became less stern when he said in a gentle voice, \u201cYou are busy with your acting career, so I dare not visit you at any time, in case I disturbed you. The only thing I can do is to ask Assistant Wang to take good care of you. I was wrong. Forgive me, Qiuhe. Now our family was about to fall apart, while Xia Song stayed abroad who I can\u2019t count upon. As for Chunhua, she has been at odds with me for your Aunt Qin led her astray. Both the company and the family were in a terrible mess, I...\u201d\u201cDad,\u201d Di Qiuhe interrupted him. Seeing Di Bian softened towards him and seemed partial to him, Di Qiuhe seized the opportunity and changed his attitude, soothing him, \u201cthings may not be as bad as you expected. Perhaps Aunt Qin felt it troublesome to go abroad and thus took Chunhua with her to have a trip at home. Last time Chunhua was seriously told off on the Internet. Rest and relaxation can do good to her.\u201d\u201cYou are too simple to be on the alert for your family, Qiuhe.\u201d Di Bian shook his head and sighed, \u201cDo you remember those business plans I handed you last time? Qin Li headed for C Province secretly to help Qin family scramble for programs from Huangdu. Her heart hasn\u2019t been in our family.\u201d\u201cHow come she...\u201d Di Qiuhe looked pretty shocked.\u201cI did nothing but sacked a few idlers who worked for Qin family from Huangdu... How could she treat me in this way and disappoint me bitterly?\u201d A look of sullen resentment appeared on Di Bian\u2019s face. He dropped his shoulder as if an old man, \u201cNo doubt that she intends to rob Huangdu to pay Qin family. Deep in her heart, she doesn\u2019t see herself as member of Di family any more...\u201dDi Qiuhe seemed deeply shocked by the news and couldn\u2019t say anything at all.\u201cTherefore, Qiuhe, we can\u2019t allow Huangdu to collapse and Qin family to tower over it.\u201d Seeing Di Qiuhe in a trance, Di Bian grasped the opportunity to have him brainwashed. He sat bolt upright and slightly approached him, coaxing in a deep voice, \u201cYou must be on my side, Qiuhe! It\u2019s quite difficult for me to make any move in B City, and I have no one to rely upon but you. We can give up the business in C Province, but it can\u2019t be captured by Qin family! Qiuhe, I\u2019m getting old. Help me defend our home, please.\u201dDi Qiuhe was profoundly moved, his expression keeping changing. Pondering it over for a long time, he made up his mind, stared straight into Di Bian\u2019s eyes and replied, \u201cSure, with pleasure. I\u2019m willing to do anything to keep our family from crumbling.\u201dDi Bian rejoiced at his words and hurried to take a document from one of his subordinates. He opened it and said, \u201cI have a team at hand, of which Qin Li and her family have no idea. Now they are at your command. You shall lead them to...\u201dDi Qiuhe pretended to listen carefully, though he felt it extremely ironic.The drama finally started.As the shooting of the last MV cover was finished, He Bai built up a collection of snaps he took when accompanying Jun Chen to C Province and posted it on WeiBo as planned. Also, in the post, he showed his appreciation of Jun Chen\u2019s recognition online, talked about his understanding of shooting, and expressed his sincere wishes that Jun Chen's new album could become a hit.Jun Chen\u2019s Studio immediately retweeted He Bai\u2019s post via its official WeiBo account, returned his thanks, and revealed something new about the album.He Bai\u2019s popularity soared after a whole series of things happened one after another: being vilified, making clarification, netizens\u2019 expose of the person who vilified him as well as the behind-the-scene boss of Saint Elephant, and getting considerable sympathy from them for working for such a boss at the very beginning. People lamented that geniuses\u2019 path to fame was always full of trouble and misfortune. Coupled with the fact that He Bai had been a hotly talked about figure for some time while doing his shooting homework at the amusement park and made a good impression on passers-by, his post that promoted Jun Chen\u2019s new album flooded the screen immediately.The news that a popular photographer joined hands with famous God of Song hit the headline instantly.Netizen No. 1: What? Jun Chen! It\u2019s more than half a year since he started to make his new album! The tears I shed are tears of joy!Netizen No. 2: Ha-Ha, those rumormongers have been bitterly attacking He Bai for playing truant, why they stop now? Mr. He hasn\u2019t missed classes in campus until that day due to work! Dare you say you have never skipped any class or work for something important? Nobody\u2019s perfect. Do you rumormongers have any sense of shame?Netizen No.3: I am also willing to skip class only if I had the opportunity to shoot for Jun Chen!Netizen No.4: Originally, I thought He Bai could take good pictures of teenage girls only, only to find that collective photos he took were also pretty. It\u2019s not until now that I come to know... god, he takes better photographs of men! These photos simply changed my impression of Jun Chen! Previously, I only dare to watch him from a distance, but now I really want to rush in and give him a hug! I\u2019m about to become a fanboy!Netizen No.5: He Bai, would you mind my asking whether you gonna dump Qiuhe? Please don\u2019t\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Besides, He Bai finally attained a very important place in the entertainment industry and was seen an excellent and popular photographer who could take on prominent shooting work instead of the former talented newcomer!From a retoucher to a photographer, from photographing unknown hosts at TV Station to shooting album covers for God of Song, He Bai rose to prominence from nothing like magic and caught the attention of people at the top of the entertainment industry immediately. Lin Xia hung up on the fifth person who called to sound out Yi Ka\u2019s opinion and sighed with joy and sorrow.Happily, Jun Chen\u2019s album won such great popularity before it was officially launched, and Small Mermaid was bound to become a hot ticket accordingly. However, once the album cover met with success, He Bai would leave Yi Ka soon.She sighed, picked up the mobile phone and dialed Zhu Ke\u2019s number, asking in a slightly helpless way, \u201cSister Ke, how\u2019s it going in looking for a new costume photographer...\u201dNational Day was coming. He Bai temporarily handed over his WeiBo account to the staffer who was in charge of it and boarded a plane to D District with his luggage on September 30th.It got cooler and cooler after the advent of autumn. He Bai straightened his collar, adjusted his mask and sunglasses, and appeared outside the shooting base with his luggage.The shooting of Jiang Guanshan\u2019s new film Cheng\u2019s Army was shrouded in secrecy, and all the crew signed a non-disclosure agreement for this reason, while a strange young man carrying luggage suddenly turned up outside the isolated base, which made the security personnel on high alert. Afraid that the man was a paparazzi some well-informed newspaper sent, they hurriedly went ahead to drive him out under a familiar pretext, \u201cPlease detour. The road is under construction.\u201dHe Bai took off his sunglasses and mask, gave the security guards a pleasant smile and said, \u201cHello, my teacher Xu Yinrong assigned me to send some materials over. This is my calling card. Please notify Director Jiang of my visit.\u201dDumbfounded, the two guards took He Bai\u2019s card and had a look. Then they became friendly and smiled, \u201cYou turn out to be Mr. Xu\u2019s student. Director has been waiting for you. Please follow me.\u201dHe Bai nodded, hauled his luggage and followed them into the base.On the set, Di Qiuhe finished his acting, took the mobile phone from Wang Boyi and turned it on, to find that He Bai still made no reply to his text, his eyebrows drooped unconsciously.It was several days since last call. Little Puppy suddenly became busy and did neither answer his phone nor return his texts, even not mentioning that he would come to D District. It seemed that he had forgotten this thing.He must be angry...Di Qiuhe looked at a corner of the set and fell into a state of deep depression.Tomorrow was National Day. Little Puppy might have returned home. Even if he rushed back to B City, he was likely to miss He Bai...\u201cMaster Di, Director Jiang said that there would be tourists everywhere these days, so is our base. For the sake of secrecy, the crew can take three days off. Shall I book a ticket to B City for you?\u201d Wang Boyi who had just asked about those things came over and said respectfully.Di Qiuhe earthed to himself, cast a glance at his mobile screen and shook his head gently, \u201cDon't do that. I\u2019m waiting for...\u201d\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201dA familiar voice came from two steps away.Di Qiuhe halted and turned his head for he couldn\u2019t believe his ears. His eyes grew wide in anticipation when he pushed aside Wang Boyi who watched out for the sound and strode toward the young man carrying a suitcase. He kept a straight face and unconsciously clenched his fist.\u201cWhy do you react in this way?\u201d He Bai raised his eyebrows, reached out his hand to straighten Di Qiuhe\u2019s collar and pinched the bulging muscles on his arm, asking deliberately, \u201cAre you braced for a fight?\u201dDi Qiuhe stared at him, and the part He Bai touched had an uncontrolled temperature. He cleared his throat, suddenly he stretched his arm to hold He Bai in his arms, rubbed his head against He Bai\u2019s hair, and said this while gritting his teeth, \u201cLittle Puppy, I hate such a surprise.\u201d\u201cYou call this a surprise?\u201d He Bai slightly moved his body, for he was still unaccustomed to his way of expressing happiness. He raised his head backwards and said, \u201cI told you before I would come to see you on National Day, so it isn\u2019t a surprise.\u201dDi Qiuhe raised his hand to hold the back of He Bai\u2019s head, pulled him back to his arms, and carried him to the resting chair regardless of his struggle and shouting. Then he squatted down, put his hands on the armrests, looked up to He Bai and said in a deep voice, \u201cLittle Puppy, I ...\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d He Bai patted Di Qiuhe on the head and interrupted him, turning his head to signal Wang Boyi to carry his suitcase over.Having guessed who he was based on Di Qiuhe\u2019s reaction, Wang Boyi obediently helped him take the suitcase over.He Bai thanked him, bent down to open the suitcase and took his camera out from inside. Turning it on and setting it, he focused the camera on Di Qiuhe who was squatting in front of him, patted him on the head and pressed the man, \u201cShow me the look again, please. It\u2019s so charming as if a wolf sees its prey. It seems that you maintain the sympathy with the role you played, really awesome. My teacher assigned me a task this time. Be quick, please!\u201dDi Qiuhe who almost bared his heart on impulse: \u201c...\u201d\u201cHmm,\u201d He Bai put down the camera and looked at him unhappily, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have praised you. Just in a flash, you turn from a wolf to a dog. Why don\u2019t you make a good showing? Show your teeth, quickly!\u201dDi Qiuhe started at him.\u201cHurry up, or my vacation will be ruined without homework.\u201d He Bai raised the camera again. \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou childish!\u201d He Bai yelled in a threatening tone of voice.Wang Boyi frowned and felt that the student would get a thrashing for his impudence.Di Qiuhe bowed his head, his hands gripped and loosened once again. Then he looked up at He Bai and flashed a smile, \u201c... like that?\u201dWang Boyi who was ready to stop the thrashing: \u201c...\u201d\u201cGood. . . Can you be a little more aggressive?\u201dDi Qiuhe slightly lowered his head and drooped his eyebrows, asking, \u201cIs it okay?\u201d\u201cBarely.\u201d He Bai showed less enthusiasm.Di Qiuhe hurriedly changed his expression to meet his requirement.Wang Boyi who looked on in silence was at a loss this time, and it struck him that his master, when faced with the younger schoolmate, was quite like a dog.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus Di Qiuhe was getting impatient, with his eyebrows furrowed unconsciously and his body stressed, and his eyes were filled with distress and depression as he considered himself helpless.Click.\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d He Bai put down camera and fondled Di\u2019s hair in ways of patting a dog, grinning from ear to ear, while extruding the left dimple on his face, which made his laugh somewhat detestable. \u201cChildish Di, come on, left hand.\u201dStaring at the white palm, Di Qiuhe got close to and grasped it instinctively, while raised his eyebrows the moment he realized something was wrong, then looking at He seriously, and gnashed again. \u201cPup!\u201dAt the very moment, He Bai raised his camera and clicked agilely, then there followed a shutter sound.Di was freezing in the cruel expression.\u201cDone.\u201d He Bai patted Di on the shoulder and looked down to check the final image.Upon seeing He\u2019s smile of satisfaction, Di Qiuhe\u2019s anger just stirred up vanished and he calmed down. He had no other way. All right, now that he was several years older than Pup, it was his responsibility to be patient.He Bai was lighted up with pleasure. He turned off the camera, stretched out his hand to pull Di Qiuhe, who was still squatting in front of him. Looking around, he saw no other chair, thus he sat down shoulder by shoulder beside Di, and inquired, \u201cWhen I just came here, I heard that the crew was going to have a holiday. Do you get to have days off as well?\u201dFor relaxing, Di Qiuhe\u2019s rest chair was rather comfortable, which was enough to accommodate two men sitting down side by side. However, Di Qiuhe had ulterior motives, thus he couldn\u2019t help but stood up promptly when he felt He\u2019s breath spraying on his shoulder. He concealed his nervousness by taking a bottle of water from the water tank beside him and gave it to He Bai. Then he leaned sideways to a pillar beside and tried to give a natural response. \u201cYeah, three-day-off, enough to treat you well.\u201dHe Bai hold the water bottle, watching Di leaning on the pillar in a deliberate posture, smiled but not exposed Di in this delicate situation, and replied, \u201cGreat, I have five days off, enough to finish my assignment and play with you.\u201dWang Boyi came up at the proper moment and put a chair beside He Bai.He Bai looked at Wang Boyi and thanked him with a friendly smile.Di Qiuhe took a look at Wang Boyi likewise, then he stepped over and sat down, made a brief introduction about Wang after meeting He\u2019s confused gaze. Then he turned to Wang and said, \u201cYou and assistant An deserve some rest as well. Come back to the studio on time three days later and contact me by phone if it\u2019s necessary.\u201d\u201cYes, Master Di.\u201d Wang Boyi responded respectfully, nodded politely to He Bai and turned away.He Bai watched the one leaving, narrowed his eyes and thought for a while, then he turned around and asked, \u201cIs Wang the assistant your father arranged for you? You bribed him?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Di Qiuhe nodded and replied in candor, \u201cI looked him up and got some of his dark history. Now he\u2019s working for me.\u201dHe Bai was amazed. \u201cWield both the carrot and the stick?\u201dDi Qiuhe was somewhat perturbed when explaining it to He Bai. He was fond of He Bai, and hoped He Bai could care for him as well, the real him. He never concealed his malice and calculation to his family before He Bai, and he was not intending to conceal himself before subordinates or outsiders in the future.It would be nice for him if He Bai could accept him like this, otherwise...Then he shall find another way to be accepted step by step. Fortunately, He Bai responded him the best, no repulsive but absolute acceptance and trust.\u201cWell, the carrot and the stick is an outmoded method, but it works.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but be happier, which could be seen from his eyes for he thought he loved the right guy. Pup was considerate, far better than he thought.He Bai raised his eyebrows to pretend he was irritated when he saw Di was showing off. But he swallowed the teasing words on the tip of his tongue as he saw from a distance that the staff around director Jiang left one by one. Then he put down the water bottle and stood up, \u201cI\u2019m going to say hello to director Jiang. Are you coming with me?\u201dDi Qiuhe looked back at director Jiang, restrained himself and got up, and then went over with He Bai.Yang Wentian just finished talking with Jiang Guanshan and left, and met He and Di halfway. Di Qiuhe took the initiative to say hello to Yang, who replied and made fun of Di, seeming quite close.He Bai looked curiously at Di Qiuhe, who appeared as a totally different person, regretting that he hadn\u2019t brought the camera with him, otherwise, he could shoot Di\u2019s countenance right now.Jiang Guanshan was talking to the assistant director. He saw Di Qiuhe coming when he raised his eyes, then he raised hand and waved to Di before the one came near, and said, \u201cQiuhe, you\u2019re right on time. I forgot to tell your assistant that Dong Ni will be on the set after the holiday. Your first co-star play is wire work, and it will be very strenuous. So please don\u2019t overtax your energy on your vacation, and make sure you have a good rest. Your shooting assignment will be heavier after Dong Ni back.\u201dHearing Dong Ni was mentioned, Di Qiuhe looked at He Bai beside, and then withdrew his sight hurriedly after catching the doubtful look of He, he looked back at Jiang Guanshan and replied. \u201cI see, director Jiang.\u201dJiang then noticed He Bai standing beside Di Qiuhe, who looked unfamiliar, and frowned a bit.He Bai gave a smile right away, then took out his business card and a USB disk, handed it to Jiang respectfully with both hands, then made a self-introduction politely, \u201cNice to meet you, director Jiang, I\u2019m He Bai. This is the material that my master, Mr. Xu Yinrong, asked me to deliver to you. Sorry to have kept you waiting, sir.\u201dJiang Guanshan eased down when he heard it, with his eyes full of kindness. He accepted the business card and looked at it. Then he handed the USB disk to the assistant director and held out his hand to He Bai. \u201cYou\u2019re LaoXu\u2019s little disciple. Thank you for taking the hard trip. I heard from LaoXu that you would like to complete your assignment on the set. Make yourself at home, but no flash please.\u201dHe Bai held Jiang\u2019s hand with both hands promptly, paused for a few seconds and then let go of it sensibly. With a pleasant smile on his face, he thanked Jiang for the opportunity to shoot, and then sincerely promised that he would never cause any trouble to the crew.Di Qiuhe, who considered He Bai was just about to make a simple greeting, frowned and looked at He with the head aslant.After parting Jiang Guanshan, they left the base. He Bai went back with Di to the hotel where the crew stayed and prepared for dinner and rest.\u201cDid you formally acknowledge Elder Xu as your master?\u201d After backing to the room, Di Qiuhe, who had suppressed his curiosity all the way, finally could not help questioning.He Bai took off his coat, slumped on the sofa and nodded, \u201cWell, not long ago.\u201dDi Qiuhe glanced at the waist figure and long legs of He, sidled over to put He\u2019s suitcase beside the wardrobe. Then he turned around and sat down on the edge of the bed, frowning at He, and finally posed an aggrieved question, \u201cSo you\u2019re not here for me but Jiang?\u201dHe Bai was amazed, cast a glance at Di funnily and kicked him with foot. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you wore a sour face all the way. How naive you are to be bothered about by it.\u201dDi Qiuhe clamped He\u2019s leg to keep He from breaking away without saying a word, He was apparently sulking.With such a temperament, He Bai thought, the upper limit of Di\u2019s mental age was three-year-old at most!He Bai felt disappointed, stopped struggling and moved his body. He then explained, \u201cVisiting you is my paramount purpose, and delivering material is in passing. I was too busy to complete two weeks\u2019 photography assignment when I took the cover for Jun Chen, and master heard that I was coming to you during National Day holidays, he asked me to bring the material and then gave me a new assignment after asking Jiang\u2019s advice.\u201dAfter hearing the explanation, Di Qiuhe was in a better mood. He saw He Bai lying in front, then his eyebrows eased and mouth curled up on the sly, asked, \u201cYou were shooting me as soon as you get here. Am I your new assignment?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He Bai denied mercilessly.Di Qiuhe wore a poker face as soon as he was frustrated. He loosened He Bai\u2019s leg, stooped to grasp He\u2019s ankle and pulled it, placing He\u2019s leg onto his knees and holding it down to keep He from moving.\u201cHey!\u201d He Bai did not see that coming, and he was almost jumping out from his skin. Thus he kicked Di with his other leg, and rebuked, \u201cHow could you behave like a kid. You\u2019re not like this when I first met you...Let it go! My assignment this time is to snapshot the protagonists in your crew, and then manage to edit the rest of the crew into the same scene for making posters, or to snapshot an applicable crew image during filming. So yes I am taking photo of you but not just you, do you understand?Di Qiuhe held both He Bai\u2019s legs down altogether, and then with a neat drag, pulled He Bai down from the sofa directly.\u201cWhat the fuck!\u201d He Bai broke away from the sofa and was about to fall down.Di Qiuhe stretched out his arms to support He Bai\u2019s back, moved his legs forward and put his hand back, laying He Bai steadily across his leg.He Bai: \u201c...\u201dDi Qiuhe was satisfied, grinned with a gentle smile. \u201cYou have no need to snapshot others, because I\u2019m the leading role during the two days after the holiday, just shoot me.\u201dHe Bai loosened his hand, which was at Di\u2019s waist for keeping his body balance, then lifted Di\u2019s shirt resolutely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Fxxk... (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe\u2019s facial expression and his whole body froze, daring not to move, and stuttered, \u201cYou, what are you doing?\u201dHe Bai sneered, put his palm on Di\u2019s waist as soon as lifting Di\u2019s shirt. Then, after sensing a sudden quiver in his hand, he bent his fingers and scratched Di, weighting his body to bump against Di aside, and finally he was on top. He sneered, \u201cIs there any connection between muscle and power? How dare you to tease me, Childish Di. I\u2019m afraid that you have no idea about what you\u2019re up against!Looking upward to downward, He Bai\u2019s small Adam\u2019s apple seemed to be right under his nose, to the extent that he could kiss He Bai whenever he got up slightly. He Bai\u2019s hand was lingering in his body, and their legs were intimately contacted...Di Qiuhe\u2019s ears were flushed first, and then extended to neck and cheeks.To avoid being detected by He Bai, Di swiftly counter-restrained He Bai, who then lied upon his stomach and was pressed at back to keep him from turning over. Then Di lifted He Bai\u2019s skirt, touching his waist with a reserved scratch, and retorted, \u201cI think it\u2019s you that will beg for mercy today.\u201dHe Bai struggled to get free and intended to launch a backhand attack. Then he protested. \u201cYou fool, I\u2019m not ticklish, let me go!\u201dHe Bai\u2019s skin was smooth and warm, and soft for lack of exercise, which was totally different from Di\u2019s stiff muscles. Di was almost choked before he realized that he had to stop before it was too late. However, lust and desire drove him to stretch his hand in again, then grasped the thin waist and kneaded instinctively.\u201cFxxk...\u201dHe Bai gave a sudden low scolding while his body quivered.Di Qiuhe froze as he was conscious of something. He tenderly pinched where he had just grasped.\u201cHmm.\u201dHe Bai grunted, trapped in bed feebly. But a few seconds later, he struggled even more. His ears, which could be seen, were reddish, and his intonation revealed that he was ashamed into anger. \u201cChildish Di, let me go! Mercy!\u201dDi Qiuhe was really getting in the mood by He Bai\u2019s soft breath and muffled hum, then he noticed that his cock was about to get erected. Thus he pulled the quilt over He Bai\u2019s head. After that, he got up promptly, rushed into the bathroom and locked himself inside.\u201cAsshole Childish Di!\u201d He Bai snatched the quilt off ashamedly, making his way to the entrance of the bathroom, then slammed the door and cursed in rage, \u201cWhat are you hiding from? Are you playing tricks while shedding off your responsibility? Even a three-year-old knows to apologize for wrongdoing, you\u2019re 23 years old! Do you have a backbone?\u201d\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d asked Di Qiuhe in the interval of washing face with cool water.\u201cYou touch! Pooh! You almost dragged me to the ground!\u201d He Bai could not help rubbing and kneading his waist of some pleasant sensation, blushed and gritted his teeth.Damn it! Two lifetimes had he finally knew that his sensitivity area was on his waist!As if he could still feel the soft skin, Di Qiuhe rubbed his fingers, noticing that his cock was getting hard again. Thus he plunged his head in the cold water, and pretended to be calm and retorted, \u201cBut I got you.\u201dHow could the asshole talk back for his mistake!He Bai found it both funny and annoying. He reached out and twisted the door\u2019s handle, and shouted, \u201cGet out! Shall it offset your wrongdoing? Out and fight!\u201d\u201cI had a busy day on the set, and it\u2019s uncomfortable to soak in sweat. I need a bath.\u201d Di Qiuhe was unmoved.Then He Bai sneered. \u201cMe too! I had a long and arduous journey, and I was tainted with sorts of smells. Anyway, open the door!\u201dDi Qiuhe paused, supposing them meeting in naked, in which his cock got strong. He hit the wall after he imagined all these scenes. Then he took off his clothes, twist the sprinkle, and lowered his voice. \u201cI called dibs first, you next. Wait for a few minutes, XiaoBai.\u201dHe Bai stepped back in disbelief. \u201cWhat was the sound just now? Did you hit the door? Now YOU are throwing a fit?\u201dThe person he loved seemed to be whispering in his ear, and he imagined the expression of He Bai speaking. Cold water poured on his body, whereas he was getting hotter and hotter. Di Qiuhe was wholly tantalized, then he held his cock.\u201cXiaoBai...\u201dThe sound of rushing water covered the murmur, thus only a faint sound could be heard outside the door.\u201cAre you taking a bath?\u201d He Bai glared and frowned, then the ineffable feeling generated from triggering his sensitive area disappeared. He recalled the way he had just acted up, felt embarrassed, then he coughed and said, \u201cOk, I, I\u2019ll watch TV.\u201dDi Qiuhe opened his half-closed eyes and pressed his lips, with his Adam\u2019s apple moving up and down. Finally he sniggered.Damn Pup knew how to work me up...A good spanking would serve him right.Lazy as they were, they declined to go out for dinner after bath, so they ordered takeout.\u201cThe sushi is tasty. Try it.\u201d Di Qiuhe put the sushi assortments in front of He Bai.He Bai took a look at the sushi, conceiving Di was fawning on him for wrongdoing. He was nearly satisfied and ate one by chopsticks. Then he was delighted as it was better than expected. He then thumbed up to Di, \u201cIt\u2019s delicious and superb.\u201dDi Qiuhe grinned, poured He Bai a glass of plum wine. \u201cIt\u2019s plain. Have a taste. You will like it.\u201dHe Bai complied, savored it carefully and nodded, \u201cSweet, it\u2019s palatable.\u201dSeeing He Bai appreciate it, Di Qiuhe was lighted up with pleasure. He then poured himself a glass.They cast the farce erewhile away through watching TV, eating and drinking. Time passed quickly. When they were satiated, it was the usual time for He Bai to bed.\u201cI\u2019ve got to take a bath.\u201d He Bai\u2019s cheeks were flushed, he lengthened his last syllable when speaking, together with his clear and energetic voice, was rather coquettish to some extent.Di Qiuhe rubbed his ears, bowed his head and pretended to tidy up the plates, answered vaguely.Clap, the door of the bathroom closed.Di Qiuhe eased and raised his hand to rub his ears.\u201cChildish Di!\u201dHe was stressed out, put down his hand swiftly, raising his voice and asked, \u201cWhat, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dHe Bai, who had taken off his coat, popped his head out from the bathroom, frowning as if trying to recall something. Finally he elaborated, \u201cForgive me. I\u2019ve made a change in my plan for fulfilling my assignment that I decide to go back home tomorrow to sweep my parents\u2019 tomb. Would you like to join me? Or you\u2019d like to rest here wait for me coming back.\u201dDi Qiuhe turned around and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201d It was impossible for him to let go such a good opportunity of visiting the Parents!The next day, He Bai, who had a hangover, was woken up by Di Qiuhe. The first scene he saw was a sexy back, he couldn\u2019t help but touch it.Di Qiuhe tightened his body for a moment, looked back at He, and whispered, \u201cHave I awakened you?\u201dHe Bai pressed Di\u2019s stiff muscle in a daze, nodded approvingly, then took up his mobile phone to see what time it was. He asked, \u201cWhat are you doing in the early morning?\u201d\u201cKeep sleeping.\u201d Di Qiuhe pushed a pile of clothes under the bed, turned around to tuck He in, and murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s early, take some more sleep, I won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201dHe Bai was still drowsy. He said a few vague words and buried himself in the quilt and went on sleeping.Di Qiuhe fondled a strand of curled hair of He in scrupulousness, turned around to pick up the pile of clothes, went into the bathroom, and embarked the laundry work.The room quieted down soon. He Bai rolled up the quilt. Just as he was about to fall asleep, the doorbell rang suddenly and harshly. He opened his eyes and sat up with heavy head while kneading his forehead, then he shouted, \u201cChildish Di, the doorbell is ringing. Someone visits you. Go check!\u201dThere was no response, the light in the bathroom seemed to be on.He frowned and got up, groomed his hair casually, took his coat and put it on to cover the pajamas, and then he opened the door.Outside the door, there was a young girl in a delicate makeup and a cotton and linen embroidered dress. She smiled and greeted kindly as the door opened, \u201cHello, I\u2019m Dong Ni, your partner in the new scene, I happen to...Who are you?\u201dHe Bai frowned a bit. He sized her up, seeing her deep V dress and disheveled curly hair, considering the time now, and then raised his hand and held his forehead as he realized something.A woman, a woman painted with exquisite makeup, passed by the room of the male partner protagonist in such an early morning. Seemed unlikely!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: You\u2019re Handsome (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkDong Ni saw He Bai pressing his forehead, with a confused look expressing that he had just been waken up. She slightly frowned and checked the room number with uncertainty. She opened her mouth with a hand running through her hair, saying with confusion and hesitation, \u201cSorry, I come to the wrong room\u2026Sorry to bother you, bye.\u201d\u201cWait.\u201d He Bai stopped her and examined her dressing carefully. \u201cYou are in the right room. It is Di Qiuhe\u2019s room.\u201d That plum wine tasted like juice, but had a strong delayed effect. The more sober he was, the worse his headache was.And this Dong Ni who showed up suddenly\u2026made things more complex.Dong Ni quickly pulled back her leg and looked at He Bai from top to bottom. She kept her smile and asked politely, \u201cSorry, but you are\u2026?\u201d\u201cHis friend, just come to visit him during the vacation.\u201d He Bai answered briefly. He imagined the complicated things in the future and decided to eliminate all the potential troubles in the bud as quickly as possible. So, he entirely opened the room door, ensuring that even if there was paparazzi or someone copied the monitoring video, they could not see any possibility that the people in and out the room had any special relationship. He smiled to Dong Ni and said, \u201cWait a minute, let me call him out.\u201d Before Dong Ni could refuse, he went to knock the washroom door. Then he came to the bed, taking his camera bag and phone, standing in the doorway again.Dong Ni: \u201c\u2026\u201d She never thought of this result as she came here early in the morning.She glanced at He Bai\u2019s camera bag and phone and then checked the room number again. Then she saw the monitor at the end of the corridor. It was a safe distance between her and He Bai. She lowered her head to remove her stiff expression and then asked with a smile, \u201cSo, why do you carry a camera?\u201d\u201cOh, well.\u201d He Bai leaned against the door frame and smoothed his hair, smiling, \u201cForget to introduce myself. I\u2019m He Bai, the junior schoolmate of Di Qiuhe, majoring in journalism and communication, a future journalist. I like to carry a camera with me due to my major.\u201dDong Ni: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe in the future, I can have the chance to cooperate with Miss Dong as a journalist.\u201d He Bai began to talk nonsense. He raised his hand and massaged his forehead, trying to relieve the headache after intoxication. He continued: \u201cI heard you from Director Jiang. With your talent, efforts and resources, you will become a hit sooner or later. By then, I will be the one who has ever chatted with the superstar Dong Ni in a hotel in the early morning. My colleague must be very jealous.\u201dHe deliberately accentuated \u201cefforts\u201d and \u201cresources\u201d, which made Dong Ni nervous and shocked. She almost failed to restrain her feelings. When she looked at He Bai again, her eyes were tainted with curiosity and scruple. She suggested, \u201cMr. He, I am just a new\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Xiao Bai?\u201d Di Qiuhe walked out from the washroom with brand-new shirt and trousers. When he saw the widely opened door and Dong Ni, the mildness and intimacy in his eyes disappeared. Di Qiuhe frowned for a second and soon relieved. He showed a polite and confused expression, pressing He Bai\u2019s shoulder. He stood behind He Bai with a slightly intimate posture, looking at Dong Ni and asking politely, \u201cWho are you, please?\u201dSeeing him, Dong Ni\u2019s eyes were glued on him and shined. She couldn\u2019t help stepping forward with a sweet smile, \u201cHello, I am your new costar Dong Ni. Our cooperated filming will be on the day after tomorrow, I think\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, so it's you.\u201d Di Qiuhe interrupted her with a smile and patted He Bai\u2019s shoulder to assure him. Then he came out of the room sideways and nodded to Dong Ni. He strode to the room door diagonally across theirs and rang the doorbell.Dong Ni woke up from that bewitching face yet still showed a face full of bewilderment, while He Bai just twitched his lips.A few seconds later, Jiang Guanshan, who apparently just got up, opened the door. Seeing Di Qiuhe standing there, he said with confusion, \u201cWhy do you get up so early? Anything wrong? Where is Xiao He, let\u2019s have a breakfast together.\u201d\u201cThanks for your invitation. He just got up, so he couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d Di Qiuhe answered with regret, \u201cSo Miss Dong is here and tells me that she wants to get familiar with the filming after the vacation, but I have promised Xiao Bai to visit his parents\u2019 graves, so\u2026\u201d Then he turned sideways and presented Dong Ni to him. Jiang Guanshan looked at Dong Ni and frowned deeply. He checked the time and said with slight dissatisfaction and dislike, \u201cWhy now?\u201dDong Ni: \u201c\u2026\u201d Things seemed to be heading in a wrong direction.\u201cIt\u2019s good for a new actress to be work hard, but that working ethic should be displayed on appropriate occasion.\u201d Jiang Guanshan knew her background, but he was not afraid, so his dissatisfaction showed a little on his face. But he still said with responsibility, \u201cBut since you\u2019re here, go prepare your filming. Your first shot requires wire work. There are many things to watch out. Come with me, let me take you to the action choreographer.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Di Qiuhe said and turned to Dong Ni, saying apologetically, \u201cMiss Dong, I\u2019m sorry that I cannot welcome and accompany you. Director Jiang will walk you through the key points about the following scene. I am going to order breakfasts for you, see you.\u201dHe Bai immediately turned on his camera and took a titbits photo \u201cThe director and actors discussing the script harmoniously.\u201d He waved to Dong Ni with a smile, \u201cMiss Dong, wish you a good work and hope you can spring into fame.\u201dHearing that, Jiang Guanshan bantered, \u201cNonsense. There are so many actors springing into fame but only last for a short time in showbiz. A good actor should delve into acting skills and make efforts to maintain his fame. Xiao He, your acting awareness is not high enough.\u201dHe Bai hurriedly clasped hands and apologized.Di Qiuhe smiled and said something for He Bai, \u201cXiao Bai just hopes that Miss Dong\u2019s first performance can impress the audience. I believe that with her talent and resources, she will make us proud.\u201dDong Ni smiled with embarrassment. She lowered her head, running a hand through her hair and smoothed her collar.The first experience in showbiz was a little bit different from her imagination. Maybe because she got too early and had an unclear mind, she felt it hard to distinguish whether these people were satirizing her or just some simple talk to flatter each other. All they said was just something beautiful but contrived.Anyway, she glammed up for nothing today. \u2018Geez, talking about getting off the wrong foot.\u2019After Dong Ni and director Jiang left for the action choreographer, He Bai finally relaxed. He covered his mouth and yawned.And Di Qiuhe just finished ordering breakfasts and hung up. He turned around and saw He Bai yawning. Frowning, he examined He Bai\u2019s face and asked with care, \u201cDidn\u2019t sleep well? I saw your eyes are bloodshot, go back to have some sleep.\u201d\u201cNo, just some delayed effects and a bit of a headache.\u201d He Bai massaged his temples and shook his hand, \u201cI can\u2019t sleep sound now, just wash up and get ready, so that we can come back early.\u201dHearing that, Di Qiuhe was even more dissatisfied with Dong Ni and her sudden appearance. He took He Bai\u2019s camera and phone from his hands and said, \u201cI have borrowed a car from filming group. We will be driving there so that you can sleep on the car. What are you craving for? I\u2019ll order now.\u201d\u201cSomething light, please.\u201d He Bai answered and narrowed his eyes, examining Di Qiuhe from top to bottom. He rubbing his chin confusedly, \u201cIt\u2019s weird. For this while I woke up, you still haven\u2019t riled me up, on the contrary, you are being so considerate, do you\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: You\u2019re Handsome (2)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cWhat?\u201d Di Qiuhe stiffened at his look. He suddenly felt that his hand-picked shirt was a little bit burning. Di Qiuhe\u2019s expression was frozen unconsciously and he was a little bit flurried. Did he behave too obviously just now? Had his little puppy noticed his secret love? If he had noticed, should he tell\u2026\u201cAre you under a spell or something?\u201d He Bai punched his right palm with the left hand and showed a mysterious smile as if he had discovered some truth, \u201cOr you want to thank me for sending away that Dong Ni? Don\u2019t bother. We are good brothers; I have the responsibility to block the girls that are not suitable for you. Of course, that Dong Ni has a good figure and beautiful face, but girls like her are ubiquitous in art college, so, why does director Jiang choose her? By the way, you just became another person in front of Dong Ni. I almost applauded for your acting skill.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai\u2026He Bai looked at him with sparkling eyes. Even the headache after hangover could not stop him from gossiping, \u201cWhy do you think director Jiang choose her?\u201dHe Bai raised his hand and wiped his face. He turned back to He Bai and wanted to be alone for a while.They got into the car and fastened the safe belt. He Bai was eating the pan cake bought on a stall. He glanced at Di Qiuhe again and again.\u201cWhat?\u201d Di Qiuhe turned his head sideways and couldn\u2019t resist asking.\u201cYou are handsome.\u201dDi Qiuhe pressed the accelerator hard.He Bai was attached to the back of the seat due to inertia. He didn\u2019t swallow the pancake in his mouth until the car drove smoothly. He was almost choked. He Bai stared at Di Qiuhe beside him, \u201cHow did you get your driving license? I have never seen a driver worse than you.\u201dDi Qiuhe reached up to loosen his tie and suddenly wanted to perform a drift trick to prove his driving skill.\u201cThe accelerator is a little loose. I was not used to it just now.\u201d He explained with a serious face.\u201cSure, I buy it.\u201d He Bai rolled his eyes. When the car was truly at normal speed, he lowered his head and ate his pan cake again, saying vaguely, \u201cBut you are really handsome today. This suit is not too formal or too frivolous. It suits you well, thanks.\u201d Di Qiuhe usually wore comfortable clothes, but today he wore suit for accompanying him to sweep graves, which made He Bai felt warm.This time, Di Qiuhe didn\u2019t press the accelerator but spun the wheel sharply, and the car took an S-shaped turn.He Bai hurriedly clenched the handrail and put his pan cake aside. He said urgently, \u201cYou stop at the next junction, and let me drive. Your driving skill will get me heart disease sooner or later.\u201dDi Qiuhe had been pleased by He Bai\u2019s praise, but now this pleasure disappeared. He frowned and said with anger, \u201cI can drive well as long as you keep silent. You said you didn\u2019t sleep well last night, then get some sleep now.\u201d\u201cHow can you blame me?\u201d He Bai couldn\u2019t help raising his voice, but given that Di Qiuhe was driving, he restrained his anger and said with worry, \u201cI am afraid that if I fall asleep, your terrible driving skill will send me to see my parents.\u201dDi Qiuhe turned his head sideways and stared at him, \u201cStop the nonsense!\u201d\u201cWatch out! Please keep your eyes on road!\u201d He Bai fastened his seat belt tight and thought that it was a total mistake to let Di Qiuhe drive him home. He stopped chatting with him and slammed down the chair hopelessly. He Bai covered his face with the blanket from the back seat and said with a shaking voice: \u201cI have set the navigation for you, just follow it. I\u2019ll keep quiet, so just focus on driving. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201dHearing this, Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help rubbing He Bai\u2019s waist.Di Qiuhe twitched on the seat like a dead fish. He threw the blanket and stared at Di Qiuhe, \u201cYou wanna die?\u201dDi Qiuhe felt better and gave an oblique look to He Bai with a smile on his lips. He gave a snort and pressed the contributor.He Bai leaned back. He looked at Di Qiuhe, who was even more handsome when he put on some swagger. He dared not to scold him nor beat him now, so he could only keep this hatred in his heart and covered his face with the blanket again. \u2018Out of mind, out of sight, after all.\u2019The person on the front seat gradually relaxed. He fell asleep with his head tilted.Di Qiuhe pulled the blanket for him at the red light, and jabbed at his left dimple, smiling, \u201cnaughty little puppy.\u201dHe stopped the car at a cemetery in the suburban area in the neighbor city in D district. He awakened He Bai, and then entered the cemetery with some relative items with him.\u201cWhen did you prepare these.\u201d With flower in his arms, He Bai didn\u2019t have any sense of heaviness. He just looked at the joss paper and other items in Di Qiuhe\u2019s hands curiously.Di Qiuhe smoothed his tie and cuffs, replying, \u201cI told assistant Wang to prepare these last night.\u201dFollowing the sequence of his movements, He Bai glanced at his delicate dark-stripe suit. He raised his hand and bent his arm around Di Qiuhe\u2019s shoulder with a smile, saying, \u201cMy parents will like you.\u201dDi Qiuhe was touched. He hurriedly held He Bai\u2019s back to keep balance and tried to ask in a calm manner, \u201cWhy\u2026\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re handsome.\u201d He Bai patted his shoulder and released him. He looked at the deepest side of the cemetery, with eyes full of memories. \u201cMaybe my parents had seen too many ugly things, so they particularly like things that can please people, such as beautiful flowers, good-looking people and fine paintings\u2026You are good-looking and handsome today. They will definitely like you.\u201dDi Qiuhe didn\u2019t expect that answer. He wore a smile and turned his head to He Bai. His face gradually relaxed and said mildly, \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201dHe Bai also smiled and gave him a \u201cyou-behave-well\u201d look. He led Di Qiuhe in front of a joint grave.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He Bai bent to put the flower in front of the grave, and then sat down quickly. He waved at the grave with a smile as if he had been an old friend of them, \u201cMum, dad, I come to visit you. How are you there? I bring a friend here this time. Isn\u2019t he very handsome? So, when you bless me, just also bless him.\u201dDi Qiuhe was baffled by his words. He looked at He Bai with deep emotions and also stepped forward. He put down the flower and joss paper, tidied up himself and bowed to the grave solemnly. He said in a serious manner, \u201cNice to meet you, I\u2019m Di Qiuhe.\u201dDi Qiuhe squatted down and helped him. He promised to He Bai\u2019s parents in the heart that he would take care of him well. They stay there for an hour, and He Bai finished everything he wanted to say. He stood up and patted the dust off on his trousers. He picked up a joss stick and worshiped his parents, \u201cMum, dad, I will visit you next time. Don\u2019t forget to wish me a fortune.Di Qiuhe also burnt a joss stick and said silently, \u201cPlease be assured to entrust He Bai to me. I will try my best to take care of him.\u201dAfter worshiping, He Bai sank the joss stick in front of the grave.Di Qiuhe also followed him.Suddenly, the roaring and rumbling of thunder came with a lightning. It began to rain without any signs.The burning joss sticks were extinguished immediately.He Bai: \u201cMum, dad, don\u2019t you want me to get rich?\u201dDi Qiuhe: \u201c\u2026\u201d No, it must be a coincidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Villa Resort (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkThe rain was getting heavier, it got to a point where it looked like God was pouring it down.They rushed back to the car and took a look at each other, both of whom resembled drowned rats.\u201cHa-ha-ha, how interesting.\u201d He Bai took off his coat and lifted his hand to flick the wet hair, seemed to be in a very good mood. He was smiling, with a deep dimple on his left face, which attracted Di to stare at him.\u201cLuckily, I didn\u2019t bring my camera.\u201d He wrapped his coat and threw it in the back seat, from which he leaned forward to take a blanket and threw it over Di Qiuhe\u2019s face. He then found a dry towel and wiped the raindrops on his face casually, urging, \u201cCome on, take off your wet coat and wipe your body dry. You have filming work two days later. By no means can you get sick.\u201dDi Qiuhe took down the blanket, which lingered the smells of He Bai, looking at He\u2019s messy hair and sparkling eyes, his Adam\u2019s apple budged for such an allure. Then he undid his tie and coat, as slow as a turtle.\u201cQuick!\u201d He Bai reached out to pull Di\u2019s coat off, then bent forward to find another dry towel and threw it into Di\u2019s arms. After checking the time on the cell phone he picked up, he suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s have a feast first, then buy clean clothes, and finally get back...No, no, no, you\u2019re so eye-catching that you shouldn\u2019t wander outside...So, what size do you wear? I\u2019ll get it for you. Wait for me in the car, and I\u2019ll buy you a mask and sunglasses by the way. We shouldn\u2019t have lunch until you\u2019re ready.\u201dDi Qiuhe took a look at the time likewise, knew that it was time for lunch. He frowned after looking at the wet jeans clinging to his legs, nodded to the proposal, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s buy clothes from a mall first.\u201d He then turned on the heater, threw the blanket back on He Bai and set the car going.Covering by blanket, He Bai got warming up soon. He meant to give it back to Di but realized it could be not safe to drive in a blanket. Therefore, he leaned it back on the seat, and just then he observed Di concentrating on turning the car around, which was so beckoning. He then leaned over to pick up the camera from the back seat and focus the lens on Di at once.Click.Di Qiuhe looked sideways at He Bai the moment he heard it.\u201cI\u2019ve got a photo of the driver in a wet shirt! I\u2019ll take it for auction when you go abroad. What a windfall.\u201d The joyous He Bai put down his camera, went through the photos of these two days, laughing like a greedy fox. \u201cChildish Di, you should take more filming to win more awards and be more popular. My down payment shall count on you.\u201dDi Qiuhe was amused by He Bai, who was treading on air of picturing the prosperous future. Di raised his hand deliberately to untie two of the shirt buttons, put the \u2018thunder and lightning strike\u2019 scene during sweeping tombs behind. He then sounded out in a low and ambiguous voice. \u201cDo you have any intention of shooting a set of art photos of my naked body? Not only will you have a down payment of your house but also a car.\u201dHe Bai looked over at Di.The sky was dark and it was dim in the car. Di Qiuhe\u2019s gorgeous eyebrows were shadowed in half, thus He Bai could only discern Di\u2019s impish eyes full of glimmer of a smile, as well as his charming lips.His nicely-carved nose outlined a sexy arc in the dim light, alluring others to kiss on it.His slender fingers rested on the collar, the rainwater-soaked shirt half-pasted on the body, revealed his handsome muscle figures. Two of the shirt buttons were untied and his bone collar half-exposed, and his Adam\u2019s apple budged slightly while talking. The raindrops left unattended slid down the neck and disappeared in the collar.Beauty, of course, was unisex.He Bai came to his sense from the attractive man, picked up the camera without hesitation and clicked several times.\u201cFreeze...Perfect! You absolutely should try to take a set of sexy photos, which will definitely attract lots of fans licking the screen!\u201dDi Qiuhe: \u201c...\u201d\u201cMy Second Senior Disciple is proficient in naked photography. You can come to him if you\u2019re interested. He will jump up for absolute joy. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll ask him to spare you an underwear.\u201d He Bai offered the sweet suggestion.Di Qiuhe retied the button at once while withdrawing his smile and then stepped on the accelerator.He Bai grabbed the handrail in a hurry to stabilize himself, looking at Di with a worrying face. \u201cAre you feeling cold? I see you can\u2019t even distinguish the accelerator and the brake. It\u2019s unsafe for us to drive so fast in the heavy rain.\u201c...I don\u2019t feel cold, I just slipped.\u201d Di Qiuhe gnashed and his eyebrows knitted tightly, seemingly quite fierce and ferocious. He was not feeling cold at all, quite on the contrary, hot was what he was feeling, to the extent that he was desperate to give Pup a spanking!Consenting someone else taking naked photos of him? Wearing nothing but a pair of underwear? Pup is so generous that pissed him off!He must weigh himself on Pup on the bed and treat Pup this way when Pup was enlightened! Nothing but a pair of underwear! Of course, it had to be a sexy one.Boom.He Bai marveled at the dark clouds rolling and gathering in the sky, raising his camera up to click without stopping. He exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve never expected there were loud crash of thunder in autumn. How eye-opening!\u201dCeasing the reverie, Di Qiuhe grasped the steering wheel, glancing sideways at the insensitive He Bai taking photos with great interest. Di paused and fantasized that besides the underwear, a vest was allowed...A sharp lightning flashed. He Bai put down his camera and muffled his eyes. \u201cJesus, my eyes. The lightning is much too cool and dazzling.\u201dDi Qiuhe: \u201c...\u201dThe fragrance skimmed over his mind. Then he took a breath and tempted that if Pup expressed willingness, they could wear matching underwears together...Clatter! It was raining cats and dogs in the turn of a hand.He Bai laid down his hand and frowned. \u201cHow could the rain get heavier? Be careful of the wet ground.\u201d\u201c...\u201dFinally, they got to the nearest shopping mall. He Bai got off to buy clothes while Di Qiuhe waited him in the car.City M, which next to D District, was a small developing city with a small population, made a quiet and suitable place for elders. At this time, the rain was putting on hold. Viewing this new city, Di Qiuhe conceived how young Pup walking through the streets laughing and playing. Before realizing it, he had curled his lips.\u201cWhat are you thinking about? You look like a snickered trafficker, who is about to kidnap an ignorant girl.\u201d He Bai, who had changed his clothes into a new one, ran back and pulled the car door to throw several shopping bags in after confirming no one was around, then he prompted, \u201cHurry up and get dressed, and I\u2019ll call to book the seats.\u201d He turned around and was ready to guard the door.Di Qiuhe glanced at the clothes He Bai had worn and the pile of shopping bags in his arms, he was so disappointed as his wishful thinking of \u201cthey were unable to suppress their emotions when getting off their clothes at the car together\u201d went down to the drain and vanished into pieces of fragments.It was crowded everywhere on the holiday. After a careful selection, He Bai finally chose a private home cuisine place where was less hustle.It was two p.m. after dinner. Di Qiuhe got on car with He Bai and drove toward D District.On their way back, He Bai, who was satiated, fell asleep once again. When he woke up, he saw no hotel gate but an unfamiliar villa resort.\u201cThere are two days left for us. Instead of going back to cope with Dong Ni, we should relax here.\u201d Di Qiuhe explained while unfastening He Bai\u2019s seat belt. \u201cI reserved a small yard. Let\u2019s get some privacy.\u201dHe Bai was in a daze until catching the name of the resort, he then woke up at once. He was totally brightened up and elated, \u201cHot Spring? There are hot springs? Can we take a bath in hot springs?The three questions in succession had fully revealed his excitement.Knowing He Bai was satisfying, Di Qiuhe smiled and nodded to response, \u201cOf course, and there\u2019re sundry palatable food.\u201d\u201cChildish Di, how cool you\u2019re!\u201d He Bai patted Di on the shoulder in great joy, then stepped out of the car first and was pleased to stretch himself.A holiday consisted of hot springs and palatable food. How comfortable!It was a chic courtyard that Di Qiuhe had reserved, of which the scenery was awesome inside. There was a small building in the courtyard, and the only master bedroom there could catch sight of the open-air hot spring pool in the courtyard when the door was opening. The spacious corridor outside the master bedroom was covered with floors, seducing the passing residents to climb up and roll them over and over.He Bai put on a bathrobe for he could never withstand such temptation. He laid prone on the corridor and reached his hands out to feel the hot spring, only to find that his arm was not that long enough.\u201cWe\u2019ll have some vegetable dishes for dinner.\u201d Di Qiuhe suggested, sat down beside He Bai in a bathrobe, smoothed He\u2019s untidy hair and laughed, \u201cOnly then did I find that your hair are somewhat naturally curly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: Villa Resort (2)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cIt is curled when I was sleeping!\u201d He Bai turned his head and pulled Di\u2019s hand away, he rolled himself over to lie on the floor like the shape of the Chinese character \u2018Da\u2019 (on the back with outstretched arms and legs), just like a starfish, sighing, \u201cThat\u2019s a vacation called by its right name. Someone waits there to serve me, all I need to do is off my feet to eat and drink, appreciate the scenery before my eyes as well.\u201dDi Qiuhe smiled, he lay down next to He Bai, staring together at the wooden roof in the corridor, whispered, \u201cRight, that\u2019s the right way to enjoy a vacation.\u201d He meant that, staying with He Bai without sorrow and anxiety, all he needed to do was devoted himself to please the other.The past twenty-three years was occupied by infighting and plot, which kept him in suspense. Neither his home nor family could be called as it meant to be. Furthermore, he may forfeit everything he got in a trivial mistake.He used to perceive that was his destined life, full of contest, conspiracy and plot...He never thought he would fall in love with someone, let alone having a family. There were only two of his future assumptions: being defeated in the infighting, and giving up to the bitter and humble life; or making a clean sweep, and leaving the life to the one who against him.But he had Pup now. Although the infighting was going on, there was a new choice for him to let go of the old memories that were too bitter to recall. Now he\u2019s got a new choice of a happy life to spoil and stay with Pup.The courtyard was quiet except for the rustle of running water and wind through the leaves.\u201cPup.\u201d He called suddenly and looked sideways at the one lying beside him.\u201cHuh?\u201d He Bai seemed to be particularly sleepy, narrowing his eyes for drowsiness.\u201cStay with me.\u201d Di Qiuhe replied, moving his hand to firmly grasp He Bai\u2019s waistband of the bathrobe little by little. \u201cStay with me and don\u2019t betray me. I\u2019ll give you whatever you want, just keep true to yourself.\u201dThe mesmerizing sound of running water, together with Di\u2019s gentle and low voice, finally a drowsy feeling crept over He Bai. He turned over and let up on his eyes, seeming had got what Di Qiuhe just said, also seeming he didn\u2019t hear anything. There was a vague response.\u201cI\u2019ve got your promise.\u201d Di Qiuhe turned sideways, looking at He\u2019s peaceful sleeping face, approached to kiss He on the head, \u201cPup, I like you, can you like me in return?\u201dOwing to sleeping too much during the day, He Bai woke up at three o\u2019clock in the morning. He then found that the well-behaved Di Qiuhe lay beside him, holding the waistband of his bathrobe, as if for fear that he might run away at night.Failing to fall asleep again, he took out his belt gently, got up and opened the door facing the courtyard, then went out and stood in the corridor to take a deep breath of the cool night air.He was a bit hungry.He cast back Di calling him to get up for dinner when he was in a daze last night. But he seemed to kick Di out impatiently and turned over and fell asleep soon.There came an ineffable sense of guilty.Two dim-light lanterns were hanging at the gate of the courtyard, dangling in the night breeze, as pleasing as a painting.He Bai was tempted, turned back into the room for the camera, and then strolled out of the courtyard.The housekeeper serving them cropped up at this time, wittingly withdrew from disturbing his night trip after handing him a thermal hamper.He Bai expressed his thanks in surprise. He then found a small pavilion to relax in, opened the hamper for food to fill up his belly. He got up after the housekeeper appeared again to take the hamper away. He then strolled around the elegant resort with camera.He had not photographed any night scenery since his rebirth. Therefore, he was so engaged that he took no notice of stepping into the depth of the villa.\u201cWhere is Fan Da?\u201dA nice but flirtatious male\u2019s voice came across behind a rockery. He Bai halted and was about to turn-back to leave.\u201cI\u2019ve got it. He\u2019s in a sanatorium in country V, and has been a little dateless.\u201d Said another male in a slightly hoarse voice dripping with sarcasm, seemingly despising the other one. \u201cI\u2019ve done whatever you asked, Di Xiasong. Please send a word to your mother, telling her to stop being bossy, otherwise, I\u2019ll make an accomplice of Qin Mingqiang!\u201dHe Bai paused at once and looked sideways at the other side of the rockery.What did he just hear? Di Xiasong? The brother of Qiuhe\u2019s? Wasn\u2019t the guy studying abroad? Why the guy was here? Or did he get it wrong?Just when he was suspecting, the first male joked in an intimate tone, which was totally different to the last minute, \u201cUncle Zeng, you\u2019re absolutely regarding me as an outsider if you say that. I know you\u2019re somewhat displeased for my disturbance, but I have no choice. I have to rush back to country Y for my lessons tomorrow. Please forgive me.\u201d\u201cStop putting on an act. You cannot even hold a candle to your brother.\u201d The man called Uncle Zeng snorted and sneered, \u201cYour mother cuckolded me and left without consideration for me. Now she wants to take advantage of me, but dares not even come out in person. It really disgusts me of sending you, a little brat out here. Well, shall I perceive that you are the zygote once I put in her belly? Ah, you? Am I blind or foolish? Get out and never ever come here. I want my place clean!\u201dHe Bai was dumbfounded, feeling it difficult to digest the mass information. He kept close to the rockery and showed up until the other\u2019s footsteps faded away.\u201cNauseous scoundrel!\u201d The other one left from the other direction after a low curse.He Bai heaved a sigh, tightened his camera. After making sure that they had left, he turned around and walked quickly toward the courtyard he lived, following his memory.When he returned, the lights in the small building were on, while Di Qiuhe was walking out in a hurry in seriousness.\u201cWhy are you getting up so early?\u201d He Bai opened the door and greeted Di. Then he stepped up and pulled the man who stopped to look up. He pulled him into the building and expounded quickly, \u201cYou\u2019re just in time. I have something to tell you. I just woke up and went out for a walk with my camera. You know, I happened to hear something terrific. Seriously, do you know Fan Da?\u201dWith the arm dragged and the man he cared about right there, the frightened Di Qiuhe waking up from finding He no longer by his side gradually. However, he paused and frowned after hearing that. \u201cFan Da is my grandfather, and he has been missing for years. How do you...\u201d\u201cYour grandfather?\u201d He Bai was stunned, and soon realized that something was wrong. He quickened his pace to pull Di into the room. After making sure that the wall had no ears, he made a quick repeat of the conversation he had heard and asked, \u201cDo you know Zeng Peizhong?\u201dDi Qiuhe shook his head, then took out his mobile phone and made several calls to his subordinates after he\u2019s done some sober reflection, then he sized up He Bai, with an eccentric look.He Bai, nervous as he was, strolled back secretly and queried, \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem of you?\u201d\u201cPup.\u201d Di Qiuhe stretched forward his hand, pinching He Bai\u2019s face gently, \u201cAre you really a man but not some spirit who come to repay my kindness?\u201d Everything from helping him to be the film\u2019s leading actor, to counter shooting with the \u201cpup\u201d arazzi in the apartment\u2019s elevator, to shooting Qin Li at the airport last time, and to now getting the whereabouts of his grandfather by chance. By the way, Pup\u2019s \u201cDream\u201d of the virus events in the border province had also helped him a lot...How amazing. It\u2019s just like God awarded him a golden finger named He Bai for compensating his frustrating life.He Bai disdained to pull down Di\u2019s hand in a seemingly annoyed manner and sneered. \u201cIf I were some spirit, I would eat you off first but not indulge you to piss me off all the time.\u201dDi Qiuhe was well aware of that he was a helpless man. He thought He Bai\u2019s every particular gesture and behavior were so cute that he couldn\u2019t help approaching and ambiguously suggested, \u201cThen eat, I\u2019m wholly clean and fresh.\u201dDi came so close that he could see clearly every single eyelash of He Bai, who paused and got closer.Di Qiuhe was nearly falling into temptation. He was stunned while his heart beat faster than normal, and his Adam\u2019s apple budged when staring at the red lips close by.\u201cYou...\u201d He Bai suddenly stated.Staring the seductive lips, Di Qiuhe was a little feverish, then asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGum in the eyes.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cIs that the clean you mean?\u201d He Bai retreated.Di Qiuhe\u2019s ears were flushed. He raised a hand to rub his eyes, but found nothing, then looking at He Bai at loss.Click.He Bai put down his camera and toppled on the tatatami in laughter.Di Qiuhe raised his eyebrows and rushed to rub He\u2019s waist until realizing that he had been tricked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: Villa Resort (3)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai floundered to dodge.They made a noise until He Bai\u2019s face got tense from laughing. Di Qiuhe then took a cold bath in a sour face.After breakfast, He Bai saw that Di Qiuhe showed no sign of packing up and leaving. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou are not going to find your grandfather? Judging from their conversation, it seems that they are scheming something.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve sent someone over there.\u201d Di Qiuhe searched out a horror film and clicked on the Play, and signaled the place beside. \u201cCome here, let go everything messy when we\u2019re on vacation.\u201dHe Bai climbed over and doubted, \u201cIs it messy?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Di Qiuhe remained unmoved and there was no joy of knowing his grandfather\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cMy grandfather was a tough investor who enjoyed freedom. Thus he was sick of my mother for fettering him. Afterwards, he entrusted his child to the care of his friend after my grandmother died of illness. He paid them on a regular basis and pursued his free and easy travel around the world.\u201dHe Bai: \u201c...\u201d That was definitely a father beyond evaluation.\u201cMy father\u2019s father, or say grandpa, was the one who took my mom in. When my mom grew up and married my dad, my grandfather cut off contact with my family once and for all.\u201d Di Qiuhe explained peacefully, added, \u201cDepending on my grandfather\u2019s sufficient funds, my grandpa was finally able to set up Huangdu in the first place. Thus I wholly understand my father\u2019s fear of me and hatred of my mother. Seriously speaking, Huangdu was co-founded by Di and Fan family, and I\u2019m one of Fan.\u201dHe Bai frowned.\u201cAlthough my grandfather was not the responsible type, he was truly open-minded about money and willing to spend money on his daughter, whose dowry was utterly generous, let alone the sumptuous wedding ceremony. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why Qin Li is jealous. She was an unmarried pregnant concubine when coming to my family. Neither she nor my father did dare to have a wedding, nor my grandpa allow it.\u201dThe horror film was playing, but no one was watching.He Bai sorted out the information he got and asked, \u201cWhat does Qin Li want to do now through entrusting her, oh, her old lover to trace your grandfather?\u201d\u201cAs I said, my grandfather was a great investor.\u201d Di Qiuhe looked at He Bai and pointed to the face. \u201cHe was rich and not begrudged to spend money on his children. But he was ignorant of when my mother gave birth to me, what I look like, or the news that my mother died long ago or Di Bian and Qin Li are couple now. I\u2019m so much like my mother. Whereas Di Xiasong looks like Di Bian. What do you think my grandfather will do if Di Xiasong pretended to be me to visit my grandfather?\u201cTransfer the possession of all his property to the grandchildren he has never met.\u201d He Bai replied, then collapsed in the Lazy Sofa and sighed, \u201cZeng Peizhong said that your grandfather was a bit dateless...Holy shit. Then they could do whatever as they pleased.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you a grateful spirit from nowhere, who brings me unexpected pleasure.\u201d Di Qiuhe stretched out his hand to catch hold of He Bai\u2019s bathrobe belt again, squinted at the screen playing horror film while his thoughts drifting away. Finally he murmured, \u201cI thought my grandfather had died in a remote beautiful country...That will be fine. He\u2019s been free all his life, and it\u2019s time to let him know, in those irresponsible years he had spent, what had his only daughter that the woman he loved gave birth to had experienced.He Bai looked at him sideways, raised his hand and patted him on the shoulder for comfort.Everything about Fan Da seemed to be just an episode that they forget about minutes later. They were still on vacation mode by means of watching the film, reading books and enjoying hot springs.When the housekeeper came to deliver dinner, Di Qiuhe spoke highly of the resort. And then, he queried who the owner of the resort was casually. He praised that the owner was so talented to manage such a distinctive resort.The housekeeper had never expected it as drawing secret out of him. He complimented his boss in the same way and gave them a basket of high-end fruits for appreciating their favorable comments.After dinner, He Bai soaked himself in the hot spring and watched Di Qiuhe take out his phone. Di was quite calm, telling someone about the secret meeting between Di Xiasong and the owner of the villa that he happened to see at the resort.Di Bian expressed his misdoubt! Somewhere must be wronged!Di Qiuhe repeatedly agreed, and then recommended the resort. Finally he showed filial piety that he must invite Di Bian to have a good time here if Di Bian had time off.Di Bian responded perfunctorily and hung up the phone in a hurry.He Bai watched Di Qiuhe throw away his mobile phone and shook his head. \u201cChildish Di, you are so cunning.\u201dDi Qiuhe took off his bathrobe and sat in the hot spring. He then took a cup of juice, wobbled it and took a sip, squinted and said, \u201cDi Xiasong brings such a good vulnerable point to me, if I don\u2019t make good use of it, shall it be a waste of your early morning outing?\u201dHe Bai snorted and hummed, \u201cAren\u2019t I doing you a great favor?\u201d\u201cA super one.\u201d Di Qiuhe looked at him and smiled lazily and pleasantly. Put aside Fan Da first. Zeng Peizhong, an old lover of Qin Li. Once Di Bian knew she let Di Xiasong met Zeng under the table, he was prone to suspect Di Xiasong, and then the veneer of mutual respect between Qin family and Di Bian should be torn off...Despite Di Xiasong resembled to Di Bian, once he was suspicious of Di Xiasong, there will be no more trust.The dim light, the vapor on the hot spring, the handsome man who glanced at somewhere sideways, such is life.He was desperate to snap the impressive scene, yet the camera was in the room, so he could only suppress the impulse and acted coquettishly, \u201cThen, why don\u2019t you thank me with a big red envelope, or I\u2019ll turn around and sell you.\u201dDi Qiuhe could not help laughing and murmuring, \u201cYou are so cute, Pup.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d He Bai didn\u2019t catch the words.\u201cI said.\u201d Di raised his voice, leaned over the edge of the pool, looking at him smilingly. \u201cIf you want a red envelope, beg me.\u201dHe Bai scattered the water toward at once to his indignation, \u201cYou stingy asshole.\u201dThe leisure vacation was always transient. On the last day of the vacation, wore glowing ruddy cheeks, they left the resort and drove back to the hotel.\u201cIt\u2019s so kind of the housekeeper of sending us another basket of fruit before checking out.\u201d He Bai, in the co-driver seat, picking up the peaches in the basket, casually asked, \u201cBy the way, how did it take you so long to check out this morning? Are there many check-outs?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Di Qiuhe responded without thinking and looked in the rearview mirror at the housekeeper seeing them off. He recalled the morning conversation with Zeng Peizhong and then smiled.Everyone could be allies as long as one could give what the others need. This resort belonged to Zeng Peizhong. Once someone he sent to country V took Fan Da away secretly, Di Xiasong and Zeng Peizhong would surely realize that somewhere was wrong and got down to check out. He and Pup made no preparation before that, instead of being find out later, which may get Pup into trouble, it was better to take the initiative to be explicit now and won over Zeng Peizhong as well as developed Zeng into an ally, who was obviously dissatisfied with the mother and son.After returning to the hotel, He Bai went back to the room to rest, while Di Qiuhe went to director Jiang and others for a small meeting.They had a good night. And early the next morning, He Bai followed Di Qiuhe to the film set with great enthusiasm.\u201cIt\u2019s a chase-and-run battle today, there are scenes of climbing up and down on the balcony and house. Qiuhe, you have the experience of Wire stunt, it\u2019s your responsibility to take care of Dong Ni.\u201d Jiang instructed and emphasized, \u201cAccording to the plot, you two have already had feelings for each other, and there should be many a lot eye contacts during the pursuit. Qiuhe, the role Cheng Jun is reserved but not explicit, affectionate but not greasy. Have you got it?Di Qiuhe looked at He Bai with a camera beside him and nodded stiffly.Jiang Guanshan then turned to Dong Ni. \u201cThe role Tu Xiu you are playing considers Cheng Jun as a drug dealer. She\u2019s confused by love and hate. Thus you should let out your struggle through your eyes. The first scene starts from the middle of the plot, and it may be difficult for you to get into. But don\u2019t worry, Qiuhe has got you.\u201d He then looked at Di Qiuhe, with eyes full of trust.Dong Ni looked at Di Qiuhe in the same way.He Bai raised his camera toward them.Di Qiuhe: \u201c...\u201d He was stressed out to perform a lovey dovey scene with a woman who obviously yearned for him before his sweetheart.\u201cQiuhe, come on!\u201d He Bai waved his fist in a tone full of anticipation and excitement about the imminent gaining of knowledge.\u201c...\u201d As ill luck would have it, his sweetheart was putting a cat among the pigeons in high spirit beside.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: Popsicle (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkHe Bai stood next to Jiang Guanshan, and he suddenly got a bit nervous while looking at Di Qiuhe who stood on the balcony on the second floor in the front.The action choreographer and the securities were doing the final check and the dresser was working on his makeup and clothes. Di Qiuhe\u2019s eyes were closed as if he was building up his mood. The smiling between his eyes was drawn back deliberately that he looked quite thoughtful and steady.The first take was Di Qiuhe\u2019s monodrama. According to the former blockings, he needed to run out from the room first and then looked back at the pursuing troops. After that, he should jump out of the balcony on the second floor and fell on the plastic roof of the first floor. Then he should pull out his leg to grab the window frame on the first floor after rolling on the ground, and flashed into the alley right after.It wasn\u2019t that easy to shoot those scenes that might not even last for only a few seconds in the final film.A few minutes later, the dresser left with his cosmetic kit. The action choreographer and other staff had made the final check and they were packing their stuff to leave gradually. Jiang Guanshan waved and all the staff on each position were ready quickly. They were ready to start the shooting right after he and Di Qiuhe gave the sign.Finally, Di Qiuhe was the only one left in the scene. He adjusted his body and turned to look downstairs.Jiang Guanshan gave him an \u201cOkay\u201d sign.Di Qiuhe nodded and waited for a second. Then he put his eyes on He Bai who was dumbly holding a camera and looking at him without blinking.He Bai waved his hand as he saw him looking at himself, and he said a silent \u201cfighting\u201d with his mouth moving. He then held up his camera and pretended to take a snap, meaning he would take good pictures for him.Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help raising his lips and his eyes were full of smile. The gentleness covered deliberately before had now been revealed unconsciously, and some staff was blushing as they were overwhelmed by how handsome Di Qiuhe was.Dong Ni\u2019s eyes flashed and she was blushing as well because he was indeed handsome. And he was totally different from her fat and greasy sponsor who kept on gazing at her.Jiang Guanshan looked around the environment and made a strong cough and stared at Di Qiuhe angrily. He then clapped to tell them the shooting was about to start.Di Qiuhe arranged his emotions immediately and withdrew his stare from He. He hid half of his body in the room after taking a few steps back.He Bai grabbed his camera tightly and couldn\u2019t help holding his breath.There was also a camera stand inside the room, and it was charged by the deputy director. The continuity called the scene number and clapped the clip stick to kick off the shooting.The atmosphere around Di Qiuhe changed promptly along with the shooting. He ran to the balcony with his eyebrows tightly knitted and looked at the pursuing troops seriously. His fist was getting hard and he abruptly pushed against the rails on the balcony and jumped down agilely.He Bai had totally forgotten that he was there to do his assignment that he couldn\u2019t help looking at that vigorous shadow falling down. His heart was beating so fast out of worry.Landing safely on the roof, Di Qiuhe rolled on the ground without a break. He then grabbed the window frame on the first floor and disappeared after stepping on it to flash into the alley near the side of the house.\u201cCut! Pass!\u201dDirector Jiang waved and then the staff ran into the alley immediately to check on Di Qiuhe. He Bai couldn\u2019t help but follow them up.There were some mats prepared in the alley, so Di Qiuhe was actually falling on them after he flashed agilely into the alley in the camera. He was about to stand up with the help of those staff when He Bai rushed into him.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He Bai ran into him and grabbed his arm to scan with his eyebrows furrowed.Di Qiuhe was struck for a second and laughed happily. He pressed his hand back and consoled him, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. They have checked the security for so many times. No worries.\u201d He was just so addicted to this feeling of being cared for by his lover. That was just so fresh and addictive.The pressing hand was too intimate for He Bai that he was struck for a while. The action choreographer came to grab Di Qiuhe\u2019s wrist and asked him to make a few gestures to check if he was alright from the falling. He Bai\u2019s weird feeling then disappeared right after.Maybe it was a shooting habit to tell them that he was alright by making gestures after shooting.He thought that way and drew his hand back to keep some distance with Di Qiuhe. He then held up his camera and took a picture of Di Qiuhe talking with the action choreographer.Di Qiuhe heard the sound of the shutter click while he was feeling depressed because of his empty hand. He couldn\u2019t help looking back and then he felt that his empty heart was getting a refill.He Bai pressed the shutter again and moved away the camera to smile at him.Di Qiuhe smiled back and the love in his eyes was about to overflow.It was getting weirdly sweet. Dong Ni was holding a bottle of water and trying to get closer to him. She looked at those two people who were smiling at each other, and she couldn\u2019t help stopping herself but then was pushed aside by some staff arranging the set.\u201cDong Ni! Where is Dong Ni? It is about to be your turn! Come here again and check the blockings!\u201d The deputy director called somewhere on the other side.Therefore, the ignored Dong Ni suddenly became the spotlight in the crowd, although not that kind of fancy spotlight.All of the staff knew that she was still raw yet with some kind of unspeakable background. They also knew that on her first day in D district she didn\u2019t visit the director but she knocked on the door of Di Qiuhe early in the morning when the others were still in their dreams. She said she was trying to check the script with him. What a piece of insincere raw meat!Luckily Di Qiuhe didn\u2019t stay alone in a room because he was hosting his junior who was visiting him. And there were no reporters lurking outside as this was a closed shooting. So there were not weird scandals coming out.Director Jiang hated it the most when scandals of the actors spreading out even before the film was released. Was Dong Ni trying to challenge director Jiang\u2019s fierceness of scolding people that she was now trying so hard to get closer to Di Qiuhe with a bottle of water?Dong Ni felt quite embarrassed by people\u2019s staring that she laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll just go check on my blockings.\u201dShe left right after as if she was just passing by.\u201cIt is not common to see a novice trying to familiarize the shooting procedures before so that not to cause trouble to the others. Ms. Dong is very dedicated.\u201dDi Qiuhe suddenly sighed and looked at He Bai gently, \u201cI still need to take a few close-ups for these set of shots. You can get closer by chance to get more familiar with your camera, and don\u2019t forget about your assignment.\u201dThe embarrassment was suddenly gone. And all the staff was looking at Di Qiuhe in a praising way as he found an excuse for the novice to ease the situation. He also changed the topic smoothly into caring for his visiting junior and telling him to do his assignment. How considerate, gentle and thoughtful Mr. Di was that he lighten up the atmosphere!The crowd was won over immediately.He Bai squinted at Di Qiuhe, \u201cThis dude...he is putting on an act again.\u201dDi Qiuhe smiled gently and he looked exactly like an elegant gentleman.He Bai rolled his eyes and spat secretly in his heart.It was quite a trivial thing to take close-ups that it took about 4 or 5 times for Di Qiuhe to finish all the shots needed. He Bai was so worried while watching it as the task was too hard to take. No wonder Di Qiuhe was so toned, he might have failed to finish the exhausting shooting task otherwise.Dong Ni had finished her blockings on the other side and she was shooting the demo for her first shot which was a basic chasing scene on the street.\u201cThe next one is the love scene.\u201d After talking with director Jiang, Di Qiuhe went behind He Bai who was holding his camera to take snaps of Dong Ni. He put his chin on his head and rubbed on it as he was a bit taller and standing on the stairs as well.He Bai was struck and hit his waist without thinking, saying with dislike, \u201cStop rubbing on me! Your face is covered with sweat and foundation. Dare you to do your tricks again I\u2019m gonna take a lot of ugly snaps of you and post them online!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: Popsicle (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe laughed and stepped back from his hit. He then moved his jaw away from him and flipped his hair, saying, \u201cThe dresser said my skin is in good condition so it looks weird with foundation. Therefore, he only applied some concealer on my face, no foundation at all.\u201d\u201cHow thick-skinned you are! Don\u2019t you blush to say that?\u201d He Bai couldn\u2019t take snaps for Dong Ni because of his interruption, so he just put down the camera and turned over to look at him. He then looked around that surreal filming site and came up with an idea. He pointed at a phone booth by the street and raised his chin to him, \u201cGo stand there and lean on it. Oh, by the way, does Cheng Jun, the character you play smoke?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Di Qiuhe guessed his intention and walked there on his command and looked at him with smiles, \u201cBut I don\u2019t have one with me.\u201d\u201cBe serious!\u201d He Bai asked for one cigarette from a passing-by staff and put it into his mouth. He then took a few steps back to adjust for better light and angle and said while checking the camera, \u201cYou are Cheng Jun instead of Di Qiuhe now. Stay in character.\u201dDi Qiuhe bowed and giggled and then raised his head, hiding all his smile and slightly frowning his eyebrows. As he still kept the instinct of a soldier, his back was still quite straight even if he\u2019s leaning on the phone booth. However, since he needed to cover as a drug dealer who did all the nasty things, he pretended to look cruel and vicious by biting a cigarette in his mouth.Yes, biting, not holding. And there you saw how cruel and vicious he was.A total stranger with exactly the face of Di Qiuhe showed up in the camera.He Bai couldn\u2019t help holding his breath. He soon changed his mind of taking a few random pictures and got serious and tried to adjust the angle more carefully.\u201cCheng Jun.\u201d He asked all of a sudden.\u201cYes?\u201d The man who was biting on a cigarette looked over. His deep eyes were full of mysterious emotions.\u201cWill you come back alive?\u201dThe man was struck and made a careless smile and said in a low voice, \u201cWho knows.\u201d\u201cBe alive.\u201dThe man looked over again without smiling.\u201cCome back alive.\u201dThe man moved his eyes and took off his cigarette. He stayed silent for a long while and nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dClick.Then it came to the applause.Both He Bai and Di Qiuhe were struck. One dropped his camera and the other was over the acting mode quickly. Then they looked to where the sound came from together.Jiang Guanshan put down his hand and walked to them with the script. He looked at He Bai and asked, \u201cDid you read the script?\u201dHe Bai nodded and replied with a bit uncertainty, \u201cYes. My master showed me a part of it and I also looked through Qiuhe\u2019s script. Is it forbidden? Just relax director Jiang, I won\u2019t speak out a word about it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous.\u201d Jiang Guanshan smiled and asked for his camera to check on those photos he just took. Then he nodded and said benignly, \u201cYou just had quite a good feeling about those lines with Qiuhe. I would have given this role to you if you weren\u2019t talking the main actress\u2019s lines.\u201dHe Bai waved his hand hastily and said humbly that it was too flattering, and he was just doing that on a random impulse with Qiuhe, and\u2026Di Qiuhe had a thought and looked at He Bai then put his hand on his shoulder, saying ambiguously, \u201cRelax my heroine, I will come back alive to you no matter what. I love you so much after all.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s eyebrows cramped and he pushed him away then threatened him by waving his fist. What a naughty piece of junk!Di Qiuhe sneered and raised his eyebrows. He knew he could never beat him up and he would surrender on purpose, so he was just being provocative like a child.He Bai really wanted to punch him.\u201cYou two are really close to each other.\u201d Jiang Guanshan stopped an upcoming domestic violence just on time. He smiled and returned the camera to He Bai, saying, \u201cNow I seem to understand why old Xu insisted on having you on his own instead of giving you to someone else. He, do you want to join the crew and help me shoot the poster and promotion pictures for this film?\u201dHe Bai\u2019s mouth was wide open and his hand was shaking that he almost fell the camera off. Di Qiuhe caught it immediately and seized that chance to touch his hand.\u201cDi...director Jiang, so, so you mean you want me to...to...\u201d That was too big a surprise for He Bai that he couldn\u2019t help stuttering.That was a film poster! A film poster for a director Jiang film!A director Jiang film would definitely be shown abroad as he was an international-awarded director. And the film would definitely go for the award competition. By then the poster and promotion pictures of this film would appear in every cinema home and abroad. Also they would be seen and studied by those judges of major awards.What did that mean? That meant that if he shot the post of this film successfully, his name would appear in front of the eyes of the audience here and abroad, also those top practitioners in the film industry!Mostly, if he shot the poster successfully, his position as a photographer in the entertainment industry would be leveled up a lot!From shooting clothes to the album cover, and then to the shooting of film poster, he was walking in a totally different way than before. And that meant he had an unlimited future in his career! The scope of his choice of work had expanded to more fields that he could choose which work to do instead of the other way around!The prerequisite for all of those was to shoot the film poster for director Jiang\u2019s film successfully!\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Jiang Guanshan was amused by his reaction and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t your master tell you? Your assignment for this time was a test. If you can have a nice work that satisfies him and me, then you can shoot the poster for this film. But, if anyone of us is not satisfied, then you need to practice longer. And we will let you try again after a few months when the film is about to be finished. I just saw your pictures, they were great. I think your master must feel the same, so you have passed the test and got the poster shooting.\u201dHe Bai would have never thought that there was another meaning in his shooting assignment for this time. He was surprised and thrilled by the trust of his master.He recalled that the master told him to study about posters when he was just starting to learn group photograph. Now he suddenly understood and felt so touched and grateful that he almost said yes to this offer right away. But he also thought about his study and the job at Yi Ka, so he restrained and said embarrassed, \u201cDirector Jiang, thank you for giving me this opportunity, and I\u2019d love to shoot the film poster. But about joining the crew, I...\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Popsicle (3)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cI know you\u2019re worried.\u201d Jiang Guanshan interrupted him and said benignly, \u201cAs a student, you should focus on your study, so we don\u2019t need to hurry about the film poster shooting. You can go back to school to talk with your master, and then tell me a proper time for you to do it.\u201dHe Bai finally heaved a sigh of relief heavily, and he immediately told him that he would go back to school and discuss it with his master.There were some issues in Dong Ni\u2019s shooting scene, so Jiang Guanshan left right after that on the deputy director\u2019s call.He Bai couldn\u2019t suppress his excitement any more and gave Di Qiuhe a couple of heavy punches. He had a big ear-to-ear smile on his face and said, \u201cQiuhe, I\u2019m gonna shoot a film poster! This is my first formal commercial group photograph work!\u201d\u201cPuppy is so impressive.\u201d Di Qiuhe smiled as well. He then pressed his head and rubbed him when he stopped his punching. He was so excited that he wished he could hug him into his arms and rub him all over. But his beloved puppy could become so aggressive when he was excited, and that meant he could suffer from \u201cdomestic violence\u201d. So he held his emotion and said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you with the crew, you just come here quickly.\u201d He had got used to seeing his puppy every minute after the few days being together. Director Jiang\u2019s offer was indeed a big pie in the sky, and so was it to him.Wang Boyi, the man who was standing behind them all the time was thinking, \u201cMr. Di, did you forget about your assistant is still here? You are now smiling like a silly puppy, and I see your reputation is collapsing...\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s excitement only lasted for ten minutes. After ten minutes, bumpy it was, Dong Ni had finally wrapped up her first scene, and they were going to have their first cooperation.Cheng Jun ran to the dock alone as he almost got rid of those cops chasing after him. He was stuck at the entrance of the lane by Tu Xiu who was played by Dong Ni and had a fierce quarrel with her. Tu Xiu begged Cheng Jun to surrender, yet Cheng Jun couldn\u2019t explain to her as he had got a mission to finish. The cops were catching up and Tu Xiu seemed to call for her companions for help. He could do nothing but to compromise and knocked her down when she approached him. He then left with the guilt and love of his beloved one, and went for the battle of life and death.That was a play that required a lot of emotional expressions. Both Dong Ni and the director were very stressed, but Di Qiuhe was feeling stressed out.\u201cIt\u2019s endless! Cheng Jun, if you are still a man then you shouldn\u2019t follow that way!\u201d Tu Xiu yelled at him and her eyes were full of tears. Her hairs fell scattered on her trembling shoulders and she was already on the verge of emotional collapse.Cheng Jun stood on the darker side and he could only keep silent as he couldn\u2019t explain anything to her.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Tu Xiu rubbed her face. She became quite determined and pointed her gun at him, \u201cCheng Jun, you forced me to do this...stay down and hands up! Do not resist!\u201d\u201cTu Xiu.\u201d Cheng Jun finally spoke to her. He walked one step further into the light with a gloomy face.Tu Xiu couldn\u2019t help but stepped back. She took her eyes off him and yelled again, \u201cFreeze! Hands up! Now!\u201d\u201cCut! Pass!\u201dDirector Jiang waved his hand and then all the nervous staff watching aside got relieved.This scene had been filmed many times, and if it still couldn\u2019t pass the whole crew would have been drowning in the dreadful atmosphere.\u201cLet\u2019s have a ten minutes break and then we take the last scene!\u201d Director Jiang tapped on the script and said.The crew held their nerve again and looked at each other. They all saw Di Qiuhe walking from the scene for a break, and they were wondering how tired it was for him to film that scene again and again with Dong Ni, as watching them filming was already quite tiring.Ugh...what a terrible job to train a rookie.He Bai passed the water to Di Qiuhe with his eyebrows furrowed and asked in a voice full of worries, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d In order to have a better light effect, Di Qiuhe had been standing in a dark place for long. The corner was quite suffocating as there was no wind, so he was sweating just standing there for a short time, which was indeed uncomfortable.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Even as a girl, Dong Ni didn\u2019t say she\u2019s tired. Then how come I can\u2019t outmatch her as a man?\u201d Di Qiuhe drank the water and consoled him with his joking and said in a relaxing tone, \u201cLittle Bai, I can rest after this scene. I\u2019m so sweaty and I want to change my clothes after work. Can you get them in my car for me?\u201dWang Boyi, the man who was standing aside the whole day, now jumped out to get some attention. \u201cMr. Di, I\u2019ll get them, you and Mr. He can just have some rest.\u201d Then he turned and strode away like a perfect personal assistant.Di Qiuhe was so speechless that he tried so hard to keep He Bai away from the last scene as it involved hugging. Maybe the assistant was too considerate for him.\u201cThen...\u201d He struggled for a second and came up with another excuse, \u201cLittle Bai, I want some cold water. You go.\u201dHe Bai took out a bottle of water from the minibar and put it into his hand. His eyebrows were still frowned and he said, \u201cI knew you would want something cold. Here, I asked assistant Wang to prepare it.\u201d\u201c......\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you drink it?\u201d He Bai was confused.Di Qiuhe opened the bottle and took a sip silently and said, \u201cAnd wet towel...\u201dHe Bai magically took out a small basin out of the minibar. There were water, ice and a white towel in the basin. He grabbed the towel and said while squeezing it, \u201cWhen the make-up artist comes to do your make-up later, don\u2019t rub your face too hard with this, just wipe your neck and shoulders. Got it?\u201d\u201cGot it. What about the fan...\u201d He was trying so hard.He Bai put the towel into his hand and took a little fan from behind the minibar. He opened it and pointed it to his body while avoiding the hair, telling him, \u201cYour hair can\u2019t be messy, so you can\u2019t use a big fan, just make it with this one.\u201dDi Qiuhe took a deep breath and looked at the minibar with hatred, \u201cHow come assistant Wang can be so considerate as a man?\u201d Cut his salary! I had to cut his salary! He usually wasn\u2019t so considerate like that!He Bai crossed his arms and looked at him in despise, \u201cSo a man can\u2019t be considerate? Why are you so sexist?\u201dDi Qiuhe was struck and he looked up at him carefully, then asked in a surprised and excited tone, \u201cWas it you who prepared all of these, wasn\u2019t it...\u201dHe Bai sneered at him and pushed him down to the resting chair, while he himself sat on a small stool nearby and took out a popsicle out of the minibar. He then stopped talking with him but sipping the popsicle and checking his camera.The little fan was blowing a cool breeze, and Di Qiuhe was getting a bit thirsty while watching He Bai sipping his popsicle. He took another mouthful of the cold water and then moved to him and said in a low voice, \u201cPuppy...\u201dHe Bai sneered.Di Qiuhe said, \u201c...I want a popsicle too.\u201dHe Bai stopped for a bit and licked the other half of his popsicle.Di Qiuhe just couldn\u2019t help swallowing his drool.\u201c...\u201d Wang Boyi returned and saw that scene and finally he felt there must be something wrong with Mr. Di.Di Qiuhe stood in front of the camera yet with that popsicle all over his mind. He tried to hypnotize himself and imagined that Dong Ni standing right in front of his to be the popsicle that was just licked by puppy. Then his face suddenly turned so constrained and lustful, which matched exactly Cheng Jun\u2019s feeling at that time.The continuity clapped the clip stick and started filming the last scene.Tu Xiu played by Dong Ni finally convinced Cheng Jun, and she dropped the gun and ran to Cheng Jun, wishing to hug her once-lost lover.Cheng Jun opened his arms to hold her. He then closed his arms and his hand moved slowly to touch her neck.The camera in charge of the close-up was moving closer gradually, but Di Qiuhe\u2019s body got suddenly frozen.\u201cCut!\u201d Director Jiang\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and he looked at Dong Ni and said, \u201cWhat are you doing? Tu Xiu was indeed very excited, but she hasn\u2019t confessed to Cheng Jun at the moment. So her hug was constrained and also with some caution! Why did you get so close to Qiuhe? And your face, don\u2019t go too close to his neck. Cheng Jun is a soldier, and he is a very vigilant one. Were you expecting to be pushed away by him that you stayed so close to his neck?\u201dDi Qiuhe stepped back earlier than director Jiang shouted out that \u201cCut!\u201d, and he was now wiping the lip print on his neck.Director Jiang was even more furious when seeing that and said angrily, \u201cWho is Dong Ni\u2019s make-up artist?! Why did you apply such a red lipstick on her? Wipe it off!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Popsicle (4)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cDirector, I didn\u2019t use any lipstick and I just put some lightener on her lips...\u201d The makeup artist explained to him fearfully that she was not to be blamed. Then all the staff looked at Dong Ni all at once.Dong Ni bit her lips and smiled awkwardly, explaining, \u201cI just put some...\u201d Actually, the lipstick wasn\u2019t bright, but a bit more watery than the one used by the makeup artist. That was just a trick of girls, but she was busted when Di Qiuhe wiped that lip print.She took a look at Di Qiuhe who went to his junior after wiping off the lip print. He seemed to speak something to the junior and his eyebrows frowned. Did she get that close to him that she even left some lipstick on him\u2026The first take failed and the second one started.Di Qiuhe made a fake action to knock on the neck of Dong Ni, and put her down when she passed out. He then looked at her in a complex way for a few seconds and turned to stride away.\u201cCut!\u201dDirector Jiang felt a bit dizzy and he scolded, \u201cDong Ni! Will someone fall down like that when he got knocked out? I told you to not get so close to Qiuhe. You did quite well when the action choreographer was checking it with you, and how come it doesn\u2019t work with Qiuhe now?\u201dHe Bai frowned and he felt a bit sympathy for Qiuhe because Dong Ni was obviously trying to throw herself at him on purpose.Di Qiuhe came close again when Dong Ni was getting scolded. He looked alright but complained in a poor tone, \u201cPuppy, that woman was taking advantage of me.\u201d Since he couldn\u2019t get puppy away, then he would try to explain his unwillingness by all means! He would try to disassociate himself from Dong Ni, and he would never let puppy misunderstand him!He Bai\u2019s lip twitched and he couldn\u2019t speak out a word to comfort him, although he knew that he was telling the truth. He felt that if he comforted him, he would fly to the moon.\u201cShe left her lip print on me and rubbed herself on me.\u201d Di Qiuhe said embarrassingly and took his hand to his chest as if he was a muscular bunny got bullied. \u201cPuppy, it feels as if there are some worms where she touched, come and get them off me.\u201dHe Bai finally couldn\u2019t stand and got rid of his hand and said bitterly, \u201cI think you enjoyed a lot. Stop making a scene!\u201d He would never believe that the cunning Di Qiuhe would fail to nail a new flesh trying to seduce him during the shooting. He was obviously just having fun!\u201cYou\u2019ve wronged me, puppy.\u201d Di Qiuhe got closer to him and explained in a careless way, \u201cI just gave her a chance to show herself.\u201d A rookie would never grow up without getting scolded.He Bai pushed him away in disgust and said while playing with the lanyard on his camera, \u201cStop playing around and go finish the shooting. Dong Ni is the leading actress and she mostly plays her part with you. If she keeps acting like that then you will be the one who suffers.\u201d\u201cAre you worried about me?\u201d Di Qiuhe kept getting closer and smiled. It seemed that he was finally satisfied with his jealous behavior, \u201cPuppy, just look how I nail her quickly.\u201dHe Bai rolled his eyes and didn\u2019t want to speak to him.Then the third scene started.Finally, Dong Ni didn\u2019t make any drama and the story went to the hugging.Realizing the sliding of Dong Ni\u2019s hand on his back, Di Qiuhe was struck and looked at the direction of He Bai. He bent down and said in a low voice that could only be heard by the two of them, \u201cDong Ni, you can win your sponsor\u2019s favor only because you look like his first love.\u201dDong Ni\u2019s body was suddenly struck.Di Qiuhe took the time to make that action of knocking on her neck and then hugged her tightly as in the script. He let go of her and kept saying in a low voice, \u201cSo you are not as important as you imagine. What kind of result are you expecting for a wicked and deceitful pet?\u201dDong Ni stared at him in surprise and fear, and she couldn\u2019t help grabbing the clothes on his back as support.\u201cHe boomed your popularity because it\u2019s convenient for him to do money laundry.\u201d Di Qiuhe slowly dragged off her hand and looked up, so that the camera could only catch his undemonstrative and soulful eyes. He said in a low voice, \u201cDon\u2019t mess around with me. He would worry if you keep tangling with me, so just stay cool. It\u2019s so easy to find a substitute that looks like you, and I can always find a way to let your sponsor dump you.\u201d Then he knocked on Dong Ni\u2019s funny bone and she suddenly got struck and fell down unconsciously, \u201cYou...\u201dDi Qiuhe bent down and held her for a second, asking, \u201cClose your eyes.\u201dDong Ni closed her eyes by instinct and fell down to the ground.Di Qiuhe drew back his hand and leaned his head to the direction of He Bai. He pretended to look at Dong Ni lying on the ground with sympathy and left after a few seconds.\u201cCut! Pass!\u201dDirector Jiang waved and he was surprised by their performance for this scene, \u201cYou caught exactly the feeling when Dong Ni was knocked over that she was so shocked yet hurt. Let\u2019s give some credit to Qiuhe. Please keep going!\u201dThe whole exhausted crew was so thrilled hearing his speech.Di Qiuhe walked back from the other side of the alley, and he helped Dong Ni stand up when she was still on the ground. He then pretended to not have seen her pale and bewildered face. Later, he greeted Jiang Guanshan and went back to He Bai, jumping to him, rubbing and complaining, \u201cPuppy, I\u2019m dirty now. Dong Ni\u2019s perfume was unpleasant.\u201d\u201cThen why are you rubbing it on me.\u201d He Bai finally came to himself from his last affectionate glance. Thinking about Dong Ni\u2019s face when she was carried away by her assistant, he frowned and pushed him, asking, \u201cWhat did you just say to Dong Ni? Why did she look so weird?\u201dDi Qiuhe smiled and blew on his ear, \u201cI told her that I am into men instead of women. Can\u2019t get hard facing women.\u201dHe Bai was struck and pushed him away. He rubbed his goosebumps coming from nowhere and grunted, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say you are the bottom and your little bird is just a decoration!\u201d He was so reckless to say that! What if Dong Ni bought some zombie fans to attack him!Di Qiuhe smiled and kept getting closer to him. He grabbed his hand and said ambiguously, \u201cThen touch it and see if it\u2019s a decoration.\u201dHe Bai dropped his hand off with disgust and finally accepted that he just had no sense of shame.\u201cFine, you have already seen my little bird, and you said it looks quite good.\u201d Di Qiuhe couldn\u2019t help getting conceited as he thought he was in Bai\u2019s good graces that day.Yet He Bai felt that he wanted to smash him.Wang Boyi who just came here to give them the water halted all of a sudden. His poker face was about to break down. He must have heard something wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Chicken Soup for the Soul (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkHaving followed closely the crew all the day, He Bai finally got a clear understanding of the working intensity of Di Qiuhe and was softened up when it occurred to him that Di Qiuhe had rushed back to B City immediately to apologize to him the moment his night shooting finished. However, his anger was stirred up within seconds.\u201cLet\u2019s go out to do late-night shopping!\u201d Di Qiuhe kept clinging to He Bai as soon as he finished a bath, his mind in a whirl, \u201cyou\u2019re returning to B city tomorrow, so there\u2019s little time left for us to wander the streets of D Area. The night fair is bustling and lively. You\u2019ll have fun.\u201dHe Bai plucked the card reader off the computer and turned it off. Then he got up, grabbed the pajamas collar of Di Qiuhe and ferociously pushed him to the bed, warning, \u201cLie still! Tell me what you\u2019d like for dinner, and I'll have Assistant Wang get it for you.\u201d After one day\u2019s filming, the guy was bound to take a rest instead of going shopping!Di Qiuhe lay down obediently but jumped out of bed in a flash, \u201cYou must be fed up with the box lunch. How about we go for a seafood feast? There\u2019s a century-old restaurant in D District, which serves good seafood. I can ask Assistant Wang to make a booking.\u201dHe Bai stared at him expressionlessly and began to take his clothes off.Di Qiuhe was dumbfounded and fell backwards on the bed after a slip. Surprised, happy and shy, he shifted his gaze from He Bai and turned his head within seconds. Watching the revealing lines of He Bai\u2019s body, Di Qiuhe stuttered, \u201cWhat\u2026 what do you take off your clothes for? Would\u2026 would you like\u2026?\u201dHe Bai threw the dirty clothes at Di Qiuhe\u2019s face, picked up his pajamas and said, \u201cI\u2019m tired and just want to sleep now. Please order a takeaway. I'll have it after a bath.\u201d Then he entered the bathroom without another word.A clunk.He Bai closed the door of the bathroom.Di Qiuhe held his breath and took the coat and T-shirt away from his face, his ears and face turning red. After a brief hesitation, he quickly buried his head in the clothes, and then got up from the bed, kept a straight face, found out his mobile phone and called Wang Boyi, \u201cAssistant Wang, go and buy some easily digested food.\u201d After hanging up, he glanced at the clothes on the bed, his fingers gripping the seam of his pajama firmly, and rushed to tidy the clothes away in a careful way, rubbing and blinking.\u2018Since Little Puppy got tired, maybe\u2026 maybe they can visit the night market next time. Today is the last night when he and Little Puppy shared the same bed, of which he must make better use... Wait, last night?\u2019Shyness, joyfulness, excitement and other emotions disappeared immediately and were replaced by sadness and reluctance to part with Little Puppy.Di Qiuhe put down the clothes in stunned silence, and in a few seconds his shoulders slowly drooped. He shot a sidelong glance at the half-packed luggage of He Bai, his eyes falling.Time flied. Little Puppy was about to go back...He Bai took a bath and walked out, only to find Di Qiuhe who was in high spirit before looked crestfallen, collapsing on the sofa by the window.Was he dying to go out? Did his words upset him so much?He Bai raised his eyebrows, put down the towel used for wiping his hair and sighed silently.Di Qiuhe was, after all, a restless young man. In contrast, he himself was in reality a middle-aged man who didn\u2019t like running around.\u201cAre you angry?\u201dHe Bai went to the sofa opposite and sat down, leaning forward to take a can of drink and another of beer and putting it on the small table between them. Then he gave Di Qiuhe the drink and picked up the beer himself, shaking and asking, \u201cHave a drink?\u201dDi Qiuhe cast a glance at him, stretched his arm to snatch the beer away from He Bai and changed it to a juice. Reclining in the sofa, he felt depressed and said, \u201cYou have a plane to catch tomorrow, so don\u2019t drink alcohol tonight.\u201dHe Bai tapped on the beverage can, raised his eyes and carefully sized Di Qiuhe\u2019s up. Holding his arm on the table, he asked smilingly, \u201cDon\u2019t want me to go?\u201dDi Qiuhe paused and shifted his gaze from He Bai.How childish he was!He Bai gave a faint smile, clinked glasses with Di Qiuhe and soothed him, \u201cI\u2019ll come to see you when I\u2019m free.\u201dHe thought carefully before adding, \u201cQiuhe, you\u2019ve been friends with few people, only me and Jiang Xiuwen, which is no good for you. It\u2019s quite rare to find close friends in the entertainment world, but it doesn\u2019t mean there are no sincere and honest persons. You can have a try and make a few more like-minded friends.\u201dHaving been closely associated with Di Qiuhe these days, He Bai came to realize that he had unconsciously developed a shut-in personality, which didn\u2019t mean he suffered autism or other physical or mental illness, but that he had been involuntarily rejecting intimate friendship with others.Di Qiuhe was indeed popular among the cast and crew. All the staff spoke highly of him, and co-actors always came to chat with him during the shooting. But He Bai observed clearly that Di Qiuhe tended to mask his true feelings and keep them at a distance.In a word, in Di Qiuhe\u2019s eyes, \u2018he can make friends with everyone, but no one is his true friend.\u2019This kind of life was quite tiring.He who kept hiding his emotions and giving no vent to his feeling would have psychological problem sooner or later.Di Qiuhe was in extraordinarily high spirit all the day, especially when faced with him. He Bai noticed that and thus intentionally cooperated with him, letting the man release his emotion. At this moment he was very glad that Di Qiuhe saw him as a bosom friend and had never masked his feelings in front of him.He really appreciated his trust and sincerity and hoped that Di Qiuhe could live a much easier life.\u2018It\u2019s quality rather than quantity that counts, as the old saying goes.\u2019 However, friends few in numbers would also cause a problem. Unlike partner, friend was unable to take into account each other\u2019s emotions constantly. The more relaxed and happier Di Qiuhe became when He Bai came over, the more depressed he would get after he left. He Bai believed that Di Qiuhe would adjust soon, but compulsive adjustment wasn\u2019t a pleasant experience.He Bai hoped that Di Qiuhe could have more friends, wear less masks and live a more relaxed and free life. He also hoped that after he left, Di Qiuhe would have more ways to vent his emotions instead of suppressing himself.On hearing He Bai\u2019s words, Di Qiuhe was stunned, his eyebrows frowned again. He stared at He Bai, pinched the drink can and said in a deep voice, \u201cI don\u2019t need more friends.\u201d For Di Qiuhe, considerable uncertainties existed about friendship. Without knowing what his fate would be, he didn\u2019t want to waste his energy on things like friendship. Besides, Little Puppy meant more than a friend to him.Di Qiuhe didn\u2019t like He Bai\u2019s look or his tone of voice, as if he was nothing but such a heavy burden on him that Little Puppy couldn\u2019t afford to shoulder and wished him off on to others.He Bai originally planned to share some chicken soup for the soul with him but chocked his words at the sight of his gaze.He wasn\u2019t Di Qiuhe, thus having no idea what he was thinking and what he wanted. At this moment He Bai suddenly realized that perhaps the life he considered tiring was the safest and most comfortable one for Di Qiuhe.\u2026 It seemed that we could never really put ourselves in others\u2019 shoes. Men tended to make indiscreet remarks on other people\u2019s life on the grounds that \u2018I did it for your good\u2019, which was in realty a stupid behavior that would easily cause burdens on others and make them unhappy.At least for now, he was quite sure that his \u2018good-for-you\u2019 utterance put Di Qiuhe in a worse mood.\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d He Bai touched the can in Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand, looked into his eyes and said, \u201cI was self-righteous. You\u2019re very nice, and thank you for your hospitality. I\u2019ve had a good time.\u201dLooking at his warm and apologetic gaze, Di Qiuhe felt his sadness and anger disappeared instantly. After a brief silence, he opened a can, gulped down a mouthful of drink, looked out of the window and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize. I know you care about me.\u201d Soft-hearted but straight-tempered, Little Puppy couldn\u2019t wish him on under the pretext that \u2018I did it for your good\u2019 but swiftly blacklisted the guy who he considered his burden.Little Puppy was genuinely concerned for him and changed his way immediately when he expressed a little unhappiness.This was the one he loved, a gentle and thoughtful person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Chicken Soup for the Soul (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkDi Qiuhe turned back. Watching He Bai\u2019s maturing face, he couldn\u2019t resist the impulse to kiss him. He put down the beverage can, got up and walked to He Bai. Puzzled, He Bai looked up at him, only to find that Di Qiuhe reached out to hold his shoulder and slowly bent down.Never had Di Qiuhe seen so nice a person like He Bai, so he decided to bare his heart now and endeavor to win He Bai\u2019s heart down until he fell in love with him. He would, if possible, even dote upon the man to extremes and spend the whole lifetime together.He Bai\u2019s eyes grew wide in astonishment. Looking at Di Qiuhe who rose all of a sudden and put one hand on his shoulder, he was scared stiff, slightly moving backwards, and said, \u201cQiuhe, I know it\u2019s quite annoying to inculcate chicken soup of the soul in you, but\u2026 but you don\u2019t need to give me a thrashing ...\u201d\u201cLittle Puppy,\u201d Di Qiuhe tightened up his hand expressionlessly and bent towards He Bai with a seemingly predatory gaze, \u201cSince you care about me so much, how about we\u2026?\u201dJingle-jingle.The doorbell rang, and Wang Boyi\u2019s voice came from outside, \u201cMaster Di, Mr. He, dinner is here.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s eyes lit up. He responded instantly, carefully pulled Di Qiuhe\u2019s hand away and said while running to the door, \u201cSit down, Qiuhe. I go to get dinner, and you\u2026 you drink something first.\u201dStuck on the affirmation, Di Qiuhe took a deep breath, slowly tightened his fists and looked at Wang Boyi, his teeth clenched, \u201cAssistance W-A-N-G, you\u2019re really quick!\u201d If only he\u2019d come back five minutes later!Wang Boyi was modest about his praise, \u201cThanks, it\u2019s my duty.\u201dShit!Di Qiuhe was choking with rage.How come his father selected such a stupid person who always missed his cue as his assistant! He wanted to give him a salary cut!After sending Assistant Wang away, He Bai found Di Qiuhe was more listless and almost stuffed the food into his nostrils.\u201cAre you tired?\u201d He Bai handed Di Qiuhe a tissue and patted him on the shoulder, coaxing, \u201cSorry, I shouldn\u2019t have remarked on your way of life. I\u2019m leaving tomorrow. Could you forgive me?\u201dDi Qiuhe lifted his eyelids to look at him, took the tissue and covered his face with it, \u201cNo, I thought you saw me as a burden and wished me on to others, which hurt me badly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The tone of voice sounded as if he\u2019d been abandoned. Di Qiuhe was really good at getting sympathy from him.\u201cMy stepmother is right. People like me deserve neither a happy life nor good friends.\u201d Di Qiuhe removed the tissue, gave He Bai a quick glance and added, \u201cas well as a steady partner and a loving family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d He Bai put down his chopsticks, feeling him full up.Di Qiuhe also laid down his and looked out of the window with a sad face, \u201cI ought to lead a rather solitary existence like a ghost until the end of my life... Oh!\u201dHe Bai stuffed a whole piece of shrimp meat into his mouth and compromised, \u201cTell me what you want!\u201dDi Qiuhe licked He Bai\u2019s fingers in a seemingly casual way when chewing on the shrimp meat, pointed to the bed and answered vaguely.He Bai clapped the table, \u201cSpeak clearly!\u201dDi Qiuhe swallowed the shrimp, and sadness on his face sunk without a trace. He said in a shy and well-behaved way, \u201cI want you to... to sleep beside me tonight.\u201d\u201c...\u201d He Bai began to consider the possibility of booking a flight and returning back now.\u201cAre you thinking about going back now? Do you want to abandon me after wishing me on? Little Puppy, how could you treat me like this?\u201d Di Qiuhe sat bolt upright, his eyebrows furrowed and his voice getting higher and higher. He pointed to the soup on the table, \u201cYou want to go, don\u2019t you? Ok! Drink this, and I\u2019ll let you go!\u201dHe Bai bowed his head and looked at the chicken soup when a feeling of regret crossed his mind.He shouldn\u2019t have shared chicken soup for the soul with the childish guy the night before he left! What he needed was not chicken soup but poisonous mushroom soup!\u201cAre you swearing at me secretly?\u201d Di Qiuhe narrowed his eyes, and a variety of expressions crossed his face, including sneer, self-depreciation, sadness and feigned calmness. Then he tilted his head and said, \u201cLittle Puppy, I know that I\u2019ve pestered you so that we\u2019re on familiar terms now, but you actually look down upon me.\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d He Bai couldn\u2019t bear him and interrupted his words. Then he gave Di Qiuhe a pat on his head, pushed him towards the bathroom and said ferociously, \u201cGo brush your teeth and lie on your bed!\u201dDi Qiuhe held on to the bathroom door, turned his head and stared at him with burning eyes.He Bai clenched his teeth, \u201cI\u2019ll cuddle you to sleep!\u201dDi Qiuhe loosened his grip and ran happily to the washing-stand to get his toothbrush.He Bai took a deep breath, banging the door behind him.Well, it\u2019s not strange for Di Qiuhe, one who hadn\u2019t received much maternal love since childhood, to make such a request! He Bai had no choice but to act like a mother and coax him to fall asleep. He Bai swore to eat shit on live streaming if he came to see Di Qiuhe again!A click.The last bedside lamp went out, leaving them in darkness.He Bai stretched his arm, pulled Di Qiuhe into his arms, patted him on the head and back, and said fiercely, \u201cGo to sleep. If you kick up a fuss, I\u2019ll give you a punch!\u201dJoyfully, Di Qiuhe also held He Bai in his arms, wrapping his limbs around him. Much taller as he was, Di Qiuhe nestled by He Bai\u2019s side and desperately pressed his head close to He Bai\u2019s neck, complaining, \u201cLittle Puppy, you are too bony to cuddle.\u201d However, his body moved a little closer despite the grumble.Di Qiuhe clung to He Bai, and his hair tickled He Bai\u2019s neck. Taking a deep breath, He Bai overcame his impulse to suffocate Di Qiuhe under a pillow, grabbed his ear and pulled it, his teeth gritted, \u201cThen loosen your hold on me, or I can\u2019t sleep well!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t! I\u2019m punishing you for making me sad.\u201d Di Qiuhe rubbed his chin against He Bai\u2019s shoulder, beaming with pleasure, \u201cAnyway, you can\u2019t doze off until I fall asleep.\u201dHe Bai tried his best to calm down. It\u2019s him who made the bed, so he must lie on it. He closed his eyes and decided to stop talking. In this way, Di Qiuhe might shut up too, he guessed.No doubt that He Bai underestimated the power of Di Qiuhe.\u201cLittle Puppy, I want to hear a bedtime story.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d \u201cLittle Puppy, can you sing lullaby?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Puppy, I\u2019m not sleepy at all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Puppy, why don\u2019t you talk?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Puppy, my back is itching. Could you please give me a scratching?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLittle Puppy, I want to sleep naked.\u201d Di Qiuhe withdrew his hands and started to take his pajamas off.He Bai couldn\u2019t bear him. He opened his eyes and pressed Di Qiuhe\u2019s arms, his teeth clenched, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare sleep naked! I\u2019ll cut your penis if you do so!\u201dDi Qiuhe paused and gave a meaningful smile, \u201cYou must be jealous of me, Little Puppy.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re jealous of my penis, which is bigger than yours.\u201dHe Bai got up and intended to borrow a cook chopper from the hotel kitchen.With surprising agility, Di Qiuhe dragged him back and pulled his pants like crazy, \u201cLittle Puppy, you\u2019ve seen my penis. For the sake of fairness, I want to see yours.\u201d\u201cD-I-Q-I-U-H-E!\u201d He Bai burst into roar, pounced on him, stared coldly at his eyes and ground his teeth, sneering, \u201cYour adolescence is quite late, isn\u2019t it? I swear to strip you and shut you out naked! Sleep, now!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Chicken Soup for the Soul (3)Translator: Sissy That Walk\u201cBut it\u2019s too early. I can\u2019t sleep.\u201d Di Qiuhe was deeply upset, his eyebrows drooped, as if he had been severely bullied.Looking at Di Qiuhe\u2019s open collar and his striking facial features in the dim light, the Bully He Bai took a deep breath, sat up, fanned himself with the hem of his pajamas and tried to calm himself down. Then he sat up, pulled up the quilt in a rude way to cover Di Qiuhe, lay down and hugged the guy, patting him on the back while whispering, \u201cOnce there was a mountain...\u201dDi Qiuhe wrapped his limbs around He Bai\u2019s body and made a request, \u201cI\u2019ve heard this. Please tell me another.\u201d\u201c\u2026 A long time ago, there was a...\u201d\u201cI\u2019m twenty-three years old, and I want to hear a coming-of-age story.\u201dHe Bai paused. Looking at the guy who made annoying demands but had child-like glowing eyes, he thought for a while, turned his head while relaxing the body, closed his eyes and said, \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a child called He Bai...\u201dDi Qiuhe was surprised and finally stopped disturbing him.He Bai opened his eyes to shoot a glance at Di Qiuhe, relieved, and continued his telling.Before this tomb-sweeping, he hadn\u2019t visited his parents for a long time, nor recalled his past. If his stories could make Di Qiuhe well-behaved, He Bai was absolutely willing to come clean even about his family tree.The room was very quiet, and Di Qiuhe\u2019s temperature pretty warm. He Bai\u2019s voice dropped when his memories came flooding back.He recalled his happy childhood when the family travelled widely, his parents\u2019 tragic death before he came of age... as well as making joyful acquaintance of the three roommates after entering the university, learning about photography with curiosity and doing tiring but meaningful part-time jobs...He Bai paused when he spoke of his coming summer vacation in the sophomore year.Di Qiuhe felt puzzled and looked up at him, \u201cWhy do you stop talking?\u201d\u201cBecause you know things that happened afterwards.\u201d smiled He Bai. He lay on his back in the bed when a smile lifted the corners of his mouth. Slowly closing his eyes, He Bai asked, \u201cDi Qiuhe, what do you think your future is like?\u201dWith his arms empty, Di Qiuhe put his hands under his head, looked at He Bai\u2019s indistinct visage and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll achieve success and win recognition.\u201dRemembering his dazzling fame in the last life, He Bai nodded his agreement, \u201cSure, you will.\u201dDi Qiuhe\u2019s eyes were fixated on He Bai\u2019s smiling mouth when he continued, \u201cAnd live a peaceful life with the one I love.\u201dHe Bai\u2019s smile faded when the picture where Di Qiuhe fell down a building consciously flashed through his mind. He asked, \u201cHow long is it?\u201d\u201cIt depends on how long my lover lives.\u201d Di Qiuhe replied in a gentle voice when he slowly reached out his hand under the quilt and pinched a corner of He Bai\u2019s pajamas.What a romantic answer it was!He Bai couldn\u2019t help laughing, while his voice lowered, \u201cIt must be such a blessing to be your lover, for you will love... love\u2026\u201d His eyes closed completely before he finished the sentence.As He Bai dozed off, Di Qiuhe slowly approached him, held the guy in his arms and kissed him on the forehead, saying in a low voice, \u201cWill you be my lover? I\u2019ll love you with all my heart.\u201dAwake from a sound sleep, He Bai found Di Qiuhe was gone, with a note left on the bedside cabinet.Di Qiuhe: I\u2019m heading for the set, and Assistant Wang will drive you to the airport later. Remember to have breakfast and send me a text when you arrive, for I\u2019m probably too busy to answer your call.He Bai put down the note and shook his head when thinking of what Di Qiuhe did last night. Then he got up, washed his face and packed up the luggage.At lunchtime, the plane arrived in B city. He Bai sent a text to Wang Boyi as soon as he got into a taxi to make sure all the crew members were having lunch, and then he dialed Di Qiuhe\u2019s number.\u201cAre you getting to B City?\u201dHe Bai quickly got through, and Di Qiuhe\u2019s gentle and pleasant voice came with a slight distortion.He Bai suddenly found himself somehow ill-adapted to his voice, paused and replied, \u201cYes, I\u2019m taking a taxi to my school. Are you having lunch?\u201d\u201cYeah, why don\u2019t you eat something before going back to school?\u201d\u201cI had a late breakfast, and I\u2019m not hungry now.\u201d\u201cRemember to eat something when you arrive at the campus.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dAfter an everyday conversation, both of them kept silent, while no one hung up, and the atmosphere became quite awkward.For some inexplicable reason, He Bai felt ill at ease. He turned his head to look out of the window at the familiar smoggy air and tried to utter something to end the embarrassing silence, \u201cWhat do you have for lunch? Don\u2019t be a picky eater. Vegetables are also good for your health.\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019ll finish it.\u201d answered Di Qiuhe. He paused and asked, \u201cBai, when will you come to the set?\u201dThe atmosphere still seemed strange.He Bai rubbed his cheek, and replied purposefully, \u201cDo you miss me?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Di Qiuhe responded honestly.He Bai: \u201c...\u201dThere was another silence. Finally, Di Qiuhe opened his mouth, \u201cI have to go, for the director hurries me. Text me when you get to school, and I\u2019ll give you a call when my work is finished.\u201dHe Bai ruffled his hair, made a vague response and hung up quickly.It\u2019s still weird... Could it be said that his mood changed seasonally as autumn came? He looked at the mobile phone and pondered it over. After a brief hesitation, he called Niu Junjie and said seriously, \u201cI miss you, bro.\u201dHalf a minute later, Niu Junjie\u2019s voice broke the silence, \u201cBai, are you recalling old memories at tomb-sweeping sights, or...haunted by ghost?\u201dHe Bai: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter He Bai was back, the whole dormitory dined out and then went to the court to play basketball. Exhausted by the sport, He Bai lay down on the ground when a relieved smile spread over his face.Having spent several days with Di Qiuhe, He Bai nearly forgot how to get along with friends on a normal basis. Luckily, he had three roommates, with whom he was able to return to normal status.The holiday wound up, and He Bai continued to engage himself in his study and part-time job.It took him a few days to sort through all the photos taken on the set, and then he carefully retouched a poster and handed it to Xu Yinrong. One day later, Xu called him and informed that there\u2019s something about cooperation that needed discussing with Jiang Guanshan.\u201cYou\u2019re still an employee of Yi Ka, so you have to tell them about it before you take the appointment.\u201d Xu Yinrong soothed him kindly, \u201cJust take it easy. Director Jiang suggests you shoot with the crew members so that you could accumulate more experience. He won\u2019t insist it if you are short of time. Academic performance is more important to you. You are already a junior and about to have an internship next year, so your main task now is to lay a good foundation.\u201dHe Bai nodded. Seeing Xu Yinrong\u2019s grey hair and softening eyes, he was open about his decision, \u201cMr. Xu, I decide to resign from Yi Ka and concentrate on my studies, only to do part-time work during vacations. A full-time job overworks me now.\u201dXu Yinrong was quite surprised, \u201cHave you made up your mind?\u201d He was well aware that his student always had a sense of gratitude. In order to repay Yi Ka for their offer, he would rather exhaust himself hurrying between two places, but now...\u201cYes, I have. I\u2019ll submit my resignation next week. It\u2019s October, and there will be publicity surrounding Little Mermaid\u2019s winter collections. When it\u2019s done, I\u2019ll not leave Yi Ka until they find a photographer to replace my job.\u201d explained He Bai. Then he added, \u201cFrom October to next January, there will be a constant market for winter wear. Despite long cycle, the working intensity is moderate, so I can cope with it. During the period, Yi Ka, I believe, will be surely able to find a perfect photographer to succeed me. Besides, Director Jiang\u2019s shooting on location can last about three months, and he\u2019ll come back to B City before next Chinese New Year, when I\u2019m in winter holiday and can just shoot on set.\u201dXu Yinrong took the calendar and calculated the time, his eyebrows unknitted. He nodded, \u201cSure, in this way, you can save both time to study and trouble on the go. Well, I\u2019ll discuss specific arrangements with Jiang on your behalf, and you can focus on Yi Ka\u2019s work for now. Remember to explain the situation to your leader and carry out your last duties.\u201d\u201cYes, Elder Xu.\u201d nodded He Bai. Relieved, he was sentimental about his departure. His cooperation with Yi Ka was kind of ill-considered, for which Sister Lin had been bothering to accommodate the team to his identity as a student. He owed her a lot on making the decision to leave, which made him extremely guilty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Divorce (1)Translator: Sissy That WalkThe moment Lin Xia saw He Bai showed up at her office solemnly, she realized that the parting was finally on the agenda.\"Don't look at me like that, take a seat.\" She greeted He Bai with a smile, motioning with her hand to signal him to be quiet first, then bowed her head to pull out a document from the drawer and presented it to him. She finally started to talk, \"I knew the day would come, and I\u2019m grateful that you can stick to your post till now. After all, the workload of Little Mermaid is a bit burdensome for you.\"He Bai froze.\"You have a hard junior year, while Little Mermaid has just hit the market. There are quite many different matters to deal with. And you must be tired of running from both ends.\" Lin Xia poured him a glass of water, motioned him to read the document, she sighed and continued, \"I\u2019ve seen that you\u2019re in a pickle and exhausted, but it\u2019s too bad to let go of such a talent like you, therefore, I kept playing dumb.\"\"No, Sister Lin, thank you for the trouble you've taken on my behalf.\" He Bai came to himself and replied. He felt even more uneasy and awkward for her consideration.Little Mermaid, was kind to him, as well. There was no need to clock in or dispose any trifles. The team worked to his schedule to the greatest extent while they gave him the first-class benefit. Today, he had come for a scolding, yet he ended up being comforted instead.Seeing he was uneasy for that, Lin Xia was more relieved for having trusted the right person. She smiled and soothed, \"A photographer like you, who has saved large publicity expenditure for the company deserves that. Without you, the Little Mermaid could not have made a big hit from Jia family's birthday feast, and even less could we have had the chance to cooperate with the Jun Chen Studio. The invisible interests you bring to Little Mermaid, comparing with the benefits you\u2019ve got, are nothing at all.\"He Bai was ill at ease and didn't know how to answer, \"That's not the point...\"\"That's what I said.\" Lin Xia leaned back in the chair with a smile, was much more relaxed than he was, and she elaborated, \"Let me be brutally frank here. Although I consent to your dimission, you have to keep on taking publicity photos for us each issue until we find another qualified photographer. Of course, if it\u2019s possible, I hope you can give some instruction and take a set of publicity photos together with the new photograph if we get one.\" Then she raised her eyebrows looking at He Bai, looking like she won't let him go unless he makes the promise.She had played both roles of good cop and bad cop, which choked back He Bai's long-prepared rhetoric. He was moved after being stunned, then bowed his head and opened the file in his hand and read it through. He signed it as agile as when he signed the employment contract at the beginning. Then he got up and reached out to Lin Xia and smiled. \"Of course, I won't let go of such a good chance to make a show of authority in front of the newbie. Sister Lin, thank you and Little Mermaid and Yi Ka for the convenience all the time.\"Lin Xia smiled and got up to hold his hand. \"I'd like to thank you on behalf of Little Mermaid and Yi Ka, and wish you a bright future.\"He Bai called Yang Fu after coming out of Yi Ka. He thanked her for setting him up with Little Mermaid, and apologized for his leave.\"Never mind, there are chances to cooperate again in the future, and we\u2019ll be friends all the same.\" Yang Fu comforted him intimately and changed the topic, \"But if you feel so sorry, there\u2019s a chance to compensate me. Well, Zehang and I are going to advance our wedding date to next year. Are you free to take our wedding photos?\"He Bai smiled and acceded with pleasure, \"Of course, it is my honor to be invited by you.\"\"Dear me! I\u2019m totally charmed by you. I\u2019m a fan of yours now.\" Yang Fu cried exaggeratedly, and then he heard Jia Zehang vaguely, then Yang Fu hastily hung up the phone after an exclamation of laughter.He Bai, a witness of such a Public Display of Affection, put down his mobile phone laughingly. After exiting the photo call page, he opened the text message page involuntarily, in which he found no new text messages. He then checked the time and speculated that Di Qiuhe should still be filming. He turned off the text message page and put the mobile phone back in his pocket.After nearly quitting the job, He Bai didn't need to punch in Yi Ka regularly on weekends and after school. He had much more free time then, and he found that recently Niu Junjie was a bit suspicious.\"He plays basketball every afternoon!\"Wang Hu nodded, \"Well, he wants to lose weight.\"He Bai almost spewed the beef jerky out of his mouth in disbelief, \"He is not fat at all. Why should he do that?\"Chen Jie looked up from the table, stabilized his glasses and explained, \"The \u2018lose weight\u2019 he meant, was more like toning up, like an abdominal muscle training, converting the belly into a six-pack. Do you remember? We had a hot pot of high calorie the day you went back to school, God knows, he went to the playground to play basketball for two more hours the next day. He\u2019s resolute to persevere in.\"\"It\u2019s good to take more exercise, so as to save him from playing games in dormitory every day.\" Wang Hu nodded and turned his head to pat He Bai on the shoulder in seriousness. \"XiaoBai, you have to exercise more as well. You backed down half time last time we play basketball. You definitely lack of physical strength and your future girlfriend may look down on you.\"He Bai rolled his eyes. \"Who said I should have a girlfriend? How happy I am now. LaoDa, you have a dirty mind.\" In his last life, he had no intention of starting a family until he was 33. He was only 21 at present. He still longed to be single. A girlfriend and the like would not be taken into consideration within at least 12 years.\"You won't say so when you meet someone you\u2019re fond of.\" Chen Jie said casually, then turned the topic back and estimated, \"LaoSan is suspicious indeed recently. He plays no game, keeps early hours and has physical training. Furthermore, he starts to study in the library.\"He Bai raised his eyebrows, rubbed his snack bag, squinted to recall the words and deeds of LaoSan in these days. Then something came to his mind as his eyes twinkled, he got up and beckoned. \"If things go wrong, there always is something behind. Brothers, let's go and see what LaoSan is up to.\"Wang Hu and Chen Jie looked at each other and got up in laugh.The three arrived at the basketball court shoulder to shoulder and saw the vigorous Niu Junjie as soon as they entered.Wang Hu touched his chin: \"The hairstyle is new.\"Chen Jie held his glasses: \"The shoes and polo shirt are both newly bought.\"He Bai find the key point in a decisive manner and fixed his eyes on a figure he knew very well in his last life on the sidelines. He then squinted. \"I\u2019ve got it. Each time LaoSan scores a goal, he will peek at the girl with a ponytail and a brown blouse on the sidelines.\"Wang Hu and Chen Jie looked over and saw the girl and Niu Junjie, then phonated a tacit and meaningful word \"ah~\".For love, the handsome and rich 2G turned out to be a hardworking and good youth!The three approached with a crafty smile and quickly blocked Niu Junjie off to the corner of the stadium during the half-time, ready to interrogate.Wang Hu: \"We\u2019re lenient to those who confess and strict to those who resist.\"Chen Jie: \"There is no forgiveness to the one breaking away from the organization and off the market surreptitiously.\"He Bai hit the point straight: \"LaoSan, that girl in brown coat, I want her!\"Niu Junjie retorted at once while keeping his neck up, \"No! No! Change one! Not her!\"He Bai grilled, \"Why?\"\"Be, because ...\" Niu Junjie lowered his voice down and took a flickering look at the girl there. He was blushed all over from his ears first and then his neck to the whole face. Finally, he pulled up his jersey to cover his face and mumbled, \"Any, anyhow, not her. I\u2019m the first one who has a crush on her.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Divorce (2)Translator: Sissy That WalkThe three looked at each other, then gave a fatherly smile at the same time and pulled Niu Junjie down to inquire him.Knowing that he had exposed himself, Niu Junjie stuttered to spoke without reserve about the cause and effect of falling in love with the girl.So the story was like this: One day, the rich 2G Niu Junjie, in company with his father, attended a business partner's birthday party. He ran into a kind-hearted, beautiful and generous adorable young girl. The girl could play the piano! She was especially nice to children! She threw herself forward and defended him when he was ridiculed by some upstart for dressing too low-key.Then they met, only to find out after a chat that they were alumni. They got to know each other step by step, and then the rich 2G was tempted and sought to make her his girlfriend.Wang Hu: \"Is that the reason you come to play basketball every day?\"Niu Junjie was embarrassed. \"She is one of the basketball club members who come over often to watch the game...\"Chen Jie: \"And the library?\"Niu Junjie scratched his face and stated. \"She majors in Department of Chinese, of which the courses have nothing to do with our department. I can only meet her at the library.\"He Bai recalled how the sister-in-law disliked LaoSan when mentioning how they getting to know each other. He prayed for LaoSan in heart and asked, \"So you kept early hours to fit her time?\"\"Hmm? Well, she gets used to go to the playground for morning exercises ...\", Niu Junjie was blushed as a red monkey's ass.The three looked at each other again, then pushed Niu out and winked, \"Go on, go bold!\"Niu Junjie shyly hid away.The three kicked his ass as they were exasperated at his flinch.Turned to look back repeatedly at every step, Niu Junjie narrowed the distance between the girl and him gradually.It seemed that Mind acted upon Mind, the girl suddenly looked back toward Niu Junjie, who pretended to look away immediately.The three turned around as they could not lay their eyes on the coward!At that moment, the girl diverted her attention suddenly after glancing at the three, and she kept a close watch on He Bai and strode over.Niu Junjie halted to stare at He Bai.Wang Hu and Chen Jie stayed three feet away from He Bai at once.He Bai: \"???\u201dThe pretty tall girl strode to He Bai and fixed her eyes upon him for a few seconds. Then she held out her hand excitedly and blushed. \"Hello, my name is Zheng Ya, a junior in Department of Chinese. Nice to meet you.\"Avoiding Niu Junjie'\u2019s terrible gaze at the moment, He Bai held her hand and loosened within a second. He was all at sea, \"Hello, I'm He Bai, a junior in Department of Journalism. May I ask you...\" Obviously, he hazed that it never happened in his last life. What was going on now?\"Oh, sorry, I'm so excited.\" Zheng Ya raised hand to cover her face out of embarrassment, then she made an outspoken narration, \"I am a fan of you who\u2019s fond of your photographs very much. I heard that you and Junjie are roommates, so ... I\u2019d like to take the liberty of inviting you to take wedding photos for my brother. Thanks in advance!\"\"... Wedding photos?\" A fan? Everything changed so fast that He Bai was unable to keep pace with.Wang Hu and Chen Jie were distracted. They went back to He Bai when they saw things went well.So did Niu Junjie, whose murderous look was replaced by doubts. \"XiaoYa, hadn't your brother's wedding photo taken two months ago??\"Instead of having a talk at the playground, they found a tea bar outside the school and got a box there for better communication.\"Excuse me, I was being abrupt just now.\" Zheng Ya made an apology once again and explained in detail.Zheng Lei, Zheng Ya's elder brother, had a fianc\u00e9e who had grown up with him together. After eight years of dating, they finally decided to get married this year. However, life was not all roses and butterflies that everything was going on smoothly except the wedding photos.\"My sister-in-law fell ill last year. She put on dozens of pounds because of taking medicine, which made her felt so vulnerable that she wanted to break up with my brother. As you see, my brother would never ever leave her alone. In order to ease her, he discussed with family and set a wedding date in this year.\" Zheng Ya felt a little embarrassed, she glanced at He Bai, and continued, \"My sister-in-law had been losing weight, whereas the outcomes were not that ideal. Although she was a little thinner when taking the wedding photos, she was still ... Just two months ago, a distant uncle of my sister-in-law brought an old doctor back and promised that as long as she was nursed by the doctor, she would definitely lose weight. Everyone didn\u2019t take it seriously at all until something marvelous happened that my sister-in-law finally got back into shape.\"Chen Jie nodded and said, \"Your sister-in-law got fat on pills, that\u2019s why it\u2019s useless to lose weight only but she needs to recuperate from the inside.\"\"Exactly.\" Zheng Ya relieved a bit as they got what she meant to, she looked at He Bai and requested, \"My brother fixed the wedding date on the day of proposing to my sister-in-law, that is, the end of this month. Now that my sister-in-law was back in shape, she\u2019s dying for rephotographing the wedding photos while she doesn\u2019t have too much time. You know, marriage is once-in-a-lifetime. My sister-in-law once chitchatted with me that she appreciated your elf series very much and would like to make an appointment with you once she got thinner, so I ... \"\"So you\u2019re not my fan but your sister-in-law is?\" He Bai answered with a smile and saw Zheng Ya was ill at ease. He then pacified, \"You are Junjie's friend. Naturally, you are my friend. I should surely undertake my friend\u2019s request.\"\"Really?\" Zheng Ya was pleasantly surprised that things would go so smoothly. She stammered. \"I, I heard that you didn't take any outside tasks unless they are Yi Ka related. I assumed... Thank you very much anyway. Thank you!\"\"You shouldn\u2019t regard me as an outsider. I\u2019ve left Yi Ka earlier this month, thus it doesn't matter if I take some outside tasks.\" He Bai explained, and then said, \"You have helped Junjie out, who has cared for me all the time. It\u2019s a pleasure for me that I can return a favor now. You can thank Junjie if you really want to.\"Zheng Ya was still carried away by his promise and she just looked sideways at Niu Junjie with eyes filled with gratitude.Niu Junjie was so elated that he couldn't help to giving He Bai a thumbs-up under the table.He Bai cracked a smile and took a sip of tea, surrounded by both success and fame.As night fell, He Bai was lying in bed. He pulled out his cell phone and opened the text message page, intending to text Di Qiuhe.He Bai: What are you bustling about?No response.He took a look at the time while the shooting intension of the crew and the chanceful Dong Ni crossed his mind. Then he frowned for worrying and texted again.He Bai: Text me when you're free. Have a good rest.After that, he put down the phone, closed his eyes to sleep. Then he opened his eyes half a minute later. He couldn't help getting his cell phone again and continued typing.He Bai: I have basically settled the matter of being a staff of crew in my winter vacation. But the exact date is still up in the air.He Bai: Sleep early and have a good night.No response as always, he put down the phone again and sighed.He worried about Childish Di day and night so much as a father did to a son that he would surely be prematurely senile.He was just about to close his eyes, the phone beside the pillow vibrated wildly.He held up his cell phone sideways and saw a familiar number lightening out on the screen. He got it through and asked, \"Finished?\"\"Pup, do you miss me?\"There came a familiar soft voice and tone of lure.He Bai didn't resist wearing on his supercilious look and snorted, \"It\u2019s far better to think about what's for breakfast tomorrow than miss you.\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Divorce (3)Translator: Sissy That Walk\"How about the longevity noodles of north canteen?\" There was a faint music from Di Qiuhe, much like the evening lullaby played every night by Q University, mingled with the laughter of students. \"Pup, the weather is getting cold in city B, and I had no preparation at all. Come and rescue me.\"He Bai sat up in disbelief and raised his voice unconsciously, \"Are you back? At Q University?\"Di Qiuhe chuckled but made no response.\"You asshole!\" He Bai scolded. He hung up the phone, got out of bed in a coat casually, and then took another one from the cupboard before running out of dormitory, leaving his astounded roommates behind.Wang Hu wondered, \"Who\u2019s that? Why he\u2019s so excited?\"Niu Junjie, who had the experience of love affairs recently, touched his chin and made a guess, \"Is the girl he cares for?\"Chen Jie thrust his glasses. \"Maybe it\u2019s a man he likes.\"Wang Hu and Niu Junjie looked at him in shocked expression.Chen Jie then made a shruggie. \"Don\u2019t be so serious.\"The other two felt relieved, pretending to beat him.In late autumn, city B was somewhat cold. When He Bai found Di Qiuhe on the cement stand beside the playground amidst the cold night wind, Di's face was already flushed by the wind.\"Why are you back all of a sudden? Are you finished with your filming work? \"He Bai stood in front of Di, threw the clothes on him and asked with a frown.Di Qiuhe wrapped up the clothes, sat on the steps with his long legs bent, looked up at He Bai, smiled and said, \"My father is getting divorced.\"\"What?\" He Bai was astounded, with brows knitting harder, he then asked in a shrill voice, \"What's going on? Are you sure?\" Huangdu and the Qin family is an interest group at present, and both of them would be undermined if Di Bian divorced Qin Li. Is he out of his mind?\"Sure, he said it on the phone.\" Di Qiuhe raised his hand to stroke his hairs, while his smile was tinged with sarcasm. \"Last time I told him about Zeng Peizhong, he remained unconvinced but sent someone to check up on Zeng Peizhong at once and did a paternity test secretly after hanging up.\"He Bai had a flash of inspiration in his mind and guessed, \"Is Di Xiasong really...\"\"Not him. He\u2019s quite a copy of my father.\" Di Qiuhe said, but his tone growing queer, \"The dubious one is Di Chunhua. She is neither the offspring of Di family, nor Zeng Peizhong.\"He Bai glared at Di for there was too much information for him to take in.\"Guess what.\" Di Qiuhe tidied his clothes again, leaned forward to hold He Bai\u2019s hand, which were cold. He then frowned and drew He\u2019s other hand, took off the scarf covering his face around He\u2019s neck with a hilarious bow, and lowered his head and said slowly, \"You\u2019ll be awarded if you guess this one right and there\u2019s a hint. Di Chunhua has been in poor health since childhood. She\u2019s irritable and is of typical features of Qin family.\"\u2018Poor health, irritability, took after Qin Li, that is, the Qin family...\u2019 He Bai gasped, and an awful conjecture came to him. He stammered, \"Your stepmother ,she committed in, incest ...\"\"You\u2019re right, you deserve a hug.\" Di Qiuhe got up and hugged him, with his head brushed against He\u2019s hair, then he lowered his voice, \"My dad has caught such a big soft spot of Qin family, which meant he could do whatever he wanted to. He wants not only a divorce, but also the Qin family shall suffer a great loss. You see, he always regards his love as a bargain price. Di Chunhua is the most one he loved among his three children, and now the secret is discovered by coincidence. He was not grieved or shocked but overjoyed at first, because he gets the most favorable demerit to restrain the Qin family, of which he no longer needs to scruple against.\"He Bai recognized there was something wrong, he held still while neglecting Di was hugging him, and hesitated, \"Qiuhe ...\"\"It's so ridiculous that I've been seeking by all means to defeat Qin Li and Qin family, but I never expect they could be disintegrated and torn by dissension so easily.\" Di Qiuhe was not satisfied at all, whereas there was a sense of emptiness after reaching his goal abruptly. He raised his hand to touch He Bai's back and continued, \"If you hadn't overheard the conversation, it would never have been known...you are my lucky charm, Pup.\"He Bai was at a loss for words, he was somewhat muddled by such a big keyhole report. And how on earth did Di Bian find out that? After all, in the last life, Di Chunhua was a little darling of Di family until Di Qiuhe died after falling from a window. She even put on an act as a sad and good sister in front of reporters after Di's death, but in this life\u2026Wait! In the last life Di Qiuhe fell from the building, the arm retracted from the curtain was obviously a woman\u2019s...Could that be Di Chunhua? She silenced him because he discovered her birth secret!His jumbled brain suddenly became as clear as daylight, yet the crisis awareness soared in his mind.If that was true, would Di Qiuhe, who fell to the floor and died after discovering the truth in his last life, follow the track this life, and after discovering the truth...\"Qiuhe!\" He was shocked, struggled to free himself from the scarf, hold Di\u2019s shoulder and pushed him away, scowled at him, \"How many people know Di Chunhua\u2019s birth until now? How did your father find out that? And your father, has he just had the idea or is he already negotiating with the Qin family? \"\"Calm down, it\u2019s ...\"The cell phone rung suddenly.Di Qiuhe took out the phone and looked at it as their conversation was interrupted. He frowned when he saw it was Wang Boyi. He raised his hand to placate and pat He Bai on the shoulder, signaling him to wait. Then he turned on the phone sideways and asked, \"What\u2019s wrong?\"\"Master Di!\" Assistant Wang's voice was so loud that He Bai could hear faintly for standing close by. \"The butler of Residence Di just called your work number, said the chairman accidentally fell down from the stairs half an hour ago. He suffered from cerebral hemorrhage and was in a coma. He\u2019s now being rescued in hospital, of which the doctor said that his life might be in danger!\"\"Half an hour ago?\" Di Qiuhe\u2019s face was distorted by anxiety instantly and strode toward the school gate while whipping round every two steps.\"I'll go with you!\" He Bai got flustered like never before. He picked up the coat and scarf that fell to the ground, and followed him up without thinking. A sense of foreboding haunted him, thus he whispered, \"From now on, you are not allowed to leave me, not even a step!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
