She unconsciously looked at the place where the sound came from; what she saw was an antiquated scene and two men wearing ancient costumes standing in the midst of it.Outside of the scene, several machines were filming them.Acting!For no reason, this thought entered Ming Shu\u2019s mind.\u201cSorry, director. Can I try again?\u201d said a woman in red clothes with a delicately pretty voice. She gazed complacently at the woman she\u2019d slapped just now.\u201cAgain,\u201d the director called patiently.The staff had no say in these matters. All they could do was shoot again.Ming Shu looked around to find herself sitting and wearing the same sort of heavy costume.She was a little confused.Who am I?Where am I?What am I doing?\u201cSister Jiang Nian, it seems they\u2019ll take a while. How about going back to rest and I\u2019ll call you when it\u2019s your turn?\u201d All of a sudden, a person approached her and quietly offered this advice.It was a girl with a pretty face and a sweet voice. She had on a sports suit and held a script, a cup of water, and a cell phone in her hands.Ming Shu rubbed her forehead and nodded slightly.The situation is unclear. Stay calm.Following the girl, Ming Shu arrived at an empty break room. Then the girl soon left and shut the door. Ming Shu studied the room and recalled what had happened before\u2014While she was being chased by a group of goblins, she was suddenly dragged into a space full of white clouds by a so-called Harmony System. The system shared many inexplicable things and asked her to complete a particular task.The task was to increase the Hatred Points of fake protagonist from different worlds. When the Hatred Points reached a certain threshold, the protagonists would lose their halos and become normal people with no influence on the world\u2019s development.[Do you understand what I explained?] the Harmony System asked.\u201c\u2026\u201d Understand what? Ming Shu thought. Who agreed to work for you? The salary hasn\u2019t been discussed yet.An illegal workshop!Ming Shu coughed and asked with a smile on her face, \u201cYou mean about helping you defeat those protagonist?\u201dThe enemy hide themselves and I was exposed. Stay calm.The Harmony System remained silent for a while before replying. [It could be understood that way. But you are an outsider, so you can\u2019t kill villains outright.]\u201cThose villains are outsiders too, so how could they kill people?\u201d Ming Shu asked. She was certainly not stupid. Otherwise, she would already have been caught by those goblins and become their meal.[\u2026 According to common people, they are beloved by Heaven, so they can kill others. In my opinion, because they stole the power of Heaven when they crossed worlds and were reborn, they\u2019re able to commit such atrocities.][You\u2019re going to accumulate the Hatred Points of villains who shouldn\u2019t have been beloved by Heaven, isn\u2019t it exciting?] The system\u2019s \u201cvoice\u201d was peaceful, quite unlike ordinary electronic voices. It also contained no human emotions, so one was unable to tell whether it was male or female. It sounded strange.Ming Shu deliberated for a long time and still felt there must be a trap.The weather today was bad, so I met sicko only.\u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d She\u2019d also stewed a pot of meat for herself.The system said nothing. Ming Shu tried to walk out, but she returned to the unearthly room full of white clouds no matter how many attempts at escape she made.\u201c\u2026\u201d My meat! Ming Shu thought.[Those people out there are always chasing you around the world. Haven\u2019t you said they\u2019re annoying and you want find a quiet place to stay for a while? This is your best option. This two-dimensional space is different from others. Ordinary people cannot enter and you can also experience many different lives.] The system continued trying to persuade her.Ming Shu furrowed her brow. Those goblins outside want to eat me.I am not a Calabash Brother.\u201cCan I do anything I want in that world?\u201d[Yes. But there are still some rules you cannot break. I\u2019ll remind you when it happens.]Tap-tap . Someone was knocking on the door to the break room.\u201cCome in.\u201d Ming Shu put on her coat, the corners of her lips turned up in a slight smile. Her face became more three-dimensional and as bright and beautiful as peach blossoms in March, dazzling and attractive.Ming Shu\u2019s eyes unfocused again and it seemed she was thinking. After a while, she said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m bored anyway.\u201dAbove was the conversation between her and the Harmony System discussing why she came here.In conclusion, for some reason villains who crossed worlds were reborn and tried to stir trouble in fictional worlds where they didn\u2019t belong.Her task was to go to different worlds to shore up on villains\u2019 Hatred points. When their Hatred Points reached a certain level, the villains who sported the protagonist\u2019s halo would become ordinary people. Therefore, the world\u2019s intended operation would be maintained.[Guest, do you accept this task?] the system\u2019s voice suddenly sounded again, peaceful and somewhat androgynous.Ming Shu looked around and realized the voice was in her mind. Maybe she\u2019d gotten an amazing cheat.She found a place to sit down and said, \u201cStart, start.\u201dThis new exciting life was about to start.This particular story revolved around showbiz.The fake female protagonist was called Ning Keqing, reborn. In her previous life, when she entered the showbiz, she was kept by someone who had a powerful background and was extremely generous to her.But Ning Keqing became infatuated with a young star, Jiang Si, instead of the rich and powerful big-shot; she even offended her Money Boss for Jiang Si. However, Jiang Si fell in love with another in the end.After her rebirth, Ning Keqing rode on her Money Boss\u2019s coattails to counterattack.The body Ming Shu occupied now was called Jiang Nian, the showbiz\u2019s famous Gossip Queen.Yes, Gossip Queen!Minor gossip about Jiang Nian would circulate every three days while major gossip about Jiang Nian would circulate every five days. Most of the male stars in show biz had been gossiped about alongside her. But that kind of gossip could reach no definite conclusion.The Host entered showbiz at fifteen and knew where to draw the line, so even though she had been gossiped about with so many male stars, she had never done anything improper. Therefore, others could only make an issue of the rumors surrounding her.There were so many rumors about her that others were confused about what they should believe. In the end, everything was just fodder for news.The Host was tactful and slick in every relation, so she had a lot of resources at her disposal.Ning Keqing had no relations with the Host in her previous life. But after her rebirth, she seemed to hate the showbiz very much. When she discovered the Host had taken a photo with her Money Boss, she thought the Host was going to nab him.The Host was subject to various forms of bashing from Ning Keqing.Whatever event the Host attended, Ning Keqing would attend as well. She would dress up beautifully to outdo the other and attract everyone\u2019s attention.Ning Keqing acted one way in front of her Money Boss and another behind the Money Boss\u2019s back. Therefore, the Host had been bullied many times. Additionally, Ning Keqing could count on journalists and spectators to arrive at exactly the right time.In the end, she became the victim and the Host became the target of others\u2019 abuse.In this life, Ning Keqing benefited from the Money Boss\u2019s protection and support. The Host couldn\u2019t defeat her and became a shameless actress referred to as Gossip Queen.The Host couldn\u2019t receive any scripts or other offers of work. More than that, she was bad-mouthed by countless people and met crazy haters whenever she went out. She gradually became a recluse, suffered from depression, and finally died by suicide.The showbiz was full of different kinds of attractions and information flowed rapidly, so no one remembered the Host. However, Ning Keqing succeeded easily in her life and became the ultimate winner both in terms of career and romance, which made others envious.Meanwhile, because of her, the course of the story had changed, deviating from its original plot.Ming Shu, who had received many memories, kneaded her head to alleviate the headache brought on by information overload. She glanced around the break room quickly.Another person\u2019s life\u2026It\u2019s just started.It really is exciting.At this time, Ning Keqing had just been reborn. The relationship between her and the Host began here.The two people outside just now were not Ning Keqing. She joined because of her Money Boss\u2014in other words, through the backdoor. Her acting skills weren\u2019t good enough and only improved well after her rebirth. She might be rehearsing elsewhere at the moment.According to the plot, she was going to play opposite Ning Keqing in the next scene.Ming Shu turned around and faced the woman in the mirror. She had an extremely beautiful face. All she had to do was stand there and others would be unable to tear their eyes away. She was beloved by the spotlight, and her smile was absolutely enchanting.This was Jiang Nian.Gossip Queen of showbiz and also the goddess of showbiz.Who would not be enthralled by such a beauty?Ming Shu touched her own face and admired herself for a while. Then she stood up to remove her heavy costume.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, hey\u2026 Why did you take off your costume?\u201d the girl who went out just now returned and asked. She was the Host\u2019s assistant, Tian Yuan.The Host\u2019s agent couldn\u2019t follow her everywhere all the time, so usually Tian Yuan accompanied her.\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Ming Shu styled her hair randomly and took the bag on the table, saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to eat.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026\u201d Tian Yuan felt awkward and said, \u201cSister Jiang Nian, it\u2019ll be your turn to shoot in a moment. Is it okay to go out now? How about I go buy something for you? What do you want to eat?\u201cOh, and Sister Aileen said you can\u2019t eat too much right now. You need to stay fit to prepare for the Ethereal Heights audition next month,\u201d Tian Yuan reminded her quietly.But Ming Shu didn\u2019t care for her words and swept out of the room. Laughing, she said, \u201cToday\u2019s shoot can\u2019t be completed, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cEh? Why?\u201d Tian Yuan\u2019s train of thought was interrupted. \u201cI was there the whole time and I didn\u2019t hear about that. Sister Jiang Nian, slow down\u2026\u201dLiked it?

She found that her employer seemed to be a little different. Sister Jiang Nian was nice, but she only smiled when there was someone watching\u2014unlike now. Now, she had a faint smile on her face all the time.She looked easygoing, but\u2026What was amazing was that Ming Shu had eaten a lot, which astonished Tian Yuan. She tried her best to stop Ming Shu.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, don\u2019t eat anymore. Sister Aileen would kill me if she found out I didn\u2019t stop you!\u201d Tian Yuan jumped up to grab Ming Shu\u2019s slice of cake, but Ming Shu was much taller than her. She couldn\u2019t take it and even cried in anger.The passersby looked at them curiously.This little girl jumped up to grab a slice of cake from a dazzling woman\u2019s hand, but that woman, smiling the whole while, only lifted the cake higher and watched the girl. They didn\u2019t know whether it was just their imagination, but they swore they saw pink bubbles around the two.Because Tian Yuan was being so demanding, Ming Shu put on her sunglasses. She didn\u2019t wear a mask if she was going to eat.But she might be recognized like this.\u201cI\u2019ll die if I don\u2019t eat.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s hand was on top of Tian Yuan\u2019s head to stop her jumping. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine as long as you don\u2019t tell Sister Aileen. Just let me eat this last one. Stop! If you keep doing this, we\u2019ll be spotted.\u201dTian Yuan immediately turned her head to look and found that some people were watching them and even more were edging closer.Tian Yuan almost cried. With a sad expression, Tian Yuan said, \u201cSister Jiang Nian, you\u2019ve said this is the last one too many times!\u201dFollowing the full and drunk Ming Shu, the downhearted Tian Yuan returned to the film set. She had already foreseen how Sister Aileen would scold her. It was going to be horrible!When they came in, the main set was crawling with people. But Ming Shu, sucking a popsicle, didn\u2019t care about that. It seemed that what was going on wasn\u2019t nearly as worthy of attention as her popsicle.Tian Yuan worried that Jiang Nian\u2019s inelegant behavior would be photographed by someone. She ventured to snatch away the popsicle from Ming Shu\u2019s hand and righteously said, \u201cSister Jiang Nian, stop eating! If you keep eating, I\u2019ll call Sister Aileen.\u201dGlancing at the half-eaten popsicle, Ming Shu tried to persuade Tian Yuan: \u201cNow, the country encourages diligence and frugality, so since I\u2019ve eaten half, I should eat the other half.\u201dObviously, Tian Yuan knew exactly what Ming Shu really wanted. She quickly threw the popsicle into the trash can.Immediately afterward, Tian Yuan felt that she had overstepped. She looked at Ming Shu fearfully, but Ming Shu only had eyes for that trash can and didn\u2019t pay Tian Yuan any mind at all.Tian Yuan held her cell phone tightly and thought, Sister Jiang Nian really is weird today.Will I need to call Sister Aileen?\u201cWe\u2019re not finished!\u201d With this sharp shout, the people in front of them backed off and scattered. The woman who\u2019d slapped another charged out angrily, dirt on her clothes and a slightly discomfited look on her face.A woman in a white dress ran after her, aggrieved, and said: \u201cSister Manman, it really wasn\u2019t on purpose.\u201dSong Man suddenly stopped and turned around. With a ferocious expression, she pointed at the other woman and said, \u201cNing Keqing, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how you joined our film crew by sleeping with someone. This isn\u2019t over.\u201dNing Keqing, the villain.After her rebirth, Ning Keqing pretended to be a white lotus all the time and secretly exacted vengeance on those who had offended her in her past life.\u201cSister Manman, how could you say that? I was just careless and got your clothes dirty,\u201d Ning Keqing explained desperately. \u201cThey all saw I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\u201cYou were careless?\u201d Song Man was extremely angry. \u201cNing Keqing, don\u2019t pretend to be innocent. Who do you want to see your innocence?\u201dNing Keqing pretended to be innocent on the surface, but there was scorn and contempt in her eyes. Maybe Song Man had seen that and became infuriated, and so returned to berate her.Such a horrible woman. I\u2019m so angry.Ning Keqing was very good at pretending to be a white lotus. She\u2019d been hit by Song Man several times, but that was only because she deliberately allowed it. Well, it was certain that the spectators would villainize Song Man and sympathize with Ning Keqing.Such scheming!Right then, Ming Shu stopped staring at the trash can and walked toward the noisy crowd.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, Sister Jiang Nian\u2026\u201d Tian Yuan was astonished and asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201dMing Shu glanced at her and chuckled\u2014 I\u2019m certainly going to earn hatred.She picked up an unopened juice box that some unknown person had set aside, opened it, and drank slowly. Then she grasped Song Man\u2019s shoulder, gently pushed her out of the way, and poured the remaining juice on Ning Keqing.Everyone instantly quieted down.The smell of orange juice was thick in the air. Ning Keqing\u2019s white dress was soaked, her lace underwear revealed.She was perhaps too shocked after having juice suddenly poured on her. After a pause, she crossed her arms over her chest to cover herself.Ming Shu placed the juice box in the hand of Song Man, who was just as shocked. Then she smiled and said, \u201cIs this all because she dirtied your clothes? What\u2019s the point of arguing? Just dirty her clothes too.\u201dEh\u2026It was so simple and rude!But\u2026Superstar Jiang Nian, did this have anything to do with you?No one dared to even breathe loudly. At first, this was an argument between Song Man and Ning Keqing. Song Man was a first-rate actress while Ning Keqing was a third-rate actress, but it was said that she was supported by a Money Boss. For these reasons, they were all unwilling to offend the two.Therefore, when the actresses quarreled, they only pretended to intervene.But Jiang Nian was different. She was a superstar actress now and could easily get many scripts. As such a superstar actress, why did she get involved in this matter?She was making things worse!\u201cSister Jiang Nian\u2026 Did I offend you?\u201d Ning Keqing lightly bit her lower lip, tears glistening in her eyes, delicate and touching.Ning Keqing really didn\u2019t remember when she offended Jiang Nian. Even in her last life, she had little to do with her.Jiang Nian was tactful and slick in every interaction. She wouldn\u2019t offend anyone even if they were unimportant.So Ning Keqing didn\u2019t know why Jiang Nian suddenly poured juice on her today.\u201cYou\u2019re bothering me,\u201d Ming Shu replied with a smile. In the next second, she started acting. \u201cDo you know how much an hour of my time is worth? You wasted time arguing here. Do you know how much of my money you wasted? Money equals time, time equals life, and therefore you\u2019re wasting my life.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Is it really that serious? Everyone had the same thought.Obviously Ming Shu wanted to say more, but Ning Keqing spoke before her. \u201cSorry, Sister Jiang Nian! I\u2019m sorry for bothering you. I really didn\u2019t mean to.\u201dIt was Ming Shu that poured juice on Ning Keqing first. But now Ning Keqing readily apologized and bowed her head. Others would think Ming Shu was bullying Ning Keqing.Great. After your rebirth, you should be smarter.Ming Shu smiled wider and patted Song Man, who was still shocked, on the shoulder. She said to her, \u201cDon\u2019t just spout evil things, it\u2019s useless. You should counterattack at once or wait for another opportunity.\u201dLiked it?

What was she doing just now?Ming Shu returned to the break room, her smile shrinking but still visible. Tian Yuan was afraid of even breathing loudly and didn\u2019t dare to lecture Ming Shu. She secretly sent a message to Sister Aileen.Sister Jiang Nian is not herself today.Meanwhile, Ming Shu was talking to the Harmony System.\u201cHow was my behavior just now?\u201d[You should have poured it on her face.] the Harmony System suggested.Ming Shu\u2019s gaze changed and after a while she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019re that type of system?\u201dHarmony?What kind of fucking harmony?[My task is to help you get Hatred Points, so the suggestion I\u2019m providing is that you make others more hateful.]Ming Shu\u2019s index finger rubbed her lips and her smile even curved her eyebrows. She was very peaceful and gentle now, which made others want to be close to her.But the Harmony System knew she was not so innocent. Even when she killed others, she was hardly affected and a smile always graced her face.Ning Keqing also went back to the break room she shared with a few others, full of confusion and resentment. Another woman made fun of her when she arrived, embarrassingly enough.Ning Keqing glanced at her and hid her hatred behind her eyes. Then she silently went to the dressing room to change out of her dirty dress.She looked at the reflection in the mirror and her face became gloomy.What had happened today was outside of her expectations. Why did Jiang Nian act against her? Jiang Nian smiled at everyone, but in the past days of filming she didn\u2019t notice that Jiang Nian was especially close to Song Man. So why did Jiang Nian help Song Man today?Yes, now Ning Keqing thought that Ming Shu was helping Song Man.Ming Shu had nothing to do with today\u2019s affair. And according to what she had known about Jiang Nian before, she should have simply stood by.Ning Keqing patted her own cheek. She lived so miserably in her last life, she wouldn\u2019t allow herself to live that way again.No matter whether Jiang Nian was trying to help Song Man or not, she would remember what had happened today.One day\u2026She would succeed.Ning Keqing firmed her resolve, walked out of the dressing room while ignoring everyone\u2019s scorn, and started to read the script.Because of this argument, the leading roles\u2019 act was stopped. The director had to film other scenes first.What Ming Shu was acting in now was called Ever-Burning Light, which involved some magical elements. The ever-burning light which allowed people to live forever was the central point of this story, and most of it would be filmed in the palace.Ming Shu played the second leading female role, a spoiled concubine of the highest rank, so Ming Shu\u2019s part was pretty much this scene.Because of her great background, Ming Shu could easily get the opportunity to play the first leading female role. But her agent, the director, and the scriptwriter believed her image was more suitable for the second leading female role.Ming Shu was going to play opposite Ning Keqing in her next part.In the plot, Ning Keqing was a newcomer to the palace and the Emperor spoiled her constantly. Since she was so popular, she was going to be taught by another concubine, one of the highest rank.Ming Shu seemed to be interested in acting, so she read the script willingly. With the original owner\u2019s knowledge and skill, acting wouldn\u2019t be a big problem for her.She was even afraid of herself when she started acting.So, was acting a problem for her? Nope.Maybe the director didn\u2019t want to offend Ming Shu, so he filmed Ming Shu and Ning Keqing early the next morning.A well-dressed woman was led to the bright palace where everything was luxurious and maids stood to the sides with their hands faced down. The palace was extremely fragrant. It felt like they\u2019d really been transported to the past.But\u2014Ka! The director stood up from his seat and looked at the one who was sitting on the rose-carved wooden chair. Restraining his anger, he said, \u201cMiss Jiang, you are going to eat all the stage props. Those are not for you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d Ming Shu threw up her hands helplessly. With a huge smile, she suggested, \u201cHow about taking them away?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDoes your agent know that you can eat so much?As the old saying goes, don\u2019t hit someone who smiles at you. So the director asked the prop crew to take away the food props and exchange them for something that couldn\u2019t be eaten.Without food to distract her, Ming Shu could focus solely on work.\u201cAgain.\u201dThe staff quickly returned and prepared to shoot again.The newly arrived beauty was led to the palace. She secretly looked around where the concubine of the highest rank lived, fearful and curious. The most spoiled woman in the entire royal palace was sitting in front of her.Her hands were slippery with sweat. The closer she was to the concubine, the more nervous she became. But her nervousness couldn\u2019t be revealed to others, so she only gripped her sleeves tightly.When the leading maid stopped and moved to the side, the new beauty halted for a second and kneeled down in salutation. \u201cYour Highness.\u201dHer voice trembled slightly, reflecting her nervousness, faint fear, and excitement.The concubine casually held her newly polished nails up to examine them as if she didn\u2019t hear the new beauty\u2019s greeting. The whole palace was silent, the atmosphere oppressive.\u201cDid His Majesty sleep in your room last night?\u201d the concubine asked. She only glanced at the new beauty who was still kneeling down, an act that accentuated her pride and nobility.\u201c\u2026 Y-yes.\u201d The new beauty\u2019s voice trembled, though she tried her best to restrain it.The concubine dropped her hand and said, \u201cHis Majesty has been busy recently, but he still hasn\u2019t forgotten to visit you, so you\u2019d best serve him well. Today I am going to ask somebody to teach you how to serve His Majesty well. Do you wish to learn?\u201dThe new beauty seemed to know what the concubine really meant. She was so frightened. She dared to look up and glance into the imperial concubine\u2019s eyes.Ning Keqing made eye contact with Ming Shu and felt truly frightened for a second. At that time, she seemed to see Ming Shu\u2019s smile in her eyes. Ning Keqing appeared to be scared and quickly looked down to avoid being distracted by Ming Shu\u2019s eyes.The director held his breath and looked at the screen. This was what he wanted.Although lowering her head just now was different from what the script demanded, it was so great that he didn\u2019t stop Ning Keqing.Jiang Nian didn\u2019t need to be mentioned. She\u2019d acted for many years and her skill was exceptional. But this woman who\u2019d joined the film crew through the backdoor and was called a vase\u2014somebody with good looks but no real talent\u2014could also fulfill her role so wonderfully.This part was so successful that the director grinned from ear to ear. \u201cMiss Jiang, you\u2019ve worked hard. Let\u2019s prepare for the next part.\u201dMing Shu didn\u2019t feel tired; it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to play as others. Now she only wanted to find someplace to eat food.She started acting early in the morning and hadn\u2019t eaten anything up until now. She was very hungry.\u201cSister Jiang Nian.\u201d Ning Keqing approached, hands lifting her skirt. She gently smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what happened yesterday. When we finish here, could I invite you to a meal to apologize? I beg Sister Jiang Nian to give me this chance, otherwise I\u2019ll feel guilty.\u201dMing Shu was watching the props crew the entire time she was spoken to so she answered randomly, \u201cWell, you can keep on feeling sorry.\u201dNing Keqing\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. She didn\u2019t think that she would be refused in such a way. Does she have any good opinion of me? Ning Keqing tried to recall when she had offended Jiang Nian.But before this, they even didn\u2019t know each other. After they joined the same film crew, there was also no conflict between them.Ming Shu took several steps and stopped.She said she\u2019d invite me to dinner?Food\u2026I want to eat.Liked it?

She was professional, so she wouldn\u2019t go even if she was invited.En\u2026 I won\u2019t go.\u201cSister Jiang Nian\u2026\u201d Tian Yuan grabbed the food-oriented Ming Shu who was ready to rob the props crew. \u201cSister Aileen called, you\u2019re in trouble!\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d What trouble? What trouble could I get into? I haven\u2019t eaten enough! I\u2019m hungry, I want to eat.Tian Yuan took Ming Shu back to the break room, leaving behind Ning Keqing who had on a strange expression.Tian Yuan gave the cell phone to Ming Shu. Ming Shu glanced at Tian Yuan, currently blocking the door, and unwillingly answered the call. \u201cHello?\u201dThe caller was waiting on Ming Shu. As soon as Ming Shu answered, a sharp female voice emerged from the cell phone. \u201cJiang Nian, whenever I don\u2019t watch you, you cause trouble for me. Did you go crazy yesterday? You directly bullied a newcomer at the film set. Do you know how those journalists like to report? Do you think you\u2019re not popular enough?\u201d\u201cWell, I won\u2019t bully her at the film set next time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYou mean you\u2019re going to bully her someplace else?Aileen couldn\u2019t be more angry. Jiang Nian was excellent and had been fostered by Aileen when she\u2019d just entered showbiz. And as Aileen had expected, Jiang Nian became popular and eye-catching soon enough, and the company decided to propagandize her.At first, the company wanted to establish a pure and innocent idol image for her. And things really went on as they had planned. However, at some point they couldn\u2019t quite recall, Jiang Nian began to be gossiped about alongside other male stars.They could have explained the first rumors away as an accident, the ones that followed as fate. But what about one after another, continuously?Jiang Nian was gossiped about every three to five days. At first, Aileen felt troubled and tried to deal with it, warning Jiang Nian. But it didn\u2019t work and Jiang Nian still did what she wanted.Eventually she came to be called the Gossip Queen. As long as there was no photographic evidence, the company would let Jiang Nian go. Regardless, more love-related gossip would continue to circulate.How about now?She was not involved in romantic rumors now, but instead was caught openly bullying a newcomer!Was she going to crown the headlines in a whole other way?\u201cJiang Nian, tell me the truth, are you in any trouble?\u201d Aileen asked, restraining her anger. Jiang Nian was tactful; she never offended others on her own initiative. And if somebody offended her, the company would deal with it for her.So, logically, she wouldn\u2019t have had a need to bully a newcomer at the film set yesterday.Ming Shu, holding the cell phone, sat down and said, \u201cI\u2019m in big trouble.\u201dAilen was astonished and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the trouble?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m starving to death.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAileen was already prepared to hear some great secret and even thought it might be something like \u201cI have a boyfriend,\u201d\u201dI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d or \u201cI killed somebody.\u201d But she was told that Ming Shu was only hungry.This can\u2019t go on!\u201cJiang Nian, don\u2019t change the subject. Answer my question, why did you bully Ning Keqing?\u201d Aileen\u2019s voice shook with the force of her anger. \u201cDo you know what those journalists wrote about you? They said that you used your higher status to bully a newcomer, that you have no morals. She\u2019s only a newcomer. When and how did she offend you so, that you needed to counterattack in person?\u201d\u201cThere is no reason. Bullying is bullying.\u201d Ming Shu held her chin in her hand, lips curled, and said, \u201cI just bullied her. And I will bully her tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAileen sensed that things were going to get worse. Does Ming Shu have a brain problem? After a moment of silence, she asked Ming Shu to give the cell phone to Tian Yuan and then hung up once she\u2019d passed on some instructions.Tian Yuan looked at Ming Shu strangely and confusedly.Ming Shu opened her cell phone and read the news Aileen mentioned. There were some pictures of her pouring juice on Ning Keqing yesterday. According to the angle, the pictures were taken by somebody standing behind Ning Keqing.There were also some pictures taken of Ning Keqing\u2019s front. The angle was such that everyone could see Ning Keqing was a newcomer being bullied.\u201cWho took this photo?\u201d Ming Shu asked, pointing at the first photo.\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Tian Yuan answered. There were so many people yesterday, no one would know.\u201cGo ask the film crew for the camera recording.\u201d Ming Shu closed the cell phone. \u201cAnd bring me back some food.\u201d\u201cSister Jiang Nian, eh\u2026\u201d You want to eat now?Do you have an appetite even now?Ming Shu looked at Tian Yuan, smiling. Her eyes were dazzling as if reflecting the purest water. But Tian Yuan was afraid of Ming Shu\u2019s gaze and immediately fled the room, her hands covering her face.This news became quite big. When Ming Shu left the vicinity, everybody gossiped about her, but when she passed by, none of them dared to speak. After all, Ming Shu was a big-shot and she could easily get rid of them.It was quite common for superstars to bully newcomers at the film set so everybody was used it. This time the news became big because the newcomer was bullied by Jiang Nian, who had always been implicated in romantic gossip exclusively and had never been reported about so negatively.\u201cSister Jiang Nian.\u201d Ning Keqing, wearing a white dress, stopped Ming Shu and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know who reported to the journalists, but I\u2019ll clarify the situation to them.\u201d It seemed that Ning Keqing was going to cry at any moment.Ming Shu was confused.What are you doing?Where is your high IQ? Are you only smart from time to time? Or are you going to do something in secret?I never denied that I bullied you yesterday. That\u2019s a fact, so what do you want to clarify?Ming Shu smiled and said, \u201cPlease get out of the way.\u201d\u201cSister Jiang Nian, I\u2026\u201d Ning Keqing stared at her, delicate and touching in her sincerity. \u201cI really didn\u2019t mean to. Please don\u2019t be angry with me. I\u2019ll explain everything to those journalists.\u201d\u201cOkay then, go. Be quick about it, otherwise the heat will die down.\u201d Ming Shu kept smiling all the while.Ning Keqing felt surprised in her heart. She stepped forward as if she wanted to hold onto Ming Shu, but before she could even touch her, she fell toward the ground suddenly.In the next second, Ming Shu felt a faint and cool breeze.Ning Keqing was caught by a man.Great. Is this man fleet-footed? He actually caught her. It\u2019s a pity he\u2019s not an athlete.The man was tall and, from head to foot, emitted a certain vibe: I have money. Lots of money.Standing next to him, one would feel oppressed. He helped Ning Keqing steady herself and looked at Ming Shu sharply.He was Ning Keqing\u2019s Money Boss, Li Shaonan.He was extremely handsome and powerful. Such a man was a woman\u2019s dream lover.As soon as he showed up, all suddenly became quiet as if someone pushed the stop button.Ming Shu smiled at Li Shaonan and spoke first. \u201cMiss Ning, don\u2019t fall over like that when you try to frame someone next time. I suggest you face down so it\u2019ll be easier to gain others\u2019 sympathy without being obvious. How can you frame others successfully without hurting yourself, am I right?\u201d ->No one could detect any irony or anger in her words, only a slight smile. It seemed she was really advising Ning Keqing sincerely.\u201cJiang Nian\u2026 I didn\u2019t try anything like that,\u201d Ning Keqing denied, distressed.\u201cJiang Nian?\u201d The man put his arm around Ning Keqing\u2019s shoulders and asked, \u201cIt was you who poured juice on her yesterday, right?\u201d His voice was low and his eyes gleamed from time to time.Liked it?

You want to pour some on me?\u201d Ming Shu admitted without any hesitation.\u201c\u2026\u201dHaving seen all kinds of unreasonably troublesome people who always tried to quibble, Li Shaonan had never yet met someone so unashamed. She even asked him with a smile if he wanted to pour juice on her.If he did that, he\u2019d only be degrading himself.\u201cI\u2019m leaving, then.\u201d I\u2019m quite a busy man.Ming Shu walked past the two and toward a staff member who was staring straight at them. \u201cDid you take this picture?\u201d Ming Shu asked, holding her cell phone up.The staff member was torn away from the handsome face of that golden thigh and looked at the photo on Ming Shu\u2019s screen. Her facial expression suddenly changed. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201dMing Shu lightly swiped the screen; another blurred picture appeared before the staff member\u2019s eyes. It was a recording of the set.\u201cIt can be inferred from this recording that only two people were able to take a photo at this angle at that time, and clearly the other one did not have a cell phone, so it must have been you.\u201dThe staff member\u2019s face turned pale and she tried to explain. \u201cI\u2026 I just sent it to a friend, I didn\u2019t do anything. Sister Jiang Nian, I know it was wrong. Please don\u2019t tell the director, I can\u2019t lose this job.\u201dOn a film set, taking photos without permission generally isn\u2019t allowed. Even if it weren\u2019t a mandatory rule, if Ming Shu decided to hold this woman accountable for the leak, she would be unable to defend herself.Putting away her phone, Ming Shu smiled and said sweetly, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much. I\u2019m just here to tell you to get a good shot of me next time. My pretty face was distorted. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What? the surrounding people thought.You spent so much time getting the surveillance video for a thorough analysis, just to tell the responsible for the leak to make you look better next time?WTF?Is she crazy?Ming Shu turned around; it only took her a minute or so to talk to the staff. Li Shaonan and Ning Keqing were still standing there. It was hard to tell whether they were shocked by Ming Shu\u2019s unique style or were waiting to give her trouble.Ming Shu fearlessly walked over. Ning Keqing acted like she was terrified, her body trembling.Ming Shu genuinely had to praise her: This is what we call a true drama queen.She could play the part anytime and anywhere.Ming Shu stopped, facing the slightly gloomy gaze of Li Shaonan. She turned her eyes to Ning Keqing and said, \u201cMiss Ning, why are you shaking? If you\u2019re sick, you have to see a doctor. Don\u2019t delay or it\u2019ll lead to big problems.\u201dMing Shu was so happy to gain Hatred Points.Aileen heard this just as she arrived.After recognizing the man standing opposite Ming Shu, she felt her blood surging and almost couldn\u2019t suppress a fervent desire to beat Jiang Nian as violently as possible.Li Shaonan\u2019s arm tightened around Ning Keqing\u2019s shoulders. Ning Keqing seemed to want to say something, but Li Shaonan\u2019s squeeze made her shut up. She bowed her head and dutifully played the role of a newbie being bullied by the big shot in the circle.\u201cMiss Jiang.\u201d Li Shaonan\u2019s voice gave Aileen a shock. People nearby also shuddered and looked to Ming Shu worriedly, one after another. \u201cYou are a little different from the rumors.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll find that I\u2019m going to be even more so.\u201d I\u2019ll bully your little girl in all kinds of different ways and make you angry enough to explode. Scared?Ming Shu had a sweet smile on her face, her gaze as soft as flowing water. She didn\u2019t seem to be afraid of him at all.Li Shaonan squinted his eyes a little and pasted on an extremely cruel sneer. He then walked away with his arm still wrapped around Ning Keqing.Pressured by his powerful aura, nobody dared to take a breath until his figure disappeared completely.\u201cEveryone said there\u2019s someone behind Ning Keqing, but I never thought it would be him.\u201d\u201cOMG, with him supporting Ning Keqing, who\u2019d dare to provoke her now?\u201d\u201cLuckily I didn\u2019t offend her before this.\u201dSurrounded by whispering, Aileen stalked over to Ming Shu like she was walking on the edge of a knife. She had to painfully endure her strong, violent urges so as to not slap her.\u201cSister Aileen.\u201d Ming Shu greeted her breezily.She dared to smile!She was still laughing aloud!Did she know who she\u2019d just offended?Ugh, I\u2019m going to explode!No words could describe Aileen\u2019s feelings right now.Watched by various pairs of eyes, she pulled Ming Shu back to the lounge.Once the door was closed, Aileen burst out completely.\u201cJiang Nian, do you know who that man is?\u201d Do you know? Do you know? Do you know?Aileen was howling on the inside.With just one word, he could expel her from the entertainment industry.No matter how many connections one had, it meant nothing to him.\u201cLi Shaonan.\u201d Ming Shu sat down carelessly.\u201cSince you know he\u2019s Li Shaonan, why were you provoking him?!\u201d Are you crazy? Aileen shouted at Ming Shu, eager to pull her ear and make her realize the seriousness of the situation right now. \u201cDo you know that you might be ostracized because of today\u2019s behavior? From now on, there might be no place for you in showbiz.\u201dLi Shaonan, the famous tycoon of the entertainment circle, possessed an unpredictable temper and was a golden bachelor who had innumerable women chasing him, desperate to sleep with him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll do something else. I don\u2019t think Li Shaonan controls the whole world, does he?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDo something else, that\u2019s easy to say!Jiang Nian really was crazy.Aileen reached out to touch Ming Shu\u2019s forehead as if to check her temperature. Ming Shu stared at her in confusion.Aileen was in her mid-thirties. Because of her many years of working experience, she\u2019d always appeared to be a capable, intelligent woman.\u201cIt\u2019s not a fever,\u201d said Aileen, placing her hands on Ming Shu\u2019s shoulders. \u201cTell me, my little ancestor, what on earth happened to you these last two days?\u201dWhat happened to make you this free?So free as to offend the biggest big shot in this industry.Why don\u2019t you fly straight to the heaven!Ming Shu pushed Aileen\u2019s hands aside, helplessly spreading her own. She thought, Who the hell knows what I\u2019ve been going through.Isn\u2019t this a place where I can do whatever I want?[Attention, Guest. I recommend you not violate the character setting. Avoiding unnecessary trouble will be helpful to completing your task.]Ming Shu was able to communicate with the Harmony System within her mind, so she grunted. Before coming here, you promised that I could do anything.[I\u2019m just offering a suggestion.]Shut up.[\u2026]Aileen really couldn\u2019t imagine how a person could change so quickly. The familiar face looking at her was definitely Jiang Nian\u2019s, even the mole on her neck was there, but everything else seemed different.But what\u2019s done is done and being angry is of no use. What\u2019s most important now is to cover up this matter, or Jiang Nian will ruin her star career.Those who displeased Li Shaonan all ended up miserable.Aileen calmed down a little and asked again, \u201cDid you know the one behind Ning Keqing was Li Shaonan?\u201dIt had never been spoken of. No one imagined that Ning Keqing, a vase in the world of acting, could have anything to do with Li Shaonan.\u201cYeah, I knew.\u201d Even if she suffered the wrath of gods, she had to obtain those Hatred Points.She couldn\u2019t do anything about it.[\u2026] Such exciting helplessness.Aileen had a ferocious look on her face like she was about to kill Ming Shu at any moment.

Meanwhile, Ming Shu was idly holding the phone reading comments online, a cup of tea and a small snack bag at hand.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, where did you get that snack?\u201d Tian Yuan encountered such a scene as soon as she returned from seeing Aileen off. She immediately went over to block access to the bag and said, \u201cStop eating! What would you do if you got fat?\u201dTian Yuan was almost crying. Sister Aileen was already enough for me, why did Sister Jiang Nian choose to be so weird now too\u2026Ming Shu tried to take her snack back, watching Tian Yuan with melting eyes. \u201cLittle Yuanzi, give it back.\u201d\u201cNo way. Sister Aileen told you to cut back on food.\u201d Tian Yuan quickly wrapped up the bag and stepped back.Sister Jiang Nian is still in the mood to eat? Is this what people call turning grief and indignation into appetite?Her Sister Jiang Nian did not have this skill previously\u2026Or was it newly acquired?Organizing her thoughts, Tian Yuan comfortingly told Ming Shu, \u201cSister Jiang Nian, it\u2019s actually not a big deal. You don\u2019t have to worry about it too much, Sister Aileen will definitely fix it for you.\u201dAlthough, she didn\u2019t believe that herself.\u201cUgh, I\u2019m so worried,\u201d Ming Shu said.Hearing this, Tian Yuan finally relaxed. After going through what she had just now, Sister Jiang Nian must be anxious. She released a small sigh and said carefully, \u201cSister Jiang Nian, you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll starve to death if you don\u2019t return my snack.\u201d Ming Shu held out her hands with a smile.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe stomped her feet, anger turning her face to a bulging bun. Sister Jiang Nian always knew how to tease her.Tian Yuan left the lounge with the snack, looking like she was going to complain to someone in tears.\u201cWait, leave the snack!\u201dMing Shu felt a bit depleted after losing the food. Her mouth began twisting in grief.She was hungry.She was so hungry she didn\u2019t have the strength to smile.Let\u2019s go out for some food.\u2026Ning Keqing returned at dusk since she had to film a scene in the evening.Everyone on the set now knew she was Li Shaonan\u2019s chosen and desperately sought any chance to please her.But Ning Keqing still wore the same meek face. She didn\u2019t treat them arrogantly because of Li Shaonan.This unintentionally won her a very favorable impression.Ming Shu thought Ning Keqing might ask her Money Boss to take revenge on Jiang Nian, yet several days passed and nothing happened. The heat brought on by Jiang Nian bullying a newbie was beginning to fade.Knowing to wait for a better opportunity\u2014it seemed Ning Keqing had gotten her IQ back.Interesting. Perhaps it\u2019s time to find another chance to obtain some Hatred Points.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, there\u2019s a banquet this evening that Sister Aileen wants you to attend,\u201d Tian Yuan reported to Ming Shu, holding the phone.A banquet\u2026Ming Shu thought for a while, eyes softly changing, and then answered with a wide, beaming smile, \u201cGreat.\u201dBanquet equals food.I have to go.Checking Ming Shu from head to toe to make sure she had no snacks on her person, Tian Yuan turned around to call Aileen back.The minute Tian Yuan left, Ming Shu pulled out a box of cookies from the pile of clothes next to her.\u201cSister Jiang Nian!\u201dMing Shu calmly pushed the cookies back again and picked up the nearest script, pretending to read. \u201cWho hid a box of cookies here? Next time you must warn those cleaning people not to leave things everywhere, what if someone eats them?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSister Jiang Nian, show me more of your exquisite acting.Tian Yuan found that Sister Jiang Nian had become obsessed with food. She would start to eat anywhere at any time behind her back. Even the prop food couldn\u2019t escape; the props crew had begun to hide from her.If she ate up all the props, what were they going to use on set!\u2026The director allowed Ming Shu a day off for the banquet. They started to get ready in the afternoon, and it took over two hours to put on the gown and do the hair.Aileen was expecting them outside the hotel.When Ming Shu\u2019s car appeared and parked, Aileen suddenly became alert and quickly moved toward it.The lurking reporters also came to life. These people were familiar with all of the stars\u2019 cars, probably more so than with their own.Ming Shu hadn\u2019t showed up in public these days, but here she was now. How could they not be excited?The car door opened and a figure in purple stepped out.Ming Shu was wearing a light purple strapless gown with some lace that decorated the chest. She looked both lovely and sexy. The three-dimensional waist design enhanced the outline of her perfect body, and her slender and fair-skinned legs were exposed past the hem, which was short in front and long in back.The Host had long, slightly curled hair. Ming Shu let it fall freely over her snow white shoulder and back, partly hiding the skin and making her look very alluring.At first, the reporters were stunned by Ming Shu\u2019s beauty. Then all of a sudden they streamed to her, throwing out sharp questions one after another.\u201cMiss Jiang, about the news that you were bullying a newbie on set, is it true?\u201d\u201cMay I ask you, Miss Jiang, how far you\u2019ve gotten with Mr. Zhou, who was rumored to have an affair with you last week? Is he your boyfriend at present?\u201dAileen held Ming Shu\u2019s arm and reminded her, \u201cDon\u2019t talk.\u201dThe hotel staff had arrived to help keep the order, clearing way for Ming Shu\u2019s passage.\u201cMiss Jiang, do you have any personal grudge against Miss Ning?\u201d someone suddenly asked.Personal grudge?Nonsense.I only take scheduled appointments.As Ming Shu was about to answer that question, there was an uproar behind her.A Bentley pulled up beside them. It was Li Shaonan\u2019s exclusive car, known by many people in the circle\u2014no wonder they were so enthusiastic.He was the tycoon of the entertainment industry.Li Shaonan got out first. With the way his swift, fierce gaze swept over everyone, the temperature inexplicably dropped and the bubbly crowd quieted down. He walked across to the other side of the car to open the door and reached one of his hands out.Ning Keqing put her hand in Li Shaonan\u2019s and stepped out of the car. She was wearing a white dress that dragged on the ground and showed off her snowy skin. Her hair was in an up-do, two curly strands framing her face. Flushed cheeks and restless eyes made her look like an elf accidentally dropped down to this world. Anyone who saw her would want to protect and cherish her.\u201cOh my god! Boss Li is here!\u201d\u201cWho is the woman beside him?\u201dReporters were not bold enough to sidle up to Li Shaonan, so they just took pictures at a distance. Li Shaonan was like a king; placing Ning Keqing\u2019s hand on his arm, he escorted her to the hotel.Ming Shu was standing in their way, so they had to walk by her if they intended to enter.\u201cSister Jiang Nian.\u201d Ning Keqing volunteered a greeting in a somewhat afflicted tone.\u201c\u2026\u201d What the hell? Have I done anything to wrong you?Li Shannan had to stop for Ning Keqing, and his cold stare turned on Ming Shu like the blade of a knife. Aileen\u2019s hands were sweating. In relation to what happened last time, Li Shaonan had yet to do anything, but that didn\u2019t mean he would let it pass.Cruelty shining in his eyes, Li Shaonan said, \u201cMiss Jiang is very bold.\u201d\u201cAm I?\u201d Ming Shu said liltingly. She kept her formal smile even as Aileen covertly pinched her hard. \u201cI\u2019m scared of myself when I start acting bold.\u201dThe air pressure around Li Shaonan dropped lower. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting, then.\u201d\u201cLi, it was my fault last time. You promised not to blame Sister Jiang Nian.\u201d Ning Keqing pulled at Li Shaonan\u2019s arm slightly, looking like she really was begging him to forgive Ming Shu.Yet, beneath everyone\u2019s notice, her other hand sent several beads scattering at Ming Shu\u2019s feet.They were all in long gowns and the color of the beads was very similar to that of the carpet. Plus, everyone was distracted by other things, so even Aileen didn\u2019t notice Ning Keqing\u2019s action.However, Ming Shu saw it. She rapidly picked up her dress and stepped back. With a small smile, her voice rang out: \u201cWell, Miss Ning, such valuable beads shouldn\u2019t be discarded. They\u2019re worth a lot of good food!\u201dLiked it?

Earlier, some reporters had taken photos of Ning Keqing wearing a bracelet decorated with light red beads.Ning Keqing was surprised at Ming Shu\u2019s reaction and remained stunned for a moment, then swiftly adjusted her facial expression and said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sister Jiang Nian. I didn\u2019t notice it was broken.\u201dMing Shu\u2019s smile widened. \u201cOkay, Miss Ning, next time you shouldn\u2019t buy this kind of bracelet. It\u2019s of such poor quality; those loose beads nearly tripped me. If next time someone really trips, you\u2019ll be sorry all over again.\u201dThe reporters surrounding them suddenly burst into discussion. The truth was already clear.Stars like them would never buy fake or cheap products, and since genuine articles were always high-quality, then the bracelet must have been purposely broken by its wearer.Now the subject of various doubtful gazes, Ning Keqing secretly and resentfully rolled her eyes at Ming Shu. She hated Ming Shu\u2019s smile. It appeared warm and gracious, but to her, it was nothing but mocking.Ning Keqing controlled her emotions and said with a pitiful voice, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Sister Jiang Nian. I have no idea why it broke.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d Li Shaonan\u2019s cold voice rang out all of a sudden. He held onto Ning Keqing\u2019s slender waist, looking at Ming Shu. \u201cMiss Jiang, you disrespect Ning Keqing over and over again; don\u2019t you know the consequences of that?\u201dEven if Li Shaonan was aware that Ning Keqing did it on purpose, he would only choose to support her.Ming Shu combed a hand through her hair, rolling her eyes. \u201cWhat consequences? Tell me about them.\u201d I\u2019ve experienced worse winds and waves. How is it possible I could fear you, a tyrannical boss?Do you expect to inherit my snacks after scaring me to death?Their opposer\u2019s powerful presence cooled Aileen\u2019s whole body; even an experienced agent such as herself was feeling the pressure.A deathly expression had appeared on her face. Aileen would have covered her artiste\u2019s mouth instantly if there hadn\u2019t been so many journalists present. Wasn\u2019t it enough to cause trouble on set? And now she wanted to cause more in front of these reporters? Did Jiang Nian really want to be expelled from showbiz?Aileen pinched Ming Shu hard to try to stop her. Yet Ming Shu seemed to feel no pain at all; not even the curve of her mouth relaxed.Had her artiste been possessed by demons or developed some mental illness?Li Shaonan hummed a short \u201cHoh\u201d after he and Ming Shu stared at each other for a few seconds.But Ming Shu cut in before he could speak and said, \u201cMr. Li, are you going to say something like, \u2018Woman, you\u2019ve attracted my attention\u2019?\u201dThat kind of tyrannical boss style\u2014I refuse.\u201c\u2026\u201d It was the first time Li Shaonan had encountered a woman could infuriate him to this extent.He was even more angry now than before, when Ning Keqing defied him!\u201cMiss Jiang is really brave. I wonder how much longer you\u2019ll be able to smile like this.\u201d This woman had completely pissed him off. If it hadn\u2019t been for Ning Keqing\u2019s pleading last time, he would have already taken measures to punish her.\u201cAt the very least, longer than you will.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s beaming smile was a stark contrast to Aileen\u2019s shadowed face.The only thing Aileen wanted to do now was find a pleasant place to wait for death. Because nothing could redeem this situation, and the impending consequences were probably worse than death.\u201cHmm!\u201d Li Shaonan\u2019s icy hum sounded again. He decided to abandon this dispute with the woman\u2014he would face her real strength later\u2014and continued moving toward the hotel with his arm around Ning Keqing.As Li Shaonan passed by, Ming Shu unexpectedly stuck her foot out, smiling happily.Thump.Li Shaonan was caught off guard and tripped over, his whole body striking the carpet. Ning Keqing was also inevitably dragged down with him. The two of them both fell in a graceless heap.An awkward silence befell the entire crowd. It felt like someone had paused time; everything seemed to move in slow motion.Just a few seconds dragged on long enough to last a century. When everyone realized what had happened, first came their quiet and profound exclamations, followed by countless shuttering sounds.Kacha, kacha, kacha\u2026Aileen was pinned on the spot, rigid like a stone. Her expression could no longer reflect her inner shock.Was she merely having a dream where her artiste stuck a foot out to trip Li Shaonan?She must be seeing things.No, she must still be lying in her bed, asleep and dreaming. Please wake up, please wake up\u2026Li Shaonan\u2019s bodyguards, who were waiting beside the car, immediately surged forth to help their boss up and force the reporters to delete those pictures.Li Shaonan adjusted his clothes, staring at Ming Shu dourly. Ming Shu just briskly walked past them with a mild smile. \u201cFirst come, first served. Mr. Li, it\u2019s safer for you to walk behind me.\u201dSeeing Ming Shu leaving, Aileen hopelessly followed her.She didn\u2019t feel her heart restart until they entered the hotel and Li Shaonan was out of sight. He was too frightening.They\u2019d offended such a demon. What could be worse than this?Nothing![Guest, there\u2019s no need to acquire Hatred Points from Li Shaonan.] the Harmony System reminded her.\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference.\u201d I don\u2019t care.[\u2026] So you\u2019ll seek Hatred Points from just anyone?\u2026Li Shaonan made a fool of himself outside the hotel, so, unwilling to lose any more face, he left with Ning Keqing shortly after.The reporters had been taken care of, but Li Shaonan couldn\u2019t stop everyone.Some onlookers fearlessly leaked out the events that transpired outside the hotel. After that, the various news outlets joined in.#Bullying a newbie wasn\u2019t enough, Jiang Nian further offends the Money Boss behind her, how will she stay in the industry?##The reveal of Ning Keqing\u2019s Money Boss who quarreled with Jiang Nian at event##Jiang Nian and Ning Keqing##Jiang Nian offending the tycoon##Jiang Nian bullying newbie##Ning Keqing and Li Shaonan#These hot topics were pushed to the top immediately. It seemed like someone had paid for this.But no matter in the news or in the hot topic column, no one had mentioned Li Shaonan falling over outside the hotel. Whenever some passersby sent out the story, it would shortly disappear, with no audience paying it any attention.Below the hot topics, netizens of great imagination fancifully imagined an outdated love triangle, with many following the story and adding more funny jokes to it. A very joyful scene.Meanwhile, the person they were talking about was fighting Tian Yuan for the last bag of chips. Her small face flushed, Tian Yuan was desperately pulling the bag. \u201cSister Jiang Nian, you\u2019ve made Sister Aileen angry enough to explode. If she sees you eating snacks again, she\u2019ll kill me!\u201d\u201cBut she hasn\u2019t come back.\u201d Immediately after, Aileen opened the door and came in.With a cough, Ming Shu released her grip and said smilingly, \u201cLittle Yuanzi, don\u2019t eat too much at night, you\u2019ll get fat.\u201dTian Yuan was left holding the bag, dumbfounded. What had she done to deserve this?Glancing at Tian Yuan, Aileen directly shoved her cell phone toward Ming Shu, several days\u2019 worth of accumulated anger finally bursting out. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you recently? Bullying Ning Keqing, provoking Li Shaonan, and even causing trouble in public today\u2014tomorrow, are you going to kill someone?!\u201dLiked it?

She dragged over a chair to sit in, slamming her hand fiercely on the desk in front of Ming Shu. Tian Yuan, who was standing in a corner of the room, was startled by the loud sound and shuddered. She didn\u2019t dare make any noise and draw attention to herself.So scary!Aileen forced a gruesome smile onto her face. \u201cTell me, Jiang Nian, what on earth are you planning?\u201d\u201cTo bully Ning Keqing.\u201d Isn\u2019t that exactly why I\u2019m here? What else can I do?The smile suddenly disappeared from Aileen\u2019s face and she stared at Ming Shu blankly for a long time. Then, with a haggard voice, she said, \u201cAre you kidding me? What\u2019s the deal between you and Ning Keqing? How did she offend you?\u201dAileen had asked Tian Yuan about this, but it turned out there was no relation between her and Ning Keqing. Jiang Nian started to bully her for no apparent reason. Was something wrong with her?\u201cWell, she pissed me off in every way,\u201d Ming Shu answered.It\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019m just taking the heat for the Harmony System.\u201c\u2026\u201d I\u2019ll take her to see a doctor , Aileen thought.\u2026The next day, Ming Shu received a call from the director telling her she was expelled. No reason was given, but apparently, only the golden thigh Li Shaonan could wield such power in the industry.\u201cWhat a weak snub,\u201d Ming Shu commented after hanging up the phone, shoving a red bean cake into her mouth.Tian Yuan was silent. What? Weak? You offended that Boss Li first, so isn\u2019t it common sense that he\u2019d take revenge on you? Next you\u2019ll probably be completely cut off from acting\u2026Of course, Tian Yuan dared not say that now since Aileen hadn\u2019t received such information. If she did get bad news later, there would be another storm. She had to save her energy in order to survive.Ming Shu leisurely finished the red bean cake, then searched in her phone\u2019s contacts list. Finally she found a number lying at the bottom and dialed.Ring\u2026 ring\u2026Several rings later, a surprisingly cheerful voice answered, \u201cYoung Miss, you\u2019re calling back?\u201dThe Host had a sound family background. However, her parents didn\u2019t approve of her entering the entertainment industry. They thought it was humiliating to the family when she had to frequently appear in public.As a result, Jiang Nian started her career in secret. Later, when she became famous, her family found out and began to hinder her in every possible way.Because of this, the Host had a tense relationship with her family. In the end, the Jiang family left Jiang Nian alone, while Jiang Nian seldom returned home. Even when they met with each other, it always ended up in arguments related to her career choice.It had been nearly two years since the Host last saw her parents. It had been around then that she began to gain more attention and spent more time flying from place to place.Speaking of which, it was when the Host was rumored to be having affairs with male stars that her relationship with her family worsened\u2014perhaps it was her manner of protesting?In the end, it was because of this issue that the Host didn\u2019t ask her family for any favors even when she was fiercely suppressed by Ning Keqing in the story.Why didn\u2019t she use the most powerful weapon at her disposal? Well, it actually made sense. If she turned to her family, the one in the story\u2019s leading role would have had too hard a time. So this was what they called a contrived plot device?\u201cIs Mrs\u2026.\u201d Ming Shu swallowed the following words and coughed, changing the form of address. \u201cWell\u2026 Is Mom at home?\u201d\u201cMadam Jiang just went out. What can I do for you, Young Miss?\u201d It was the Jiang family\u2019s servant answering the phone; she tentatively asked: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since you came home, Young Miss. Yesterday Madam Jiang and the young master were talking about you. Perhaps when you\u2019re not busy, you\u2019d like to stop by for a meal?\u201dTalking about her?The Jiang family must\u2019ve caught wind of the big news topics yesterday.\u201cI\u2019ll come home tonight.\u201d\u201cAnd Madam Jiang hasn\u2019t been very well recently, if you\u2026 Huh? Young Miss will come home tonight? Wonderful, I\u2019ll cook your favorite food. How about crispy braised crucian carp and poached spicy pork slices?\u201dHearing the food names, Ming Shu answered \u201cYes\u201d without any hesitation.Once she\u2019d hung up the phone, Ming Shu\u2019s eyes started to gleam. According to the Host\u2019s memory, the Jiang family\u2019s chef was very good at cooking delicious meals.[Guest, there\u2019s an additional task for you to complete.] Without warning, the Harmony System issued this notice.Ming Shu was in a good mood. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d[Eliminate Jiang Xun\u2019s feelings for Ning Keqing.]Jiang Xun?After delving into the Host\u2019s memories, Ming Shu remembered that Jiang Xun seemed to be the Host\u2019s cheap brother. He was called the cheap brother because he was adopted by the Jiang family.Before the Host was born, when her parents were on a trip by the sea, they met the abandoned Jiang Xun. Mother Jiang insisted on adopting him, so Jiang Xun became the Host\u2019s cheap brother.The Host had never liked this brother of hers. Later, when her relationship with her family stiffened, she saw even less of him than originally.In the story\u2026 It seemed Jiang Xun would really fall in love with Ning Keqing.He appeared as a supporting role many times, but would meet a miserable end.No problem! I have everything under control.\u2026Ming Shu traveled to the villa where the Jiang family lived, according to her memories. It wasn\u2019t a top-grade community, but it boasted an excellent environment. The Host loved this place the most\u2014and that was why the Jiang family hadn\u2019t moved for all these years.It showed that the Host was doted on by her family. It was only because the Host remained true to herself when the family didn\u2019t support her, as well as her being young and aggressive, that things had devolved so thoroughly.Ming Shu parked her car outside the villa. She got out and rang the doorbell.The gate was opened immediately after the bell rang. There was a tall figure standing in the shadow of the gate. It was a man with a handsome yet icy appearance whose eyes watched Ming Shu dully.A straight suit with the neckband widened to a larger size, white collarbone exposed to the air\u2014a totally abstinent style.This man was the Host\u2019s brother, Jiang Xun.Jiang Xun opened the gate and stood aside, uttering not a word.He also hadn\u2019t seen his younger sister in a while. Usually she would be seen on TV or in the newspaper. She was like a shining queen, constantly surrounded by a cluster of subjects.Now, seeing her in person, Jiang Xun found that she was even prettier than on TV.Ming Shu\u2019s mouth curved; she entered the house. Jiang Xun reached out for her bag as he closed the gate and said, \u201cMom and Dad are waiting.\u201dHis voice was very pleasing and clear, like flowing water. It was totally different from his dreary aura.Jiang Xun was a little surprised that he was able to take Ming Shu\u2019s bag\u2014before, if he dared to touch her things, she would immediately become angry.Jiang Xun looked up to see Ming Shu walking into the house. Out of nowhere, he thought her figure seemed to be different from before, more vivacious.Father Jiang and Mother Jiang were both sitting in the living room. The former was reading a newspaper while the latter stared at him, the atmosphere a little depressed.The servants\u2019 greetings emerged from the hallway and Mother Jiang stood up swiftly, looking toward the voices.Ming Shu came in with a sweet smile on her face, gloriously gentle and lovable. Mother Jiang looked like she was about to cry all of a sudden and quickly moved to give Ming Shu a hug. \u201cNiannian, my poor Niannian.\u201dEvery parent loves their children.Father Jiang put down the newspaper, silently looking at Jiang Nian and Mother Jiang through his glasses. A muted softness spread across his serious face.Ming Shu was perfectly at ease with Mother Jiang\u2019s big hug. She lightly patted her shoulder and smiled. \u201cMom, can you cry later? I\u2019m starving, can I have dinner first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBecause he heard this, Jiang Xun was wearing a strange expression when he appeared in the doorway.Liked it?

Ming Shu was 100% immersed in her food, and the measuring gazes coming from opposite her didn\u2019t affect her at all.\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d Father Jiang made a coughing sound and asked with a rigid face, \u201cJiang Nian, what\u2019d you come home for?\u201d\u201cTo have dinner,\u201d Ming Shu answered, the words distorted as she chewed.\u201c\u2026\u201dMother Jiang kicked her husband under the table, then put more food on Ming Shu\u2019s plate with a satisfied smile. \u201cThe child rarely comes home for a meal, save your words for later. Come, Niannian, try some of your favorite crucian carp.\u201dBefore, she\u2019d always drop in just to shout at them. When had she ever had dinner quietly like this?Jiang Xun was sitting next to Ming Shu, his chopsticks unmoving. He barely ate anything and was thinking about something with a cold expression.Ming Shu finished almost every dish on the table, making Mother Jiang feel both relieved and worried. She couldn\u2019t help wondering how her treasured daughter was living and eating outside.\u201cNiannian, come home to Mom, all right? Look how skinny you are. It worries me every time I think of you living all alone away from home.\u201d Mother Jiang was choking up again. She gazed at her beloved daughter with tears in her eyes.Ming Shu put down her chopsticks and spoke while wiping her mouth with a handkerchief. \u201cI weigh over forty-five kilograms, I\u2019m not skinny.\u201dThis sentence thoroughly ruined the atmosphere.Father Jiang clapped a hand on the table, asking the question that had consistently come to mind. \u201cWhat happened with all that news online?\u201d\u201cLi Shaonan was bullying me and throwing his weight around!\u201d Ming Shu answered, meeting Father Jiang\u2019s eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun thought, Why do I feel that my sister\u2019s a bit odd?Father Jiang also felt perturbed. How could his rebellious daughter act like a tender lamb? In the past, she would\u2019ve flipped the table by now.\u201cBullying you?\u201d Mother Jiang didn\u2019t overthink it; all she paid attention to was the fact that her little girl was being bullied. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Tell me, Niannian, I will not allow the pearl of my family to be toyed with!\u201dLeaning back in her chair, Ming Shu said, \u201cLi Shaonan took away my role in the film; he intends to knock me out of the industry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing this, Mother Jiang finally could not bear her anger.Meanwhile, Father Jiang calmly responded, \u201cJust take the chance to come back home, don\u2019t stay in that business anymore. Being the young miss of the Jiang family, you will want for nothing.\u201dSaying this, Father Jiang expected a rebuttal. But Ming Shu only widened her smile and answered, \u201cDad, I\u2019m the Jiang family\u2019s young miss. If I just swallow my pride, people will laugh not only at me, but at our family! Shouldn\u2019t I retaliate against him? What do you say, Dad?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well, yes.\u201d Father Jiang nodded. Then he suddenly realized he\u2019d been led by the nose.He was about to take it back, but Ming Shu spoke again. \u201cSo, Dad, I want Starlight Entertainment under our family\u2019s name.\u201dJiang Xun choked a little, coughing.Now both Mother and Father Jiang were looking at their daughter like she was a stranger.\u2026Ming Shu didn\u2019t talk back to Father Jiang, and it turned out Father Jiang was an easygoing parent. Because Ming Shu played a few tricks, in the end, she successfully acquired Starlight Entertainment.Before, the Host and her father were very opposed to each other due to their stubborn natures. Neither of them were willing to concede.If the Host had come back home and spent time with her family, Father Jiang would absolutely agree with her. He probably would have supported her; after all, she was the only young miss of the Jiang family.Starlight was handed over to Jiang Xun. Father Jiang was concerned over Ming Shu\u2019s inexperience, so he let Jiang Xun help her.Mother Jiang asked Ming Shu to stay for the night. Thinking of the tasty food, Ming Shu happily agreed.It was all for the food.Ah!I have a tough life too!\u201cNiannian.\u201dMing Shu stopped at the bedroom door and saw Jiang Xun walking toward her from around the corner. He was very handsome, not losing to Li Shaonan at all, and with his profound gaze, he always looked like a courteous yet unapproachable man.But for Ming Shu, he gave off a kind of glum feeling.Jiang Xun handed her a full glass of milk, studying her face. \u201cMom said it\u2019ll help you sleep.\u201dRaised her eyebrow, Ming Shu took the milk with a smile. \u201cThank you.\u201dJiang Xun was a bit stunned, but immediately came back to himself and said, \u201cGood night.\u201dBringing the milk with her into the room, Ming Shu put it on the desk and went to take a shower. Then, when she was sitting on the bed with her legs folded, rubbing her wet hair with a towel, she glanced at the milk again.She deliberated whether to drink it.Finally, putting the towel aside, Ming Shu took the glass and licked her mouth with the tip of her tongue.But with a sigh, she stopped. Looking around the room, she saw several plants on the window sill.She stood up and poured the milk onto the soil. She then returned to switch off the lights and sleep.I won\u2019t eat or drink just anything I\u2019m given, hmph!\u2026The next day, the news of Ming Shu being replaced in The Ever-Burning Light was spread across the whole circle, making headlines everywhere.A superstar of her level was never replaced by others, she was the one who replaced others. Therefore, this was definitely big news, and numerous media outlets scrambled to repost it. They\u2019d certainly push this topic to the very top.Because of You: Is this the prelude to her being forced out of the industry?Reflection in Left Hand: Full of beans! It\u2019s impossible for our Niannian to be forced out. Don\u2019t make irresponsible remarks if you know nothing. Niannian, cheer up, we\u2019ll always support you.Smiling Like a Pig: Earlier she was bullying Ning Keqing and now she has offended Ning Keqing\u2019s Money Boss, isn\u2019t this her being forced out? You crazy fans, do you have mental problems?Zero 222: She deserves it! This woman is a b*tch who\u2019ll sleep with any actor. She should be evicted and stop polluting our eyes.Moon Breeze: Niannian, I offer you my heart. No matter what happens we\u2019ll be on your side, so cheer up.Online, the haters and the fans had erupted into war. Ming Shu was amused by the influx of comments as she ate breakfast.It\u2019s getting funny, a lot funnier than earlier.Her whole body seemed to reflect sunshine, a slight, sweet smile on her face. She looked like a glittering star, full of vitality. Jiang Xun couldn\u2019t tear his eyes off her.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dJiang Xun was sitting across from Ming Shu. At this time, Mother and Father Jiang had both gone out, leaving the two alone in the villa.Glancing at her cheap brother, Ming Shu put down the phone and busied herself with drinking her porridge.The sweet, soft taste made her expression turn gentler.After drinking up her bowl of porridge, Ming Shu stood and looked at Jiang Xun, leaned in, and smilingly said, \u201cAn eye for an eye.\u201dShe was not a softhearted person.If someone dared to pull her hair, she would tear all of their hair from their scalp.That smile made Jiang Xun feel a bit lost.His nose was overwhelmed by a delicate fragrance. It was her scent, as light as that of bamboo\u2014faint yet long-lasting.Jiang Xun returned to himself when Ming Xi walked toward the door with her bag in hand. He stood up and followed her, saying in a low, deep voice, \u201cLi Shaonan is a tough guy.\u201dAlthough the Jiang and Lu families had their own separate main businesses, not often running across each other, they had met on some occasions.Li Shaonan didn\u2019t leave a sound impression on Jiang Xun.Ming Shu pushed aside a strand of hair that fell in her face. \u201cWell, I look forward to finding out exactly how tough this guy is.\u201dLiked it?

And as soon as it was released, it became the hottest topic; other negative articles about Jiang Nian immediately became less popular.She was in charge of Starlight Entertainment. Would she care for that role?Li Shaonan slid down to the bottom of the article, in which there was a picture. In that picture, a woman wore a light-colored dress and smiled softly, as if she cherished the whole world. Even the light in her eyes was gentle.But Li Shaonan knew all of that was fake. What she had done was the complete opposite of gentle.Such a scheming woman was exactly what he hated most.\u201cJiang family, Jiang Nian?\u201d Li Shaonan put down his cell phone and snorted. \u201cResearch her for me.\u201dShe should have some relation to the Jiang family.The assistant complied and left the office. After only an hour, he returned.\u201cMr. Li, Jiang Nian really isn\u2019t simple.\u201d The assistant delivered several pages of information to Li Shaonan and said, \u201cShe\u2019s the young miss of the Jiang family.\u201d\u201cThe young miss of the Jiang family?\u201d Li Shaonan looked up; a hint of dark light flashed in his eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Jiang family propagandize her before?\u201d\u201cIt is said that the Jiang family didn\u2019t agree with her entering showbiz and even shunned her. But they finally agreed, only didn\u2019t provide any help.\u201d The assistant shared what he knew with Li Shaonan.So Jiang Nian had succeeded only because of her own hard work and contribution.Of course, there might be somebody who knew Jiang Nian\u2019s real identity and provided her help. But they didn\u2019t say that openly.Li Shaonan put down his pen and read several pages of the information. \u201cThe Jiang family\u2026\u201dLi Shaonan looked at the smiling woman in the online article and suddenly closed it, snorting. Do you think you have nothing to worry about with the protection of the Jiang family?Naive!In this industry, I have the final say.\u2026Aileen\u2019s expression was surprised and confused at this time. How had Jiang Nian changed her identity in one night?And this new identity was powerful.Aileen knew that Jiang Nian\u2019s background was a little powerful, but she didn\u2019t realize exactly how powerful. So when Jiang Nian was involved in romantic rumors before, she really wasn\u2019t very worried.The Jiang family was as powerful as the Li family. With the exception of showbiz, the Jiang family played an important role in many fields. If it wasn\u2019t for showbiz, the Jiang family would already have exceeded the Li family.Who could ever have thought that she was the young miss of the Jiang family?Ming Shu ate candied fruit and threw a document at Aileen. \u201cSister Aileen, look at this contract. Do you have any interest in working for Starlight Entertainment?\u201d\u201cYou want me to hop jobs?\u201d Aileen stopped thinking other things and looked at Ming Shu.With a smile, Ming Shu explained, \u201cSister Aileen, there is a saying: \u2018A wise bird chooses the tree it will nest on, and a wise vassal chooses the lord he will serve.\u2019 This is not job-hopping but choosing a better future for yourself.\u201dAileen remained silent. The Jiang family was powerful and had lots of money. Even though Jiang Nian failed this time, she wouldn\u2019t lose out too much.Jiang Nian could leave whenever she wanted, but Aileen couldn\u2019t.But just as Jiang Nian said, Aileen didn\u2019t have much of a chance for promotion in the company she was working at now. If she didn\u2019t choose a better way for herself, she would continue like this.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Aileen looked at Jiang Nian, who she had worked with for so many years, brow furrowing, and said, \u201cJiang Nian, let\u2019s be honest today. Are you going to oppose Li Shaonan?\u201dLi Shaonan just took away her role. After that, she took charge of the Jiang family\u2019s new entertainment company. Her reasoning couldn\u2019t be more obvious.\u201cDo you dare to stick with me?\u201d Ming Shu winked at Aileen.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Aileen put her hand on her forehead. This was no small matter. She couldn\u2019t make a decision all at once.Ming Shu shrugged and smiled. \u201cStarlight Entertainment will welcome Sister Aileen at any time.\u201d\u2026Their new boss was about to arrive, so Starlight Entertainment would hold a welcoming party. With Master Jiang\u2019s acquiescence, this party was handled by Jiang Xun. The guests included both those working in showbiz and in other fields.On such an occasion, no matter whether there was enmity between the host and their guests, according to tradition, the host should invite all the appropriate people. Li Shaonan therefore attended with Ning Keqing.Ning Keqing was popular recently. It seemed Li Shaonan didn\u2019t hide their relationship and took her out in public more and more often.As soon as they appeared, they immediately became the center of attention.\u201cMr. Li, is Miss Ning Keqing your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cMr. Li, what\u2019s the relationship between you and Miss Ning? You came here with her, are you going to admit your relationship in public?\u201d\u201cMr. Li, can you tell us how you know each other?\u201dLi Shaonan protected Ning Keqing, squeezed past those journalists who fired questions constantly, and came into the hall.Ning Keqing still wore a white dress, pure and lovely. She held Li Shaonan with a slightly red face; it was hard to tell whether she was hot or shy.She looked around the hall and said, \u201cI never thought that Sister Jiang Nian was the young miss of the Jiang family. No wonder she\u2019s so successful.\u201dIn her last life, she still didn\u2019t know it by the time she died.Li Shaona sneered. \u201cShe bullies you in such a way and you still speak up for her?\u201dNing Keqing opened her small, cherry-like mouth and said, \u201cNo\u2026 Actually Sister Jiang Nian never did anything. I don\u2019t blame her.\u201dShe knew Li Shaonan would became angrier because of her words.He could only vent his rage on Jiang Nian.Jiang Nian, it\u2019s you who offended me first, so don\u2019t blame me for doing this.The domineering boss scoffed. \u201cI won\u2019t let others bully you randomly.\u201d\u201cWell, I just like to bully her,\u201d a clear, smiling voice said from off to the side.A beautifully dressed woman detached herself from the crowd. She wore a fiery red dress which enhanced her good looks and resembled a blossoming rose.Li Shaonan narrowed his eyes slightly and lowered his voice. \u201cJiang Nian, do you think that I can\u2019t deal with you when you have the support of the Jiang family?\u201d\u201cHow can you deal with me? By hitting me?\u201d Ming Shu stopped and asked with a smile.Although she smiled gently, everyone could see her arrogance. She didn\u2019t even need to show off her arrogance, it radiated from inside her.Li Shaonan became extremely furious. It had been a long time since anyone dared to contradict him.But he was not young anymore and quickly suppressed his rage. \u201cWell, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201dMing Shu glanced at Ning Keqing and smiled gently at her. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.\u201dFor no reason, Ning Keqing suddenly felt cold and dared not look into Ming Shu\u2019s eyes. She glanced away, clutching her dress tightly, and moved closer to Li Shaonan.Li Shaonan almost dragged Ning Keqing away. Ming Shu stood there, watching them disappear into the crowd. She only stopped watching them when someone came to speak with her.Note: \u201cA wise bird chooses the tree it will nest on, and a wise vassal chooses the lord he will serve.\u201d\u2014Romance of the Three KingdomsLiked it?

He walked toward her, coughed with a hand over his mouth, and reminded her in a low voice, \u201cNiannian, behave yourself.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d Ming Shu answered in an unclear voice.\u201cYou ate so much this morning, you\u2019re still hungry now?\u201d Jiang Xun was confused. He remembered her eating a lot before. Was her stomach a bottomless pit?In the past, when she was still at home, he had never seen this.As a star, wasn\u2019t she afraid of becoming fat?Ming Shu ate the last piece of dessert on her plate. She shook the empty plate and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not me. I\u2019m just hungry. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dI can\u2019t even eat in peace.\u201c\u2026\u201dJiang Xun glanced behind him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to give a public speech. Don\u2019t eat too much in case you get fat.\u201dMing Shu continued to smile. \u201cAnyhow, it\u2019s not you who are going to be fat.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d He was deluded to think she had changed. She just quarreled with him in another way.The temperature around Jiang Xun dropped a little and his face became sour.Ming Shu stepped back. Is he going to be bad?How about I fight him first?Ming Shu was considering the feasibility of that when Jiang Xun left. From head to toe, all of him let strangers know not to come close and acquaintances not to bother him. Where he passed, the crowd couldn\u2019t help but make way for him.Ming Shu used the empty plate as a fan. What\u2019s wrong with him?Let him go. I\u2019m hungry.\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s welcome Miss Jiang to speak. Journalists can ask questions afterward, but please be quiet and wait for now.\u201d The host\u2019s voice was sweet and, as she spoke, the light focused on Ming Shu.Ming Shu hid the plate behind her back at once. She stepped aside to put it on the table behind her. After that, she walked to the stage with a smile on her face.Jiang Xun had told her what to say. She just needed to recite it.After the speech, it was time for the journalists to ask questions.Ming Shu pointed at somebody randomly.\u201cMiss Jiang, there was a rumor about you and Mr. Zhou. Is he your boyfriend?\u201d\u201cMr. Zhou?\u201d Who? Do I know him? The Host had been gossiped about with so many people and some of them even had the same first name. How could she know who Mr. Zhou was. \u201cNext question.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The journalist was astonished. \u201cMiss Jiang, could you answer my question?\u201d\u201cIs there any rule that forces me to answer your question?\u201d I just don\u2019t want to answer. What can you do to me? \u201cAnyway, I have been gossiped about with many people, how can I remember who Mr. Zhou is. Can you ask a relevant question?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The journalist was silent. Are you proud of being gossiped about with so many people?Was this question not relevant? Does she doubt my professional ability?The next journalist took the opportunity to ask a relevant question. \u201cMiss Jiang, what\u2019s the grievance between you and Miss Ning?\u201dMing Shu smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201dThe journalists immediately became excited. They all stared single-mindedly at Ming Shu in case they missed anything.\u201cIn short\u2014I don\u2019t like her.\u201dYou\u2019re done?It\u2019s over?How is it a long story?Where\u2019s this long story?\u201cWhat do you want to hear? A tale of enmity and romantic rivalry? I can make one up for you.\u201d Is the reason I don\u2019t like her powerful and sincere?That was the beginning and end of many arguments. Those four words, enmity and romantic rivalry, were great. What else could they want?\u201c\u2026\u201d#The big shot is quite different today. Is it just my impression?#The journalists became suddenly nervous, though they didn\u2019t know what they were nervous about.\u201cMiss Jiang, The Ever-Burning Light film crew canceled your role. What do you have to say about that? Is it because of the strife between you and Mr. Li? Does it mean Starlight Entertainment is going to compete with Jinyu Entertainment?Li Shaonan was the boss of Jinyu Entertainment.It was the biggest entertainment company in showbiz. Many Best Actor and Actress award winners came from there.Ming Shu smiled and answered, \u201cYes.\u201dThe journalists thought Ming Shu would reply with something unrelated. But she suddenly answered yes, admitting it outright.You admitted it so easily!They were extremely excited and continued asking: \u201cMiss Jiang, what\u2019s the reason? Personal animosity, or does Starlight Entertainment want to develop in showbiz?\u201dWhat was Jinyu Entertainment?It was the leader in showbiz. Now somebody wanted to compete with it. It was big news!These two questions appeared completely innocuous, but there was a trap within. If Ming Shu answered that Starlight Entertainment wanted to develop in showbiz, she would be representing the Jiang family, not herself.And if her answer was personal, those journalists would report that she didn\u2019t care to look after the family\u2019s interests as a whole.\u201cIf you want to know the reason, you can ask Li Shaonan. I believe his answer would be better than mine. Next.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d So are you too lazy to give us an explanation? the journalists thought.\u201cDoes Miss Jiang believe that Starlight Entertainment could compete with Jinyu Entertainment under your leadership?\u201d This journalist was indomitable and continued to press.Ming Shu remained unflappable and answered their artful questions. The journalists asked artful questions and her answers were artful too. She even entertained herself sometimes.Soon, the journalists were unable to bear looking at Ming Shu any longer. They felt pained by her answers.Ming Shu jumped from the stage and walked through the crowd to the lounge. When she was answering questions just now, she saw Ning Keqing go backstage and not come out.Jiang Xun wasn\u2019t here either. One of her tasks was preventing Jiang Xun from falling in love with Ning Keqing. She had to go there to get Hatred Points.Ming Shu ate the apple she picked up and tied a knot in her overlong dress, her gaze searching around.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d The delicate voice came from around the corner. It was Ning Keqing\u2019s voice.Ming Shu stopped, her eyes shining\u2014 I found you.Ning Keqing, I\u2019m coming.Ming Shu walked in the direction of the voice. She turned the corner and saw that Ning Keqing, in her white dress, was fumbling on Jiang Xun and Jiang Xun was trying to stop her, his face gloomy.Crunch . Ming Shu bit into the apple, the sound surprising them. The two looked at her at the same time. Ning Keqing panicked for a second and then quickly stepped back. Jiang Xun took off his suit, threw it aside, and walked toward Ming Shu.Ming Shu smiled and said, \u201cAh, Miss Ning, are you going to find another Money Boss? Your Li Shaonan would be so sad.\u201d\u201cNiannian, just now\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun wanted to explain.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, I have nothing to do with Mr. Jiang,\u201d Ning Keqing, with an aggrieved expression, interrupted Jiang Xun and explained. \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand.\u201dLiked it?

It just led to more misunderstandings.Ming Shu finished the apple and flung the core away. She clapped her hands and looked at Jiang Xun. \u201cBrother, could you please go out and keep watch for me?\u201dJiang Xun frowned and asked, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cHit her.\u201d Ming Shu pointed at Ning Keqing, who was still pretending to be innocent and pitiful.Ning Keqing widened her eyes, surprised. Was Jiang Nian about to hit her here? And she even asked Jiang Xun to keep watch for her. Was she crazy?\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun was speechless. He swallowed words about doing it for her and said, \u201cBe careful.\u201dMing Shu smiled.Jiang Xun glanced at Ning Keqing and turned to leave, his footstep gradually disappearing.Ming Shu touched her chin. Jiang Xun\u2026 Maybe he liked the Host. But the Host didn\u2019t know and even trampled on his love again and again.And now Jiang Xun just met Ning Keqing when Ming Shu came to this world. So it was unlikely that Jiang Xun would fall in love with Ning Keqing.Ah, it wasn\u2019t technically sound to obtain Hatred Points this way.\u201cJiang Nian, what do you want to do?\u201d Ning Keqing leaned against the wall, her mask fading. There was anger and hatred in her gaze.She really couldn\u2019t remember when and where she offended Jiang Nian.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s smile became a little obscene, her eyes shining. \u201cI just want to reason with Miss Ning. After all, I\u2019m a reasonable woman.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d If Ming Shu really want to reason with her, why did she ask Jiang Xun to keep watch? Was she lying? She just said she was about to hit Ning Keqing! Did she think Ning Keqing forgot or didn\u2019t hear?\u201cJiang Nian.\u201d Ning Keqing calmed down. She had lived two lives, she couldn\u2019t be frightened by Jiang Nian. \u201cWhen did I offend you?\u201dAt first, when Jiang Nian had only poured juice on Ning Keqing, it could be that she was helping Song Man. But how could she explain what Jiang Nian had done later?There was no reason for it.\u201cMaybe in your last life.\u201d It was quite right. In Ning Keqing\u2019s last life, she bullied the Host severely.Ming Shu answered randomly. But Ning Keqing, who\u2019d kept this secret, was quite frightened. However, when she thought about it, she found that she didn\u2019t have any relations with Jiang Nian in her last life, so she must not have offended her back then.\u201cJiang Nian, shouldn\u2019t you give me a reason as to why you did all this to me?\u201dMing Shu felt confused. \u201cEh, why are you pretending to be a white lotus?\u201dBecause Li Shaonan and Jiang Xun were not here, Ning Keqing was unwilling to act. It was not professional. What if passersby saw her real self!\u201c\u2026\u201dMing Shu, with a smile on her face, walked toward Ning Keqing, step after step. Ning Keqing couldn\u2019t back away anymore and sweat appeared on her forehead. She hadn\u2019t learned Kong Fu, but she knew that Jiang Nian had.Ning Keqing threatened her with words. \u201cJiang Nian, the journalists are outside. No matter what you do to me, it\u2019ll be reported tomorrow.\u201dMing Shu caught Ning Keqing\u2019s arm and smiled. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not me who\u2019ll become a laughing stock.\u201dNing Keqing looked at Ming Shu\u2019s smiling face and blanked out.A second passed.Ning Keqing felt a sharp pain.\u2026Ming Shu stepped out, wiping her hands. Jiang Xun leaned against wall outside, an unlit cigarette in his mouth. He was illuminated by the weak wall lamp, which made him appear lonely. Half of his face was in shadow, so his expression couldn\u2019t be seen clearly.He suddenly turned around and looked into Ming Shu\u2019s eyes. Ming Shu\u2019s mouth turned up in a perfect smile.Ming Shu stood at the junction of light and darkness. Behind her was light, shining with boundless radiance; ahead was an endless darkness.Jiang Xun paused for a moment and removed the cigarette, tossing it into a garbage can. He straightened up and asked, \u201cFinished?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Ming Shu walked into the shadows as if abandoning the shining light at her back.Light flashed in Jiang Xun\u2019s eyes for a second. He suddenly reached out and caught Ming Shu, who was passing by him, and pushed her against the wall.They were so close to each other, Ming Shu could even hear the sound of Jiang Xun\u2019s heartbeat, rapid and powerful.Ming Shu didn\u2019t resist. She looked at him and smiled wider. \u201cBrother, what are you trying to do?\u201dBecause she called him brother, Jiang Xun sobered up quickly. He lowered his head as if to hide something and released Ming Shu. He answered in a hoarse voice, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dMing Shu righted herself and untied the knot on her dress, swaggering forward.Jiang Xun really liked the Host.It was a pity.The Host would never know.Ah\u2026 Lovers become brother and sister in the end.[Guest, you could try to attract Jiang Xun.] the Harmony System suggested.\u201cWhy?\u201d[When he falls in love with you, you dump him. You could get Hatred Points this way.]Let people like you, then get rid of them. Was she such an evil woman?Harmony System, are you really harmonious?You shouldn\u2019t give such suggestions.You\u2019re so shameless![Guest, don\u2019t forget your task is to get Hatred Points. You should only regard these people as characters in a game. Besides, you are worse than now when you want to be bad.]Ming Shu smiled. \u201cI regard that as high praise.\u201d[\u2026]\u201cI refuse.\u201d[Why?]\u201cAre you blind? Don\u2019t you see Jiang Xun clearly? He must be smarter and stronger than me. I\u2019m afraid I couldn\u2019t get rid of him and have to kill him.\u201d I don\u2019t want to be in trouble.[If you do that, you will obtain more Hatred Points.]\u201c\u2026\u201d In the fiction that she read recently, the system was good and kind; its aim was to rescue others. However, why did her system encourage her to be an evil woman and even kill people?Maybe it was a fake system. \u201cWell, why must you ruin everything?\u201d[Our task is to obtain Hatred Points.]That meant they needed Hatred Points only and needn\u2019t care for others\u2019 lives.You are so powerful, why don\u2019t you destroy the world directly?!\u201cHmph!\u201dMing Shu ignored the Harmony System. She believed the system needed to learn graciousness, kindness, and beauty. What would she do if she was encouraged to do bad things all day in the future. After all, she couldn\u2019t restrain herself.Jiang Xun followed her, not too far or too close. She could feel his stare from time to time as if she was being watched by a poisoned snake: simply horrible.Does Jiang Xun want to scare me to death in order to inherit my snacks?So in order to protect my snacks, I only have to do bad things when necessary.\u201cJiang Nian!\u201dThis shout almost startled Ming Shu into dropping her smile.A tall man walked toward her, radiating a strong sense of oppression. No need to guess. It must be Li Shaonan wanting to scare her to death to inherit her snacks.Why do I always run into him?Guards, protect my snacks!\u201cWhere is Keqing?\u201d Li Shaonan stopped before Ming Shu. Being tall, he looked down at Ming Shu disdainfully. There was fire in his eyes, as if he was going to tear her to pieces.\u201cMr. Li.\u201d Jiang Xun put his arm around Ming Shu\u2019s shoulder and pulled her against his chest. He looked at Li Shaonan. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring my sister.\u201dMing Shu quietly slipped out of Jiang Xun\u2019s hug. She glanced around and found there was a row of chairs in the corridor. She headed straight for them and climbed onto one, instantaneously becoming much taller than Li Shaonan. With a smile on her face, she replied, \u201cMr. Li, if you lose your canary, you can go to the zoo to look for it. Why did you ask me? I\u2019m not the zookeeper.\u201dAre you just tall?I am even afraid of myself when I\u2019m tall.\u201c\u2026\u201d Is she crazy? Li Shaonan thought.\u201c\u2026\u201d My sister is quite strange , Jiang Xun thought.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But when he heard a scream from behind him, he became extremely angry. His gaze seemed to be a knife pointing at Ming Shu.Ming Shu still smiled. Do you think I\u2019m afraid of you? Nope!Li Shaonan had controlled himself well for many years. But now he had run out of self-restraint and wanted to tear up Ming Shu\u2019s smiling face. However, the voice coming from backstage stopped him and he went over quickly.Ming Shu jumped down from the chair. Jiang Xun subconsciously stretched his hand out to hold her, but Ming Shu moved her body and avoided his help.Jiang Xun liked the Host. But Ming Shu was not the Host, so it was better to avoid any misunderstandings.Love\u2026It\u2019s so complicated!I\u2019d be better off loving only my snacks.Jiang Xun\u2019s gaze darkened and he took back his hand, saying, \u201cWhy did you infuriate Li Shaonan?\u201cI hit his sweetheart. What\u2019s the matter with that?\u201d How can I get Hatred Points without infuriating him?Jiang Xun didn\u2019t know what Ming Shu hitting somebody meant. He thought it might just mean a slap or something like that between girls and there was no need to worry.But Jiang Xun soon realized he was wrong. He was totally wrong.This was not a small tussle!Ning Keqing\u2019s whole body was black and blue except for her face. Just because of this, the issue was ambiguous when she was photographed by journalists.The news headlines seemed to imply something. With the picture, the newspaper was the scene of the crime.Because Ning Keqing came out with Li Shaonan, the Money Boss, Li Shaonan, was also reported in the news. Journalists were very different and strange. They could turn nothing into something. It seemed those journalists had seen what happened between Li Shaonan and Ning Kqing for them to write such articles.Ning Keqing was involved in many negative news reports. Even though she was protected by Li Shaonan, she was still scolded by others.They all censured Ning Keqing. They said she was shameless and did such things at other people\u2019s parties.But Li Shaonan was not scolded as much.There was a strange thing in this world. If there was a matter between a man and a woman, the woman must be scolded seriously.And most of the people who scolded others were women.Li Shaonan had never been involved in such gossip. He was very frustrated and those surrounding him were frightened and cautious.\u201cMr. Li, I\u2019m sorry. Some of the journalists and media are from Starlight Entertainment. We can\u2019t suppress the reports,\u201d the assistant said cautiously.Mr. Li is so scary right now.\u201cJiang Nian!\u201d Li Shaonan held his pen so tightly that his fingertips became white. There was much anger in his eyes. \u201cTell them that anybody who provides her with work is against Jinyu Entertainment.\u201d\u201cMr. Li, we could ban her, but Starlight Entertainment would support\u2026\u201dMr. Li looked at him sharply. The assistant swallowed and bowed to indicate agreement, fleeing from the office quickly.Mr. Li threw away the pen. The root of the Jiang Family was not in showbiz, so it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to suppress Starlight Entertainment.Jiang Nian, I will see how long you\u2019ll remain arrogant.Li Shaonan told others to blacklist Ming Shu. After work, he returned to his silent villa. He switched on the lights and found that everything was a mess. He frowned and looked around, but saw nobody. He went upstairs.Upstairs in the main bedroom, he found Ning Keqing, hair disheveled and appearance sloppy. Her eyes were red because of crying. In rumpled clothes, she sat on the floor, a computer in front of her.Li Shaonan walked forward and turned off the computer. Ning Keqing looked at him with bloodshot eyes. Tears immediately began to fall. \u201cMr. Li\u2026\u201dHer voice was full of grievance and stubbornness, which made Li Shaonan distressed. He walked toward her and hugged her, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cMr. Li, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Ning Keqing clutched Li Shaonan\u2019s clothes and cried quietly. \u201cBecause of me, they scolded you too. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dLi Shaonan felt uncomfortable because of Ning Keqing\u2019s crying. He tried to comfort her, but whatever he said, she still apologized all the time as if she didn\u2019t hear anything.Li Shaonan had to kiss Ning Keqing to stop her apologies in the end.Things got out of control. Ning Keqing pretended to refuse, but they soon had sex.It was funny. In her last life, Ning Keqing had stayed with Li Shaonan for a long time, but Li Shaonan only kissed her at most. Even when she made him extremely angry, he still just fondled her and never slept with her.Tonight, some people didn\u2019t sleep. Others slept very well.Such as Ming Shu.Aileen was still Ming Shu\u2019s agent now. Since others called her to tell her they wanted to terminate their contracts or replace Ming Shu\u2019s roles, she began to call Ming Shu constantly. At first she could get through, but after a while she found that Ming Shu had turned off her cell phone.Before Ming Shu\u2019s cell phone powered off, a message was sent to Aileen.I\u2019m going to rest. If there\u2019s anything, tell me tomorrow.Where is my knife? Aileen thought.If she didn\u2019t know that Ming Shu lived with the Jiang family, Aileen would go to see her, shake her, and ask what she had done to make Li Shaonan decide to blacklist her.Although, just what she had done before was enough to warrant a ban from Li Shaonan.\u2026The next day, the headline news was not Ning Keqing. Now it was about Ming Shu getting banned, which was obvious in every newspaper.Ming Shu held the newspaper and sighed. Why were things so difficult that the female protagonist even made headlines?\u201cNiannian, what happened?\u201d Mother Jiang pointed at the newspaper agitatedly. \u201cIs it Li Shaonan? Does he still care about our Jiang family?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d He only cared about Ning Keqing and the high-ranking people in the world. He wouldn\u2019t care about the Jiang family, which was only a stepping stone.Mother Jiang patted the newspaper and looked at Jiang Xun, who was about to go out. \u201d Xun\u2019er, you just stand by when you sister is bullied?\u201cMom, Niannian told me she could handle it.\u201d Jiang Xun kept his head down and voice low. He had asked Ming Shu last night, but Ming Shu told him she could handle it fine on her own.\u201cJust because she said no, you won\u2019t help her?\u201d Mother Jiang said, \u201cNo wonder you still don\u2019t have a lover. I\u2019m telling you, you must handle this. Our Niannian can\u2019t be bullied by others.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Does this have anything to do with lovers?Besides, Mom, who is it that disagreed with Niannian working in showbiz before?\u201cBefore your dad comes back, this matter must be solved.\u201d When he came back, he might argue with Niannian again. Niannian seldom returned home, she couldn\u2019t leave because of her dad. Thinking that, Mother Jiang was extremely worried and smacked the table, saying loudly, \u201cXun\u2019er, do you understand!\u201dJiang Xun was speechless, but he didn\u2019t show it on his face. He nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Ming Shu said lowly.\u201cDon\u2019t say that you don\u2019t need help. We\u2019re a family. You brother is here, Li Shaonan can\u2019t do anything he wants. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dMing Shu smiled and lifted her empty bowl. \u201cMom, can I eat one more bowl of porridge?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLiked it?

Still less than one hundred.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLess than one hundred!Less than!Aileen wanted to kill somebody. She shouted at the phone so loudly her voice could be heard off speaker.Jiang Xun looked at his sister, her arm against the window and her legs crossed. Her slit skirt exposed her beautiful white leg.Jiang Xun looked away and leaned over.A strange but familiar smell came to Ming Shu. Holding a bottle of milk, she moved back and stared at Jiang Xun.What are you doing? Robbing my milk?Jiang Xun smiled suddenly. But maybe because he didn\u2019t want Ming Shu to see it, he quickly stopped. He helped her fasten her seat belt. \u201cSeat belt.\u201dMing Shu looked at the side of Jiang Xun\u2019s face.When Jiang Xun sat back, Ming Shu quickly finished her milk. Meanwhile, the more Jiang Xun looked at Ming Shu, the more lovely he thought she was.\u201cJiang Nian, are you listening to me?\u201d Aileen shouted for some time and found that Jiang Nian said nothing. She had to continue shouting.\u201cI listened.\u201d Ming Shu put the phone close to her ear and said, \u201cJust terminate the contracts. Tell them to compensate me. I\u2019ve heard that my work for the year after next has been arranged already. Such a large sum of money, we should get all of it.\u201dI can buy lots of food.\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Aileen was in a fury. \u201cIf those contracts are terminated, do you know what else you can do in showbiz?\u201d\u201cSister Aileen, I don\u2019t want to act anymore. I can get such a huge amount of cash before I quit acting. Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d I am a woman with a dream.\u201cWhat?\u201d Aileen shouted. Then a sudden sound came out of the phone, such that nobody knew what happened to Aileen. After a while, Aileen returned to the call. \u201cAre you a fool? You\u2019re at your peak right now, do you really want to quit? You are the young miss of the Jiang family. Li Shaonan is powerful in showbiz, but your Jiang family is powerful too. Jiang Nian, don\u2019t ruin your future.\u201dThe more Aileen spoke, the lower her voice became. She really wanted Jiang Nian to go far in showbiz.\u201cSister Aileen, I\u2019m tired,\u201d Ming Shu said in a low, exhausted voice.But\u2014\u201cJiang Nian, what are you eating!\u201d\u2026\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to act?\u201d Jiang Xun paused for a second before continuing. \u201cIf you want to act, I can help you.\u201dMing Shu turned her head to look at Jiang Xun. \u201cBro, I decided to compete with you for the family assets.\u201dShe could buy lots of things if she got the family assets!Jiang Xun\u2019s didn\u2019t look fazed at all. \u201cThe Jiang family is yours. I\u2019m just protecting it for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBoring. It was not interesting if she competed with only herself.When she got out of the car, Ming Shu said, \u201cBrother, don\u2019t be alone anymore.\u201dPlease don\u2019t love me anymore!I won\u2019t belong to you!My snacks will be unhappy!Jiang Xun saw that she was surrounded by journalists. But with a smile on her face, she said something that made those journalists unwilling to ask questions. In the end, she entered Starlight Entertainment like a queen.Jiang Xun held the steering wheel tightly. A gloomy atmosphere spread in the car.How could she put him in her eyes?Jiang Xun covered his face for a while. Because they were brother and sister, she would never regard him as a man.He hated his identity as the young master of the Jiang family.But he still didn\u2019t want to abandon this identity. If he were not the young master of the Jiang family, he wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to accompany her.\u2026Even though Aileen couldn\u2019t accept it, Ming Shu decided she wouldn\u2019t continue acting.She didn\u2019t want to do it. How could Aileen force her?Aileen was extremely angry, so when those people came to terminate their contracts, she asked for a large sum of money as reparations. Some of them bargained with her, but Aileen directly showed them the contracts.She just did things according to the terms. If they didn\u2019t want to give her money, they must uphold the contract. If they wanted to terminate the contract but didn\u2019t want to pay reparations, Aileen would prosecute them.It was not Aileen and Ming Shu who wanted to terminate, it was them. They were unreasonable, so they had to pay up.Compared to losing money, they were more afraid of Li Shaonan.Why were they not afraid of the Jiang family? Maybe because a difference in profession makes one feel worlds apart. If the Jiang family wanted to develop in showbiz, they needed help from others in showbiz. Between offending Li Shaonan and offending the Jiang family, they knew which to choose.Most of the contracts had been canceled. Ming Shu held a press conference and announced that she was about to quit acting.She was just quitting acting, not leaving the industry altogether.In the press conference, Ming Shu was asked whether she was afraid of Li Shaonan.\u201cAfraid? I don\u2019t know the definition of the word!\u201d Ming Shu answered with a smile. Her voice was gentle, but others heard arrogance in it. \u201cIn this industry, it\u2019s uncertain who will have the final say in the future. Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201dI\u2019m a little hungry. When will this finish? These journalists ask questions constantly.Another journalist asked, \u201cSo, Miss Jiang, why do you want to quit acting? With help from Starlight Entertainment, you could still go on acting.\u201dMing Shu smiled energetically, eyes shining. \u201cIn life, one should be brave enough to pursue one\u2019s own dream.\u201dI feel hungrier.I want to pursue my dream.\u201c\u2026\u201dWasn\u2019t a star\u2019s dream to be hot and popular? What else did she want? To fly?Maybe Ming Shu\u2019s dream was eating.Acting affected her eating, so she quit acting.Li Shaonan\u2019s decision didn\u2019t make Ming Shu angry, it actually helped her greatly. She worried about how to terminate her contracts. Now she needn\u2019t cancel them herself and was even paid reparations.Well, Li Shaonan\u2019s decision didn\u2019t harm Ming Shu at all. She didn\u2019t care whether she could act or not. And because of this matter, she made lots of money\u2026Now she also was the boss of Starlight Entertainment\u2026It was maybe the funniest joke of the year.Someone guessed that Li Shaonan was about to compete against Starlight Entertainment.Actually, Starlight Entertainment was not as powerful as Jinyu Entertainment. That was the weakness of Starlight Entertainment.But Ming Shu didn\u2019t seem worried about that. She showed up in different kinds of\u2026 hotels, restaurants, and snack shops.Ming Shu resolved everything before Jiang Xun had to provide her with help. Additionally, Father Jiang was extremely happy when he heard Ming Shu quit acting. As long as she quit acting, Father Jiang didn\u2019t care what she did with the company.\u201c\u2026\u201d One can do her own will with money , Ming Shu thought.#Former superstar visited various snack shops instead of operating company after she quit acting. Is she going to change professions?#The news divulged almost everything of Ming Shu\u2019s activity after she quit acting.She arrived at the company at nine in the morning and finished work at twelve. And her lunch destination changed everyday.Then she returned at one in the afternoon and get off work at six.Her working hours were the same as ordinary employers. Was she really a boss?Following were some secretly taken photographs. In every picture, although Ming Shu was eating, she was still extremely beautiful. She was smiling and polite all the time. She looked gorgeous from every angle even while eating.Because of this, Ming Shu was supported by lots of foodie fans.#Can a foodie still be beautiful? Is my way of eating wrong?

Then she began to read documents, pretending to be busy.The assistant who entered was speechless. Do you think I didn\u2019t see youeating just now? It\u2019s useless to hide your food. And please pay more attention when you want to hide something?She already knew her new boss was quite different from other bosses.\u201cEh\u2026 Miss Jiang, Jinyu Entertainment signed a contract with that screenwriter before we could.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Ming Shu looked up and signed her name on a document.Maybe because she was used to writing Ming Shu, she signed Ming Shu just now. She crumpled that paper and threw it away. Then she looked at her assistant with a smile on face. \u201cCan you print one more for me?\u201dThe assistant looked at the ceiling, speechless, and said, \u201cMiss Jiang, we have discussed that show for months. The company also thinks it\u2019s good and will become popular. But now Jinyu Entertainment signed the contract with the screenwriter before us\u2026\u201dMing Shu complained in her heart.Why isn\u2019t she finished?When will she be finished?Please finish already?My pudding awaits me!Ming Shu rummaged on her desk to find the phone, buried in documents. She called, \u201cTian Yuan, come in.\u201dTian Yuan, with a confused expression, came in. She bought pudding just now. Did Ming Shu already eat it?When Tian Yuan entered, she found that assistant was there too. Tian Yuan was an assistant too in the past, but now\u2026He he.She get the salary of an assistant, but did the job of a deliveryman.\u201cSister Jiang Nian?\u201d\u201cDid you finish what I told you to do?\u201d\u201cEn\u2026 Yes, I finished.\u201d It is not buying food for you.\u201cGive it to her.\u201d Ming Shu pointed at the other assistant.\u201cOh.\u201dTian Yuan ran out and took several documents to the assistant.Ding . The floor\u2019s clock sounded.\u201cIt\u2019s time to leave.\u201d Ming Shu stood up, picked up her bag, and left. She still didn\u2019t forget to take her leftover pudding.\u201c\u2026\u201d The assistant who held the documents saw her boss leaving the office quickly.She hadn\u2019t finished. Come back, boss!Why does food attract you so much? Get back to work!\u2026Jinyu Entertainment battled with Starlight Entertainment for resources. Whatever Starlight Entertainment wanted, Jinyu would battle for it. And every time Starlight Entertainment failed.But Starlight Entertainment didn\u2019t get scared by that. It was supported by the Jiang family, which was extremely rich, so it still struggled against Jinyu Entertainment.In showbiz, some didn\u2019t join in and just watched; others began to warm up to Jinyu Entertainment.Many people also chose to leave Starlight Entertainment. But Ming Shu\u2019s ability showed through. No matter how big the problem was, she could still solve it. The premise was that nothing could affect her eating.She was in the terminal stage of eating cancer. She couldn\u2019t be cured.\u201cI think that Starlight Entertainment is in danger. She said she had the confidence to battle with Jinyu Entertainment at her press conference. How about now? Starlight Entertainment has accomplished nothing and is greatly suppressed by Jinyu Entertainment.\u201d A man shook his head and turned his nose up at Ming Shu.\u201cWhen Mr. Li started working, she was a baby. Ah, nowadays these young people always make confident declarations but seldom carry through. In the future, she will lose face for the Jiang family,\u201d another man agreed.\u201cA girl in charge of Starlight Entertainment, the company must go bankrupt sooner or later. What does the Jiang family think? They shouldn\u2019t allow a girl to manage a company.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t we do our own will with money?\u201d a girl said suddenly. Her voice was as gentle as the breeze that blew into their hearts.Those who were discussing heatedly looked at where the voice came from. A thin, tall woman in a purple dress stood there. The dress, with a cinched waist, showed off her wonderful figure.She stood beneath the light and looked at them with a smile. \u201cWhen speaking ill of others behind their backs, be careful that your tongues not get cut off in hell.\u201dThey were all astonished and trembled.\u201cWe just tell the truth.\u201d One returned to himself quickly and snorted scornfully. \u201cIf Miss Jiang doesn\u2019t have the ability, don\u2019t accept the task of making china.\u201dMing Shu pushed a strand of hair behind her ear, answering with a smile, \u201cOf course I won\u2019t accept the task of making china. After all, that\u2019s not my family\u2019s business. But I think you, a rich boss, could try to make china. Maybe you\u2019ll earn lots of money from that. Money comes from taking risks, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThey didn\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t understand what they said. She was just mocking them!She even mocked them with a smile on her face.It made them angry, but they didn\u2019t know how to counterattack.\u201cMiss Jiang is young and ignorant. Be careful with your words. Showbiz is not as simple as you think,\u201d another man said, his expression dark.\u201cMr. Zhang, what do you want my sister to be careful with?\u201dThe man suddenly looked at the one who just spoke and his expression worsened. The others also kept silent. It was only when the man approached them that they greeted him.\u201cMr. Jiang\u2026\u201d\u201cMr. Jiang.\u201d\u201cMr. Zhang, there is a saying: Disaster is a result of careless talk.\u201d Since when did others have the right to judge his sister?Their judgment shouldn\u2019t be heard by him either.\u201cMr. Jiang.\u201d The man who was talking just now smiled and said, \u201cWe\u2019re just kidding with Miss Jiang. It doesn\u2019t mean anything else.\u201dAlthough Jiang Xun didn\u2019t work in Starlight Entertainment, he managed it in the past, so these men knew him.And outside showbiz, Jiang Xun was not easygoing.But they had heard he didn\u2019t get along well with Miss Jiang\u2026Why was it different from what they heard?Jiang Xun glanced at Mr. Zhang and said, \u201cMr. Zhang is kidding, I won\u2019t forget.\u201dMr. Zhang was silent. What!You won\u2019t forget what?Jiang Xun ignored Mr. Zhang\u2019s confused and worried gaze. He looked at his sister and said, \u201cNiannian, how about I introduce some people to you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m busy. I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d Ming Shu erected her middle finger at Mr. Zhang. Then, with a smile on face, she walked past him. \u201cMr. Zhang, young and ignorant people can always go far. Seeing you now, I guess you\u2019ve never been young and ignorant!\u201dJiang Xun furrowed his brow. \u201cNiannian.\u201dMing Shu quickly melted into the crowd and shook off Jiang Xun.She didn\u2019t want to have any relation with Jiang Xun, especially since Jiang Xun would misunderstand some behaviors.After losing Jiang Xun, Ming Shu found a place to eat.\u201cSister Jiang Nian.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s hand, holding a piece of chocolate, shook. She took a deep breath and put the chocolate in her mouth.She must be full before going after Hatred Points.She turned and looked at the person behind her, smiling. \u201cMiss Ning, with such a dress, you look like a birdman. What are you doing? I didn\u2019t hear about any costume party. Or is it true that Li Shannan regards you as a canary?\u201dWhat Ning Keqing was wearing was the most popular dress this year. Ning Keqing was already beautiful, but became even lovelier with this dress, dazzling many people.But now Ming Shu said she looked like a birdman, making Ning Keqing angry.Ning Keqing suppressed her resentment and said sweetly, \u201cSister Jiang Nian, can I talk to you?\u201dMing Shu pointed at herself. \u201cMe? Alone?\u201dNing Keqing nodded and smiled. \u201cAre you afraid of talking to me?\u201dMing Shu\u2019s lips curled; no one could know the true thoughts behind her smiling eyes.\u201cDo you think you\u2019re a celestial being?\u201dYou want to talk to me, so I must talk to you?Liked it?

According to tradition, if I go with her, either I\u2019ll fall for it or she\u2019ll deal with me. So in the end I\u2019ll get into trouble.So\u2014Why should I go?I won\u2019t go!Ning Keqing was astonished and wondered how to answer.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, I just want to have a talk with you. There\u2019s no other meaning.\u201d Ning Keqing made her voice gentler and looked more innocent.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to you.\u201d Ming Shu smiled. \u201cIf you still show your face in front of me, I\u2019ll hit you!\u201dMaybe because of this sentence, Ning Keqing remembered what had happened before and her expression crumpled. That matter affected her greatly and Li Shaonan had spent much time and money to bury it.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, what are you afraid of?\u201d Ning Keqing didn\u2019t give up. Today, she would let Jiang Nian know that offending her was unforgivable.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I will be more beautiful than you later.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Wasn\u2019t her answer too deliberate?Ning Keqing looked around and saw that nobody cared what was happening here. She stepped forward, hatred flashing in her eyes, and pretended to twist her ankle, pouncing on Ming Shu.Ning Keqing had predicted it all. Ming Shu wore high-heeled shoes and there was a set of steps behind her. As long as she kept steady when she fell against Ming Shu, Ming Shu would tumble down the steps.But reality was totally different from what she had imagined. When she fell, Ming Shu moved aside and walked forward several paces.Now there was nobody in front of Ning Keqing, so she couldn\u2019t keep her balance. Besides that, Ming Shu pushed on her back, so she directly fell down the steps.Although there were only three steps, it was still a serious fall.The people nearby looked at her.Ning Keqing\u2019s knees and elbows were scraped raw and bloody. But the pain was far inferior to her resentment for Ming Shu. Her resentment for Ming Shu was like a vine, twining around her heart and increasing constantly.Because of Ming Shu, she became a laughing stock in public.\u201cAh, Miss Ning, it\u2019s a long time until the New Year. Why are you kneeling down and greeting me?\u201d a woman in the crowd said, smiling. Maybe she was another opponent of Ning Keqing\u2019s.Li Shaonan was not here now, so they mocked her freely. Did she think that she was better than them with the protection of Li Shaonan?The woman\u2019s voice was loud and some burst into laughter, drawing in others.Ning Keqing was on the ground and didn\u2019t dare to raise her head. Why hadn\u2019t Li Shaonan appeared yet?In the past, Li Shaonan would always show up in time. Why didn\u2019t he show up this time?Ning Keqing clenched her fist and finally stood by herself. Her knees were bleeding. She looked up, tears falling, and asked painfully, \u201cSister Jiang Nian, why did you push me?\u201dOthers were surprised and looked at the woman who was standing on the stairs, illuminated by a crystal lamp.Ming Shu smiled. \u201cI just pushed you. There is no reason. Push back if you can.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The answer was outside of Ning Keqing\u2019s expectations.The others were also silent. The domineering Jiang Nian deserved to be a boss.Ming Shu walked down in her high heels. She leaned forward slightly, her hands behind her back, and stared at Ning Keqing. \u201cThey all know we have a bad relationship, but you still appear in front of me. You just want me to push you, is that it?Pushing you is a small punishment.If the weather today was good and suitable for killing, I would kill you now.Ning Keqing glanced at the people around her. Their stares were the same as the stares of those in her past life.Indifference, mockery, and ridicule\u2026They had no right!The resentment in Ning Keqing\u2019s heart grew. All of this was because of Ming Shu. She wouldn\u2019t have experienced this if not for Ming Shu.The faces around her overlapped and some became unclear.Ning Keqing shook and fell back to the ground.\u2026The news that Ning Keqing had an argument with the boss of Starlight Entertainment and fainted was heatedly discussed.The comments varied.Some people thought that Ming Shu took advantage of her power to bully Ning Keqing. She had done that before so she couldn\u2019t be forgiven. This kind of comment came from Ning Keqing\u2019s fans and Ming Shu\u2019s haters.All knew that Ming Shu and Ning Keqing had a bad relationship. But Ning Keqing still stood close to Ming Shu. She did it on purpose. This kind of comment came from Ming Shu\u2019s foodie fans and die-hard fans.Whatever, pushing others was wrong. But no one knew what truly transpired. It was useless to argue. This comment came from sane onlookers.This matter had no effect on Ming Shu. She didn\u2019t act anymore so she was not afraid of these negative comments.Some people even scolded that as a public figure, she didn\u2019t set an example for others but spread negativity instead.Ming Shu directly denounced them:What\u2019s the matter with public figures? Are public figures not allowed to have a little bit of emotion? I work hard as a boss and don\u2019t ask you to pay attention to me. It\u2019s you who made me a public figure and even think to control my life. Are you a celestial being?That was right. She had quit acting and now lived privately, but those paparazzi followed her all the time.She became a public figure because of the paparazzi. Sane people agreed with that.Stars were ordinary people too. They also hated others and had enemies.Now those paparazzi were everywhere, which annoyed many.Many stars had the same feelings as Ming Shu. They gave a thumbs up to Ming Shu\u2019s response.Many stars decided to quit acting and assume a private life. But those paparazzi still followed them and reported news about them sometimes, which forced them into the public eye again.Everybody wanted others only remember their best times.But their hopes were ruined by paparazzi who revealed their changed lives to those fans who loved them in the past.On the Internet, whoever had the more support was the right one, so Ning Keqing was scolded by many people.Although Li Shaonan helped Ning Keqing later, she still couldn\u2019t get rid of her schemer\u2019s label.\u201cWhat were you doing then?\u201d Ning Keqing asked Li Shaonan. If he had shown up earlier that day, those things wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201cI was answering a call outside.\u201d Li Shaonan frowned. \u201cAre you questioning me?\u201dWhen had he ever been questioned like that? Ning Keqing wasn\u2019t allowed to question him either.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ning Keqing immediately started crying and lowered her head as if to hide. \u201cI\u2019m not. I just feel sad.\u201dLi Shaonan was her Money Boss, she couldn\u2019t displease him.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was still kind to her, but she could tell that he was absent-minded.Ning Keqing tried to find out the reason, but she observed him for several days and couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion.At night, after sex, Li Shaonan went to take a shower while Ning Keqing lay in bed. She saw that Li Shaonan\u2019s phone was on the bed. She picked it up.This phone was locked. It was Li Shaonan\u2019s work phone.She remembered that his private phone was unlocked.Ning Keqing was about to put it down, but she suddenly felt strange. It was his private phone.He always gave his work phone to his assistant when he went home, so this one must be his private phone.Ning Keqing picked it up again and tried to unlock it, but it needed a fingerprint or a password.She tried several passwords that Li Shaonan always used, but all were wrong. Ning Keqing didn\u2019t dare to try again and replaced it.She lay in bed, restless, mind occupied with wild fantasies Was Li Shaonan interested in other people?He was so excellent, it was not strange that somebody liked him.She still didn\u2019t know why Li Shaonan chose her even now.Was she going to lose him?At first she only regarded Li Shaonan as a Money Boss who could help her succeed. But Li Shaonan was kind to her, and she had already fallen in love with him.So when Li Shaonan finished shower and came into the room again, she didn\u2019t care about her pride and moved toward him. But Li Shaonan was tired and didn\u2019t respond to her. He hugged her and said, \u201cOkay, go to sleep. I\u2019ll take you to an audition tomorrow.\u201dNing Keqing heard \u201caudition\u201d and thought about it. She did as Li Shaonan wished and stopped teasing.\u2026What Ning Keqing was going to audition for was the same Ethereal Heights that Tian Yuan had mentioned when Ming Shu just came to this world. The auditions were over, but the actress who was going to take the leading female role got into trouble, so the film crew had to choose another actress.Ethereal Heights was a film; its director had been awarded many times. This film aimed at awards too, so the leading female role attracted many people.Ning Keqing remembered that in her past life, the leading role was taken by Jiang Nian, and Jiang Nian became more successful because of this film.She was determined to audition, but many things happened to her so she missed the chance. She regretted that, but now the leading role was to be chosen again.Li Shaonan brought her to the film crew in person, so the film crew gave them face. Ning Keqing auditioned first.The director seemed to be satisfied with her acting skills and image but he wasn\u2019t decided yet. The leading female role was important so he wanted to choose the most suitable person.\u201cMiss Ning, please go back and wait for news.\u201d The staff sent Ning Keqing out.\u201cThank you.\u201d Ning Keqing thought that she must be chosen and felt happy in her heart.However, when she got out, a smile still on her face, she saw Ming Shu walking toward her with Aileen and Tian Yuan.Ming Shu ate out of a bag of puffs as she walked. Tian Yuan\u2019s and Aileen\u2019s faces clearly said they couldn\u2019t bear with her and didn\u2019t want to be anywhere near her.Enemies met with exceptional jealousy. Ning Keqing was ready to fight against Ming Shu and looked at her with alarm.In her last life, the leading female role was acted by Ming Shu. Even though something went wrong, did everything still revert to its original track?No\u2026She must prevent Jiang Nian from acting in this film.\u201cSister Jiang Nian, I remember that you had quit acting,\u201d Ning Shu said when Ming Shu passed by her. \u201cDo you want to come back?\u201dMing Shu ate a puff, surprised. \u201cMiss Ning, why do you care about me so much? Are you in love with me?\u201dNing Keqing was surprised. Do you want face? Who\u2019s fallen love with you? \u201cDon\u2019t be so confident.\u201d\u201cSince Miss Ning is not in love with me, why do you care about me? If you have time to care about me, you\u2019d better care about your own love life. Be careful or something might happen.\u201dAstonished, Ning Keqing asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dMing Shu smiled and said, \u201cGuess.\u201d This kind of reply made others want to hit her.\u201cDid you say something to Li Shaonan?\u201d Ning Keqing stopped Ming Shu, who was about to leave. Li Shaonan was acting very strange recently. Now Ming Shu said this as well. Ning Keqing must be suspicious.\u201cI didn\u2019t talk to him.\u201d Ming Shu smiled slightly. \u201cYour Money Boss is at the top of the pyramid and I haven\u2019t yet reached there. How could I talk to him.\u201d\u201cThen what did you mean?\u201d\u201cI just said that to scare you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ning Keqing\u2019s hand shot up and slapped Ming Shu\u2019s puffs. Her fingers hooked into the bag so that the whole thing fell from Ming Shu\u2019s hand and onto the ground.Tian Yuan\u2019s and Aileen\u2019s faces changed at the same time.The two stepped back.Ming Shu\u2019s smile didn\u2019t change at all. However, the temperature dropped and it suddenly became cold, striking fear in people\u2019s hearts.Ning Keqing was also scared and her back dripped with sweat. Why was her smile so frightening? She thought.Ming Shu caught Ning Keqing\u2019s hand quickly and flung her over her arm! Ning Keqing was thrown onto the floor.Ning Keqing hadn\u2019t thought Ming Shu would hit her and throw her down so fast.\u201cAh!\u201d Ning Keqing cried out in pain. Her internal organs seemed to have changed position because of the overarm throw. Her hand was still in Ming Shu\u2019s clutches, so she could only shout angrily, \u201cJiang Nian, what are you doing?!\u201dShe\u2019d kill Ming Shu!\u201cWasting food is the same as wasting life, do you know that?\u201d Ming Shu still spoke in a gentle tone. If she were not pressed by Ming Shu, Ning Keqing would think that Ming Shu was just talking to her politely.\u201cDo you have the right to waste my life?\u201dMore and more sweat covered Ning Keqing. She said, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dMing Shu looked at her, smiling.Ning Keqing was even more frightened.\u2026Ten minutes later\u2026Ning Keqing, with an unhappy expression, stood at the door of a shop, her hands holding her waist. She looked at Ming Shu who was holding her puffs and walking away. She felt confused.Was she crazy?She hit her and then asked her to compensate for her wasted puffs?Pain struck Ning Keqing and dispelled her strange thoughts. Her resentment stirred again.Ning Keqing decided to forgive Ming Shu\u2019s beating, but the result of the audition surprised her. In the end, she was not chosen and neither was Ming Shu. A newcomer Ming Shu had brought was selected for the role.This director was quite different from others. Even though Li Shaonan was powerful and rich, he still couldn\u2019t change the director\u2019s decision. What the director needed was a suitable actress.Ning Keqing failed and the actress from Ming Shu\u2019s company was chosen. Ning Keqing owed this to Ming Shu. She even wanted to make a doll of Ming Shu and stab it to curse her.And Li Shaonan was quite different recently. Every time she wanted to see him, he either said he was busy or asked an assistant to help her. Now she couldn\u2019t see him for a whole week.Liked it?

She was neither a popular star nor an actress with a great background. She just was a newbie.A newbie that no one had ever seen on the Internet before.Later an Internet user dug up her information. She came from Starlight Entertainment and graduated from a famous communications university. At school, her grades were outstanding and she was pure and beautiful. But her development in showbiz was not good. It seemed that she had offended many people because of her character, so she had never acted in anything after graduation.Ning Keqing totally lost her cool because she failed to win the leading female role in Ethereal Heights . When she was awaiting the results, she thought that if she failed, it was Jiang Nian who would succeed. But in the end she was told that a newbie had gotten the role.A newbie from Starlight Entertainment.Ning Keqing couldn\u2019t accept that.She went directly to Li Shaonan, but he hadn\u2019t been seeing her recently. She didn\u2019t find Li Shaonan at his company, so she went to his apartment to look for him.But she still didn\u2019t find him. He was not in the apartment.Ning Keqing sat at the door to wait. She had to see Li Shaonan today.Ning Keqing waited for half the night and almost fell asleep. When she heard the sound of a car outside, she sobered up at once and stood up to walk out.But she suddenly hid herself after taking two steps.The person getting off the car was not Li Shaonan, but a woman. Li Shaonan seemed to be drunk. The woman held him, walking toward the apartment.Li Shaonan was quite tipsy, but he was still fully aware. He walked very close to the woman and they spoke in low voices. They looked intimate.Li Shaonan\u2026He really fell in love with another woman?Ning Keqing was in a daze and only returned to herself after a while. She rushed out and pushed that woman away, asking, \u201cLi Shaonan, who is she?\u201dThe woman was pushed away suddenly and stepped back, making it so Ning Keqing could see her face clearly. But Ning Keqing sucked in a deep breath.That face\u2026It was similar to hers.But the woman\u2019s temperament and presentation were much better than hers. Everybody would know this with merely a glance.Ning Keqing suddenly remembered there was a room that Li Shaonan didn\u2019t allow her to enter. If she even came near it, Li Shaonan would become extremely angry\u2026A calligraphy book she found in Li Shaonan\u2019s study. Remarks in graceful handwriting on the pages. A tiny signature on paintings\u2026The woman in front of her dusted off her clothes and smiled scornfully. \u201cLi Shaonan, are you keeping a mistress in this love nest? We haven\u2019t seen each other for years, you\u2019ve changed a lot.\u201dThe woman turned back to leave as soon as she finished speaking. Li Shaonan wanted to stop her, but he failed. She walked too quickly.\u201cMr. Li\u2026\u201d Seeing that Li Shaonan wanted to catch up with the woman and didn\u2019t even hesitate, Ning Keqing grabbed him without taking time to think.Because of this, the woman got in the car and started it, soon disappearing.Li Shaonan\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously. He said to Ning Keqing in an indifferent tone, \u201cNing Keqing, who allowed you to come here?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Ning Keqing\u2019s mind was a mess. She wasn\u2019t even clear about what she was doing right now.From the moment she saw that woman, she felt completely unlike herself.She was just like a soulless doll.\u201cWho is she?\u201d Ning Keqing murmured, expression sad.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ask that.\u201d Li Shaonan got free of Ning Keqing, feeling annoyed.\u201cShe\u2026 resembled me. Why can\u2019t I ask?\u201d Ning Keqing was suddenly having an emotional breakdown. Her voice became harsh. \u201cWhat do you regard me as? A substitute?\u201dLi Shaonan was a little drunk and since the woman took off just now, he became more agitated. The following words slipped out thoughtlessly. \u201cSince you know you\u2019re a substitute, you\u2019d better perform your duty as a substitute well. If you dare to show up in front of her, don\u2019t blame me if I forget our good old days.\u201dNing Keqing stepped back, her face contorted.She was a substitute?\u2026Ming Shu noticed that Ning Keqing hadn\u2019t picked on her recently. Then she realized she might have discovered that Li Shaonan had a lover before her.First loves always occupied an important position in one\u2019s heart. Li Shaonan\u2019s first love was his childhood sweetheart. Their parents were satisfied with their relationship too. They had decided to get married after graduation.But things changed quickly. The accident came faster than a tornado.When they were about to graduate, the perfect couple broke up.It wasn\u2019t because one fell in love with another person or because Li Shaonan\u2019s love suffered from an incurable disease and left for his sake. His love wanted to travel abroad and hoped that Li Shaonan would go with her. But Li Shaonan didn\u2019t like foreign countries and wished for his love to stay.They consulted with each other at first, then quarreled, then finally broke up.You like sweet Zongzi but I like salty Zongzi. We have different habits. So how could we be together?Although they broke up, Li Shaonan still loved that woman in his heart and never forgot her.He chose Ning Keqing only because she looked similar to her.In the original plot, this was a sad point. But Li Shaonan would choose Ning Keqing in the end.But now\u2026Maybe the result would change.Because of Ming Shu, Ning Keqing was angry and difficult to keep calm. Besides, her Money Boss had been snatched away by others. She didn\u2019t have the head to deal with Li Shaonan\u2019s first love.So it would be enough after Ming Shu found another chance to get Hatred Points.\u201cNiannian, we should go.\u201d Jiang Xun\u2019s voice came through the door.Ming Shu turned off her phone and left.Today was Jiang Xun\u2019s birthday. As the young master of the Jiang family, he was expected to throw a big birthday party. But Jiang Xun was strange. On every birthday, he only had a meal with Father and Mother Jiang.In the last few years, the Host didn\u2019t get along well with them, so she didn\u2019t have meals with them either. But this time, she must show up.Father and Mother Jiang were ready. Ming Shu came down and headed straight for Mother Jiang. \u201cMom, what are we eating?\u201d\u201cAll you do is eat.\u201d Mother Jiang tapped her nose gently.\u201cA good appetite is a blessing.\u201d How much have I eaten? I\u2019m economical!Mother Jiang shook her head, speechless. \u201cToday is your brother\u2019s birthday, ask your brother.\u201dMing Shu didn\u2019t want to talk to Jiang Xun, whose behavior was odd as of late. She just glanced at him.Jiang Xun looked down so his expression couldn\u2019t be seen clearly and said in a deep voice, \u201cWherever Niannian wants to go, we\u2019ll head there to eat. I\u2019ll get the car.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mother Jiang sighed and turned her head to lecture Ming Shu. \u201cYour brother is really kind to you. Don\u2019t be selfish or unfair to him. I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t get along well with your brother. Other brothers and sisters have such good relationships!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d If I wasn\u2019t bad to him, he would do bad things to your daughter!I am protecting your daughter\u2019s chastity.Liked it?

For them, to avoid being exposed to the public, it must be a restaurant with great privacy.As for Ming Shu, she was open to anywhere as long as it offered food.\u201cNiannian, how\u2019s the company going recently?\u201d Father Jiang asked, just to check whether the entertainment company had gone bankrupt under his daughter\u2019s control.\u201cJust as usual,\u201d Ming Shu said casually, her greedy eyes staring at the steaming pig\u2019s feet.The dish serving is so slow! I\u2019m going to die of starvation.Father Jiang was clearly dissatisfied with Ming Shu\u2019s perfunctory attitude, so he turned to Jiang Xun, who had lowered his head toward the table. \u201cXun\u2019er, tell me about it.\u201dHearing his name, Jiang Xun raised his head to reveal a poker face and answered, \u201cNiannian is doing great with management.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to cover for her. She isn\u2019t expected to do well with her loose personality. I heard that you were losing quite a lot of employees, right?\u201d Father Jiang knew exactly everything about his own daughter.\u201cIt\u2019s true, Niannian did run the company well. The empty positions have been occupied by new staff, and everything is operating normally now.\u201d Only, we\u2019re being choked by Jinyu.Certainly, the last sentence was swallowed by Jiang Xun. But Father Jiang must have known this if he was at all interested.Jiang Xun was reluctant to say it in front of Niannian for fear that she might be upset.\u201cCome on, you two. Can\u2019t we just enjoy this hard-won family time and have a meal leisurely? Don\u2019t talk about work anymore.\u201d Mother Jiang pinched Father Jiang, so Father Jiang had to shut up. \u201cXun\u2019er, Mom has something to tell you. You see, you\u2019ve grown up and you\u2019re at the perfect age for marriage. Maybe go find yourself a good wife?\u201dThe topic changed to him so dramatically; Jiang Xun was still distracted, and he subconsciously looked to Ming Shu. Meanwhile, she was keeping a close watch on the pig\u2019s feet, not noticing his gaze at all.In a dry voice, Jiang Xun said softly, \u201cMom\u2026 For the moment I don\u2019t want to talk about this.\u201d\u201cStop saying that! You are not young anymore. If you really like someone, just bring her home. The Jiang family is not like other families. As long as the girl behaves herself, no matter what her family background is, you can stay with each other.\u201d\u201cAs long as you like,\u201d Father Jiang also added.\u201c\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun wondered, Why is the birthday topic always the same? Can\u2019t they just change the channel?Resting his eyes on Ming Shu, Jiang Xun asked tentatively, \u201cNiannian, do you like someone?\u201d\u201cThe pig\u2019s feet!\u201d Ming Shu blurted out.\u201cPfft!\u201dMother Jiang didn\u2019t refrain from laughing; even Father Jiang was shaking with laughter. Only Jiang Xun looked a little cloudy, but he hid it away as Mother Jiang looked over.\u201cIf Niannian is hungry, just eat,\u201d Jiang Xun said considerately.\u201cGo ahead, go ahead.\u201d Father Jiang waved his hands, having no other choice. There were no guests today, so just forget table manners.Hearing this, Ming Shu swiftly reached for the pig\u2019s feet, her eyes shining with joy. Yet the pig\u2019s feet were taken away by another hand immediately before her. Ming Shu\u2019s eyes opened wide at once.My pig\u2019s feet were robbed!Give them back!\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Putting on a disposable glove, Jiang Xun cut off all the meat from the pig\u2019s feet and put it onto a clean plate, then he delivered most of the meat to Ming Shu and the leftovers to Mother and Father Jiang.\u201c\u2026\u201d The pig\u2019s feet can be eaten in this way? Ming Shu thought.The rich really do have a special way of eating.I used to eat the whole thing!Jiang Xun felt that he was being stared at by his own sister with some unidentified hostility again. Why? What else should he do? He was in total despair now.\u201cXun\u2019er, did you hear what I said?\u201d Mother Jiang still kept the marriage topic in mind as she ate. She was so concerned about Jiang Xun as a mother.\u201cMom, for the moment I don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to find a man for yourself like those people?\u201d Father Jiang interrupted again. \u201cWhat is that called? Out of what?\u201d\u201cOut of the closet,\u201d Mother Jiang added.\u201cRight. That\u2019s out of the closet!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any girls around Xun\u2019er during the years. Xun\u2019er, do you really like men?\u201d Mother Jiang looked at Jiang Xun worriedly.\u201c\u2026\u201dCan I just switch parents?He rose. \u201cI need to use the restroom.\u201dMother Jiang and her husband looked at each other and got the relieved answer from each other\u2019s eyes.Jiang Xun had been absent for a long time, so Mother Jiang asked Ming Shu to check on him. But Ming Shu was entirely focused on her food, not knowing what they were talking about. And now all she knew was that Jiang Xun made her starve again.She added it to her mental list of Jiang Xun\u2019s misdeeds, bitter.Interrupting my meal can\u2019t be forgiven.Outside the room, Ming Shu walked toward the restroom. Before going near, she saw a few people gathering around the restroom door.A noisy argument was coming from inside. Ming Shu approached and saw two people clearly.Ning Keqing and Li Shaonan\u2019s first love.The latter was against the wall, looking uncomfortable. Ning Keqing, with her hair disheveled and a clear palm print on her face, was pointing at Li Shaonan\u2019s first love, saying something.The first love was getting more and more uncomfortable. Her body was almost sliding down to the floor, and tiny, cold beads of sweat began to appear on her forehead.\u201cStop acting! Weren\u2019t you strong enough to slap me on the face?\u201d Ning Keqing screamed in a shrill voice. She looked a little hideous with that expression.Usually in a story of this kind\u2014where the first love and the substitute quarreled with each other\u2014people would have more sympathy for the substitute. But in this case, it looked like the first love was more pitiful.Li Shaonan showed up in time. When Ning Keqing was about to take further action, he came to protect his first love like a hero. After warning Ning Keqing, he took his first love in his arms and left in a hurry.Ning Keqing went after him, yet was held up by his assistant ruthlessly.\u201cLi Shaonan!\u201d Ning Keqing shouted, her eyes turning red.The man didn\u2019t look back once. After his figure disappeared from sight, the assistant also left. The others hanging around, seeing the show coming to the end, discussed with each other in front of Ning Keqing and then trickled away. Finally Ning Keqing was left alone in the restroom.She felt the familiar despair and helplessness of her previous existence.How could\u2026How could he treat her like this!He once promised\u2026Ning Keqing was stunned. Now she realized that Li Shaonan had never liked or been in love with her. All he had done for her was just what she asked of him.\u201cHa ha ha\u2026\u201d How ridiculous of her, being so foolishly sentimental.What was the meaning of being reborn and living life again?Ning Keqing laughed loudly as tears streamed down her cheeks. With her blurred vision, she seemed to see a smiling face she would never forget.\u201cJiang Nian!\u201d Endless hatred was shooting out from Ning Keqing\u2019s eyes.Kill her!Kill her!Driven by the voice inside, Ning Keqing rushed to Ming Shu fiercely.Ming Shu didn\u2019t give her any chance to get near and kicked Ning Keqing in the belly. Ning Keqing had been in poor health recently because of unexpected changes. Suffering a heavy kick, she directly fell onto the floor.\u201cWhoops, I didn\u2019t use any strength.\u201d Ming Shu looked at Ning Keqing with a smile.Coughing, Ning Keqing covered her aching belly, her pale face filled with hatred. \u201cJiang Nian\u2026 Jiang Nian\u2026 I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201dMing Shu opened her arms and said happily, \u201cCome on.\u201dNing Keqing crawled up from the floor, teeth biting into her lip, and staggered toward Ming Shu.She was going to kill her.All because of her! She\u2019d lost everything!Her career, her love, all gone.It was all her fault!Kill her, and she would be the superstar in the spotlight again, with millions of people chasing after her.Kill her, and Li Shaonan would like\u2014no, he would love her.Kill her\u2026Then everything would return to normal.Liked it?

Ning Keqing was shouting and yelling in a hysterical voice, her clothes a mess and temperament unstable. She totally looked like a psychopath.Even if Ming Shu hit her, it could probably be a justifiable defense, so no one questioned her.Ning Keqing was forcibly removed from the restaurant. At first she resisted with loud yelling and shouting, but when she was almost out of Ming Shu\u2019s line of sight, she suddenly became quiet.Her eyes filling with hatred, she stared at Ming Shu like an evil, poisonous snake.Ming Shu curved her lips, waving her hands excitedly at Ning Keqing.\u201cAh\u2014\u201d Ning Keqing couldn\u2019t stand the provocation anymore and screamed recklessly.[Hatred Points are maxed out, task completed.] The Harmony System notified after Ning Keqing disappeared from this world.[You can choose to stay in this world until the body you are living in expires. Or you can choose to return to the system space and move on to your next task.]Return?For what?I haven\u2019t eaten enough!I\u2019m not going back!Ming Shu refused to return, and the Harmony System didn\u2019t say anything to interfere.After looking for Jiang Xun all around the restroom, Ming Shu didn\u2019t find him, so she had to return to her family\u2019s room alone.\u201cWhere\u2019s your brother?\u201d Mother Jiang asked when she saw Ming Shu coming in by herself.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t find him.\u201d Ming Shu shrugged, sitting down to continue eating.Mother Jiang shook her head. She was going to look for Jiang Xun herself when the door was pushed open suddenly. Jiang Xun entered, one hand in his pocket, and looked straight at Mother Jiang.\u201cMom, Dad, I have something to tell you.\u201dMother and Father Jiang looked at each other over and over again, and finally Father Jiang nodded. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dTurning to Ming Shu, who was still absorbed in her food and didn\u2019t look up, Jiang Xun said, \u201cNiannian.\u201dMing Shu raised her head with a bit of confusion in her eyes. Why do you call my name when talking to our parents?Jiang Xun\u2019s cold face showed a kind of soft color. He looked deep into Ming Shu\u2019s eyes. \u201cNiannian, I like you.\u201dHearing this, Ming Shu wasn\u2019t surprised at all, but Mother and Father Jiang were frightened. They were shocked, wearing the same disbelieving looks on their faces.\u201cXun\u2019er\u2026\u201d\u201cMom, Dad, I know you are not my biological parents, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I like Niannian.\u201d Jiang Xun continued, \u201cNiannian and I grew up together, it\u2019ll be better for me to look after her rather than others, won\u2019t it?\u201dUnder the gazes of Mother and Father Jiang, Jiang Xun walked toward Ming Shu. Pulling his hand from his pocket, he held out a small and exquisite box to Ming Shu. The box was open; a ring sat quietly inside.Jiang Xun was determined to do this and got down on one knee, stern eyes filled with eager affection. \u201cNiannian, would you like to be my girlfriend?\u201d\u201cJiang Xun!\u201d Father Jiang slammed the table and stood up. \u201cYou are her brother! What are you doing!\u201dBefore it was Jiang Nian that always rebelled against him. Now, finally, the daughter gave up being an actress, yet the son began to stir trouble.\u201cYou want to piss me off, don\u2019t you?\u201d Father Jiang was really angry. \u201cDon\u2019t say such things again! Stand up!\u201d\u201cDarling, actually\u2026\u201d Mother Jiang was a little embarrassed. She took turns looking at her son and husband for a while, then said, \u201cIf Niannian also likes Xun\u2019er\u2026 it doesn\u2019t seem that bad. They are not really brother and sister anyway, there\u2019s no need to get too angry about this.\u201dMother Jiang was satisfied with Jiang Xun. She would support them if they really were fond of each other.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Father Jiang cried out with a black face. \u201cJiang Xun, if you still want to be my son, get off the floor!\u201d\u201cNiannian.\u201d Ignoring Father Jiang, Jiang Xun kept his deep and eager eyes on Ming Shu.He had grown tired of seeing her around yet not being able to show his love.He had to get an answer today.Ming Shu licked her fingers before taking out some tissues to wipe her hands. Then she unhurriedly rose up with a normal smile. \u201cBrother, I don\u2019t like you.\u201dWithout any ambiguous words, it was a straightforward refusal.Jiang Xun\u2019s eyes dimmed. He clenched hard on the ring box in silence, head lowering. After a long time, he stood up. \u201cI know.\u201dPutting the ring back in his pocket, Jiang Xun turned to Mother and Father Jiang. \u201cDad, Mom, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThen Jiang Xun turned around and left the room. Ming Shu sat down again, continuing to eat like nothing had happened. After struggling for a while, Mother Jiang went out after Jiang Xun.Father Jiang restrained his anger. \u201cNiannian, have you been aware of this for a long time?\u201d\u201cWell, not that long. I didn\u2019t know until recently,\u201d Ming Shu answered quickly, grasping a short pause in her eating.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026\u201d Father Jiang didn\u2019t finish the sentence. Perhaps he also didn\u2019t know what words could describe his feelings right now.If Jiang Xun weren\u2019t the son he\u2019d raised for so many years, he would have agreed.But the key point was, many people in the business considered Jiang Xun his biological son, with only a few knowing he was adopted. If Jiang Xun really stayed with Niannian, what would people think of them?How would they deal with people\u2019s talk?\u2026Jiang Xun hadn\u2019t appeared since that day. According to Father Jiang, he didn\u2019t even go to the company.Mother Jiang was so worried about him. He didn\u2019t answer the phone, and the apartment was also empty.\u201cNiannian, give your brother a call.\u201d Mother Jiang really had no idea what to do, so she came to Ming Shu. \u201cAfter all, he is your brother. You can\u2019t let him do stupid things.\u201d\u201cMom, just ask someone to track down his phone.\u201d Jiang Xun didn\u2019t answer the phone, but he also didn\u2019t shut it off! He must carry it with him, silly mother!\u201cRight right right, why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u201d Mother Jiang left in a hurry, looking for someone to track Jiang Xun\u2019s phone.Ming Shu sighed. What\u2019s all this about? I\u2019m going to eat!Ming Shu thought Jiang Xun would stay away for a long time. But he showed up right in the evening, looking just the same as usual.\u201cMom, I\u2019m sorry to have worried you.\u201d Jiang Xun apologized to his parents first.\u201cI\u2019m fine as long as you are home,\u201d Mother Jiang said with wet eyes.Father Jiang kept silent, face dark. But seeing Jiang Xun home, he must be relieved as well.Jiang Xun walked to Ming Shu and carefully chose his words. \u201cNiannian, I\u2019m sorry I troubled you. But I just wanted you to know my feelings. I can\u2019t control it.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d I know that now.But what\u2019s the point of my knowing it!Your treasured sister is already gone.\u2026In the following days, Jiang Xun seemed just as before. He went to work, keeping a distance from Ming Shu. Mother and Father Jiang thought he had let it go, so they began to introduce new girls to him again.Jiang Xun never rejected, but each attempt ended in vain.Ming Shu had been busy lately, so busy that she barely had time to eat. Thus she was very irritable, and the more irritable she was, the brighter her smile became, which looked a little creepy, scaring the staff away.\u201cMiss Jiang, Jinyu Entertainment happened to be scheduled on the same day as us. They absolutely did this on purpose,\u201d the assistant reported in a trembling voice. \u201cAnd their broadcast TV is better than ours, I\u2019m afraid the audience rating would\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we are the dark horse.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Who gave you the confidence to say that you\u2019re the dark horse?With her chin in hand, Ming Shu said gently, \u201cContact the Ethereal Heights crew and ask if they need free publicity. Then tell Tian Yuan to buy me some food.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAlways with food in mind. Miss Jiang, do you have some disease to make you eat or die? Is it incurable?Liked it?

    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Gossip Queen (21)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsMing Shu and Jinyu both arranged their TV dramas to air on the prime time slot of the winter holiday. Jinyu started advertising long ago, and with its hot IP name and well known stars, their show had attracted lots of attention before its TV premiere.While Ming Shu\u2019s show, from the first shooting to approaching its first broadcasting, was kept low all the time. The employees became anxious in private, wondering what their boss was going to do.Just as they were worrying, the official microblog of Ethereal Heightssurprisingly reposted a trailer, noting in particular that it was the first screen show by the same leading actress of Ethereal Heights .Initially, when the newbie was selected as Ethereal Heights\u2019 leading actress, it made many people drop their jaws in surprise. How could a newbie without any prior works be chosen to play the leading role?And now a trailer suddenly came out, saying she had finished a drama?Numerous netizens poured into the original blogger\u2019s page\u2014the official microblog of TV drama Records of the Royal Queen .Most people were confused. Was there a TV drama called Records of the Royal Queen ?How could it never have been divulged?They sought information from the official microblog one after another.Then the introduction came soon after those netizens watched the trailer.A Famous Netizen: Records of the Royal Queen is adapted from Qing Shui Wu Yuan\u2019s long novel, The Supreme Royalty , from some literature site. Because of its updating problem, the novel didn\u2019t make a big impression in the site, not even showing up on the ranking list.Born Stunner: Watched the trailer, seems good. I\u2019m look forward to the drama.The Wind Is Coming: I heard about Qing Shui Wu Yuan before. She once wrote a short story, suspense type though, and it was a super great story. The Supreme Royalty was about harem fighting, so I didn\u2019t read it. But for the adaption of her novel, I will take a look. Anticipating!After a heated discussion, most netizens had been informed of the basic information of this drama.Harem fighting, adapted from novel, produced by Starlight Entertainment, and with a famous director. The author of the original work was not well known but her style was great, and the scriptwriter was XX. The leading actress was also the same as in Ethereal Heights , and the leading actor was from Starlight Entertainment.All the entertainment companies were chasing after widely known IPs, wishing to grab almost every heated one.Thus people in the industry didn\u2019t hold a positive view on Starlight Entertainment, for it chose a cold IP.But Ming Shu thought these people were superficial.How did the TV series catch fire when the novels weren\u2019t so popular?It was because of the scenario and story, not because of the fame brought by novel IPs and stars.A good TV drama was going to be known in the end.The diamonds always shine wherever they are.Compared with other harem fighting series, the trailer of Records of the Royal Queen made an impression on the audience no matter its scene or the actors\u2019 makeup. At a perfectly appropriate degree, it was not too bright to the point of dazzling.And the director of Ethereal Heights ?This was a real artist who focused on creating quality works and who would never fear a strong power.The official blogger must seek permission from the director to repost such a trailer, which meant the director accepted this drama, thus most netizens began to look forward to it.As soon as the trailer was published, Ming Shu gave orders to mobilize official advertising.With the Ethereal Heights group\u2019s publicity beforehand, it became much easier for further advertisement at this time. But Ming Shu was almost suppressing the advertising, trying to keep the drama mysterious to arouse interest in the audience.When the broadcasting day came, Records of the Royal Queen had gained as much popularity as the drama on Jinyu\u2019s side. Differently, Jinyu had disclosed almost all the relevant information, but Ming Shu maintained that their publicized information was only the tip of the iceberg.Their series started on the same day and at the same eight o\u2019clock prime time slot.On Ming Shu\u2019s side, the television channel was actually not as good as Jinyu\u2019s and it was at a disadvantage in the beginning. But twenty minutes later, its ratings began to rise, matching that of Jinyu when the first episode ended.However, as the second episode began, the ratings soared all the way, with Jinyu lagging far behind.Records of the Royal Queen , whether for its plot or the actors\u2019 acting, though not perfect, was much better than those dramas with only good-looking young stars or where the acting was too exaggerated.Decorated with unique drama scenes, Records of the Royal Queen really impressed the audience. The director had adopted clever shooting techniques to cover up the shortcomings of the actors and actresses, making the whole scenario seem reasonable.Just as Ming Shu said, this drama had become the dark horse.\u2026For the next few days, Records of the Royal Queen had been overwhelmingly pressuring Jinyu, creating new records constantly.Praise was also coming like a flowing tide. Those who were bad-mouthing the show now started to blatantly acclaim it, deleting large numbers of former comments.The leading actress of Records of the Royal Queen exploded in popularity all at once. Ethereal Heights took this opportunity to release promotional photos. As the eye-catching leading actress of Ethereal Heights , the young girl in the picture was fresh and juicy, with a quick-witted appearance in complete conformity with the female character in the film.Jinyu suffered a great loss with their drama, so they wanted to make a comeback with the movie at the Lunar New Year slot. However, there was no movie by Starlight Entertainment that would be released at that time.You wanted to start a race, yet your opponent didn\u2019t care to respond. How did you feel about that?Ming Shu won the battle in a beautiful way, so people in the circle didn\u2019t look down on her anymore. She could bear the pressure of Li Shaonan and found a way out from under the water; that endurance was totally beyond the average.\u201cNiannian, congratulations.\u201dMing Shu saw Jiang Xun sitting alone in the living room when she came downstairs. Turning her gaze to the empty dining room, was Mother Jiang not at home?\u201cMom and Dad went abroad,\u201d Jiang Xun explained before Ming Shu asked.About that day\u2019s confession, he seemed to have forgotten. He didn\u2019t show any embarrassment when they met each other at home.If Jiang Xun wasn\u2019t embarrassed, then Ming Shu as an outsider couldn\u2019t be any cooler. She stepped down, holding the banister. \u201cWhere\u2019s Aunt Zhou?\u201dMother Jiang didn\u2019t take Aunt Zhou with her, right? She had to do her cooking job.\u201cAunt Zhou took some days off for family affairs.\u201d\u201cHow long?\u201d Ming Shu picked up an apple on the table and took a bite out of it. \u201cWho will cook for us if she\u2019s not here?\u201d\u201cIt should be only a few days. I\u2019m not busy these days, so just tell me if you want to eat something.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Pointing to the burning incense on the table, Ming Shu suddenly asked this.\u201cJust for pacifying the mood.\u201d Jiang Xun tried to act normally. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling a little anxious recently so I let the servant buy it.\u201dMing Shu stepped back with the apple in hand, glancing at the door, then swiftly ran to it.It was locked.Turning around, Ming Shu saw Jiang Xun standing up from the sofa and looking at her with shadowed eyes. A hidden madness was emerging in his gaze.Sh*t!I knew this guy would go crazy.Abandoning the thought of opening the door, Ming Shu took two bites of the apple, leaning against it, and said, \u201cBrother, what do you want? To imprison me?\u201d\u201cNiannian\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun\u2019s face looked pained and his voice sounded bitter. \u201cWhy\u2026 why don\u2019t you like me? Tell me which part you don\u2019t like, I\u2019ll change for you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like that you like me, can you change that?\u201d As an outsider, Ming Shu couldn\u2019t afford this \u201clike\u201d thing.\u201cNiannian, don\u2019t torture me.\u201d Jiang Xun seemed to be restraining his emotions.Ming Shu rested her eyes on the burning incense, which had almost burned out, and with a smile faintly discernible on her face, she provoked, \u201cSo what?\u201dLiked it?

Rich people truly are different. Of course he\u2019d have such realistic props!The passing scenery outside the window became more and more desolate. She didn\u2019t know where Jiang Xun was going to take her.That incense was spiked with some kind of overpowering drug, which would cause loss of strength.Ming Shu felt nothing in her heart, and even had the desire to eat something.\u201cNiannian, give me a chance, all right?\u201d With an imploring voice, Jiang Xun looked straight ahead. He didn\u2019t want to do this, but devastated by Ming Shu\u2019s refusal, he couldn\u2019t help it\u2026With a drowsy feeling creeping over her, Ming Shu curled up in the passenger seat. She turned her head when she heard Jiang Xun\u2019s voice and said, \u201cDear brother, there are so many beautiful women in the world, why do you have to like me?\u201dI\u2019m really not a person you should like!Blue veins were spreading all over the back of Jiang Xun\u2019s hand, which showed he was strongly restraining his body\u2019s desire. His gaze drifted away, seemingly trapped in memories. \u201cI remember when you were a little girl, you looked like a snow white fluffy ball and always called me brother in a crisp and sweet voice\u2026\u201dMost of what Jiang Xun said couldn\u2019t be found in the Host\u2019s memory anymore. Probably the Host was too young to remember it.But Jiang Xun remembered everything clearly.Terrible!I need a whole bunch of snacks to calm down.\u201cI don\u2019t know why, but you began to alienate me starting in middle school, and even quarreled with me as you grew older\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun\u2019s face was full of pain. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight with you. But every time you saw me you were filled with impatience. Niannian, did you know how anguished I was at that time?\u201dMing Shu was fiddling with the handcuffs and her face was covered by dangling hair. Her faint voice emerged: \u201cBecause you were too controlling.\u201dSince the Host attended middle school, Jiang Xun started to control her in almost every way. What kind of friends she was going to make, where to hang out and what to eat, all of these he required to know.Teenagers were at a rebellious age and not even their parents restricted her as tightly as him, plus she incidentally knew that Jiang Xun was not her biological brother then, so how could she not feel annoyed?Jiang Xun felt his lips twitch. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to be hurt by others.\u201dMing Shu sneered. \u201cThat\u2019s why you lost your dear sister.\u201dSqueak \u2014The car suddenly stopped. With its tires rubbing against the ground, a harsh sound was produced. Ming Shu was thrown forward suddenly and then was violently pulled back by the seatbelt. The hit made her feel dizzy in the head.Then a pair of hands pushed on her shoulders, and a familiar breath came near. \u201cNiannian, I won\u2019t lose you.\u201d\u201cYou have lost me.\u201d Ming Shu shook her head. So faint.\u201cNo! I won\u2019t!\u201d Jiang Xun looked at Ming Shu with his determined eyes. That hidden madness appeared again.He released Ming Shu and started the car. He would never lose her.Ming Shu was still affected by the drug and could do nothing but nest in the passenger seat, feeling Jiang Xun\u2019s mad and evil thoughts.She was taken to a villa in the neighboring city, where the layout seemed to follow what the Host preferred. But all the windows and doors of the villa used a high-tech system that needed a fingerprint to unlock.\u201cNiannian, my good girl, you will live here and no one else can bother us.\u201d A bit of joy emerged on Jiang Xun\u2019s face. \u201cI arranged all of this for you, personally. Do you like it?\u201dHe would live here forever with his Niannian.His Niannian would always belong to him.He believed that one day Niannian would like him, and accept him.\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Ming Shu took things as they came.Jiang Xun\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2019ll cook some food for you. Niannian, stay here waiting for me. Don\u2019t try to run away or I\u2019ll be angry.\u201dMing Shu smiled, then fell on the sofa, pretending to rest.Come on, you have to feed me thoroughly first!With an empty stomach, how can I have the strength to escape!Ming Shu\u2019s obedience made Jiang Xun feel soft inside. His eyes were full of love, and he didn\u2019t need to hide his affection anymore.Jiang Xun came back soon with food. He served dinner directly to Ming Shu, half-kneeling in front of the sofa. \u201cNiannian, let me feed you, okay?\u201dMing Shu sat up on the sofa and grabbed the bowl and chopsticks from Jiang Xun. \u201cDon\u2019t bother my eating, go away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe always felt he was not as important as the food.After eating and drinking her fill, Ming Shu put down the bowl, making a clear sound. The handcuffs also fell off to this same sound.Jiang Xun\u2019s tender expression suddenly changed.The temperature of the room seemed to have dropped several degrees.The scene was awkward for a while.Ming Shu handcuffed herself again with a smile. \u201cBrother, this pair of handcuffs is of poor quality. Remember to buy a new pair with better quality next time. It will be great to buy one made of gold and inlaid with diamonds.\u201d\u201cWould you like that?\u201d Jiang Xun said in a low voice, sounding a bit dangerous.\u201cOf course.\u201d It could be exchanged for lots of snacks.\u201cThen I\u2019ll customize a pair for Niannian.\u201d Jiang Xun\u2019s tone softened again.Ming Shu smiled with curved eyes and brows, then sat back on the sofa, ignoring Jiang Xun.After standing beside her for a while, Jiang Xun returned the tableware to the kitchen.Ming Shu was placed in the villa like this. She could watch TV and the news, but couldn\u2019t use cell phones and computers.Ming Shu was surprised when Jiang Xun really customized a pair of gold handcuffs with diamonds for her. But he didn\u2019t use them on her. So on that night, Ming Shu carried out an escape, then succeeded in putting those handcuffs on her wrists.\u201cNiannian, why can\u2019t you be obedient?\u201d Jiang Xun shackled Ming Shu to the bed; he was very disappointed. \u201cI\u2019m treating you with love, why do you want to leave me?\u201d\u201cJust go, I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d Ming Shu waved her hand like an emperor.\u201cNiannian\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun suddenly bent over, his hands next to Ming Shu\u2019s ears, his eyes was filled with a crazy desire to possess. \u201cYou are mine, you can\u2019t leave me.\u201dThe illumination from the bulb over Jiang Xun\u2019s head fell into Ming Shu\u2019s eyes, breaking into countless shimmering lights. With her glittering smile, it was extremely intoxicating. \u201cIf I want to leave, no one can stop me.\u201dMing Shu suddenly bent her legs. Jiang Xun subconsciously seized them tighter but failed. Ming Shu curled her body swiftly under Jiang Xun and successfully grabbed one of his hands. The handcuff was transferred from Ming Shu\u2019s wrist to Jiang Xun\u2019s.Jiang Xun then quickly used another hand to grab Ming Shu, yet Ming Shu moved to the bedside, ruining his confidence and hitting his hand with her head. The other hand was also handcuffed now.Ming Shu jumped out of bed, watching Jiang Xun floundering in irritation.Jiang Xun didn\u2019t expect that he would be caught by Ming Shu.\u201cNiannian\u2026\u201d Jiang Xun pulled the handcuffs hard. But they were designed by himself, so they definitely couldn\u2019t be broken out of so easily. \u201cNiannian, where are you going?\u201d\u201cDownstairs to eat something,\u201d Ming Shu answered without turning back.Physical activity was really tiring.\u201c\u2026\u201dJiang Xun opened the handcuffs using the key and ran downstairs. The door was open. The sound of the car\u2019s engine starting came from outside.He ran out of the villa. Ming Shu had propped her arms on the car window, waiting for him leisurely.She waved to Jiang Xun and smiled. \u201cJiang Xun, we will never meet again!\u201dThe car slipped out of the villa.Jiang Xun shouted in despair, \u201cJiang Nian!\u201dThrough the rearview mirror, Ming Shu saw him standing motionlessly where he was. The lights on the front lawn sketched out his tall, thin figure.Ming Shu tapped the window with her fingertips and her lips slightly curled.The car drove further and further away, disappearing into the dark.Liked it?

Since she was going to leave, she\u2019d better beat him as soon as possible.Walking out of Li Shaonan\u2019s house, Ming Shu felt her life bar was totally empty; she was in urgent need of feeding now.[Guest, are you going back to the system space now?]\u201cWho said that?\u201d I\u2019m not leaving this world.[\u2026] You just beat someone up, doesn\u2019t that mean you are leaving? Am I wrong?Apparently the Harmony System had mistaken her. She never intended to go back so soon, and what she meant was to leave that place.The place where Jiang Xun was.She bought plane tickets overnight and transferred between multiple airplanes, carrying a fake ID card and passport acquired from a forger. Finally, she was wandering on the streets of a foreign country.Ming Shu looked at the strange crowd.Luckily I\u2019m clever. With the money I saved before and my beautiful face, all the delicious food in this world will be mine!But those gold handcuffs with diamonds\u2026 what a pity!Ming Shu would occasionally pay attention to the domestic news. Afterward, Ning Keqing met with Li Shaonan several times. But compared to his first love, who was noble and generous, she became more and more like a shrew.In the end, she completely annoyed Li Shaonan after beating his first love.Without Li Shaonan\u2019s protection, plus her resentful heart, Ning Keqing could no longer be tolerated in the circle.She didn\u2019t want to leave the entertainment industry, though. In order to obtain an acting role, she fawned over some investors. But before she could climb up, it was exposed.Surrounded by negative reports, the investors pushed Ning Keqing to the front as a shield in order to protect themselves.Some said Ning Keqing killed herself in the end, but others said she was sent to a mental hospital. No one knew the specifics, and there were no fixed statements online.As for Jiang Xun, he had been chasing after her all this time!Therefore, Ming Shu transferred from one place to another like a refugee. Before she could settle down to eat some warm food, Jiang Xun would appear, catching her alive.And he always wanted to imprison her, repeating the small dark room drama.Such a noble identity as mine, am I someone that you\u2019re entitled to play with in a small dark room?I\u2019m not going if the room isn\u2019t decorated with gold and diamonds.Usually, if Jiang Xun didn\u2019t disturb her meal, Ming Shu would ignore him. She would run away when Jiang Xun caught up with her; if Jiang Xun blocked the way, she would fight.But just like glue, Jiang Xun was too sticky to throw away.It was slightly suffocating.Ming Shu looked back and saw Jiang Xun following not far behind; she sighed in her heart. Jiang Nian, Jiang Nian, what crime have you committed to deserve this? To incur such a terrible and persistent psychopath?I just wanted to eat something quietly, how is it so hard!She turned around and walked back toward Jiang Xun. Standing in front of him, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me. You\u2019ve tried so many times, which time did you trap me successfully?\u201dShe was tired of the dark room drama. Why couldn\u2019t he just change his methods?He dreamed of chasing a girl with such poor creativity? Prepare to be single for the rest of your life!\u201cThis time will definitely work,\u201d Jiang Xun answered in a stubborn tone.\u201c\u2026\u201d Psychopath . \u201cHow will you catch me this time?\u201dJiang Xun fell into silence. Ming Shu waited for a while, but received no answer. Perhaps this psychopath was planning some major trouble in his mind.Jiang Xun\u2019s obsession with her seemed to have been deeply rooted in his blood: he would never stop until he got her.Ming Shu dumped Jiang Xun and got ready to leave this place, searching for the next ideal city.However, on the plane, she was to tragically meet Jiang Xun again. Ming Shu smiled as she gnashed her teeth. After getting off the plane, she\u2019d find a remote place to kill him. He was so annoying.Ming Shu sat in front of Jiang Xun. Even blocked by the seats, she could still feel his dour gaze trying to wrap her and imprison her.Psychopath!He wants to separate me from my snacks!!He\u2019s daydreaming!The plane took off. Ming Shu felt some buzzing in her ears, which was normal.But perhaps it was because of Jiang Nian\u2019s special constitution, Ming Shu always felt she was going to turn deaf each time. She uncomfortably shrank in her seat, watching the clouds outside.The passenger beside her suddenly got up. Ming Shu turned back to see Jiang Xun switching seats with that person. He bent down to put white earmuffs on her ears, and sat down next to her with tight lips. Then he looked ahead after fastening his seatbelt.He didn\u2019t say any words from beginning to end.Ming Shu touched the fluffy earmuffs, pushed one side off, and then bent toward Jiang Xun. \u201cBrother, tell me, which part of me do you like?\u201dI\u2019ll change, okay?\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jiang Xun sat straight and answered in a cold voice, \u201cLike is like.\u201dMing Shu helplessly covered her ears, and after a while she took off the earmuffs again. \u201cBrother, did you read the novel The Last Candy ?\u201dJiang Xun glanced at her sidelong, seeming like he wanted to look at Ming Shu, but quickly he moved his gaze away again. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIn the novel, there was a secondary character just like you. He forcibly wanted to get a girl that didn\u2019t like him. Do you know what happened in the end?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the end he pushed her to her death, and for the rest of his life they couldn\u2019t see each other.\u201dJiang Xun\u2019s eyes flashed. He said firmly, \u201cI will never do that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Unbelievable .Pulling the earmuffs back on, Ming Shu covered her entire head with them. Talking to this illiberal psychopath just didn\u2019t make any sense.As Ming Shu was about to fall asleep, the plane suddenly began to shake, making her drowsiness disappear at once. Several low cries came from the passengers and the broadcast also sounded at the same time, saying the plane had encountered turbulence.It\u2019s normal for a plane to encounter turbulence, but now the shaking was getting fiercer and fiercer, which was not normal at all.\u201cBrother, you wouldn\u2019t be so desperate as to bury all the people on this plane together with me?\u201d Ming Shu put down her earmuffs, looking to Jiang Xun.Jiang Xun frowned. \u201cNonsense, I will never hurt you.\u201d\u201cWhy is the plane falling!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dPassengers in the back row screamed. The plane was falling very fast, like a toy suddenly thrown into the air by someone.The plane was falling faster and faster and the whole cabin was drowned with screams.Ming Shu grabbed the chair\u2019s armrest, her expression hardly changing.I haven\u2019t eaten all over this world, and now I\u2019m going to die\u2026Jiang Xun suddenly bent down to hug Ming Shu. \u201cNiannian, I like you.\u201dThat was the last sentence Ming Shu heard. When she woke up, she was standing in a room made of clouds.This was where the system drew her into the world before.She was back?Wasn\u2019t she told that she could use the Host\u2019s body until her death?[Jiang Nian\u2019s life lasts right to that day in the original plot.]\u201c\u2026\u201d Liar !A screen fashioned from a white cloud floated in front of Ming Shu, several lines on it.Name: Ming ShuHatred Points: 3000Extension Task: CompletedVery brief information. Compared to other system novels, this was the most simple she\u2019d ever read.Ming Shu struck her hands through the cloud-screen and the cloud dispersed immediately. But a moment later it reappeared again next to her.Evil technology!\u201cWas Jiang Xun killed?\u201d Ming Shu suddenly asked.[No.] The Harmony System answered.

Illuminated by the glimmering flash, the old teaching building looked haunted.A girl in uniform lay on the floor of a classroom. She was like a corpse, still and soundless.A raindrop as large as a bean fell heavily on the glass window, giving out a loud sound.The girl moved and sat up gradually, looking at the unfamiliar scene around her blankly.Pain in the head\u2026Pain in the chest\u2026Pain everywhere\u2026Ming Shu took deep breaths and felt uncomfortable, as if her chest was pressed upon by a huge stone.After resting for a while, she felt better.Ming Shu stood from the ground with great effort and sat on the seat beside her. As soon as she sat down, the chair suddenly released a sound.This seemed to be a classroom that was no longer in use. The desks and chairs were old and there was some rubbish on the ground.Where the hell was this?\u2026This was a fictional world with the setting of a school campus.The fake protagonist was called Jin Yuqi, who came to this world through a book. In this book, Jin Yuqi played an evil female supporting role. Because she competed with the female protagonist to win the heart of a man, she ended with a broken family.The new Jin Yuqi who came to this world through that book was determined to change her ending. So she started to compete with the female protagonist to win the heart of the male protagonist. Originally, things were over when she succeeded in winning the heart of the male protagonist. But Jin Yuqi was not satisfied and began to tempt other male supporting roles.In the end, Jin Yuqi successfully lived a happy life with several men.That was right!It was polygamy.The Host was called Lu Meng, a straight-A student who always ranked first on the school\u2019s grade list. Her appearance was lovely, in accordance with her name.She was famous at school. Originally, Lu Meng had no relation with Jin Yuqi, but\u2026Among Jin Yuqi\u2019s lovers, one was the Host\u2019s childhood sweetheart. The Host liked him and he seemed to like her too. Before the new Jin Yuqi appeared, the Host and her childhood sweetheart were in a dubious relationship.However, from the moment the new Jin Yuqi arrived in this fictional world, the childhood sweetheart paid no attention to the Host any longer and said that he always regarded her as a sister.In order to keep her childhood sweetheart, the Host compromised and begged him. But the childhood sweetheart firmly determined to leave her.In order to win the Host\u2019s childhood sweetheart, Jin Yuqi showed affection in the presence of the Host. Because the Host still badgered them, Jin Yuqi invited the Host to the old teaching building in the childhood sweetheart\u2019s name and locked her in a classroom.The Host stayed in a dark classroom alone while it thundered and rained outside. When the Host was discovered the next day, she was already in a coma.After being sent to the hospital, the Host started raving, becoming delirious. The doctor said the delirium was caused by fear.Soon the Host committed suicide by jumping from the building, taking advantage of the nurses\u2019 inattention.At the Host\u2019s death, her childhood sweetheart only felt grieved for several days, then he was passionately in love with Jin Yuqi. Under Jin Yuqi\u2019s persuasion, he even accepted the fact that Jin Yuqi had other lovers!So now the plot was that the Host was tricked into visiting the old teaching building and locked in a classroom.In the Host\u2019s memory, she had seen several silhouettes resembling ghosts outside the classroom and heard strange noises too.The Host\u2019s heart was not very strong, so she couldn\u2019t stand to be frightened. Therefore, she was frightened into a coma in the dark classroom.Then in the hospital, she still couldn\u2019t forget that scene and was driven to delirium in the end.\u201cAlas.\u201d Ming Shu sighed after she learned the whole story. Poor girl , she thought.If it were not for that Jin Yuqi appeared and changed the plot, the Host wouldn\u2019t have been frightened to delirium and died.Emmmm\u2026 Where is the food? I\u2019m so hungry!Since classes came to an end yesterday afternoon, this girl had been locked in here\u2026 Maybe it was early in the morning. No matter who went without eating for such a long time, they must feel hungry.Ming Shu turned her head to look around, finding that there was nothing to eat. She stood up to shake out her hands and feet and walked to the door, trying to open it.Huala huala\u2014The door was locked from the outside and couldn\u2019t be opened from the inside.Ming Shu looked at the window beside the door. The window of the old teaching building was not high, but it was barred with steel. Unless she could change into a smaller being, she couldn\u2019t go out through the window.Ming Shu looked at the wall on the other side whose window wasn\u2019t barred. But the classroom was on the third floor; she would be seriously injured if she jumped down.I\u2019m doomed to die here!\u201cHarmony, haven\u2019t you said there\u2019s a store? Are there any tools for me to use?\u201d Ming Shu leaned against the desk, asking without energy.[Sorry, your Hatred Points are not enough to open the store. No tool can be provided for you.]\u201c\u2026 How many Hatred Points do I need to open the store?\u201d Is there such a condition? Why don\u2019t I know? Ming Shu was confused.[One billion.]\u201c\u2026\u201d You are such a liar , Ming Shu cried her in mind.I may have been cheated, what to do?Before, you said there were tools in the store for me to use. But now I\u2019m told I need one billion Hatred Points to open the store. I only have three thousand Hatred Points now, when will I open that store? By the time I get one billion Hatred Points, things may have been solved already.Which fool invented this damn system?I\u2019ll complain.[Guest, if you want to complain, please write down the complaint. It can\u2019t be less than ten thousand words. I\u2019ll hand it in for you.]\u201c\u2026\u201d What the fuck kind of system\u2014Ten thousand words, why don\u2019t you go die?Do you know how much one word of mine is worth?It\u2019s priceless!Priceless, do you know!I don\u2019t want your tool!Rolling up her sleeves, Ming Shu walked to the window and was ready to climb down. Ming Shu had learned Kung Fu well, so even though the Host was extremely weak, climbing down\u2026 might not be a big problem for her.Even if she died here, she at most experienced one less world.Besides, the people who might die were not Ming Shu, so she was fearless.Ming Shu found a gutter outside the window. She pulled out the window, the cold, rainy wind blowing into her immediately and drenching her; her thin clothes became wet at once.Wiping her face, Ming Shu stood on the windowsill, then gripped the gutter carefully. It was raining now, so the gutter was smooth. Besides that, thunder boomed from above from time to time. Ming Shu\u2019s heart beat so fast it almost burst from her chest.Ming Shu reached the ground in the end with great effort. She covered her chest, calming down her hammering heart.Intermittently illuminated by the lightning, Ming Shu\u2019s face was both bright and dim, making her look like a smiling ghost.I didn\u2019t die.\u2026Exposed to the rain, Ming Shu walked out along the road of the old teaching building. Ming Shu\u2019s sight was hampered by the rain that grew heavier and heavier, and she couldn\u2019t see clearly in front of her.She was so hungry that she staggered.Bang!A boy darted from the side suddenly and collided with Ming Shu.Ming Shu fell toward the ground and the boy seemed to want to catch her. However, he couldn\u2019t steady himself and fell toward Ming Shu because of the smooth road, which was covered in moss as people seldom came here.Ming Shu\u2019s pupils widened slightly in astonishment. She quickly caught the tree beside she and successfully avoided falling down.Unfortunately, the boy fell to the ground and moaned painfully.Leaning against the tree, Ming Shu gasped, her heart that had only just calmed down now pounding again.Oh my god!You want to frighten me to death in order to inherit my snacks?Liked it?

It was a male uniform.The light was so dim that Ming Shu couldn\u2019t see his face clearly, only knowing that the boy was much taller than herself.On a rainy night, a girl student was murdered by a serial killer and abandoned in the wilderness.Ming Shu had already imagined the headlines for tomorrow\u2019s newspaper.Eh, so hungry!Ming Shu passed the boy, pressing her hands on her abdomen. Brushing off his dirty clothes and seeing that Ming Shu was about to leave, he looked at her for a while and suddenly called her. \u201cLu Meng?\u201dThrough the rain, Ming Shu looked at the boy with alarm. She had no snacks for him to rob.His voice was clean, sounding peaceful. \u201cWhy are you here when it\u2019s so late?\u201d\u201cSleepwalking,\u201d Ming Shu answered randomly.\u201c\u2026\u201dWho would sleepwalk to the school\u2019s old teaching building?The boy raised his hands to hold his collar, saying calmly, \u201cGo back early.\u201dThen he passed Ming Shu quickly, unwilling to stay.Seeing him disappear in the rain, Ming Shu wiped her face and complained, \u201cCrazy ah!\u201dThe school was closed now so Ming Shu had to find a place to climb the wall to get out. The wall of the school was a little high, but she succeeded in climbing it after a while. Sitting on top of the wall, Ming Shu calmed herself and rested there, exposed to the rain.I\u2019m so tired.Without snacks to support me, I might die here.Ming Shu inelegantly sat on the top of wall. When her eyes adjusted to the light, she seemed to see someone standing behind a tree under her feet.Ming Shu moved her body to adjust her line of sight. After a moment, she lay prone on top of wall, shouting, \u201cHey, you, why did you follow me?\u201dFollowing a beautiful girl student, what do you want to do?Knowing that he was found out, the boy standing behind the tree walked out gradually. It was the same guy from before.The boy walked to the wall and looked at Ming Shu who was lying prone, answering, \u201cThe gate was closed.\u201dThat explained why he was here too; he was about to go out over the wall as well.The sound of rain muffled all other sounds, the two keeping silent.After a while, Ming Shu broke the silence and asked, \u201cDo you have any food?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201dObviously, the boy was surprised by the question.\u201cFood,\u201d Ming Shu said again.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d He was a man, how could he bring food with him all the time?Ming Shu sat up, unwilling to talk to this stalker who didn\u2019t have any food. Then she jumped down from the top of the wall. Outside was an alley; it was dark and not equipped with any street lamp.The boy also went out over the wall. Looking at Ming Shu, who was gasping, he asked with hesitation, \u201cLu Meng, do you need me to send you back?\u201dAlthough knowing he couldn\u2019t see her face, Ming Shu still smiled as standard and refused politely. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d\u201cWell, be careful on your way home.\u201d The boy said it out of kindness among classmates. After all, no other meaning could be discerned from his mood.Then he left toward the other side of the alley. After leaning against the wall and resting for a while, Ming Shu was also about to leave.As she lifted her foot, she felt that she had stepped on something. She bent down and picked it up.Rumble\u2014Illuminated by lightning, the card could be seen clearly by Ming Shu.It was a student ID card on which the boy student was pure and handsome, like an Adonis from ancient Greek mythology.It can\u2019t be eaten.Useless.Ming Shu threw it away before she saw the name, walking into the darkness of the valley.\u2026Having been exposed to the rain for a whole night, Ming Shu had a serious cold the next day and was dizzy and sleepy when she arrived at the classroom.\u201cMengmeng, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d As soon as Ming Shu sat in the Host\u2019s seat, a girl with short hair beside her moved closer to her, asking, \u201cWhy is your face so red?\u201dThe girl with short hair touched Ming Shu\u2019s forehead and suddenly cried, \u201cAh, Mengmeng, you have a fever!\u201d\u201cEn\u2026\u201d It\u2019s just a fever, what\u2019s the fuss? Ming Shu thought.Ming Shu pushed away the hand of the short-haired girl, a smile on her pale face. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be fine after eating something.\u201d\u201cYou have a fever. You should take medicine instead of eating other things.\u201d The girl with short hair was worried. \u201cAre you confused because of the fever? Ah\u2026 I\u2019ll take you to the infirmary.\u201dThe girl with short hair dragged Ming Shu to the infirmary uncompromisingly.At that time, Jin Yuqi and a boy were about to come in. So they met at the door and paused there.Jin Yuqi looked Ming Shu up and down, asking with worry, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Lu Meng?\u201dMing Shu glanced at them quickly and her gaze didn\u2019t linger for one second. Although smiling as usual, she was totally unwilling to talk to them.\u201cGet away!\u201d The girl with short hair who dragged Ming Shu along seemed to greatly hate Jin Yuqi, her words to Jin Yuqi full of resentment.Jin Yuqi was a female supporting role originally, beautiful and rich. Just standing there, she was a fair-skinned, rich, and attractive lady.With a worried expression, she looked at the boy next to her. \u201cA\u2019Feng, Lu Meng seems to be uncomfortable. How about you take her to the infirmary?\u201dBefore he could speak, the girl with short hair became agitated, face turning red. \u201cJin Yuqi, don\u2019t go overboard!\u201dThis guy was the Host\u2019s childhood sweetheart, Shangguan Feng.\u201cYe Miaomiao, I just want A\u2019Feng to take Lu Meng to the infirmary. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Jin Yuqi said righteously.The students in the classroom had been attracted by the noise at the door and were watching them curiously.\u201cYou know what\u2026\u201d The girl with short hair was extremely angry. But being stared at by others, she had to swallow her words.Knowing that Lu Meng liked Shangguan Feng, Jin Yuqi still showed off in Lu Meng\u2019s presence, always high profile. She just wanted to make Lu Meng angry and jealous.Under the misguidance of Jin Yuqi, Shangguang Feng had no good feelings for Lu Meng now. At Jin Yuqi\u2019s proposal, he said nothing and directly went into the classroom, dragging Jin Yuqi behind him.\u201cA\u2019Feng, take Lu Meng to the infirmary,\u201d Jin Yuqi said gently with a concerned look. \u201cAfter all, she and you grew up together, you should take care of her.\u201d\u201cStay out of our business,\u201d the girl with short hair scolded in a low voice that no one besides Shangguan Feng could hear.He was angry, his face becoming gloomy at once. \u201cWho did you scold?\u201d\u201cWho I scolded knows.\u201d The girl with short hair was fearless too, staring at Shangguang Feng directly. \u201cShangguan Feng, you\u2019re a bad man.\u201d\u201cLiushui, don\u2019t speak so frankly. They won\u2019t understand. Don\u2019t waste time, let\u2019s go,\u201d Ming Shu said, smiling.Ye Miaomiao looked at Ming Shu, surprised.Were these words from Lu Meng who really liked Shangguan Feng?Didn\u2019t she wake up today?Shangguan Feng was already infuriated by Ye Miaomiao. But now, because of what Ming Shu said, the fury in his eyes flared. \u201cLu Meng, you say that again.\u201dMing Shu always smiled before speaking, her expression innocent. \u201cAlas, now you don\u2019t even understand human language. Since you don\u2019t know how to be a man, don\u2019t imitate one.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But she restrained her anger because she didn\u2019t want to be inelegant in front of others.Jin Yuqi scrutinized Ming Shu secretly. Woman\u2019s intuition told her that the girl in front of her was a bit different from who she used to be.If Lu Meng had seen Jin Yuqi and Shangguan Feng together in the past, she wouldn\u2019t be able to bear it and would be liable to fall over. But today she was so calm, which was strange.And she only had a cold after being locked in the old teaching building last night.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being rude to you?\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s face was red because of her fever. With a sweet smile on her lovely face now, she was so cute that others wanted to pinch her cheeks.\u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d Jin Yuqi hid her confusion in her heart, showing grief on her face. \u201cI saw that you\u2019re not feeling well and wanted A\u2019Feng to take you to the infirmary. It\u2019s fine that you didn\u2019t accept my kindness, but you shouldn\u2019t have been so rude. Lu Meng, didn\u2019t your parents teach you manners?\u201dWithout really trying, Jin Yuqi\u2019s expression was such that others didn\u2019t think she was being deliberate.Subconsciously, others were partial to her.Ming Shu chuckled, her sweet voice saying, \u201cYou scold me claiming my parents didn\u2019t teach me well?\u201dJin Yuqi didn\u2019t expect that Ming Shu would say that directly. When she heard that, her expression changed and her hands fell to unconsciously clutch her clothes tightly. She took a deep breath, explaining, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. Lu Meng, don\u2019t misunderstand my words.\u201d\u201cYuqi, don\u2019t say too much to her. She just knows how to make trouble out of nothing. Lu Meng, apologize to Yuqi and we\u2019ll let this go.\u201d Shangguan Feng dragged Jin Yuqi close to him, looking at Ming Shu indifferently.One had to admit that Shangguan Feng was really handsome, or Jin Yuqi wouldn\u2019t have taken a fancy to him and tried to win him over.\u201cApologize? I never apologize to a brute.\u201d Jin Yuqi deliberately flaunted their relationship in Lu Meng\u2019s presence. Ming Shu would have felt sorry for Jin Yuqi if she didn\u2019t counterattack and get Hatred Points. It would be a missed opportunity for them both.\u201cLu Meng, where is your upbringing?\u201d Shangguan Feng was disappointed. He remembered that Lu Meng was polite in the past and wondered why she changed so much.Ming Shu almost laughed. Why did Shangguan Feng still think he had the right to be disappointed in Lu Meng?If it were not that Shangguan Feng flirted with the Host, would the Host like him so much?Ye Miaomiao was right: Shangguan Feng was a bad man.\u201cI fed a dog with my upbringing.\u201d Ming Shu slightly tilted her head, asking Shangguan Feng, \u201cWell, was it delicious?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Shangguan Feng couldn\u2019t restrain his anger anymore, furiously demanding, \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to apologize? Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t dare deal with you.\u201dHe had clearly explained to her that he always regarded her as a sister and thought she would understand. But things developed into this, beyond his expectation.That a lovely girl changed to such an impolite girl disappointed him greatly.\u201cI just don\u2019t want to apologize. Do you want to hit me? Come on, hit me!\u201d Ming Shu pushed her smiling face closer to Shangguang Feng\u2019s on purpose.Shangguan Feng was so angry he almost lost his mind, hand rising to slap Ming Shu. Meanwhile Ming Shu smiled wider. Looking into her smiling eyes suddenly, Shangguan Feng felt fearful for no reason and wanted to stop.But now he couldn\u2019t stop and had to slap her.\u201cMengmeng!\u201dYe Miaomiao\u2019s shout was drowned out by a louder sound. Before everybody could see what happened, Shangguan Feng was sprawled on the floor, the desk tipping so that somebody\u2019s breakfast fell onto him.The classroom quieted down, the smell of braised beef in sauce suffusing the air.Under the strange atmosphere, Ming Shu naturally took back her gesture of an overarm throw, brushing her hands with a smile on her face as if to clean dirt off them. No dislike could be seen on her face, but could be greatly discerned from her behavior.I\u2019m so hungry that I almost have no energy to hit people!\u201c\u2026\u201d Ye Miaomiao was silent and cried in her mind, Oh my god! What happened to Mengmeng in just one night?She beat Shangguan Feng\u2026It was unbelievable!Others gulped harshly, not daring to breathe loudly. What happened this morning surprised them all greatly.\u201cA\u2019Feng\u2026\u201d Jin Yuqi snapped out of it first and ran to Shangguan Feng, reaching out her hands to hold him. \u201cAre you okay? Is Lu Meng crazy? Why did she hit you suddenly?\u201dShangguan Feng was muddled because of the overarm throw, his face becoming unhappier because of the smell on him. Struggling to stand up, he looked at Ming Shu the way he\u2019d look at an enemy.Ming Shu squinted at Jin Yuqi. \u201cI just hit him. If you can\u2019t accept that, hit back for him.\u201dWhat\u2019s the matter with hitting him? If I had energy, I would hit you too. Buy one, get one free. I must get Hatred Points.Jin Yuqi hesitated, looking terrible. She was an elegant lady, how could she fight with others.Ming Shu snorted and glanced at the displeased-looking Shangguan Feng. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Liushui. I\u2019m hungry.\u201dHearing Ming Shu call her, Ye Miaomiao was jolted from her astonished state and looked at Ming Shu, who had walked to the door. She caught up to her quickly, saying, \u201cMengmeng, what else do you want to eat? You\u2019re sick. You should have medicine!\u201dMengmeng must be muddled because of her illness.But why am I so happy?Shangguan Feng is terrible to Mengmeng. He deserves it.\u2026Ming Shu had decided to eat, but was dragged to the infirmary by Ye Miaomiao. After a check, her temperature surprised the school doctor. \u201cYou have a serious fever, why did you still come to school?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d This body is so weak.The school doctor helped Ming Shu with a fluid infusion and Ye Miaomiao went to ask for leave for her. The doctor was busy for a while and then left, leaving Ming Shu alone in the infirmary.Ming Shu lay in bed, bored. Maybe there was some medicine that made people sleepy in this fluid, because Ming Shu felt sleepy.Because of her serious cold, Ming Shu felt that her body was heavy. While she was sleeping, she felt that she was crushed by something and almost couldn\u2019t breathe.A slight sound rang out beside Ming Shu\u2019s ear; she returned to herself at once. Narrowing her eyes, she looked to the left and saw a boy in uniform searching the cupboard where the school doctor kept the medicine.Ming Shu shook her dizzy head and sat up. \u201cHey.\u201dThe boy turned his head; a handsome face entered Ming Shu\u2019s sight. He looked like a star, practically shining.\u2026 He\u2019s familiar. Where did I meet him?Ah, right. The student ID last night.It\u2019s him.Turning back his head as if nothing had happened, the boy student put two bottles into his bag, closed the cupboard, and walked toward Ming Shu. Then, leaning against the bed and looking at Ming Shu, he bent down gradually. A strange smell surrounded Ming Shu. \u201cLu Meng, what did you see just now?\u201d\u201cYou stealing medicine.\u201dThe student\u2019s mouth turned up, his face becoming evil immediately. \u201cLu Meng, are you sure?\u201dMing Shu smiled back and moved away to distance herself from him. Blinking her eyes, she asked, \u201cDo you have any food?\u201dHis mouth quivered slightly in shock.The second time\u2026\u201cNo.\u201d He stood up, heaving his bag, and squinted at Ming Shu from his greater height. \u201cLu Meng, if you dare to tell others what happened just now\u2026\u201dHe looked at Ming Shu meaningfully, then left through the window, disappearing from Ming Shu\u2019s sight.\u201c\u2026\u201d How dare you be so cocky without any food!Liked it?

So it was likely they didn\u2019t see each other even though they were in the same school.Well, let it go. Find food first.Because of her fever, Ming Shu rested for several days, during which the fact that Ming Shu had hit Shangguan Feng became well known to all in school.A love triangle.One taking away another\u2019s lover.These gossipy students had imagined a romantic fiction of several billion words.Ming Shu also admired Jin Yuqi, who hadn\u2019t been exposed and involved in negative news when she simultaneously dated several men.A real master!Ming Shu returned to school after recovering. But as soon as she went in, she was degraded by others; some male students even whistled at her roguishly.\u201cIt\u2019s shameless of her to tempt a man at such a young age. Fortunately, Shangguan knew her real nature or she would have succeeded.\u201d\u201cWe didn\u2019t know she was such a bad girl before. You may know a person\u2019s face but not their mind.\u201d\u201cShameless\u2026\u201d\u201cDisgusting\u2026\u201dEating baozi, Ming Shu glanced at the people who were whispering behind her back, feeling confused.Hearing some words, she took out the Host\u2019s cell phone, found the school\u2019s Postbar, and entered.#Amazing! The unknown truth of the straight-A student\u2026#The headline was eye-catching. What followed was a photo of the Host, whose profile was lovely, doing homework in the classroom. One side of the photo was exposed, so it might have been taken secretly.This photo revealed who the subject of this post was.Amazing. I should make headlines in this way.Finishing the baozi, Ming Shu licked her fingers and clicked that post.Claiming to be a student of grade one, the poster, a new account, didn\u2019t say nonsense and directly uploaded photos.Ming Shu scrolled down the post. The first photo was of doing homework in the classroom that was displayed on the home page. The second photo was normal too, a photo of the Host walking in the corridor.Ming Shu continued scrolling. The third photo changed suddenly\u2014under the dim lights, a girl was dragged into a bar and seemed to be kissed by someone.Ming Shu\u2019s eyes shone, the memory of what was going on in the photo coming to mind.One month ago, the Host discovered that Shangguan Feng and Jin Yuqi went to a bar together. So she followed them to the bar. The lighting was dim and the Host lost them after she entered.The bar was disorderly. The Host was stopped by several hooligans, which scared her greatly. Later, it seemed that a fight happened, but the Host didn\u2019t remember clearly.She only remembered that she was lying on a bench outside the school when she woke up, with nobody around. She didn\u2019t know how she came to the bench or what happened before.The following photos were vague. Under the dim lighting, the face of the Host couldn\u2019t be seen clearly and it seemed she was doing something with someone in the photo.And the following comments varied. Ming Shu read those interestedly.Mr. Crazy: I didn\u2019t expect this. We ordinary people can\u2019t be compared with such bold straight-A students.Ghost\u2019s Calling: I just said Lu Meng pretended to be innocent. She\u2019s a bad girl.Mango Mango: Oh my god\u2026 She is a goody-two-shoes at school. How could she do that? Are these pictures photoshopped by someone?Blue Love: What goody-two-shoes? She must be faking. She\u2019s so good at faking that we\u2019ve been fooled for such a long time and didn\u2019t even know. I thought she was a good student. One may know a person\u2019s face but not their mind. Horrible.Those words were not unpleasant to hear. Following those words, there were some people who criticized even more unpleasantly.\u201cMengmeng.\u201d Ye Miaomiao appeared behind Ming Shu suddenly. Putting her arm around Ming Shu\u2019s shoulders, she asked, \u201cDid you recover? Do you feel well?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Ming Shu put away her cell phone, smiling as usual. \u201cDid you eat breakfast?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Ye Miaomiao shook her head.\u201cWell, I\u2019m treating you.\u201d Ming Shu who had just finished some baozi invited Ye Miaomiao to breakfast, her eyes shining.There was a smile on her face and her voice was soft. Ye Miaomiao believed she saw a warm and holy light that could cure anyone around Lu Meng.Looking at Ming Shu, Ye Miaomiao lost her train of thought. After a while, she coughed and said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m about to use up my money and decided to eat less these days. Mengmeng, I\u2019ll eat breakfast with you for several days. When my father gives me pocket money, I\u2019ll treat you.\u201dYe Miaomiao was a straightforward person, agreeing without hesitation.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Breakfast, I\u2019m coming.Ye Miaomiao seemed to not know what had happened on the Postbar. On the way to the dining hall, she found that many people kept whispering behind Ming Shu\u2019s back. She stopped a student to ask and discovered what had happened.Ye Miaomiao put her phone on the table, angry. \u201cWriting a post with a new account, they must be afraid of being found out. If I knew who did it, I would teach him or her a lesson. It\u2019s so malicious to write a post slandering you.\u201dAnd those people were boring too, gossiping over some photos.She was angry to death!\u201cMengmeng, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll ask my friend to delete it.\u201d Ye Miaomiao took her cell phone and sent a message out quickly.\u201cThe porridge is going to get cold.\u201d Ming Shu pushed the porridge toward Ye Miaomiao. \u201cIt won\u2019t be delicious if it\u2019s cold.\u201d\u201cMengmeng!\u201d Ye Miaomiao shouted. \u201cAren\u2019t you angry? They slandered you.\u201dYe Miaomiao couldn\u2019t bear all the harsh comments. So unpleasant to read.She didn\u2019t know how students could say such unpleasant words.Ming Shu finished her porridge and wiped her mouth with a napkin. Facing Ye Miaomiao\u2019s confused and worried gaze, she whispered, \u201cOne can withstand slander so as to bear the crown.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Mengmeng seems to be different. Has her character changed now that she doesn\u2019t like Shangguan Feng anymore? Or has she been influenced by someone? Ye Miaomiao pondered to herself and finally asked gingerly, \u201cMengmeng, I want to ask you about you and Shangguan Feng\u2026 Er, I want to ask if you\u2026 still like him?\u201dMing Shu smiled slightly. \u201cI haven\u2019t decided to be in a relationship with another species.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Why does Mengmeng speak so interestingly now?\u201cLu Meng, how could you do that?\u201d Shangguan Feng rushed in with anger, asking Lu Meng sharply, \u201cDo you have any of the reserve and self-respect girls should have?\u201dBecause of Shangguan Feng\u2019s sudden appearance and loud question, the students who were eating in the dining hall looked at Ming Shu with scorn.Resting her chin in her hands and tilting her head, Ming Shu looked at Shangguan Feng. He resembled an angry boyfriend who found out his girlfriend was having a love affair.Where does the fool come from to perform like this?Pa!The sound rang through the dining hall. Patting the table, Ming Shu stood up. \u201cShangguan, who are you to ask me what I\u2019ve done? My father, or my mother?\u201dLiked it?

What qualification or identity did he have to question her?But when he saw that picture, he couldn\u2019t help but get angry.\u201cLu Meng, although I don\u2019t like you, I always regarded you as my sister, hoping that you could be a good girl. How could you do that?\u201d Yes, although he wasn\u2019t her boyfriend, they grew up together and he was her brother.Thinking that he was her brother, Shangguan Feng would speak his mind.\u201cI didn\u2019t accuse you of making trouble out of nothing before because you\u2019re young. But what did you do recently? You fooled around in a bar with others at night, aren\u2019t you ashamed?\u201dOh, even though the Host fooled around in a bar at night, does it have anything to do with you?Do you think you are a celestial being? You\u2019re shameless!\u201cI don\u2019t deserve that. Don\u2019t regard me as your sister. I am afraid that I will anger you to death.\u201d Why didn\u2019t you say that you regarded the Host as a sister when you were ambiguously in a relationship with her?And now he questioned the Host when there were so many people around, and even directly claimed she was shameless. Ming Shu didn\u2019t think that Shangguan Feng really regarded the Host as a sister.If I had a brother like you, I would bury him in the soil so that he could grow up again.\u201cLu Meng, you really let me down.\u201d Shangguan Feng shook his head with disappointment on his face.He had thought that Lu Meng would explain herself to him, but now she just looked like a dead mouse that felt no cold.Ming Shu moved her wrists and shifted around, asking, \u201cAre you finished?\u201dSeeing that, Shangguan Feng stepped back unconsciously. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dThe girl opposite him answered with a smile, \u201cI want to exercise after breakfast.\u201d\u2026When Shangguan Feng was beaten by Ming Shu for the second time, he was sure this Lu Meng wasn\u2019t the one he knew. She might be crazy.\u201cWhy did you fight?\u201d The headmaster, holding a ruler, asked with a serious face.The two, one of whom was the the famous straight-A student, fought in the dining hall early in the morning.\u201cHeadmaster, I didn\u2019t fight,\u201d Ming Shu retorted, one hand up.\u201cI saw it in person. Do you want to deny it?\u201d The headmaster smacked his ruler against the table heavily, unable to restrain his anger. \u201cLu Meng, I thought you were a good student.\u201d\u201cWell, you thought that.\u201d Ming Shu coughed and smiled. \u201cHeadmaster, I really didn\u2019t fight.\u201dThe headmaster was so angry that the skin of his face even trembled. \u201cFine, you tell me what you did in the dining hall.\u201d\u201cHit people.\u201d I hit him just now, I didn\u2019t fight with him. Fighting will reduce my prestige and must be corrected.\u201cWhat\u2019s the different between fight and hit?\u201d the headmaster shouted loudly. He almost died from anger! \u201cDo you think hitting people is reasonable? Are you smiling? Don\u2019t smile!\u201dIs smiling against the law?I\u2019ll smile whenever I want!In the end, Ming Shu and Shangguan Feng were punished by the angry headmaster. Their punishment was to clean the playground for one week separately and write a self-criticizing paper.Covering his face, Shangguan Feng left the office with Ming Shu, asking in a deep voice, \u201cAre you satisfied? Lu Meng, no matter what you do, I won\u2019t like you anymore. You\u2019d better give up.\u201d\u201cWhat a coincidence. I won\u2019t like you neither.\u201d I won\u2019t like a bad man who can\u2019t even be compared to my snacks.Shangguan Feng thought Ming Shu was reluctant to admit that she still liked him.He was confused before about why she had changed greatly. Now he understood. She did it to attract his attention.Ming Shu passed Shangguan Feng briskly.\u2026Ye Miaomiao had asked her friend to delete that Post, but it had already been seen by many people. Besides, Shangguan Feng questioned Ming Shu in the dining hall, so this matter spread among the students.However, Ming Shu, who was involved, attended classes as if nothing had happened. Facing others\u2019 gossip, she could respond with a warm and lovely smile that made others fearful. They didn\u2019t dare gossip in her presence\u2026\u201cMengmeng, who do you think did that?\u201d When the teacher was writing on the blackboard and couldn\u2019t see the students, Ye Miaomiao asked Ming Shu in a lowered voice. She thought this matter and those pictures were strange\u2026But Ming Shu didn\u2019t want to talk about it. What could Ye Miaomiao do?The one involved was not worried but the standby was.\u201cExcept for Jin Yuqi, who would do that?\u201d Shangguan Feng questioned her this morning; obviously he wasn\u2019t responsible. Other than Shangguan Feng, only Jin Yuqi would do that.\u201cJin Yuqi?\u201d Ye Miaomiao\u2019s tone changed. \u201cMengmeng, how do you know that?\u201dMing Shu smiled at Ye Miaomiao, answering, \u201cYou guess.\u201dI guessed it. I don\u2019t know how I know that.After school in the afternoon, Ming Shu was about to clean the playground. Ye Miaomiao wanted to help her, but was refused by Ming Shu and left unwillingly.The playground was huge and Ming Shu didn\u2019t intend to clean it. She walked from one side to the other, where there was a grove. After school every day, Jin Yuqi would meet with another man there.Ming Shu decided to watch them. And she would destroy their date to win Hatred Points if there was any chance.[Guest, you could kidnap Jin Yuqi and lock her in the place where you were locked. It\u2019ll be no problem winning Hatred Points then and you also could avenge the Host.]\u201c\u2026\u201dThe Harmony System is instigating me again.I\u2019ve said I can\u2019t withstand any instigation.Does your behavior match your name?Does your conscience feel guilty?Ming Shu\u2019s eyes rolled and she asked, \u201cCan you provide me with any tools?\u201d[I could keep watch for you.]Ming Shu refused. \u201cUseless. Shut up.\u201dExcept instigating her, what\u2019s the else of this system?[\u2026]Ming Shu walked into the grove. In it was a lake that possessed water clear enough for the plants at the bottom to be visible.Several fish swam in it, sending ripples across the lake.Ming Shu saw that two people sat by the lake. The girl was looking at the boy and talking to him softly while the boy was holding a pen and drawing.The boy student was a dummy; he liked drawing and always came here. So Jin Yuqi came here too every day after school to talk to him, which touched the boy student greatly. Thus the boy student gradually fell in love with Jin Yuqi.Ming Shu squatted in the grove behind them, thinking about the Harmony System\u2019s suggestion.If she really kidnapped Jin Yuqi and locked her in the old teaching building\u2019s classroom, how much energy would she spend and how much food would she have to eat to replenish that energy?\u201cLu Meng, what are you looking at?\u201d A man appeared on one side of Ming Shu suddenly, a familiar voice ringing out beside her ear.Ming Shu turned her head and looked into the boy student\u2019s curious gaze. Instead of a uniform, he wore a T-shirt on which there was a fierce skull.\u201cIt\u2019s you again.\u201d Their first encounter might be coincidence. The second encounter might be fate. So what was the reason for this third encounter? \u201c\u2026 What\u2019s your purpose? Did you fall in love with my talent or beauty?\u201dOr do you want to murder me in order to inherit my snacks?Leaning against the tree, the boy student looked at Ming Shu with a slight smile on his face. \u201cLu Meng, you seem so confident.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talented.\u201d I am so confident. If you can\u2019t bear that, then hit me!\u201c\u2026\u201dHe really had never seen such a confident person.The man squatted beside the tree and asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dMing Shu moved to the side. \u201cWhat\u2019s your purpose?\u201dLiked it?

Only this time, she began to learn how to protect herself.Hidden beneath her smile, her strength was not obvious and couldn\u2019t be found easily if you didn\u2019t carefully look for it.\u201cBarking dogs seldom bite.\u201d Ming Shu smiled. The defensiveness disappeared, giving others a feeling of peace.Ming Shu took out a bag of egg rolls and opened it.The boy student looked Ming Shu up and down and deliberately moved closer to Ming Shu. \u201cDo you mean you can bite people?\u201dThey got closer to each other and Ming Shu held her egg rolls tightly without thought. Why did you scoot closer to me? Do you want to take away my snacks?The boy student laughed at Ming Shu\u2019s behavior. Why did this girl resemble a food-protecting cat?Ming Shu moved to the side, asking, \u201cDo I know you?\u201d\u201cPeople meet for the first time, then get to know each other on the second time, and make friends on the third time. Did you know we\u2019ve met for the third time now?\u201d\u201cFriend? Who wants to be your friend? Do you think you\u2019re a celestial being?\u201d Ming Shu moved further away, showing her dislike. I never make friends with people I don\u2019t know.The boy student wasn\u2019t annoyed and reminded her, \u201cLu Meng, the people you were looking at left.\u201dMing Shu looked over to the lake, finding that Jin Yuqi really had left. Only that boy student who was drawing remained.Holding her egg rolls, Ming Shu stood up and followed Jin Yuqi to the grove. The boy student who spoke with Ming Shu just now stayed for a while, watching the boy student beside the lake with a smile.When the boy student found Ming Shu again, she was eating egg rolls, squatting next to the passed-out Jin Yuqi.Hearing the footsteps, she looked up. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop? Why did you follow me?\u201d\u201cDid you kill her?\u201d The boy student stopped walking, looking at Jin Yuqi lying on the ground.\u201cDo you think I look like a murderer?\u201d Ming Shu pointed at herself with an egg roll, then quickly took it back and put it in her mouth, eating it.The boy student couldn\u2019t help laughing. Gesturing at Jin Yuqi with his chin, he asked, \u201cWell, what are you preparing to do?\u201d\u201cDoes what I\u2019m preparing to do have anything to do with you?\u201d Why he is so annoying?\u201cNow I\u2019m a witness. How about I call the police?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d I didn\u2019t kill anyone. Call the police if you want. I would only be considered for hurting a classmate and put in jail for several days at most. When I get out, I\u2019m still a hero. I\u2019m not afraid of that.\u201c\u2026\u201d Her response doesn\u2019t comply with common sense!Isn\u2019t she going to negotiate with me?Why is she eating so calmly?The boy student felt troubled for the first time, because Ming Shu was not only interesting but also a difficult conundrum to solve.\u201cLu Meng, did you have any trouble with her before?\u201d The boy student tried to be close to Ming Shu.But Ming Shu only squinted at him, a slight smile on her face. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t had any trouble with her, would I be having a party with her now?\u201dHe is so annoying.I\u2019ll kidnap him too if he\u2019s going to talk all the time.Her voice was gentle, but the man heard mockery in her words.\u201cLu Meng, actually I can help you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your purpose?\u201d Fuck. I knew he had ulterior motives. He must want to kill me so that he can inherit my snacks.The boy student smiled, his voice filling the quiet grove. \u201cLu Meng, I have no motivation. I just think that you\u2019re funny and want to help you\u2026 En, I think you need help.\u201dFunny?What the fuck?Am I for you to play with?Am I something you can do for fun?Mindless!\u201cAre you going or not?\u201d Ming Shu pointed at the man with an egg roll, then took it back to eat after only a second and pointed at him with her finger instead. \u201cI\u2019ll call the police if you don\u2019t leave.\u201dYou have delayed me. You\u2019re so annoying.The boy student felt confused. Why do you want to call the police?Under the boy student\u2019s confused gaze, Ming Shu took out Jin Yuqi\u2019s phone and pressed three numbers quickly, smiling at him. \u201cHello, I want to make a report. A man is being impolite to me. I am\u2026\u201dHe stepped forward quickly and took the phone away from Ming Shu. When he was about to hang up, he found that she didn\u2019t dial the number.\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a whooshing sound. A slender leg crossed the distance and hit the boy student in his private parts. It was so fast that the boy student had no time to respond and was hit by Ming Shu.Ah\u2014The boy student covered his private part unconsciously, clear agony on his handsome face. He said with pain, \u201cLu Meng, it\u2019s a pity that you\u2019re not an actress.\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect that Ming Shu would pretend to call the police in order to lure him closer\u2026\u201cIf you bother me again, I won\u2019t just kick you.\u201d Ming Shu bent down and looked into the man\u2019s eyes, smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t care what your purpose is. But you\u2019d better not make me angry. It will be horrible.\u201dShe didn\u2019t mind some fun and was not afraid of machinations either. The more entertaining it was, the more she liked it.But when she concentrated her attention on something, she really hated anyone who would talk around her all the time. Being hit was only a small punishment for those who chattered ceaselessly.Ming Shu took back Jin Yuqi\u2019s phone and went to kick him again. But the boy student, sweat beading his forehead from pain, caught her ankle and stopped her, warning Ming Shu, \u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t go overboard.\u201dThen Ming Shu took back her foot and left, dragging Jin Yuqi along.Seeing what Ming Shu was doing, people would believe a horror movie was being filmed.The boy student looked at Ming Shu\u2019s back, the corner of his mouth trembling. In his memory, Lu Meng was different from now. She was the straight-A student, a good girl, and had never argued with anybody.But this woman was an actress. Maybe she pretended to be good in the past.\u2026Having been delayed in the grove for a while, Ming Shu, dragging Jin Yuqi, arrived at the old teaching building when it was getting dark. On the way, she didn\u2019t encounter any students. Then she threw Jin Yuqi into a classroom and locked the door.After that, she didn\u2019t leave, but ate outside the classroom, leaning against the window.The sky gradually became dark. A sound came from the classroom. At first, it was Jin Yuqi\u2019s painful cry. She had been dragged around for a long time. It would be strange if she didn\u2019t feel sore.Then the sound of desks and chairs being moved emerged.Jin Yuqi remembered that when she left the grove, she was knocked silly. She didn\u2019t know what had happened after and now woke up here.She knew where she was, though. It was the old teaching building.The place she fooled Lu Meng into entering. But why was she here?Who?Who brought her here?Jin Yuqi searched for her cell phone in her pocket but didn\u2019t find it.Where is my cell phone?It\u2019s disappeared?Leaning against a desk, Jin Yuqi looked around. But with the weak lighting, she could only see the outline of desks and chairs in the classroom.The door was locked and she couldn\u2019t open it even with great effort. Then she looked out the window and discovered that there seemed to be a person there.\u201cWho\u2019s outside?\u201d Jin Yuqi shouted, rushing to the window and looking out through the glass. \u201cWhy did you kidnap me? Who are you?\u201dThe person outside turned slowly. The light of a cell phone illuminated her face, pale against the darkness.\u201cAh!\u201d Jin Yuqi was so frightened she fell down. But soon she realized who was outside and became angry at once. \u201cLu Meng, what are you doing? Let me out!\u201dLiked it?

Obstructing the sudden strong light, Jin Yuqi stood up hardily, not caring for her image now. \u201cLu Meng, what do you want to do? Let me out.\u201d\u201cLet you out?\u201d Ming Shu answered with a smile, which looked strange in the darkness. \u201cNo. It cost me great effort to bring you to here.\u201dWasting food is shameful.Jin Yuqi rushed to the window. Her face was scrunched up under the beam of the flashlight. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is illegal. Lu Meng, as long as you let me out, I won\u2019t tell others about this.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Ming Shu was a little confused. \u201cYou know it\u2019s illegal?\u201dJin Yuqi was amazed and had an unfortunate feeling at the same time.Looked around the classroom quickly, Jin Yuqi thought\u2014she fooled Lu Meng into coming here in Shangguan Feng\u2019s name and didn\u2019t show up. Lu Meng shouldn\u2019t know the truth.But now Lu Meng locked her in here too, which meant she did know the truth.No\u2026Gripping the bars of the window, she cried with red-rimmed eyes, \u201cLu Meng, I know you don\u2019t like me and think I took away A\u2019Feng. But you have to know love can\u2019t be forced. A\u2019Feng doesn\u2019t like you. Even if you were together, you wouldn\u2019t be happy.\u201dAmazing. She starts acting more readily than me.\u201cIt has nothing to do with me.\u201d It had nothing to do with Ming Shu who Shangguan Feng liked. Ming Shu knocked on the steel bars, saying, \u201cYou\u2019d better stay here without resistance. Maybe one of your boyfriends will come to rescue you.\u201dSeeing that Ming Shu was about to leave, Jin Yuqi was extremely worried and shouted loudly.\u201cLu Meng!\u201dBecause she had shouted so loudly, her voice broke, making it sound like a ghost\u2019s cry in this vacant teaching building.Ming Shu turned her head and illuminated her face with the phone. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMing Shu stopped as soon as she was called by Jin Yuqi, which was different from what happened in fiction and TV shows. Jin Yuqi was surprised for several seconds. Catching the steel bars, Jin Yuqi said angrily, \u201cLu Meng, do you think A\u2019Feng would like you if he knew you locked me in here?\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 I should kill you now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Was there any relation? Why couldn\u2019t she understand?\u201cBut I haven\u2019t been full today. I have no energy.\u201d Ming Shu was a little sad. She almost used up her energy.\u201c\u2026\u201dMing Shu wanted to kill her?Jin Yuqi was shocked by Ming Shu\u2019s answer. She loosened her grip on the steel bars and stepped back quickly, looking at Ming Shu as if looking at an evil villain. Is she really Lu Meng?\u201cLu Meng\u2026 come back.\u201d Seeing that Ming Shu really left, Jin Yuqi hit the bars heavily and shouted, \u201cLu Meng, come back! Let me out.\u201dBut Ming Shu walked further and further away, disappearing from Jin Yuqi\u2019s sight in the end.No matter how Jin Yuqi shouted, Ming Shu didn\u2019t respond to her.Lu Meng\u2026She did something like this to her.\u201cHey.\u201d A person appeared outside the window suddenly. Ming Shu\u2019s voice rang out again.\u201cAh!\u201d Jin Yuqi was frightened enough to cry, heart beating fast and cold sweat covering her back.One will be frightened to death if they\u2019re frightened by others on purpose.\u201cLu Meng, what do you want to do?\u201d Jin Yuqi shouted furiously.\u201cI just want to ask you a question. Don\u2019t be so jittery, calm down.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s voice was pure and could soften others\u2019 hearts. But all Jin Yuqi could hear was scorn. Ming Shu laughed at her from outside. How could she calm down as Ming Shu wanted?Who could be calm now?\u201cDid you write that post on the school\u2019s Postbar?\u201d\u201cWhat post? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Jin Yuqi denied it quickly. \u201cLu Meng, let me out now, or I won\u2019t let you off when I get out.\u201dJin Yuqi warned Ming Shu.\u201cIt\u2019s likely that you will let me off if I let you out now.\u201d Ming Shu smiled slightly. \u201cJin Yuqi, are you a fool? Am I?\u201dDo you think that I am a three-year-old kid who could be fooled so easily?\u201cLu Meng, no matter what you do, A\u2019Feng won\u2019t like you. He only likes me.\u201d Lu Meng cared for Shangguan Feng the most. Even though her character had changed, she wouldn\u2019t dislike him at once. She must be faking that.Ming Shu smiled slightly, saying, \u201cJin Yuqi, there are three problems you need to fix on your post. Firstly, the photos are not clear enough. People couldn\u2019t see any distinguishing features. I could claim that the person in the photos isn\u2019t me. Secondly, your language is not grandiose and doesn\u2019t attract attention. If you were a paparazzi, you would starve with your poor choice of words. Finally, if you decide to write a post to slander others in the future, please don\u2019t use your own cell phone.\u201dMing Shu showed Jin Yuqi\u2019s cell phone to her, the browser history displayed on the screen.Jin Yuqi\u2019s terrible-looking face was illuminated by the light of the phone. She wanted to grab her phone, but failed because Ming Shu\u2019s hand moved.\u201cYes, I did. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Jin Yuqi sneered. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t fooled around in that bar, I wouldn\u2019t have taken those photos. Don\u2019t you want to admit what you\u2019ve done? I just told the truth, I didn\u2019t slander you.\u201dJin Yuqi moved closer to the bars, saying resentfully, \u201cLu Meng, you\u2019re a bad girl too. Although you pretend to be innocent, you\u2019re evil inside.\u201dMing Shu threw the phone inside after she removed the SIM card, smiling calmly and saying, \u201cOnly those who are evil would think others are evil too. Jin Yuqi, I advise you to visit a psychologist, you might be cured.\u201dSince they knew each other\u2019s true nature and there was nobody else here, Jin Yuqi didn\u2019t pretend and said, \u201cLu Meng, I won\u2019t let you off.\u201d\u201cBring it on!\u201d Ming Shu opened her hand, smiling. \u201cBut you have to escape first. How about jumping down? This is the fifth floor. If you jump down, your arms or legs would be broken at most. You wouldn\u2019t die.\u201dIf it was not serious that her arms or legs might be broken, what was serious?Jin Yuqi was extremely furious inside. But she restrained her anger and avoided irritating Lu Meng because she was at a disadvantage now. If she irritated Lu Meng and got killed, she would lose everything.When she got out, she would deal with Lu Meng.She didn\u2019t believe that she couldn\u2019t overcome Lu Meng when she knew what would happen in the future.Seeing that Jin Yuqi abruptly fell silent, Ming Shu just snorted and briskly left.I\u2019m a little hungry. Gonna go eat something.Ming Shu went down the stairs. There were no lights so she had to use the phone to illuminate her way. When she got to the third floor, a hand suddenly emerged from the darkness and dragged her into the shadows.Her back rested against the cold wall and a warm body hovered near her.Ming Shu was already making to attack.\u201cStop. It\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why is it you again!\u201d You\u2019re so annoying. What do you want?\u201cHush!\u201d Putting his finger on Ming Shu\u2019s lips, the boy student moved closer to her.Liked it?

Ming Shu could even hear his heartbeat, smooth and powerful and unhurried.Ming Shu slapped the boy student\u2019s hands away and kicked him.How dare you be impolite to me!\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The boy was a little angry.Tap-tap-tap\u2014The sound of high-heeled shoes came from the stairs, echoing up the stairwell. The sound cut into the silence, extremely frightening.The boy student didn\u2019t dare speak, holding his breath.\u201cThe Upper Government has been extremely strict in relation to crime recently. I suggest we stop for some time to avoid any trouble.\u201d A woman\u2019s voice emerged. Then another set of footsteps could be heard, sounding like a man\u2019s.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If we get into trouble, those who support us and deal with us would be in trouble too. So they would protect us,\u201d the man said fearlessly, his voice deep.But the woman was still worried, saying, \u201cI feel distraught recently. I don\u2019t know whether something is going to happen.\u201d\u201cYou just think too much. Don\u2019t dwell.\u201dTheir footsteps echoed up the stairs, the sound of their chatter fading till it disappeared altogether.After waiting for a while, the boy student moved back several steps, unable to see Ming Shu\u2019s expression clearly in the darkness. He rested his hands against the wall and kabe-doned Ming Shu instinctively. \u201cLu Meng, why did you come here?\u201d\u201cTo abandon a corpse.\u201dMing Shu hit his arm unkindly. Her thin arms and legs seemed to be powerless. But actually they were as powerful as a man\u2019s when she struck. The boy frowned in pain.Had she eaten too much spinach?The boy student didn\u2019t believe that Ming Shu had killed someone. He thought that she might have locked that girl here. \u201cWhich floor did you lock her in?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. You want to rescue her?\u201d Ming Shu walked downstairs, saying with smile on her face, \u201cIf you want to rescue her, you\u2019d better find her yourself. It\u2019s insincere of you to ask me.\u201dThe boy student glanced upstairs, then followed Ming Shu. \u201cDid you hear the conversation just now?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCan we have a good chat?\u201cDon\u2019t you think that their voices are familiar?\u201d The boy student continued asking questions.\u201cOh.\u201d What\u2019s the use of being familiar with that? It can\u2019t be eaten.The boy was speechless. He walked besides Ming Shu, hands in his pockets. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky that you met me just now. If you met them instead, you would\u2019ve died without knowing why.\u201d\u201cEveryone will die at some point. No need to be nervous about death.\u201d I\u2019m going to have an evening snack later. I\u2019m a little hungry.\u201c\u2026\u201d Was it his imagination that she didn\u2019t listen to him just now? \u201cI suggest you not come to the old teaching building in the future. It\u2019s dangerous here.\u201dDangerous?I don\u2019t know how to spell dangerous.\u2026Ming Shu left the school by way of jumping over the wall and found a place to eat an evening snack. Narrowing her eyes, she looked at the boy student in front of her, asking with a smile, \u201cWhy did you follow me?\u201dFollowing a female student at night, do you want to kill me for snacks?\u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t you think we should have a good talk?\u201d The boy raised his eyebrows at Ming Shu.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201dThe boy leaned forward, his handsome face suddenly magnified in Ming Shu\u2019s pupils. \u201cLu Meng, I have seen you beat a classmate and saved your life indirectly. Shouldn\u2019t you invite me out to eat to express your gratitude?\u201d\u201cDid I beg you to see that? Don\u2019t you know to close your eyes?\u201d Ming Shu smiled.\u201c\u2026\u201d Was this an option?Why was this girl\u2019s answer different from normal people\u2019s?Ming Shu moved all the food closer to herself, leaving nothing to the boy.Seeing what she had done, the boy student felt funny. Why did she like to protect her food so fiercely?He stood up and left his seat suddenly.Ming Shu thought that the annoying boy decided to leave. But after a moment, he came back with a plate of cake in hand. He gave it to Ming Shu, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201dMing Shu studied the cake for a while, then studied the boy for a while.He controlled his evil aura, looking at her with a smile.Taking the edge of the plate, Ming Shu pulled it toward herself gradually, her eyes shining.It seemed that the boy student\u2019s smile even reached his eyebrows. She\u2019s so lovely.The cake was about to enter Ming Shu\u2019s vicinity, but Ming Shu pushed it away suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019re kind to me out of nowhere, you must be planning to wrong me. Don\u2019t think you can bribe me with just one cake.\u201dAt least two cakes!Ah! I can\u2019t be bribed even with two cakes.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe boy student left again and bought several cakes of different flavors to Ming Shu. He didn\u2019t believe that she would refuse again.Ming Shu licked her lips. The strong smell of the cake spread, which made her stomach growl.Struggling for a while, she refused regretfully in the end.I have my principles.\u201c\u2026\u201dThat she struggled to refuse the cakes even though she really wanted them was lovely too.[Guest, why did you refuse?] The Harmony System thought that she would accept.Ming Shu said in her heart, How can we sell our souls for food?[\u2026 Don\u2019t beat around the bush.] Please consider the feelings of the Harmony System.This guy has ulterior motives concerning me.Don\u2019t ask me how I know that.I\u2019ve been chased by goblins for such a long time. If I can\u2019t tell that much, I have lived in vain.Thinking about those goblins that wanted to eat her, Ming Shu felt annoyed.I\u2019m not a Calabash Brother.[\u2026] Its Guest didn\u2019t accept just any food from anybody. For example, she didn\u2019t accept food from Jiang Xun. But she ate when other people gave her food.And in this plane, she would eat food provided by Ye Miaomiao. But when it came to this boy student, she would refuse.[But why did you ask him for food before?] The Harmony System remembered that.\u201cMaybe I was foolish because of hunger at that time.\u201d The first time, she just woke up in an old teaching building, extremely hungry and would have even devoured a whole person.The second time, when she was in the infirmary, she was also extremely hungry.The most important point was that she didn\u2019t feel this boy had ulterior motives at those times. She only felt that when they met for the third time.[\u2026] Since the Guest said it like that, what else it could say?[Guest, the Extension Task: Reveal the school\u2019s evildoings.] Releasing a task to calm down , the Harmony System thought.Reveal the school\u2019s evildoings?Didn\u2019t we come here to get Hatred Points? Why are we doing this now?Wasn\u2019t the school meant to educate people? Are there any evildoings?Horrible.But\u2026[You could win Hatred Points from everybody.] The Harmony system added. [But Guest, don\u2019t offend other people to win Hatred Points. You can only win Hatred Points by completing my tasks. Normal Hatred Points are useless.]That sentence destroyed Ming Shu\u2019s excitement.She concentrated on eating and was unwilling to talk to the Harmony System, not answering whether she would accept the Extension Task or not.After waiting for a while, the Harmony System found that Ming Shu was still unwilling to speak to it.[Guest, if you complete the tasks well, I will give you more Extension Tasks to win Hatred Points.] The system lost Ming Shu\u2019s interest, then gave her another motivator.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Do you think you are worthy of your name, Harmony System?You encourage me to do these bad things.Am I a scumbag?[I have told you before. You could regard these worlds as game settings. These people are fictitious people only.] You can\u2019t even be called a human being when you\u2019re about to do bad things.Liked it?

I\u2019ll consider that when I have time.Ming Shu looked at the boy student who didn\u2019t leave and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t ask me.\u201d She didn\u2019t ask for his name for such a long time and didn\u2019t call him either. She looked at him as if looking at a stranger; she must not know him.So much nonsense, forget my question.Ming Shu stood up and checked out. Then she went straight to the cake shop next door. The boy student followed her speechlessly.He had to refresh his knowledge of the little girl.\u201cMy name is Cheng Yan. Cheng is the same as in He chu shi gui cheng* . Yan is the same as in Yan yan mu xing kuan .\u201d He was famous at school so he was confident that she must have heard his name before.But\u2026Ming Shu only glanced at him with a strange gaze.Everybody would think he was a poor student when they saw him for the first time. Why did he introduce himself in such a genteel way?Horrible.It\u2019s so horrible.Cheng Yan didn\u2019t know what Ming Shu was looking at but he felt that her gaze was odd. He coughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201dMing Shu stopped looking at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know my name?\u201dMindless. Why ask again since you know my name?\u201cWe could get to know each other again.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re bothersome.\u201dCheng Yan was confused by that label. Why was he bothersome?Cheng Yan walked with Ming Shu on the street. He saw that foodie Shu ate from one street to another. Finally he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cLu Meng, is your stomach a bottomless hole?\u201dHer stomach still didn\u2019t bulge even when she ate so much. Where did that food go?Ming Shu forced a smile for him. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten your food, why do you care so much? Did you fall in love with me?\u201dCheng Yan\u2019s eyes rolled and he answered, \u201cI wonder whether you could give me a chance.\u201dWhat the fuck. Did he really fall in love with me? Ming Shu thought.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t afford me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Normal people really can\u2019t afford her if she eats so much, Cheng Yan thought.\u2026When Ming Shu returned to the gated community, she found that Cheng Yan still followed her. She even wanted to hit people. \u201cCan\u2019t you stop?\u201dCheng Yan faced forward, playing innocent. \u201cI live here too.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCheng Yan moved closer to Ming Shu and asked, \u201cSo, Lu Meng, how about you consider me? I can afford you.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019m not interested in people who have ulterior motives.Cheng Yan followed Ming Shu to the community which was a community for rich people. Although the Host\u2019s family was not a top family, it still was a rich family. But Cheng Yan lived here too. Was his family rich?It was unknown to Ming Shu. The original plot didn\u2019t mention that and the Host didn\u2019t know either.But his name, Cheng Yan, was a little familiar. The Host might have heard it.Cheng Yan accompanied Ming Shu to her house. \u201cLu Meng, if you change your mind, you can tell me at any time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Mindless .Ming Shu entered the house and closed the door loudly.Cheng Yan\u2019s smile became smaller and his gaze darkened. The light around him mixed and he was cast in shadow.\u2026The next day.As soon as Ming Shu opened the door, Cheng Yan\u2019s face entered her view. He wore a uniform today too. Even though the uniform was normal, when it was worn by him, it shone as if reflecting golden light.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Ming Shu bit into a sandwich and her smile almost couldn\u2019t be maintained. Did he decided to follow her all the time?\u201cGood morning, Lu Meng.\u201d Cheng Yan took out a rose as if playing a trick and showed it to Ming Shu.It can\u2019t be eaten, useless.Ming Shu didn\u2019t want to talk to him and passed by him, a sandwich in her mouth.No matter what was happening, she always smiled. Even when she was eating, she still kept her smile, which attracted others.Cheng Yan lost his mind because of her smile. When Ming Shu walked past, he returned to himself and took back his hands, feeling no embarrassment. Then he turned around and followed Ming Shu, saying with a smile, \u201cLu Meng, you were impolite just now.\u201dMing Shu turned her head and said, \u201cCheng Yan, good morning.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Why didn\u2019t she respond like others?On the way from the community to the school, Cheng Yan found her character was strange. Her smile was soft sometimes, bright other times. But one couldn\u2019t know whether her feelings changed from her smile.Maybe the one thing that didn\u2019t change was that she smiled all the time.She looked like a light-hearted girl, radiating a youthful glow.On the way, there were kids going to school, white collars who were in a hurry, and grandmothers who were going to buy groceries. They were all busy and walked quickly. Only she was at ease and walked leisurely among them.Cheng Yan felt strange and didn\u2019t talk to her until they arrived at school.\u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t go to the old teaching building again. Next time, you won\u2019t be as lucky as yesterday.\u201d Before they entered school, Cheng Yan warned her again. Then he went in another direction and didn\u2019t go inside with Ming Shu.The old teaching building\u2026What\u2019s in there?According to the Host\u2019s memory, she had seen a ghost in the old teaching building. Was that really a ghost?Ming Shu went toward the classroom while thinking about it. But before she arrived, the headmaster appeared suddenly and angrily stopped her.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you clean the playground?\u201d The headmaster was very angry. \u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t think that you can do anything you want at school as long as your grades are good.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cI tell you, you must be punished when you make mistakes. That\u2019s a school rule. As a student, you must obey it. That I\u2019m strict to you now is good for you. When you work in society, all your mistakes will become great losses. No one will reason with you like I\u2019m doing now.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cToday after school, I will supervise you personally. If you don\u2019t clean again, I will deal with you.\u201dThe headmaster spoke quickly. It was as fast as pouring beans from a bamboo tube. Then he left.\u201c\u2026\u201d You should at least listen to my explanation.\u201cHeadmaster, who made you angry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more and more difficult to teach those students. They\u2019ll cause problems for you the second you don\u2019t pay attention to them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but they are children and naughty now. Don\u2019t get angry with them\u2026\u201dMing Shu looked over there. A woman in a cream-colored dress was talking to the headmaster, hair wavy and looking pretty young.That voice\u2026It was the same as that woman\u2019s yesterday.\u201cMengmeng!\u201d Ye Miaomiao rushed out from somewhere and hugged Ming Shu\u2019s arm. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dMing Shu pulled her hands away and pointed at where the headmaster was with her chin, asking, \u201cWho is she?\u201dYe Miaomiao looked and answered, \u201cShe might be the English teacher in the Junior Department. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNothing, I was just asking.\u201dNote: He chu shi gui cheng and Yan yan mu xing kuan are verses.Liked it?

Others did things as usual. What they talked about most still was the photos of Ming Shu on the Postbar.Although they had been deleted, others couldn\u2019t control their curiosity to gossip. Even some boy students asked Ming Shu when they had the chance.\u201cLu Meng, did you really date for money outside?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ye Miaomiao pushed away the boy student who asked Ming Shu, warning, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, if I hear that again, I won\u2019t let you off.\u201dYe Miaomiao was the famous tigress in class and some boy students didn\u2019t dare to displease her.\u201cHah, it\u2019s been exposed. Why can\u2019t we talk about it. If you don\u2019t want us to talk about it, you could choose not to do it. Since you did it, stop pretending to be innocent. Shameless.\u201d A girl student ahead snorted.\u201cYou say that again!\u201d\u201cLiushui.\u201d Ming Shu stopped Ye Miaomiao who was about to rush to that girl student.\u201cMengmeng, I\u2019ll help you deal with them.\u201d Ye Miaomiao was unhappy. Those people only knew how to slander others. Her friend Mengmeng didn\u2019t do that.\u201cDeal with us? Ye Miaomiao, who are you? Are we wrong?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If she hadn\u2019t done that, would we say that? She is shameless. Bitch!\u201dIn the past, Lu Meng was the straight-A student in class. Her appearance was lovely and many boy students liked her, so others envied her. Now they were told that Lu Meng had done shameless things. Of course they would slander her plenty.Jealousy makes people crazy.Ye Miaomiao became angry at once and threw books at them. \u201cWho is shameless? Who is a bitch? Who are you cursing?\u201d\u201cFuck!\u201dYe Miaomiao\u2019s behavior irritated those girls. They threw books back.A chaotic battle took place in the classroom.\u201c\u2026\u201d What the hell? Can\u2019t you let me say something? Why do all of you like to perform? Ming Shu thought.Pa\u2014A book came from the side and knocked down Ming Shu\u2019s bag of nuts she had placed on the corner of her desk. The nuts fell to the ground and scattered everywhere. Then they were trampled.\u201c\u2026\u201dMing Shu was a freak. Others could hit her, but her snacks couldn\u2019t be touched.\u2026Ten minutes later.All the girls who fought just now lay on the floor. Ming Shu didn\u2019t care whether you were a girl or a boy. As long as you wasted her snacks, she wouldn\u2019t let you off.Ye Miaomiao and the other bystanders were extremely shocked.When did Mengmeng became so fierce in fighting? Ye Miaomiao thought.Ming Shu stood on a chair, squinting at those who lay on the floor. \u201cApologize to Liushui.\u201d\u201cShe fought us first. Why should we apologize to her?\u201d One of the girl students stared at Ming Shu. Why is Lu Meng so fierce now? It\u2019s painful.Ming Shu raised her fist with a smile. That girl\u2019s face became pale at once in fear. She lightly bit her lower lip, tears pooling in her eyes. \u201cS-sorry.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cSorry.\u201dUnder Ming Shu\u2019s threat, the other girls apologized unwillingly.Ye Miaomiao felt touched. I know Mengmeng is kind to me.\u201cWell, the second question.\u201d Ming Shu unclenched her fist and stretched two fingers, glancing at the girls. \u201cWho knocked down my nuts just now?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What? the girl students lying on the floor thought.Nuts?It had been chaotic just now. Who cared about those nuts?Those girl students wanted to answer that they didn\u2019t know. But seeing Ming Shu\u2019s smiling face, they felt frightened for no reason and didn\u2019t dare to answer that they didn\u2019t know.When they hesitated, a noise came from outside. Then an angry shout emerged.\u201cLu Meng, what are you doing!\u201d The angry shout from the headmaster broke the strange atmosphere of the classroom. \u201cCome down.\u201dHe didn\u2019t blame her for what she had done before. Now she had hit her classmates in school. She was so unruly.Ming Shu was asked to the office and was put to blame. Those students who had been hit demanded that Ming Shu be given a major demerit. However, Ming Shu just looked at the headmaster without care.The headmaster thought that Ming Shu was a straight-A student and could make the school proud. He had decided to speak for her. But he became angrier and angrier at Ming Shu\u2019s attitude and gave her a demerit.The time she had to spend cleaning the playground increased to half a month.Those girl students were complacent and thought, Why did she hit people? She deserves that.But soon they realized this matter couldn\u2019t be solved so easily. After school, they were stopped by Ming Shu at once.\u201cLu Meng, if you hit us again, we\u2019ll tell the headmaster. Then you\u2019ll be expelled,\u201d one of the girls said courageously.Ming Shu leaned against the door frame with one hand and swung her bangs beautifully, one corner of her mouth turned up. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. I\u2019m a reasonable person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What you\u2019re doing now doesn\u2019t show that you\u2019re a reasonable person. These girl students were silent and thought this to themselves.\u2026At the nuts shop.Ming Shu took her nuts and left, followed by the group of girls, who were looking at each other and feeling strange. She turned back and faced them. They stepped back and said with alarm, \u201cWhat else do you want to do?\u201dMing Shu just smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t waste food next time.\u201dThe girls watched Ming Shu until she disappeared at the end of the street. One of them swallowed saliva with a gulp and said, \u201cDo you think Lu Meng is possessed by evil?\u201d\u201cYes, I had that feeling already. Lu Meng didn\u2019t smile like that before. I feel afraid when I look at her smile.\u201d\u201cYes, I have the same feeling. Lu Meng is being really odd recently\u2026\u201dShe asked them to compensate her nuts and hit them before just because they had knocked them down. Did normal people do that? If she wasn\u2019t possessed by evil, what else could cause her strange behavior?\u201cI\u2019m a little afraid.\u201dThe girls looked at each other and hugged themselves, rubbing their arms. They all seemed to be fearful.\u2026That Lu Meng had fought with others in class was the leading news on campus again. Many people wondered whether Lu Meng was possessed by evil. How could she do all these things that didn\u2019t add up with her image?Some people said Ming Shu had been driven crazy because of what happened on Postbar before.But this guess had been proved wrong. She didn\u2019t seemed to be crazy. Her logic was present. She was normal. But her smile was frightening sometimes.And those girl students who had been hit by Ming Shu didn\u2019t dare to irritate her. It was like she was a cursed object and they didn\u2019t dare come near anymore.That Ming Shu had to clean the playground caused the headmaster pain. After school, Ming Shu left quickly and he couldn\u2019t catch up with her.The headmaster had no other choice. He had to wait outside the classroom before classes were finished.\u201cHeadmaster, can\u2019t you let me off?\u201d How could I clean the playground? It doesn\u2019t match with my identity.The headmaster was serious and said, \u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t joke with me.\u201dAlas!Now even a smile is illegal.\u201cWhy are you still standing here? Let\u2019s go. Today I won\u2019t leave until you finish cleaning.\u201d Children are more and more rebellious now. Why did she, a straight-A student, change so greatly? I must educate her well.I won\u2019t let her go astray.Ming Shu\u2019s eyes rolled, saying, \u201cHello, Headmaster.\u201dThe headmaster remained still.\u201c\u2026\u201d Headmaster, why must we hurt each other? Ming Shu thought.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ming Shu cleaned for a while and didn\u2019t cover more than three square meters.Ah, I\u2019m so hungry!\u201cLu Meng, you\u2019re cleaning the playground?\u201d Cheng Yan, with two classmates, came from the direction of the headmaster. He raised his eyebrows at Ming Shu and said, \u201cWhen will you finish if you clean that way?\u201dThe two boy students beside Cheng Yan stared into each other\u2019s eyes and then looked at the girl student in front of them with curiosity. Our boss seems to be interested in her recently , they thought.Did he fall in love with the straight-A student?Boss, you\u2019re not in the same world!Ming Shu wanted to sweep these annoyances away.\u201cHeadmaster, he\u2019s bothering me about cleaning,\u201d Ming Shu shouted to the headmaster, who was playing on his cell phone.The headmaster looked up and saw Cheng Yan and two companions standing in front of Ming Shu. His face became gloomy at once. He walked toward them while shouting, \u201cCheng Yan, what are you doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Why do you complain as soon as you are displeased? Cheng Yan thought.Ming Shu leaned against the broom and looked at him with a smile. Because you bothered me into missing my snacks.\u201cHeadmaster, I want to help Lu Meng clean.\u201d Before the headmaster came close, Cheng Yan made this request.That shocked not only the headmaster but also his two companions.Has our boss taken something before coming out today?When had his worshipful hands wielded such a crude broom?\u201cCheng Yan, what do you want to do?\u201d The headmaster was confused. \u201cHow many times have you come to school this month? I\u2019m telling you, the school will expel you if you continue.\u201d\u201cSo I came today,\u201d Cheng Yan said. \u201cHeadmaster, it\u2019s getting late. Lu Meng is a girl, it will be dangerous when she goes home later. How about I clean for her.\u201dThe headmaster looked at the sky, then looked at the playground that Ming Shu hadn\u2019t cleaned past the first three square meters, and finally looked at Cheng Yan who recommended himself just now. He thought for a while and said, \u201cQuickly.\u201dCheng Yan winked at Ming Shu and ordered his companions, \u201cYou two, clean the playground.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d I just knew that our boss wouldn\u2019t clean the playground himself , the two thought.Ming Shu walked briskly through the playground, dragging the broom. Cheng Yan followed her closely. \u201cLu Meng, aren\u2019t you going to thank me?\u201d\u201cWhy are you doing this? Tell me.\u201d He\u2019s suddenly kind to me. He must have a purpose. I should protect my snacks, Ming Shu thought.\u2026 But the premise was that she had snacks now.I\u2019m hungry.\u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t be so indifferent. It\u2019s just help among classmates.\u201dMing Shu looked at him. Her eyes seemed to be full of water and glimmered softly, appearing warm. Under that gaze, Cheng Yan felt a little guilty.Why do I feel guilty? I\u2019ve done nothing!He coughed and said, \u201cLu Meng, I think you need a boyfriend. If you had a boyfriend, he would solve that problem for you today. So how about I be your boyfriend?\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d Ming Shu looked at the playground and said, \u201cI need a follower. Do you want to be my follower?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What follower? I said boyfriend! Boyfriend! Cheng Yan was a little crazy and shouted in his mind.Calm down!Don\u2019t be angry.Cheng Yan leaned forward and his expression became more serious. \u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t avoid my question. I\u2019m talking with you seriously.\u201dMing Shu put her hand against his chest and smiled slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity I don\u2019t like you.\u201dCheng Yan is strange.I won\u2019t be cheated by him.\u201cThat you don\u2019t like me now doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t like me in the future.\u201d Cheng Yan smiled and was very confident. \u201cI believe that you\u2019ll like me.\u201dMing Shu shook her head, smiling. \u201cConfidence is good. But don\u2019t be overconfident, or you\u2019ll suffer losses.\u201d\u201cHow do you know you won\u2019t like me without trying. Are you afraid of that?\u201dMing Shu smiled wider, saying, \u201cAfraid? There\u2019s nothing I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you dare agree with my suggestion?\u201d Cheng Yan thought that provoking Ming Shu would be useful. He moved closer to Ming Shu and asked, \u201cExcept that you\u2019re afraid of something, I can\u2019t think of any other reason.\u201dUnder Cheng Yan\u2019s provoking stare, Ming Shu smiled and answered, \u201cProvoking me is useless. I won\u2019t like you no matter what you say to me.\u201dI\u2019m not a person who is easily influenced by others.[Guest, you could agree with him.] The Harmony System instigated Ming Shu again. [Agree with him now and get rid of him later, you will earn his Hatred Points. This way, you could obtain many more Hatred Points. Then gathering one billion Hatred Points and opening a store won\u2019t be a distant dream. Guest, don\u2019t miss such a good opportunity.]Ah. Am I that kind of horrible woman?If I had the time to do that, I would like to eat more snacks.[\u2026] In the Guest\u2019s heart, what else is important besides snacks? Is there any chance I can refuse to cooperate with her? The Harmony System thought.I just want Hatred Points.Why is it so hard?Ming Shu could never be kind-hearted to those who had ulterior motives. While the headmaster was talking on the phone, she threw the broom aside and left.If Cheng Yan wants to sweep, just let him. I\u2019ll go chase my dream.Cheng Yan had a feeling of failure because of Ming Shu\u2019s direct refusal.Wasn\u2019t he handsome? He was confident in his looks. Those girls at school all shouted excitedly when they looked at him.Why didn\u2019t it work when he met Ming Shu?\u2026Since Jin Yuqi had been locked inside the old teaching building, she came to school again after three days. She looked very weak and glared at Ming Shu with great resentment. If looks could kill, Ming Shu would already have died many times.But Ming Shu didn\u2019t care about that. She looked at Jin Yuqi with her standard smile.Was she angry? Did she hate her?It was right for her to be hateful.Jin Yuqi didn\u2019t stop looking at Ming Shu until the head teacher arrived. Then she sat down with a gloomy expression. Her desk-mate didn\u2019t even dare speak.Knocking on the desk, the head teacher said, \u201cBe quiet. Each class has to participate in the Cultural Festival, so our class is going to perform a drama,Sleeping Beauty . The head of the Cultural Committee is in charge of that. Everybody, join positively.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 a drama again,\u201d one student complained.\u201cCan we not join? It\u2019s boring.\u201d Another student complained too.\u201cYeah, Teacher, can we not join.\u201dThe head teacher patted the desk, looking a little unhappy. \u201cNo. Each class has to participate. You\u2019d better hurry up and prepare.\u201dUnwillingness was clearly showing on these students\u2019 faces. This class was made up of straight-A students most of whom liked to study only.So when the head of the Cultural Committee asked others to join, they all made excuses not to join.With great effort, the head of the Cultural Committee gathered enough people with a carrot and stick.This matter originally had nothing to do with Ming Shu. But when they were going to rehearse, the head of the Cultural Committee called Ming Shu.Ming Shu looked at the head of the Cultural Committee with confusion. \u201cMe?\u201d\u201cMengmeng, when did you sign up?\u201d Ye Miaomiao was confused too. She sat next to Ming Shu and never saw that Ming Shu had signed up.\u201c\u2026\u201d How could I know. Maybe I signed up when I was dreaming , Ming Shu thought.The head of the Cultural Committee nodded. \u201cYes, you.\u201dMing Shu looked at Jin Yuqi, who was watching her with a slight smile. Her resentment for Ming Shu was clear.Ming Shu took a breath, then asked the head of the Cultural Committee with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s the role I\u2019m going to play?\u201d\u201cEn\u2026 The witch who curses the princess.\u201d The head of the Cultural Committee felt awkward. \u201cLu Meng, didn\u2019t you fill in the form in person? In the past, you never joined us even when we called you. I didn\u2019t expect that you would join us willingly this time.\u201dLu Meng was quite odd recently. Now she had also joined the drama. It was unknown whether this was because she had been irritated by what happened on Postbar.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why did you agree?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a drama. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of.\u201d Ming Shu opened her chips, speaking slowly but arrogantly. \u201cI\u2019m the Goblin of Acting. If they play a drama game with me, I will thoroughly defeat them.\u201d\u201cMengmeng, you haven\u2019t acted in a drama before,\u201d Ye Miaomiao said nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s more difficult than you imagine.\u201dMing Shu patted Ye Miaomiao on the shoulder, a smile on her face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s nothing that I can\u2019t deal with.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMing Shu didn\u2019t worry at all, but Ye Miaomiao was extremely concerned.Ye Miaomiao put her hand against her forehead for a while. Finally, she sighed and signed up too.She couldn\u2019t let Mengmeng be bullied by others.\u2026After school, Ming Shu went to the playground and found the two followers already there.Seeing her coming, the two ran to her, smiling with flattery. \u201cSister-in-law, we\u2019ll clean the playground for you. You needn\u2019t come anymore. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll complete the task well.\u201d\u201cWho is your sister-in-law?\u201d Ming Shu smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll hit you if you call me that again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Our Big Brother likes you, aren\u2019t you our sister-in-law? Or are you Big Sister?the two thought.Ming Shu glanced at the two followers; the two lowered their heads. Okay, since she said so, she wasn\u2019t their sister-in-law. Anyhow, they listened to their Big Brother.\u2026Ming Shu played the role of the witch who curses the princess. She didn\u2019t need to show up in the performance for a long time, so most of the time she sat there and ate while the others were rehearsing.Jin Yuqi joined the drama too. But amazingly, she didn\u2019t make trouble for Ming Shu and rehearsed seriously.Maybe because of Jin Yuqi\u2019s deliberate guidance, all of others isolated Ming Shu. Fortunately, Ye Miaomiao was there too, so Ming Shu wouldn\u2019t be so bored as to make trouble for them.\u201cHello, Grandmother, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m spinning. You see, it\u2019s very interesting. Do you want to try?\u201dNow, the scene they were rehearsing was that the princess was on her fifteenth birthday and was about to enter a deep sleep because she was stabbed by a spindle\u2019s needle.The princess was Jin Yuqi. Although she wasn\u2019t a professional actress, Jin Yuqi\u2019s acting skills were good. She could act well without any special classes.Even the teacher who inspected them nodded to themself, showing satisfaction toward Jin Yuqi.When Jin Yuqi was holding the spindle prop, a person rushed toward Jin Yuqi angrily. \u201cJin Yuqi, why did you occupy our classroom?\u201dThe rehearsal was interrupted; everyone looked at the girl student who rushed in just now.\u201cIs she the Qian Duoduo from Class F? Why is she making trouble for Yuqi again? She ruined Yuqi\u2019s uniform before and Yuqi forgave her. Shouldn\u2019t she feel grateful to Yuqi? I don\u2019t know where her courage comes from.\u201d\u201cAlas, such ugly ducklings always think themselves swans that could one day fly.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know why she\u2019s so confident. She is so shameless and even thinks Senior Jiang will like her. Senior Jiang matches our Yuqi well, they should be a couple\u2026\u201dA good show was coming.Ming Shu shifted to another position and continued eating, her gaze on that girl student\u2014the original female protagonist.Jin Yuqi was the fake female protagonist and wanted to counterattack. So there must be an original female protagonist.Was the original female protagonist still in the picture?She had thought the original female protagonist had been successfully suppressed by Jin Yuqi already.The girl student was embarrassed because of the discussion about her. But she still looked at Jin Yuqi with confidence. \u201cWe used to practice in this classroom all the time. Jin Yuqi, why did you take it?\u201dHolding the spindle and smiling elegantly, Jin Yuqi answered, \u201cQian Duoduo, this classroom belongs to the school and there was nobody when we arrived. You also didn\u2019t apply to the school so that this classroom could be reserved for you. Why can\u2019t we use it?\u201d\u201cYeah, it\u2019s a public classroom, why can\u2019t we use it?\u201dRecently, many people rehearsed for the Cultural Festival, but the space for the rehearsal was not enough. Qian Duoduo and her classmates used this classroom all the time before, but now it had been occupied by Jin Yuqi and her classmates. So Qian Duoduo came here and asked for Jin Yuqi\u2019s explanation.\u201cBut we used it all the time before,\u201d Qian Duoduo insisted, her face turning red in embarrassment.\u201cYou used it all the time before, so does it belongs to you?\u201d Jin Yuqi played with the spindle. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I know of such a rule in this school?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 you should have told us first,\u201d Qian Duoduo said weakly.They argued. Qian Duoduo and Jin Yuqi defended their positions one after another, explaining their reasons. Later, it was unknown when exactly they started to fight and Qian Duoduo pushed Jin Yuqi.Jin Yuqi fell down and the spindle she held stabbed her palm.From where they were, everyone only saw that Jin Yuqi was pushed down by Qian Duoduo. But from Ming Shu\u2019s vantage point, she saw that Jin Yuqi stepped back and fell down by herself.\u201c\u2026\u201d Do all people like to do that? It\u2019s contagious! Ming Shu thought.\u201cYuqi!\u201dWhen the others screamed, a boy student rushed in and helped Jin Yuqi to stand. \u201cAre you okay?\u201dJin Yuqi deliberately hid her hand behind back, which gave the impression that she didn\u2019t want the boy to see it. But on the contrary, this action drew his attention. \u201cYour hand is injured?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Jin Yuqi shook her head with a normal expression, deliberately keeping distance between herself and the boy.\u201cSenior Jiang, she pushed Yuqi just now,\u201d a nearby girl said.Senior Jiang looked at Qian Duoduo, his face becoming indifferent.Under Senior Jiang\u2019s stare, Qian Duoduo shook her head and explained incoherently, \u201cNo\u2026 I\u2026\u201dJin Yuqi had fallen down before she put forth her power.Qian Duoduo looked at Jin Yuqi and saw scorn on her face. She immediately understood what had happened just now. Pointing at Jin Yuqi, she said furiously, \u201cYou\u2019re framing me!\u201dThat she ruined Jin Yuqi\u2019s uniform before was also set up by Jin Yuqi. But everyone said it was her fault and believed Jin Yuqi\u2019s story.\u201cWe all saw that you pushed Yuqi, are we all framing you?\u201d Jin Yuqi didn\u2019t need to argue: her classmates would speak for her.\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d Qian Duoduo\u2019s face became red with worry; she felt aggrieved and sad. Compared with the others\u2019 scolding, Senior Jiang\u2019s gaze made her sadder.\u201cQian Duoduo, apologize to Yuqi,\u201d Senior Jiang said in a deep voice.Qian Duoduo\u2019s face became pale at once. He also doesn\u2019t believe me.\u201cAhem!\u201d Ming Shu coughed, which drew everyone\u2019s attention successfully. Then she stood up and walked to the middle of the crowd under their stares.Why did she also insert herself into this?As soon as Ming Shu showed up, Jin Yuqi became nervous.Qian Duoduo was the original female protagonist when Jin Yuqi read the book. But now, when she saw Ming Shu, she had an unfortunate premonition. However, she didn\u2019t know the reason.\u201cI was bored just now, so I recorded a video. Let\u2019s see it.\u201d Ming Shu took out her cell phone, smiling.Jin Yuqi glanced at the place Ming Shu came from. That direction\u2026Liked it?

Quickly suppressing her inner turmoil, she said calmly, \u201cLu Meng, is it suitable to watch a video now?\u201dMing Shu ignored Jin Yuqi and fiddled with her cell phone. Sound came from the phone at once. It was a recording of the recent events.Hearing their own voices, the bystanders gathered to watch.From the video, they could all see Jin Yuqi clearly, as well as what happened just now.Jin Yuqi argued with Qian Duoduo and then the two started fighting. But Qian Duoduo only lightly pushed Jin Yuqi, hardly even touching her.They all fell silent.Even Senior Jiang looked at Jin Yuqi with a confused and complicated gaze.Jin Yuqi bit her lips hard and clenched her fists tightly, her palms almost bleeding from the pressure of her fingernails.\u201cYuqi?\u201d Senior Jiang addressed her, maybe hoping to hear an explanation from her. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Facing the evidence, Jin Yuqi could say nothing. She couldn\u2019t say she\u2019d sleepwalked right then.Lu Meng, the bitch, dared to ruin her plan.Damn it!\u201cI said that I didn\u2019t push her,\u201d Qian Duoduo said in a low voice, aggrieved, then wiped her eyes and ran away.Senior Jiang hesitated for a while, looking at Jin Yuqi complicatedly. Then he ran as well, following Qian Duoduo.\u201cSenior\u2026\u201d Jin Yuqi opened her mouth, but couldn\u2019t say anything. She glanced at the bystanders and their conflicted expressions, becoming angry. \u201cWhat are you looking at? Hurry up and rehearse!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The others were silent and thought, What\u2019s the point of shouting at us?We spoke for her just now!Alas, she is the fair-skinned, rich, and beautiful lady. Let\u2019s go.As the bystanders walked away, Jin Yuqi stared at Ming Shu. \u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be satisfied when you\u2019re angry.\u201d How can I get Hatred Points if you aren\u2019t angry! I did that just for my work!\u201cAre you angry?\u201d Ming Shu circled Jin Yuqi with a big smile on her lovely face. \u201cYou\u2019re right to be angry. Anger will make you more beautiful.\u201d\u201cLu Meng!\u201d Blue veins bulging on the back of Jin Yuqi\u2019s hands and eyes bloodshot, she shouted furiously, \u201cThis isn\u2019t over!\u201d\u201cYo, bring it on!\u201d Ming Shu still bore her duty to get Hatred Points.Jin Yuqi stared at Ming Shu and then walked away in her high-heeled shoes. She wouldn\u2019t let her off.Ming Shu\u2019s smile shrank. Then she returned, sat down, and started eating as if nothing had happened.Only snacks could release her.\u2026Maybe because of Jin Yuqi\u2019s influence, nobody talked about that day, pretending that nothing happened.The drama was rehearsed in an orderly manner. Ming Shu walked around the playground every day, only seeing Cheng Yan\u2019s followers. Cheng Yan didn\u2019t show up in the playground and wasn\u2019t even seen at school.Cheng Yan was the problem student whom the school felt most troubled about. He stirred trouble and fought every day. All the bullies around the school knew him.Whenever he went to school, the students had holidays.However, he was handsome, so many girls at school liked him. Although he was not as popular as the original male protagonist, Senior Jiang, he was still in the top three.He was one of the the school\u2019s popular students who became well known because of appearance.Alas, he shouldn\u2019t want to pursue me since he seldom comes to school. Out!Ming Shu sat at the back of the playground, eating out of a bag of candy.\u201cLu Meng.\u201d Shangguan Feng arrived, extremely angry. He questioned sharply, \u201cWhy did you bully Yuqi?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re blocking my view of the sunset.\u201d Ming Shu tilted her head to see him and found that it was a little inconvenient. She stood, but she was still shorter than him\u2026 so she stepped back and stood on the stair she\u2019d been sitting on. At once, she was much taller than Shangguan Feng. Then she said slowly, \u201cOr do you think that you\u2019re more beautiful than the sunset?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What the hell? ShangguanFeng didn\u2019t want to waste too much time with her. \u201cI\u2019m asking you why you bullied Yuqi. Lu Meng, you can make trouble for me if you\u2019re unhappy. I like Yuqi first and foremost, so why did you make trouble for her? I will look down on you even more if you do that!\u201dMing Shu tilted her head. Did Jin Yuqi complain to Shangguan Feng again?Why is she so confident that Shangguan Feng still has an influence on me?Am I a superficial person?\u201cShangguan Feng, quit performing. Making trouble for her has nothing to do with you.\u201d What should I do with people who put on these self-important acts.Shangguan Feng didn\u2019t believe that. He sneered and said, \u201cIf it had nothing to do with me, why did you make trouble for Yuqi? Lu Meng, don\u2019t start lying now. You weren\u2019t like this before!\u201d\u201cWell, what was I like before?\u201d Ming Shu raised her eyebrows.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Shangguan Feng was stuck. Angry, he finally said, \u201cIn short, you weren\u2019t like this before. Lu Meng, this is your last chance. If you dare to make trouble for Yuqi again, I won\u2019t let you off. Should this happen, it will not only involve you and I, but also our families.\u201dAmazing. You\u2019re threatening me.\u201cI will make trouble for her again and again. If you\u2019re angry, hit me!\u201d How can I complete my task and get Hatred Points if I don\u2019t make trouble for Jin Yuqi?Shangguan Feng instantly became even madder and even felt the impulse to slap Ming Shu.Excitement flashing in Ming Shu\u2019s eyes, she lifted her foot and quickly kicked Shangguan Feng.Shangguan Feng stepped back. Before he could steady himself, he felt a sudden pain on his knee and knelt down. Two boy students stood in front of him, brooms in their hands. \u201cYou dare to bully sister-in-law, are you tired of living?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Shangguan Feng was baffled. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business!\u201d\u201cNone of our business? You bullied our sister-in-law and call us meddlesome. It\u2019s lucky for you that our Big Brother isn\u2019t here, or else he would thoroughly beat you!\u201d One follower smacked Shangguan on the leg with his broom and said, \u201cGet out!\u201dShangguan Feng was extremely angry and shouted, \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t care who you are. Do you want to die!\u201d The followers beat Shangguan Feng with their brooms.Shangguan Feng was furious that he was beaten, unable to fight back. He merely stood and fled quickly.Before leaving, he stared at Ming Shu with resentful eyes the same as Jin Yuqi\u2019s.Ming Shu waved at him.[Extension Task: Utterly isolate Shangguan Feng.] The Harmony System announced a task suddenly.\u201c\u2026\u201d It\u2019s the end for anyone who impedes me from completing my task. The Harmony System is going to deal with you , Ming Shu thought.Harmony, are you abusing your power for personal revenge?I hadn\u2019t thought you were this kind of system.In order to obtain Hatred Points, you really could do anything. Are you sure the plot can develop without any mistakes? Are you kidding me?[As long as the real protagonist hasn\u2019t been influenced, a small deviation is okay. Guest, don\u2019t worry. You only have to remember that your task is to gather Hatred Points.] The Harmony System continued impressing its ideology on Ming Shu.Ming Shu lifted her eyebrows and thought, Hey, Harmony, you\u2019re pretty amazing.Liked it?

During that time, Cheng Yan didn\u2019t show up at all, as if he had vanished.\u201cAh, the rehearsal is over.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s have snacks, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not nervous\u2026\u201dThe students who finished rehearsal left one by one. Ming Shu and her classmates still rehearsed, though, because someone arrived late.When they finished their rehearsal, almost all the other students had left.\u201cMengmeng, quickly. I\u2019m inviting you to eat delicious food.\u201d Ye Miaomiao ran out, dragging Ming Shu who hadn\u2019t even taken off her costume.Food!Ming Shu\u2019s eyes shone, but she still stopped Ye Miaomiao and took off the costume. She was afraid of being sent to a mental hospital if she left with it on.Ye Miaomiao found a Huoguo restaurant near the school and invited Ming Shu there.It was their first time at this restaurant and Ye Miaomiao was unclear about its menu, so she ordered the super spicy dish. As a result, she felt extremely hot while eating.\u201cHuhuhu\u2026\u201d Ye Miaomiao fanned her tongue with hers hands, tears flooding her eyes. \u201cMengmeng, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too spicy?\u201dIt\u2019s so so so spicy!Why is Mengmeng so calm? How is she not even sweating?\u201cEn\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very spicy.\u201d Ming Shu picked up some meat with her chopsticks and asked, \u201cIs it very spicy?\u201cIt\u2019s very spicy.\u201d Ye Miaomiao drank juice quickly. \u201cMengmeng, I remember you didn\u2019t eat spicy food before.\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know how I ate spicy food before.\u201d Ming Shu picked up more meat.\u201c\u2026\u201dShe put down her juice quickly and ate some meat. Although it was spicy, it was really delicious. The two enjoyed it happily.After finishing the Huoguo, they left the restaurant. Then Ye Miaomiao answered a call from home and they parted ways.Ming Shu walked around. Finally she went to the dessert shop and bought lots of food. When she exited, carrying a plastic bag full of her purchases, she saw some people walking toward her and her smile shrank.Why is it him again?It\u2019s him!It\u2019s him!Troublesome!Cheng Yan walked with several people, apparently accompanying them somewhere. He was also surprised to see her.Then he slightly smiled and whispered to the two followers who had helped Ming Shu clean the playground before. The two of them looked at Ming Shu and winked at her vaguely, then left with the others noisily.With one hand in his pocket, Cheng Yan walked through the crowd to Ming Shu. \u201cLu Meng, long time no see.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll walk you home.\u201d Cheng Yan tried to take the bag from Ming Shu, but Ming Shu hid it behind her back suddenly and stared at him with alarm, as if he was going to rob her snacks.\u201c\u2026\u201d She hadn\u2019t been so alert when he showed up.Thinking of her habit of protecting food, Cheng Yan took back his hand and placed his fist against his lips. He coughed to hide his original intention and said, \u201cIt\u2019s getting dark. I\u2019m going home now so I\u2019ll send you back on my way.\u201dHe was smart. If he said that he wanted to walk her home, he would surely be refused. But the result was different if he went home too.As expected, Ming Shu looked at him for a few seconds and then walked forward, carrying her bag. She didn\u2019t refuse Cheng Yan\u2019s offer.It was not very late now. Many young people hung around under the colorful lights.Cheng Yan\u2019s stare roved over the crowd only to fall on Ming Shu in the end. He organized his thoughts and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that you joined the stage-play drama?\u201d\u201cWhat, do you have an opinion?\u201d Ming Shu bit her spoon as she answered, tilting her head.\u201cNo, how dare I have an opinion.\u201d Cheng Yan smiled. He kept silent for a second, then moved closer to Ming Shu suddenly. \u201cLu Meng, you really can\u2019t give me a chance?\u201d\u201cIf I didn\u2019t give you a chance, would you disappear?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cSo what\u2019s the point of asking me that?\u201d Ming Shu said.Cheng Yan laughed in a low voice. \u201cLu Meng, I find you more and more interesting.\u201d\u201cI find you more and more interesting too.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s tone implied other meanings.\u201cIn what way am I interesting?\u201d Cheng Yan asked, not realizing Ming Shu\u2019s real meaning.Ming Shu pointed at her head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t give up, maybe you\u2019ll be cured one day.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What do you mean?Do you mean I\u2019m sick in the head?Why am I crazy for liking her?Cheng Yan was a little frantic. Why was she so stubborn? Because of his followers\u2019 suggestion, he purposely didn\u2019t show up before. But she had no reaction to that, which was different from what his followers told him.Why was it so hard to pursue a girl?Ding!It was a message. Seeing that it came from Ye Miaomiao, she read it.Mengmeng, I left my bag at school. Can you go back to look for it for me? My student ID card is in it. It will be troublesome if I lose it. I\u2019m busy and can\u2019t go back now. Please.Ming Shu read that twice, then directly called back to confirm.The call was answered, but it was noisy on that side and Ming Shu couldn\u2019t hear clearly. \u201cMengmeng, it\u2019s loud over here. Did you receive my message?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ming Shu threw out the plastic ice cream bowl and returned to the school. \u201cWhere did you put your bag?\u201d\u201cMaybe the auditorium. I brought it when I went to rehearse. I can\u2019t remember clearly. Go to the rehearsal room and the auditorium and search.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d\u2026Because tomorrow was the Cultural Festival, there were still some people at school preparing. Ming Shu went to the rehearsal room first and didn\u2019t find Ye Miaomiao\u2019s bag there. Then she went to the auditorium.But, the follower\u2026Ming Shu thought for a few seconds. Then she stopped in the corridor of the auditorium and crooked her finger, beckoning Cheng Yan.Cheng Yan walked quickly to her without any suspicion or hesitation. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201dMing Shu smiled and pushed him suddenly, surprising Cheng Yan. He fell into a room behind him. Then Ming Shu quickly closed the door.\u201c\u2026\u201d Why is it so hard to pursue a girl?Not to mention he\u2019d been hit by her, now he was locked in some room!You\u2019ll be forever alone!Cheng Yan groped for the switch and turned on the lights. Maybe it was a room to store stage props, because there were many stage props all in a mess. He looked around and found there was a window through which he could escape.It wasn\u2019t that easy to restrain him.Cheng Yan left through the window. He returned to the auditorium through another room and walked to the stage where the performance was going to be held tomorrow.Before he was nearby, he heard somebody talking.\u201cLu Meng, it\u2019s late, why didn\u2019t you go home? What are you doing here?\u201d It was the headmaster\u2019s loud voice.\u201cYe Miaomiao lost her bag here. I\u2019m retrieving it for her.\u201dEven though he couldn\u2019t see her face, he could still hear the smile in her voice.\u201cAll right, you go. Remember to turn off the lights when you leave. Return home as soon as possible!\u201d The headmaster walked toward the place Cheng Yan was. He moved quickly to the corner to hide.After the headmaster left, Cheng Yan emerged from the dark corner. Meanwhile, Ming Shu stepped out with a schoolbag. When she saw him, a murderous look seemed to appear on her lovely face for a moment.But when Cheng Yan looked at her more closely, she still had that smiling and innocent expression. She was surrounded by yellow light as if her whole body was radiating warmth.Cheng Yan furrowed his brow. Had the murderous look been his imagination?Liked it?

However, Ming Shu, who walked ahead, was focused on eating while Cheng Yan wanted to talk to her. So the conversation between them came to an end after several sentences. The two almost couldn\u2019t communicate with each other at all.It seemed that they lived in two different planets.And that foodie was extremely arrogant, always feeling superior.Never judge a book by its cover. One would be cheated by her appearance and die in the end without knowing why.Cheng Yan felt hopeless. When and how could he succeed in winning her?Was God kidding with him?All of a sudden, a flurry of footstep came from ahead and Cheng Yan looked over unconsciously to see a crowd of people carrying knives and walking toward him angrily.\u201cCheng Yan!\u201d someone called him.\u201cFuck!\u201d Cheng Yan cursed in a low voice, quickly walking forward and catching Ming Shu, who was still ambling along.Ming Shu looked up and glanced at him with confusion, then looked at the people charging toward them.Huh!Are so many people going to frighten me to death to inherit my snacks?Ming Shu rid herself of Cheng Yan at once and stepped aside quickly, holding her snacks. \u201cI have no relation with him. I don\u2019t know him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d You can\u2019t do that! Cheng Yan shouted in his mind.Ming Shu smiled, saying to those people, \u201cIf there\u2019s any issue between you and him, get your revenge on him only. I\u2019m just a passerby.\u201d\u201cHahaha, Cheng Yan, is she the girl you like?\u201d One person opposite them laughed, sneering with words full of scorn.As he walked closer, Ming Shu saw him clearly. He was not as attractive as Cheng Yan, but was also handsome. He was tall and strong and dressed all in black, wearing a somewhat scary expression.\u201cYou go first,\u201d Cheng Yan said to Ming Shu.\u201cOh.\u201d Holding her snacks, Ming Shu was about to leave.But the people stopped Ming Shu immediately. \u201cCheng Yan, how could you ask her to go first? This is an uncommon chance for her to appreciate your heroics.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to see.\u201d I\u2019m busy. My snacks are waiting for me.The man snorted, squinting at Ming Shu. \u201cCheng Yan, where did you find such a timid and careful girl? She doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d\u201cThe problem between us has nothing to do with her. Let her go.\u201d Cheng Yan furrowed his eyebrows.\u201cNothing to do with her?\u201d The man guffawed. \u201cIs she your girlfriend?\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t say things randomly.\u201d Ming Shu put her hands up. \u201cI\u2019m not his girlfriend.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d The man looked Ming Shu up and down with confusion, then laughed suddenly. \u201cCheng Yan, hahahaha. Why do you like her? How could she say something like that.\u201dCheng Yan hadn\u2019t been in a relationship with a girl before. Although he was young, since he had taken this road, the ostentation and extravagance associated with it couldn\u2019t be ignored. But in the past, he was alone whenever he showed up.However, a girl was with him today and he followed her with such patience. If she wasn\u2019t his girlfriend, who was she?The man had thought the girl couldn\u2019t be simple. Now it surprised him that she was just a timid and careful girl.The followers beside the man suddenly stepped forward and caught Ming Shu\u2019s arms on both sides.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Even caught, Ming Shu still kept a smile on her face. \u201cI\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m not familiar with him. Deal with him if there\u2019s a problem between you. Don\u2019t involve innocent people, okay?\u201dI\u2019m just eating. Why am I involved in such evil things?Can\u2019t I eat in peace?It\u2019s all because of this troublesome fellow.\u201c\u2026\u201d Why stare at me? I also didn\u2019t expect to be stopped here , the troublesome Cheng Yan thought.\u201cLittle girl, since you\u2019re involved with someone you shouldn\u2019t be, you have to be prepared for these kind of thins. Do you think I\u2019ll believe that you don\u2019t know him and let you go?\u201d The man\u2019s face became malicious. \u201cCheng Yan, you only have one choice now. Follow me and we\u2019ll resolve things.\u201dIt seems they won\u2019t finish talking any time soon.\u201cIf I don\u2019t choose, what will happen?\u201d\u201cWell, your beautiful girlfriend will come with me.\u201dCan\u2019t they get this over with?Ming Shu was almost going crazy, but Cheng Yan was still chatting with that guy. When the man and Cheng Yan couldn\u2019t come to an agreement, a painful shout suddenly rang out.The two who\u2019d been restraining Ming Shu fell to the ground.The petite girl was kicking one of them. \u201cWho allowed you to touch my snacks!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d All were silent.Hey, she looked so weak before!Why is she so fierce now?Cheng Yan laid his hand against his forehead, speechless. She looked weak, but when someone touched her snacks, she would become fierce as if possessed by Ares.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Ming Shu turned her head and looked at the man who\u2019d been speaking to Cheng Yan. \u201cDo you want to get hit?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d He had treated her like a docile sheep, but actually she was a tigress. He sneered and thought in his heart, Knowing a little Kung Fu, you just don\u2019t appreciate how powerful others are . \u201cWhat are you doing? Catch her.\u201dMing Shu smiled strangely. Fighting is good. It\u2019s entertaining.She threw the snacks aside and rolled her sleeves up in preparation for a brawl.I would have eaten a hundred bags of snacks if I didn\u2019t have to beat you today.Seeing that a girl was fighting with a crowd of men, Cheng Yan felt complicated.Hey, what happened to the plot of the hero rescuing the damsel?This isn\u2019t how it should be!\u2026It was dark and the wind was strong; no stars could be seen in the sky.The cold wind blew past the red and blue lights. A crowd of people squatted on the road, hands on their heads, and fielded questions from policemen.Ming Shu sat in front of her snacks, eating to replenish her strength. She asked Cheng Yan who was guarding his life. \u201cDid you call the police?\u201dCheng Yan answered, \u201cDo you think I would call the police?\u201dHe was a bully, would he ever do that?\u201cWasn\u2019t it you?\u201d Cheng Yan thought it was more likely that Ming Shu had called the police. She always seemed to want to do that before.Ming Shu smiled. \u201cAm I foolish?\u201dShe\u2019d participated in such a serious altercation, so why would she call the police?\u201cYou two, what are you talking about? Don\u2019t whisper to each other!\u201d a policeman shouted suddenly. Because of that, Ming Shu\u2019s hands jerked and her chips almost fell to ground.She stuffed the chips in her mouth quickly as the policeman walked toward her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dMing Shu put down the chips calmly. \u201cSir, I\u2019ll report what happened just now.\u201dHearing that, the policeman decided not to blame her for eating just now. Glancing at his busy colleague, he took out a notepad and said, \u201cExplain.\u201d\u201cThe truth is that\u2026 blah blah blah\u2026 blah blah blah\u2026 blah blah blah\u2026 In conclusion, they attacked first and I just protected myself.\u201d Goblin of Acting Ming Shu told the policeman that a crowd of people was about to be impolite to a girl and she herself was just a poor innocent who beat others in self-defense.The policeman was astonished. When they arrived, they saw this girl hitting people.Ming Shu continued: \u201cI just learned some Kung Fu. If I were a weak girl, you might be looking at my corpse.\u201dLiked it?

He was asked to go to the police station and pick up Ming Shu and Cheng Yan.A straight-A student and a problem student were at the police station together, which astonished the headmaster. He felt the same as the policeman who had taken Ming Shu\u2019s statement.Finishing up the procedures, the headmaster walked out with the two of them, an unhappy look on his face. Once they had exited the police station, the headmaster suddenly erupted, shouting, \u201cLu Meng, Cheng Yan, you two didn\u2019t go home tonight! What were you doing?\u201dMore importantly, why ask him to come here? He felt ashamed!Ming Shu pointed at Cheng Yan. \u201cHeadmaster, those people were going to make trouble for him. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201d\u201cNone of your business? Why was it you who beat on people?\u201d The headmaster was so angry he even wanted to blow himself up.You injured those people so heavily they called the police. You don\u2019t feel proud of yourself?Why didn\u2019t he ever realize the straight-A student was so fierce?\u201cHeadmaster, it\u2019s really my fault. It has nothing to do with Lu Meng.\u201d If Cheng Yan didn\u2019t manfully confess his fault now, he believed he would be put on Ming Shu\u2019s blacklist forever.\u201cCheng Yan!\u201d the headmaster shouted angrily. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t study, but you shouldn\u2019t be a bad influence on Lu Meng.\u201dCheng Yan wanted to explain, but was interrupted by the headmaster. \u201cFine. Lu Meng, don\u2019t play with Cheng Yan anymore and write a self-criticism for me by tomorrow. And Cheng Yan, if I find out you\u2019re leading students astray again, I\u2019ll ask the school to expel you. Now, I\u2019ll send you both home!\u201dMing Shu\u2019s eyes rolled and she said, \u201cHeadmaster, I also don\u2019t want to play with him, but he always keeps hounding me and affects my studies. I suggest he be expelled as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cHum.\u201d The headmaster snorted, not directly replying to Ming Shu. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dCheng Yan moved closer to Ming Shu. \u201cLu Meng, must you be so cruel?\u201dHolding her snacks tightly, Ming Shu ignored Cheng Yan and got in the car with the headmaster.The headmaster sent them to the community gates and watched them walk in. He felt astonished in his heart. What a damning fate, that the straight-A student and the problem student lived in the same community.Cheng Yan accompanied Ming Shu to her home. When he was about to leave, he said, \u201cThe headmaster is my uncle. Do you think he would listen to your suggestion? Lu Meng, see you tomorrow.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat the fuck?This is some shady deal!\u2026One trouble follows another. Ming Shu got into big trouble when she went to school the next day.The students who came to the auditorium first to prepare for the rehearsal found that all the costumes that every class stored in there were stained with oil paint and couldn\u2019t be worn.The Cultural Festival was coming. How would they perform on stage with all of the costumes ruined?Not only the costumes of one class, but the costumes of all the classes had been ruined.And Ming Shu was considered the primary suspect.Ming Shu, who knew what had happened, stood in the middle of the crowd, looking at the stained costumes. The pungent smell of the oils suffused the place.Ming Shu furrowed her eyebrows slightly. Then she calmly took out a lollipop and said slowly, \u201cThere\u2019s only one truth\u2014\u201dEveryone quieted down and looked at Ming Shu.Truth?She knew the truth?Now that she was the suspect, what kind of truth would she say?But Ming Shu changed the topic suddenly. \u201cAll of you claim I did this. But where\u2019s the evidence?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Can\u2019t the pause between sentences be too long? The others were silently thinking this.\u201cYesterday when it was dark, someone saw that you came to the auditorium again,\u201d a student in the crowd said.\u201cI saw that you went into the auditorium and came out after a while.\u201d\u201cThere was no one in here when we left. Some students who left late saw you return. Other than you, who would have the chance do this?\u201d\u201cLu Meng, is there any resentment between us? Why did you ruin our costumes so that we can\u2019t perform on stage?\u201d\u201cSome people are saying Lu Meng has gone crazy\u2026 Is she really crazy?\u201dAll kinds of voices mixed together and all the comments were aimed at Ming Shu.\u201cYou\u2019ve said enough. I asked Mengmeng to go to the auditorium to pick up my schoolbag for me. Did you see Mengmeng pour the paint in person? If not, don\u2019t say things randomly.\u201d Ye Miaomiao squeezed through the crowd. No matter what the truth was, she had to protect Mengmeng first.Ye Miaomiao was extremely angry when she heard the news this morning.\u201cEveryone left the auditorium last night and many people saw she was the last one to go home. What\u2019s wrong with suspecting her?\u201d Jin Yuqi walked out from the crowd, staring at Ming Shu. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t do it, can she prove it?\u201dMing Shu raised her eyebrows; her smile became more beautiful.Resentment flashed in Jin Yuqi\u2019s eyes quickly. She should smile now, Jin Yuqi thought.\u201cCall the teacher!\u201d someone shouted.\u201cYes, call the teacher. The teacher would know whether we framed her.\u201dLooking at the excited crowd and Jin Yuqi who thought she would win, Ye Miaomiao secretly poked Ming Shu and asked, \u201cMengmeng, did you offend God? Why are you running into so many problems lately?\u201dMing Shu smiled at Ye Miaomiao and said fearlessly, \u201cOkay, call the teacher.\u201dAm I afraid of that? If things get out of control at this point, it\u2019ll be funny , she thought.Since Ming Shu said that, the students who stood at the edges of the crowd went to call the teacher immediately.Jin Yuqi was afraid that the teacher would know the truth, but she couldn\u2019t stop her classmates from going or else she would be suspect. Jin Yuqi didn\u2019t know why things turned out like this. She only poured oil paint on the costumes of one class last night.But with the situation as it was, she couldn\u2019t shrink back.The teacher who was in charge of the Cultural Festival arrived with the headmaster. As soon as they appeared, they were surrounded by the students and their complaints.\u201cHeadmaster, Lu Meng is so evil. She poured oil paint on our costumes and they can\u2019t be worn now. What should we wear for the Cultural Festival?\u201d\u201cTeacher, the witnesses saw Lu Meng was the last one to leave the auditorium yesterday. Now she\u2019s denying that she did all this\u2026\u201dThese complains were countless.Painfully, the headmaster looked at Ming Shu who stood behind the crowd, drinking yogurt and ignoring the others\u2019 censures.What was she up to recently?She fought against others in class first. Then she fought with Cheng Yan outside school. Now many people complained that she had ruined their costumes.Had she gone crazy after all the stress from studying?\u201cBe quiet!\u201d the headmaster shouted. The students were afraid of the headmaster and all quieted down because of his shout. But their anger showed on their faces clearly.The headmaster knew what had happened just now and massaged the skin between his eyebrows. \u201cLu Meng, when I checked yesterday, you really were the last one to leave. Anything you want to explain?\u201dEveryone was surprised by the headmaster\u2019s words and looked at Ming Shu.Jin Yuqi also rejoiced secretly, her happiness shining from her face. It seemed God also helped her. Even the headmaster saw Ming Shu yesterday.In order for the others not to find out she was happy, Jin Yuqi lowered her head quickly. She hid her joyLiked it?

She must be crazy. We\u2019ve rehearsed for such a long time, will it all be ruined by her?\u201d\u201cHeadmaster, she must give us an explanation!\u201d\u201cBe quiet!\u201d the headmaster shouted loudly. Is what I said useless now?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Ming Shu threw up her hands. \u201cBelieve it or not.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no enmity between you and Mengmeng. She must have been framed by someone,\u201d Ye Miaomiao said, after Ming Shu\u2019s words. \u201cHeadmaster, we must find out the truth and prove that Mengmeng is innocent. Mengmeng isn\u2019t such a bored person.\u201dThe headmaster looked at Ming Shu, who tilted her head and bit into her lollipop, a slight smile on her innocent face. She could smile even now. Was she crazy or merely calm?\u201cHeadmaster.\u201d Ming Shu stopped biting the lollipop, her clear voice ringing through the whole room. \u201cDo you smell blood in the room?\u201d\u201cBlood?\u201d The headmaster sniffed the air unconsciously. But there was only the pungent smell of oil paint.\u201cLu Meng, don\u2019t change the topic.\u201d One student pointed at Ming Shu. \u201cIt must be you who ruined our costumes. Now you\u2019re trying to scare us to distract us. This is the school\u2019s auditorium. Where would any blood come from?\u201d\u201cYeah!\u201d\u201cHeadmaster, don\u2019t listen to her.\u201dMing Shu smiled and said to the headmaster leisurely, \u201cHeadmaster, I suggest you call the police now. No matter whether I did it or whether there is blood, we\u2019ll know the truth once the police are here.\u201dMing Shu glanced at Jin Yuqi in particular. From Jin Yuqi\u2019s appearance and behavior, maybe she also didn\u2019t know the truth and was even confused about why there were so much paint.The headmaster deliberated for a while and asked Ming Shu, \u201cLu Meng, the room reeks of oil paint. How can you smell blood?\u201dThe smell of oil paint was so overpowering that they couldn\u2019t smell anything else at all. Why could she, a simple girl, distinguish the smell of blood?\u201cI say there is, so there must be.\u201d Ming Shu kept smiling, confident.\u201c\u2026\u201d Did the straight-A student\u2019s behavior differ from normal people\u2019s? Thinking that she was the straight-A student who never lied, the headmaster finally decided to ask the teacher beside him to call the police.Jin Yuqi became worried when she heard the headmaster decided to call the police. She had thought that this matter would be solved easily, not expecting that the teacher would call the police.There was so much oil paint and\u2026Jin Yuqi gripped the fabric of her clothes and tried to calm down. But she was still worried and couldn\u2019t be as calm as the others.Soon the police arrived. Some of the policemen had seen Ming Shu at the police station yesterday. They furrowed their eyebrows when they saw her, indicating their confusion at seeing this troublemaker again.The policeman asked for information from the headmaster first. The headmaster also felt it was strange that there was so much oil paint here, so he told the policeman that Ming Shu had caught the smell of blood.The policeman asked them to go outside to wait, then told his colleagues to search the room.The students stood in groups of two or three and discussed, waiting outside and craning to see inside but unable to discern anything.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they come out in so long?\u201d\u201cIs it true there\u2019s blood?\u201d\u201cThe oil paint really is strange. Other than on our costumes, there\u2019s a lot spilled on the floor. It\u2019s weird.\u201dMing Shu and Ye Miaomiao stood next to the headmaster who was in the middle of the crowd. After all, she was suspected of pouring the oil paint, she had to stand in the middle.The headmaster stared into the room, furrowing his eyebrows. As the headmaster, he hoped that nothing had happened that might impact the school\u2019s prestige.The policeman left the room, his serious expression revealing that something bad had really happened. Soon another group of policemen came here. The police cordoned off the area and no one was allowed to leave.Didn\u2019t that mean something bad really happened?The policeman called away the headmaster first. Soon the headmaster came back and called for Ming Shu with an unhappy, serious expression.The atmosphere became depressed suddenly, everyone feeling upset. Except for Ming Shu, the students were questioned separately.\u201cLu Meng, you were the first to claim the room smelled of blood?\u201d the policeman asked, holding a pen and notepad. \u201cThe smell of oil paint was overpowering, how did you detect any smell of blood?\u201dMing Shu leaned against the wall, her attitude improper. \u201cI guessed it.\u201dThe policeman frowned. \u201cLu Meng, please answer my question honestly.\u201d\u201cLu Meng, answer honestly.\u201d The headmaster reproached Ming Shu with a serious stare. That she could smile at this time\u2026. Did she really comprehend the seriousness of the matter?Ming Shu took out two pieces of chocolate and answered while opening them. \u201cI found that there was blood on the floor when I came into the room. The policeman clearly knows the color of oil paint won\u2019t change, but the color of blood will. And\u2026 I can smell blood.\u201dThe policeman nodded. Yes, the color of blood would change, which was different from oil paint. They also found some blood that wasn\u2019t covered by the paint.But\u2026\u201cSmell?\u201d The room was full of the stench of oil paint, and they still couldn\u2019t smell the blood although they had visited many crime scene. Could the girl as well?Ming Shu ate the chocolate and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s inherent.\u201dSome people did have a strange talent and could smell blood easily. Or maybe she was sensitive to the smell of blood. But she was still suspect.The policeman looked Ming Shu up and down. She had remained calm the entire time since she was called here. Maybe she wasn\u2019t calm, but comfortable.If there was a person like her at a crime scene, there were two explanations for their behavior. First, they really had nothing to do with the crime, so they would be at ease. Second, they were the murderer, pretending to be calm to mislead the investigators.The policeman coughed and said, \u201cThere really is a lot of blood mixed in with oil paint at the crime scene. And you were the first one to discover it. So we need your cooperation.\u201dMing Shu agreed with a smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u2026A lot of blood, which was later proven to be human blood after a test, was found at the crime scene, catching the police\u2019s attention.Now that all the costumes had been ruined, the Cultural Festival couldn\u2019t be held as planned. The headmaster asked teachers to tell students that the Cultural Festival was being postponed and students were to have classes as usual.And all the students at the crime scene needed to be questioned by the police\u2026The police\u2019s questions were things like \u201cWhen did you come here?\u201d, \u201cWho discovered this first?\u201d, \u201cWhy did you argue?\u201d, \u201cDid you find anyone strange?\u201d and so on\u2026No secret could be kept forever. Although the headmaster asked them to keep it quiet, the news that a lot of blood was found in the auditorium still spread, leading to heated discussion among students. The school suffered immense pressure and demanded that the police uncover the truth as soon as possible to assuage the students\u2019 uneasiness.Except for the blood, the police didn\u2019t find any other clues. It appeared that someone deliberately poured blood there and then covered it with oil paint.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although they were the same color, the compositions of the two kinds of oil paints were different because they came from different brands.After some analysis, they inferred that someone poured one kind of oil paint first, then someone else poured another kind of oil paint afterward.\u201cAccording to the evidence we\u2019ve gathered up until now, it\u2019s likely that some students wanted to play a prank, which was taken advantage of by the culprit.\u201d The police held a meeting in their temporary meeting room.\u201cWell, it\u2019s possible that some students poured the paint first and the suspect came later. Now we need to find out which student poured the oil paint.\u201d\u201cThat Lu Meng is the biggest suspect.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t agree with that. She came to the police station last night,\u201d someone disagreed. \u201cThe headmaster came to pick her up and he said that he sent her home personally. And we know she stayed at home after she came back because of the housemaid\u2019s statement. The housemaid went to the washroom several times during the night and said that she saw Lu Meng asleep on the sofa in the living room.\u201d\u201cShe went to the police station?\u201d\u201cEn\u2026 because of fighting.\u201d That policeman nodded. \u201cShe looked very thin and seemed to be weak, but she is really very fierce.\u201dThe policemen stared each other in the eyes.\u201cLu Meng needs to be investigated further. After all, she was mostly suspected because the headmaster said she entered the auditorium as he was leaving.\u201d\u201cEn\u2026 But she didn\u2019t carry anything at that time and came out quickly. According to the time when the doorkeeper saw her leave, we could speculate that she stayed in the auditorium only for several minutes. She didn\u2019t have enough time to do anything. Then she went to the police station because of some altercation and was sent home by the headmaster.\u201d\u201cInvestigate more carefully,\u201d the policeman who seemed to be the leader concluded in the end.When police investigated who poured the oil paint first, a student confessed saying she did it. She wasn\u2019t allowed to join the class performance, leading her to pour the paint during the night because of her grudge.But she didn\u2019t expect that things would turn out like this. She didn\u2019t know why there was blood beneath the oil paint. She was afraid. After struggling for a long time, she decided to confess what she had done.When the student came to confess, Ming Shu was brought in for questioning. After hearing the student\u2019s story, Ming Shu lifted her eyebrows and asked her in front of the police, \u201cYou did it? How did you enter the auditorium? I remember that I locked the door when I left.\u201dThe lock on the auditorium\u2019s door was an instant lock. The door was opened when Ming Shu came in because the headmaster was inside.But once the door was locked, it could only be opened with a key. And Ming Shu locked the door when she left.\u201cI\u2026\u201d The girl\u2019s face became pale. \u201cI have the key.\u201d\u201cI also remember that the teacher gave the key to the president and vice-president of the Student Council yesterday. Where did you get the key?\u201d Ming Shu held her chin in her hands, smiling. \u201cOr did you steal it?\u201d\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t steal the key,\u201d the student denied unconsciously.When someone was blamed for stealing, they would reply instinctively if they didn\u2019t do it. The same went for this student. But she regretted it as soon as she retorted. \u201cYes, I stole it.\u201dMing Shu looked at the policeman beside them. \u201cShe lied.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t lie, I really did it.\u201d The student worried that the policeman wouldn\u2019t believe her and insisted, \u201cI really poured the paint.\u201dThe policeman had seen many different kinds of people; he could easily tell whether someone was lying. \u201cYou question her inside. Lu Meng, you\u2019re the suspect now. Don\u2019t talk randomly.\u201d\u201cAlas, I said I didn\u2019t do it.\u201d Ming Shu shook her head. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d\u201cBefore we catch the murderer, everyone is suspect.\u201d The policeman was serious. \u201cYou\u2019re still a suspect now. Blah blah blah, blah blah blah\u2026\u201d\u201cOkay, okay. But, can I eat that bread? Don\u2019t you provide meals when you question me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Was she even listening to me? the policeman thought.\u2026The police couldn\u2019t be fooled so easily. Because Ming Shu said only the Student Council had the key, they soon found out Jin Yuqi.Jin Yuqi wasn\u2019t a member of the Student Council, but she had borrowed a key from the president and hadn\u2019t given it back.Jin Yuqi was afraid of being investigated by the police. Although she had nothing to do with the blood, she had ruined those costumes, which would damage her image if it was exposed.In order not to be discovered, she bribed another student to confess for her.Originally Jin Yuqi would have succeeded. But Ming Shu, who was sure that the oil paint was poured by Jin Yuqi to begin with and would win Hatred Points along the way, was in the police station too when the student was confessing.But even if Ming Shu weren\u2019t in the police station at that time, the police would have discovered the information about the key sooner or later.Before she came into this world through a book, Jin Yuqi was just a student. Those people who incarnated into novels always said they were older and more mature, adding their age in their original world with their age in the novel\u2019s world. But experience and IQ couldn\u2019t be counted as age.The background of this world that Jin Yuqi incarnated into was of a school campus. Maybe when faced with her peers, Jin Yuqi had a sense of superiority. She could easily succeed and win several lovers because she only needed to compete with naive students. But when she faced the police, she was not smart enough.Jin Yuqi only poured some paint, which wasn\u2019t a criminal offense. But when she came to school, she found that her classmates looked at her with a strange gaze, the same gaze they looked at Lu Meng with before.Jin Yuqi gritted her teeth and thought, Lu Meng, it\u2019s because of you again.She had expected that Lu Meng would become everyone\u2019s enemy this time because of her frame job. However, what she had done brought serious consequences to herself in the end.\u201cWhat are you looking at!\u201d Jin Yuqi fiercely stared at the students beside her.The students who were staring shrank back in fear and ran away with their friends.Jin Yuqi had looked frightening just now and wasn\u2019t elegant or easygoing at all.Jin Yuqi ignored those students who kept whispering behind her back and went to see Shangguan Feng, resentful.She had to make sure Lu Meng was completely discredited.\u2026The police had found out that Jin Yuqi poured the oil paint initially, but not who poured the oil paint that was mixed with the blood. And no corpse was found at the school either. Ming Shu, who was suspected at first, was proven innocent in the end because she didn\u2019t have the motivation and time to do anything.So the investigation had to be delayed.The school was afraid that worse things would happen among students. So without evidence, it was announced that the oil paint mixed with the human blood was a mere prank and the human blood was taken from a hospital and had not come from anyone specific.Because no corpse had been found, most students believed it and were pacified by the announcement. The police also didn\u2019t deny the announcement and investigated in secret.As the mid-term exams approached, the attention of the students was diverted and less people discussed this matter.The mid-terms were strict. Ming Shu lay prone and looked at the test paper, unwilling to answer any questions at all.When the exam period was about over, she quickly began to answer and turned her test in as the bell rang.When all the subjects were finished, Ming Shu became energetic once again. She went to buy snacks with Ye Miaomiao. I can eat happily at last, Ming Shu thought.As soon as they arrived at the school\u2019s shop, they saw Cheng Yan come out with many snacks. Ye Miaomiao poked Ming Shu secretly and thought that many people said that Cheng Yan was pursuing Mengmeng.\u201cFinished your test? It\u2019s for you.\u201d Cheng Yan gave the snacks to Ming Shu, a roguish smile on his face that elicited excited shouts from the girl students hanging around.\u201c\u2026\u201d I would ever choose a guy doesn\u2019t show up when he should, Ming Shu thought.Liked it?

The corners of his mouth trembled. She ignored him again! Ignored him again! Ignored him again!Was he so easily ignored?She ignored him every time!Cheng Yan threw the snacks to another girl nearby. Then, ignoring the girl\u2019s excited shout, he followed Ming Shu to the shop.\u201cCheng Yan!\u201d\u201cOh my God, I saw Cheng Yan at school today!\u201dAs Cheng Yan went in, the shouts from the girls emerged one by one.Carrying a shopping basket, Ming Shu threw snacks inside quickly. Cheng Yan watched her for a while, then walked forward to take the basket. \u201cI\u2019ll hold it for you, is that okay?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d Ming Shu caught one side of the basket and refused to hand it over to Cheng Yan, smiling.Should you dare to take away my snacks, I\u2019ll hit you, you fool.\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to serve you.\u201d Cheng Yan gripped the basket as well, not giving up.\u201cThere are many people waiting for your servitude.\u201d Ming Shu beckoned Cheng Yan to look at the other side where many girl students were watching him. Hearing Ming Shu\u2019s words, all those girls looked forward to Cheng Yan\u2019s servitude.\u201cBut I only want to serve you,\u201d Cheng Yan said seriously. \u201cCan\u2019t you consider my offer?\u201dMing Shu let the basket go suddenly. \u201cLiushui, please get another basket for me.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Ye Miaomiao, browsing in another isle, answered.Ming Shu forced a polite smile and left.You want that basket? Okay, I\u2019ll give it to you. I don\u2019t want it.\u201c\u2026\u201d How do I pursue her when she\u2019s so different from other girls? Are there any tips?Not daring to take away Ming Shu\u2019s shopping basket again, Cheng Yan followed her quietly. \u201cLu Meng, how do you view the oil paint case at school?\u201d\u201cNo opinion.\u201d Ming Shu put several boxes of yogurt into the basket as she replied.\u201cLu Meng.\u201d Cheng Yan bent close to Ming Shu. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that you\u2019re involved too. Although you\u2019ve been removed as a suspect, this matter hasn\u2019t been solved. Do you think you can escape it completely?\u201dBang!Covering his eyes, Cheng Yan felt depressed. You hit me whenever you\u2019re displeased. Can\u2019t we have a nice chat?Ming Shu took back her fist, her smile gentle and soft. \u201cIf you come close to me again, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dBut her words were not gentle and soft at all.Cheng Yan watched Ming Shu go to check out with Ye Miaomiao who smiled and chatted but turned to glance at him from time to time. It seemed she was talking about Cheng Yan with Ming Shu.And Ming Shu smiled as usual, her true feeling unrevealed. She just replied to Ye Miaomiao occasionally, which prompted Ye Miaomiao to laugh heartily.She is just a normal student when looked at from a distance. But why is she so fierce after close contact?Alas\u2026I failed N+1 times.I need to change my methods.The scores of the mid-term exams were released soon. What surprised them most was that Lu Meng, the straight-A student, barely passed in most subjects and failed in Chinese, Politics, and History.She! Had! Failed!What was the matter with the straight-A student?Ming Shu wasn\u2019t the number one; Jin Yuqi took her place in their year.In the past, Jin Yuqi\u2019s grades weren\u2019t bad, but they weren\u2019t very good either. Her ranking was almost the same as Ming Shu\u2019s ranking as of now. But now she had become the number one.Did Jin Yuqi and Lu Meng exchange their names?\u201cBefore I was thinking that Jin Yuqi turned good. Surprisingly, she didn\u2019t change at all. Did she pretend? That she said she didn\u2019t like Senior Jiang must be her plan to win Senior Jiang\u2019s love.\u201d\u201cYes. In the past, she liked Senior Jiang so much and always entangled herself with him. All of a sudden, she didn\u2019t pursue Senior Jiang anymore and became close with Shangguan Feng who grew up with Lu Meng. If not for her, Shangguan Feng and Lu Meng wouldn\u2019t have such a bad relationship. She\u2019s so malicious.\u201d\u201cShe got such a high score this time, did she cheat? Her grades weren\u2019t so good before.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dBecause of the oil paint case, many students were dissatisfied with Jin Yuqi. There was much gossip about her at school. This time, when she became the number one student, she obtained Hatred Points from others.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dThe students who were discussing just now looked behind them to find that Jin Yuqi was staring at them with an angry face. They glanced into each others\u2019 eyes and left with their heads down.Jin Yuqi looked at the score list on the bulletin board. Lu Meng\u2019s name was obvious, as if bolded.She took out her cell phone, found Shangguan Feng\u2019s number, and dialed.\u201cA\u2019Feng, have you thought about what I said last time?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s not so good\u2026\u201d Shangguan Feng hesitated.\u201cHah, A\u2019Feng, didn\u2019t you say you could do anything for me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Shangguan Feng hesitated for a while longer, then agreed under Jin Yuqi\u2019s threat of hanging up. \u201cOkay, I promise.\u201dMing Shu received an unexpected score and was asked to have a talk with the teacher and headmaster separately.Believing that Ming Shu must have been influenced by the oil paint case, the headmaster comforted her saying not to care too much about the score this time and get a good score the next time, and that what happened recently had nothing to do with students and their task was only to study.Ming Shu agreed carelessly. Thinking about her snacks all the time, Ming Shu didn\u2019t hear what the headmaster said.\u201cOkay, you can go back.\u201d The headmaster waved his hands, indicating for Ming Shu to leave.\u201cBye, Headmaster.\u201dMing Shu left the office as a beautiful woman walked toward it. She smiled gently at Ming Shu, then entered the office after knocking on the door.The woman was called Shi Yaxin, the English teacher of the junior department. She was gentle and always spoke up for her students, which gained her popularity.Ming Shu thought for a while. Then she found a place to squat down and eat.Shi Yaxin spoke with the headmaster for a long time, then came out when classes were over. Ming Shu followed her to the junior department, where students always looked downhearted and the atmosphere was depressive.Ming Shu moved her gaze between those students who walked together and those students who walked alone. Compared with the students who were accompanied, those on their own were more downhearted.While she was looking at the students, Shi Yaxin had left.Ming Shu felt strange and walked around for a while.Today was the day when the mid-term exam results were released. The student rankings were posted in the corridor of the junior department. The grades of most students were extremely bad. Only a few got decent grades.\u201cSenior Sister?\u201dMing Shu looked around. A thin, weak girl was standing behind her and looking at her fearfully. The uniform of the junior department was different from the uniform of the senior department in color, so this student could easily tell that Ming Shu was of the senior department.Ming Shu smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201dThe girl student relaxed at Ming Shu\u2019s gentle and harmless smile. She looked around and swallowed. \u201cSenior Sister, what are you doing here?\u201dMing Shu chose a random explanation: \u201cI\u2019m lost.\u201d\u201cWell, Senior Sister, go this way and you\u2019ll get back to the senior department soon. It\u2019s been a long time since classes finished. Senior Sister, go now.\u201d The girl student showed Ming Shu the way.Ming Shu looked in the direction the girl indicated. It was a side path through which Ming Shu could return to the senior apartment, but she couldn\u2019t know the exact place she would end up at. It wasn\u2019t the same path she came from.\u201cSenior Sister, how about I lead the way?\u201d Seeing that Ming Shu didn\u2019t reply to her, the girl made this suggestion, head tilted.\u201cLu Meng.\u201d Cheng Yan showed up suddenly. He caught her arm with a tight grip and said to the girl, \u201cThank you, we\u2019ll go back together.\u201dSeeing a boy student appear, the girl was surprised.

His strength was surprisingly great, enough that Ming Shu couldn\u2019t free herself from his grip.At this moment, Ming Shu discovered that Cheng Yan seemed to have hidden his strength before.In less realistic words, was he giving in to her?This idea was really too impractical.Leaving the junior department, when they arrived at a rather remote place, Cheng Yan threw Ming Shu against the wall, with one hand propped up beside her. He looked at her with a kabe-don posture. \u201cWhy were you in the junior department?\u201d\u201cWhy were you in the junior department?\u201d Ming Shu asked instead of answering his question.He didn\u2019t come from the direction of the senior department, which meant he had been there before she arrived.\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to go to the junior department!\u201d Cheng Yan said in a dignified tone, just like before when he warned her not to go to the old teaching building. \u201cLu Meng, I won\u2019t harm you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the secret hidden in the junior department?\u201d Ming Shu leaned close to Cheng Yan, a big smile blooming in her eyes. \u201cWhat is worthy of such a formal warning?\u201dCheng Yan pressed on Ming Shu\u2019s shoulders, pushing her back against the wall, and looked into her eyes. \u201cLu Meng, why do you always ignore my feelings? Always doubting me, thinking I have some other purpose?\u201d\u201cDo you not?\u201d Ming Shu pushed his hand away, slightly raising her head.\u201cI don\u2019t. I just want to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d Cheng Yan looked particularly serious. \u201cJust believe me for once, all right?\u201dMing Shu shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201dCheng Yan seemed a little self-indulgent. \u201cFine. No matter whether you believe me or not, I won\u2019t give up.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201d Ming Shu pushed him away, then straightened her school uniform.Cheng Yan dragged her back with force. \u201cLu Meng, I\u2019ll say this one last time. You\u2019re not allowed to go to the junior department.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re annoying!\u201dMing Shu swung her fist at Cheng Yan while Cheng Yan subconsciously moved his head to one side, the fist flying past his cheek. Because of his body\u2019s conditioned reflexes, Cheng Yan wanted to fight back, but he suppressed the impulse in the end, only avoiding his face being hit.\u201cCheng Yan, you are not telling the truth.\u201d Ming Shu threw Cheng Yan onto the ground and squatted beside him, her fingers poking his chest. \u201cYou are far stronger than what you\u2019ve shown, right? Why don\u2019t you fight back?\u201dCheng Yan took Ming Shu\u2019s hand and sat up, propping up his body. \u201cIt\u2019s not something a man should do\u2014fight back against the girl he likes.\u201dMing Shu pulled back her own hand fiercely, giving Cheng Yan a cold look. \u201cCheng Yan, don\u2019t be delusional. Are you trying to fool me like I\u2019m a three-year-old kid?\u201dCheng Yan said he liked her, but he was acting too deliberately, like it was not real at all.Before, when Jiang Xun looked at her with amorous eyes, that was truly liking\u2026 although the one he liked was not her.Ming Shu grabbed her schoolbag from the ground and got up, dropping Cheng Yan a condescending smile. \u201cCheng Yan, don\u2019t let me see you around. If you piss me off, I will destroy you without mercy.\u201dThis was not a threat, but worse than a threat.\u2026Cheng Yan hadn\u2019t appeared since that day. It was a routine disappearance. But his errand boys still showed up before Ming Shu to deliver breakfast and snacks.\u201cMengmeng, how are things going between you and Cheng Yan?\u201d Ye Miaomiao showed great interest in gossiping.\u201cNot very well.\u201d What would happen between me and that nerd with evil designs? Nothing.\u201cDon\u2019t you like him?\u201d Ye Miaomiao made eyes at Ming Shu. \u201cCheng Yan is handsome! His grades are not very good, but I heard he has a great family background, so it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201dYe Miaomiao doubted it. \u201cI think Cheng Yan cares about you a lot. He buys you breakfast and snacks everyday, which he never did for any other girl before. Mengmeng, you don\u2019t like him? Are you concealing your real feelings? Come on, tell me about it. I\u2019m your friend and I won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\u201cHe cares about me?\u201d Ming Shu grunted. \u201cLiushui, do you have a misunderstanding concerning boys who care about girls?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Ye Miaomiao shook her head.\u201cHe did send these things, but did he show up in person? Sending his two followers here means he cares?\u201d Such care I don\u2019t find flattering.Thinking for a while, Ye Miaomiao said: \u201cBut every time he appears, you\u2019ll either beat him or ignore him. Even so, he hasn\u2019t given up on you, that\u2019s true love!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d I\u2019m not going to debate with her. This is what\u2019s called a chicken and a duck trying to communicate, getting nowhere.Most importantly\u2014I\u2019m not fond of him, not at all!\u201cLu Meng, someone told me to give you this.\u201d A classmate put an envelope on the table in front ofMing Shu.Ye Miaomiao came to see. \u201cWho wrote a love letter to you?\u201dMing Shu took the envelope to check it over, yet not a word was written on the surface. She opened it. There was letter paper inside, and the handwriting was one she recognized.Shangguan Feng, that annoying scarecrow.He asked Ming Shu to meet at the old teaching building, saying he had something to tell her.Shangguan Feng\u2026What does this little goblin want to scheme\u2026\u201cMengmeng, you aren\u2019t going, are you?\u201d Ye Miaomiao got anxious as soon as she saw Ming Shu packing up her things. \u201cShangguan Feng must be planning something evil. Earlier you made a massive fool of him, you can\u2019t go.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go get something to eat.\u201d\u201cAh, to eat.\u201d Ye Miaomiao sighedIt was a relief that she wasn\u2019t going to see Shangguan Feng. He chose the old teaching building to meet, and that kind of place clearly revealed his evil intentions.\u201cBut wait, Mengmeng, weren\u2019t you just eating snacks in class? Now you\u2019re going to eat again?\u201d Ye Miaomiao yelled from behind Ming Shu.Recently, her Mengmeng had been eating too much, but she didn\u2019t get any fatter. Where did that food go?Eating without getting fat was a really easy way to obtain Hatred Points.Feeling her plump waist, Ye Miaomiao suppressed the desire to eat along with Ming Shu, swallowing saliva. She had to control her eating, otherwise she would get fat.Hearing the mournful howl of Ye Miaomiao behind her, Ming Shu curled her lips and happily went down the stairs. After she finished eating in the school canteen, she held the letter and deliberated for a long time, and finally she decided to go have a look. Ming Shu walked toward the old teaching building.It was time for class at this point, so no one was hanging around the school. Ming Shu stopped at her destination, an unprovoked gruesome feeling rising inside her.She went up along the stairs. This building was between the senior and junior departments.Initially, there wasn\u2019t a junior department in this school. The teaching building of the junior department over there was built afterward, with this old teaching building as the divider The junior department could be seen from the old teaching buildingThe first two times, Ming Shu came here during evening, so she didn\u2019t pay much attention to the specific appearance of this building.Now arriving upstairs, Ming Shu noticed many scratches on the staircase wall. If there was only one or two of them, it might have been drawn by someone deliberately. But there were many such scratches on the wall, varying from old to new.She held out her hand to mimic them, trying to find out how the scratches were made. But the angle and height both seemed incorrect. She bent down a little.After a moment, Ming Shu took back her hand, her smile growing more and more brilliant. \u201cThis school really is interesting.\u201dLiked it?

So Ming Shu arrived ahead of time, hiding in a secluded spot and waiting to see what he would do.It was in a classroom on the third floor. Ming Shu sat there, waiting.About half an hour later, the sound of footsteps came from the staircase. It sounded a bit hesitant, at a very slow speed.Ming Shu leaned forward to have a look. Shangguan Feng showed up at the top of the stairs. He looked around with a refined expression and stood for a while before opening a classroom door.Ming Shu sat still in the corner and didn\u2019t stop eating her snacks. After a moment, some noise came from the classroom.\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve arrived here, she hasn\u2019t come\u2026 Yuqi, are we really going to do this?\u201dIt seemed the person on the other side had said something, and Shangguan Feng began to coax in a light and nervous tone.Hanging up the phone, Shangguan Feng sighed heavily. He was smoking, leaned against the shabby table and wondering whether it was right to do this. But thinking Jin Yuqi might get angry, he had no other choice.He would do anything as long as it made Jin Yuqi happy.Ming Shu waited for a little longer, then walked to the classroom door, adjusting her clothes\u2014and fiercely kicked the door open.Because it had aged, the door was kicked down by Ming Shu.It smashed against the floor with a big bang , sending dust into the air.\u201cShangguan Feng, what do you want?\u201d The mild voice of the girl sounded through the dust. Not angrily, but with a faint smiling undertone.Shangguan Feng was probably startled by the sudden appearance of Ming Shu. His expression was extremely brilliant. Upon hearing the voice of Ming Shu, he quickly returned to himself and squeezed a smile onto his face. \u201cMengmeng, you\u2019re here.\u201dWow!Shangguan Feng called me this! Does he want to scare me to death so as to inherit my snacks?Ming Shu didn\u2019t go in, but stood at the doorway smiling and said, \u201cJust say it quickly. My time is very precious. Wasting my time is wasting my life, which you can\u2019t afford.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d If it wasn\u2019t for Yuqi, he would never speak a word to this woman ever again. Shangguan Feng suppressed his inner impatience. \u201cMengmeng, do we have to have such a difficult relationship?\u201dMing Shu glanced up at Shangguan Feng with smiling eyes. Her lips parted slightly and her words smashed into the dust flying around the room. \u201cYes, we do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d How should I reply to this?Taking a deep breath, Shangguan Feng said, \u201cMengmeng, I\u2019m here to reconcile with you today. I know that recently you\u2019ve been wronged and it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d\u201cReconcile?\u201d Ming Shu lifted her slender eyebrows, showing her smiling eyes. \u201cAre you kidding me? After what\u2019s happened between us, you really think it\u2019s possible for us to reconcile?\u201dIf I were to believe you then my brain must have been blocked by pig\u2019s feet.\u201cMengmeng, I know you\u2019re angry. If you want to beat or scold me, I will accept. But can you forgive me this time? I promise I\u2019ll take care of you later.\u201d Shangguan Feng said this according to previous lines. With such sincere words, it seemed he was really regretful.Ming Shu\u2019s smile widened. \u201cOkay, how about letting me beat you first?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t come to be beaten.But what was revealed in her expression seemed to be serious. Was he really going to be beaten by her?\u201cMengmeng\u2026\u201d\u201cYou just said it.\u201d Ming Shu interrupted Shangguan Feng in a delighted voice. \u201cShangguan Feng, won\u2019t you forget what you just said instantly? If so, I cannot believe you.\u201dShangguan Feng, faced with Ming Shu\u2019s smile, which always gave her a cold edge, felt his deepest thoughts seemed to have been read by her.\u201cFine!\u201d Shangguan Feng agreed, gritting his teeth. \u201cAs long as you can forgive me, I\u2019m willing to help vent your anger.\u201dSo be it! He would just be beaten once. He was a man; if he couldn\u2019t bear this, then he couldn\u2019t be considered one.Ming Shu came forward, one hand grasping his wrist, preparing to give him a lesson. But she couldn\u2019t help wondering, what kind of magic potion Jin Yuqi had made this man drink, that he would suffer for her? Or was it that the aura of a fake protagonist could be comparable to the real protagonist\u2019s aura?[The aura of a fake protagonist is the same as the protagonist\u2019s. Don\u2019t underestimate it, Guest.] The Harmony System explained patiently.A few rays of excitement shone from Ming Shu\u2019s eyes. Interesting .[\u2026] What was interesting?\u2026Near the old teaching building\u2026Jin Yuqi and several of her classmates were heading in this direction. They toured the surroundings and seemed to be looking for something.\u201cThe animal was just seen coming this way, how could it disappear in the blink of an eye? That silk scarf was a gift from my father, I can\u2019t lose it,\u201d one of the girls said anxiously.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, let\u2019s keep searching. It should be in the vicinity.\u201d Jin Yuqi comforted her, eyes naturally resting on the old teaching building. \u201cUsually there aren\u2019t many people hanging around the old teaching building. Those stray dogs and cats probably use it as shelter. Let\u2019s go have a look.\u201d\u201cThat building\u2026\u201d Some timid girls revealed faces full of fear. \u201cIt always has a spooky feeling.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s so many people here so there\u2019s no need to be scared. We will go together.\u201d Jin Yuqi comforted them again.Everyone felt a lot more relieved as they stayed together. They all walked toward the old teaching building.Yet they didn\u2019t find anything from the first floor to the second floor. Jin Yuqi proposed they continue to go up. Since they had searched the second floor, going up to the third floor was not a big deal. Later, a group of people followed Jin Yuqi, moving up to the third floor.Jin Yuqi was ahead of them, walking directly to the appointed classroom. But in front of her was just a fallen door lying on the ground and no one in the classroom.Jin Yuqi\u2019s stomach dropped as she saw this scene. Was something wrong?Just when she was about to call Shangguan Feng, a faint sound emerged from the next classroom suddenly. It sounded like groaning, and also like a hum of pain.Jin Yuqi immediately wore an excited look on her face, but then she quickly hid it. In a deliberately low and questioning voice, she asked, \u201cDid you hear any strange voice just now?\u201dEveryone nodded as they all heard it.\u201cLet\u2019s go and see\u2026\u201d\u201cOh no, forget about it. What if it\u2019s something unthinkable.\u201d\u201cIn broad daylight, what\u2019s something unthinkable? Don\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d Jin Yuqi retorted. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll go.\u201dJin Yuqi walked to the classroom where the voice was coming from. The abandoned students looked at each other for a moment, then caught up to her in a trot. At the front, Jin Yuqi gently curled her lips. Lu Meng, you\u2019re dead this time.Kacha.Squeak\u2014The door opened, making a harsh sound.\u201cAh!\u201d As soon as the classroom door was completely open, the girls at the back screamed loudly. Then with flushed faces, they covered their eyes and turned around.Meanwhile the boys were shocked, clapping eyes upon the scene in the classroom.It was like Jin Yuqi had been pinned on the spot. What happened?Why is there only Shangguan Feng? Where is Lu Meng, that bitch?Probably disturbed by the sudden noise, Shangguan Feng regained a little consciousness. He barely opened his eyes. Yet after recognizing the people standing at the door, he suddenly felt a lightning strike inside.She brought so many people here?Shangguan Feng subconsciously tried to cover his body, but his clothes had been taken away by Ming Shu. Now he was totally naked and being looked at by so many classmates who had been led here by Jin Yuqi.All of a sudden, humiliation and anger struck all his nerves.However, the angrier he was, the more uncomfortable he became, and he desperately wanted to vent his desire.Liked it?

She didn\u2019t tell him what was dissolved in the water. He believed her, so he just did what he was told without any doubts.But he didn\u2019t know anything until now.Besides, he didn\u2019t drink the water but had such a reaction as well. How? he wondered. It must have been before he left when he ate the food given by her that he fell into her trap.She intended to humiliate him together with Lu Meng. Watched by so many people, naked and having sex with someone in the old teaching building, how could he stay in this school afterward? How would he face people\u2019s talking?Jin Yuqi was stunned only for a moment. Then she turned around, pretending she didn\u2019t know anything.Seeing this, Shangguan Feng became even angrier. He stood up from the floor with the last of his strength, staggering toward the door.\u201cShangguan Feng, are you okay?\u201d The male students apparently knew Shangguan Feng, and without thinking much, they asked him this concernedly, preparing to come and cover him up.Taking the chance while he was unnoticed, Shangguan Feng swiftly grabbed Jin Yuqi and dragged her into the classroom, his eyes shooting an angry glare. The door was closed and locked without difficulty.The students outside were shocked for a moment before falling upon the door, hitting it. \u201cShangguan Feng, what do you want to do? Open the door!\u201d\u201cShangguan Feng, open the door.\u201d\u201cYuqi.\u201d\u201cShangguan Feng, what are you doing, let me go. Ah!\u201d Jin Yuqi screamed. \u201cHelp.\u201d\u201cBreak the door.\u201dScreams and pounding noises mixed with each other, creating endless chaos.The classroom door didn\u2019t stand for long because of its age. It was broken open by students\u2019 co-efforts. Then on the floor of the room, they saw Shangguan Feng on top of Jin Yuqi, twisting his body violently. He seemed to be in a crazy state. They immediately worked together to pull him away.In a panic, Jin Yuqi confusedly tugged her skirt to cover her thighs. With a trembling body and a stunned expression, she curled her arms around her knees and crouched in a corner. Her eyes tightly stared at Shangguan Feng, who was struggling and roaring like an animal.The dust on the ground was dotted with drops of blood. Several girls looked at each other with different thoughts in mind, then went over to care for Jin Yuqi.The boys were almost at the limit of their ability to control Shangguan Feng. At last, they had no other choice but to call the faculty.Several teachers hurried over only to encounter such a scene. With dizzy minds and shocked faces, they quickly ordered a few students to send the mad Shangguan Feng to the infirmary.Then a party of people hurried downstairs. Just as they walked out of the old teaching building, a dark shadow fell down from above. Putong! Something smashed on the ground heavily, splashing drops of warm blood all over them.\u201cAh\u2014\u201d\u2026Having been shocked twice, Jin Yuqi\u2019s whole person appeared dull. Shangguan Feng was still in a coma.The school intended to hide what happened in the old teaching building, but the incident where someone jumped off the building that happened later surely had exposed everything between Jin Yuqi and Shangguan Feng.Students who were present there then couldn\u2019t give a clear and exact explanation of the whole thing either. It began with a silk scarf, which was quite expensive and was carried off by a dog. The owner of the scarf begged them to help her look for it.Then they marched near the old teaching building and found Shangguan Feng naked in the classroom. Shangguan Feng was so crazy that he dragged Jin Yuqi into the classroom\u2026What happened next was already known.They ran into a suicide case, a leap from the old building.According to the investigation, the girl who jumped to her death was from the junior department. The police also found that the girl had many scars on her body. Some were new, some looked like they had been there for a long time.The truth was revealed shortly this time.No school could escape from violence; this school was no exception. Because of unbearable bullying, the girl jumped from the building. The matter quieted down after those students involved had been taken away. In the end, the only story that passed around concerned Jin Yuqi and Shangguan Feng, who were doing this or that in the old teaching building.Fortunately, Shangguan Feng and Jin Yuqi had been suspended, or they would be angered to death after hearing this gossip.Ye Miaomiao always had a feeling that something was wrong. After thinking for a long time, she finally surrendered to her own gossiping fire. \u201cMengmeng, why would Shangguan Feng and Jin Yuqi do that kind of thing in the old teaching building?\u201dMing Shu stilled her hand, holding a chocolate bean motionlessly. She shook her head, chuckling. \u201cHow would I know.\u201d\u201cMengmeng.\u201d Ye Miaomiao stuck her face inches from Ming Shu\u2019s, smiling evilly. \u201cYou were absent the day when this happened. Earlier Shangguan Feng asked you out, and later this happened, you tell me you don\u2019t know?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why, but she had a premonition that Ming Shu must know something.\u201cKnowing too much, you will be\u2026\u201d Ming Shu made a motion of cutting the throat.Ye Miaomiao protected her neck quickly with both hands. She curled her lips with shifting eyes and asked, \u201cMengmeng, have you heard about the girl who jumped from the old teaching building?\u201dIf you don\u2019t want to talk about Shangguan Feng, then I\u2019ll change to another topic. There\u2019s no problem with this, right?\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWell, I heard some back-alley news.\u201d Ye Miaomiao sat next to Ming Shu, naturally reaching for the chocolate beans. Ming Shu stared at Ye Miaomiao\u2019s hand, restraining the strong urge to stop her.Ye Miaomiao said while eating, \u201cYou know, the junior department was built afterward. It was completely different from our senior department, which belongs to the municipal key school. They say most students accepted in the junior department have good grades, but poor family backgrounds. The suicidal girl was from a rural area. Rumors said she and a teacher were having an affair. She killed herself because she couldn\u2019t bear the pressure of being talked about over a supposedly improper relationship with the teacher, not because of violence! It\u2019s not suicide!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Ming Shu responded uninterestedly.\u201cHey, Mengmeng, aren\u2019t you surprised?\u201d Ye Miaomiao poked Ming Shu. \u201cThe rumor has been spread to our senior department, many people are talking about it.\u201dYe Miaomiao didn\u2019t understand why Mengmeng had been behaving a little strangely these days. Sometimes she was very interested in one thing, and even though her excitement had an odd quality, she was eager to engage; but sometimes she just showed zero interest in other things\u2026Well, it seems she will always be uninterested when she\u2019s eating.Ye Miaomiao nabbed the chocolate beans from Ming Shu\u2019s hands. \u201cMengmeng, are you listening to me?\u201dHer hands empty, Ming Shu first stared at her lonely hands for a moment, then moved her eyes to Ye Miaomiao.Although she was wearing a smile on her face, it seemed something horrible was hiding deep inside her eyes. Ye Miaomiao felt a bit terrified under such a stare, which made her subconsciously want to return the chocolate beans to their owner.Ming Shu then dropped her eyes, calmly pulling out a packet of dried mango from the desk.Ye Miaomiao held the chocolate beans, her hand moist with cold sweat as for a moment she thought Mengmeng was going to beat her.Ming Shu tore the packaging of the dried mango, her soft smiling voice ringing out: \u201cThe bloody paint in the hallway and the suicidal jump from the old teaching building, these two things must be linked. But Liushui, I advise you not to get involved. It may kill you.\u201dYe Miaomiao tightened her grip on the chocolate beans bag slightly, gulping. She asked, \u201cMengmeng, do you know something?\u201dMing Shu smiled, but didn\u2019t answer.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The bloodstain had been cleaned up. If it wasn\u2019t for the yellow tape, no one could imagine that there had been a suicide case here.Ming Shu ducked beneath the yellow tape and walked up to the rooftop.The old teaching building had six floors in total, not very high. Its rooftop was littered with random piles of debris.Ming Shu went to the spot the girl jumped down from, bending over to peer below.Then suddenly her whole body was pulled back by a tug on her collar. Ming Shu turned around to see Cheng Yan\u2019s handsome and shining face.With an aggressive smile, Ming Shu slapped Cheng Yan\u2019s hand aside and swiftly gave him a punch in the belly. Cheng Yan slightly moved his body to avoid the fist and easily grasped it.\u201cLu Meng, are you sure you want to welcome me with such great passion?\u201d\u201cIf you stop haunting me, I\u2019ll stop being so passionate.\u201d Ming Shu jerked hard to break free from his grip, pulling his arm in a shoulder throw.\u201c\u2026\u201d Why does she like doing this.Ming Shu stepped on Cheng Yan\u2019s chest, bending her body with two hands propped on her knees. She said with a smile, \u201cCheng Yan, you ignored my words again and again. Are you testing my bottom line?\u201d Her gentle tone carried an intoxicating air, like a breeze blowing past his cheek.\u201cLu Meng, do you remember that I also told you not to come here?\u201d Cheng Yan stared back at Ming Shu. Her eyes were always smiling, but one couldn\u2019t discern her real thoughts and emotions at all.\u201cWho do you think you are? Do I have to obey what you say?\u201dDo you think you are a god?I have to abide by whatever you say?\u201cIt\u2019s good for you.\u201d\u201cDo you know what I want?\u201dCheng Yan had never asked what she wanted and what she wanted to do. All he had done was treat her blindly according to his own intentions. He interfered with her behavior under the veneer of protecting her, which was especially annoying.Cheng Yan frowned, silent for a moment, then asked, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cWhy do I have to tell you?\u201d Ming Shu took back her foot. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything else to do, just go away already. Don\u2019t disturb my eating.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Eating? Did he get it wrong?She was the first to eat at a crime scene.Climbing up from the floor, Cheng Yan brushed some dirt off his school uniform. As he saw Ming Shu really pulling out snacks to eat, his mouth twitched a little. He then walked to the edge of the rooftop, took a deep breath, and said, \u201cThat girl jumped from here. The police said it was suicide. Do you think so?\u201dNow that one way was blocked, he would take another. He didn\u2019t believe that he couldn\u2019t track down the killer!Ming Shu just glanced at him, uninterested. She didn\u2019t say a word until she had finished eating a pack of snacks. With a faint voice, she said, \u201cShe did commit suicide.\u201dCheng Yan frowned deeply. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201dShe was overconfident to say that, as if she had already known the answer.\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d Ming Shu paused for a moment and her smile widened. \u201cI saw it with my own eyes.\u201dWhat?Returning to the day of the incident\u2026Ming Shu beat Shangguan Feng fiercely before taking off his clothes and throwing him into the classroom. Then she went to the rooftop, eating snacks as she waited for an entertaining show.In the middle of her eating, someone suddenly ran up crying, moving straight to the edge of the rooftop. Ming Shu was sitting on the other side of the rooftop, blocked by the debris, so the girl didn\u2019t notice her.She stood alone at the edge of the rooftop, crying for a long time, which annoyed Ming Shu a lot. She was in no mood to eat anything. Ming Shu stood up and walked over to the girl along the roof\u2019s edge, giving a standard smile. \u201cCan you stop crying? It\u2019s impolite to disturb others\u2019 eating.\u201dThe girl seemed to be startled by her sudden appearance. She stared at Ming Shu with tearful eyes.Ming Shu still had some impression of her face. She was the girl who showed her the way to the junior department before.\u201cUgh, it\u2019s you.\u201d Ming Shu walked steadily from the edge of the rooftop toward the girl. Her eyes seemed to contain the warm spring sunshine. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d The girl opened her mouth and said in a subtle voice, \u201cSenior Sister\u2026 I\u2019m fine.\u201dMing Shu turned around and walked back. \u201cIf you\u2019re fine, then stop crying. You disturbed my eating.\u201dThe girl stood where she was. She watched Ming Shu disappear behind the debris, then clutched her clothes and carefully moved over there. Slipping between the piles, she saw Ming Shu sitting in a spot near the inside part of the rooftop, many snacks at hand.\u201cSenior Sister\u2026\u201d She asked cautiously, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\u201cEating snacks,\u201d Ming Shu answered.The girl looked at the snacks in front of Ming Shu. She stood still for a long time, not knowing what she was wondering.\u201cSince you don\u2019t want to die, go back to class. Don\u2019t stand here, because I won\u2019t share my snacks with you.\u201dThe girl smiled for some unknown reason. \u201cSenior Sister, I didn\u2019t intend to eat your snacks.\u201d\u201cEven if you did, I won\u2019t give you any.\u201d The food protector Ming Shu was online.The girl was amused again, but soon the smile on her face became miserable. She looked away and toward the cloud in the distance. \u201cSenior Sister, do you know the feeling of being dead?\u201dMing Shu looked up at her. Tears were silently falling down the girl\u2019s cheeks. Her overcast eyes, which were supposed to be vibrant, now were filled with despair and pain.The girl wiped away her tears and sobbed, \u201cSister, I\u2019m so envious of your senior department.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your junior department? Tell me, perhaps I can help you.\u201dWhat\u2019s the secret hidden in the junior department? It\u2019s forcing students to commit suicide?The girl shook her head and bent over in a 90-degree bow to Ming Shu. \u201cThank you, Sister.\u201dFinishing this sentence, the girl turned around and left. She walked back to the place where she had been standing, her eyes pointed in the direction of the junior department.She was still standing there when Ming Shu ate up her snacks and left. But after she watched those two\u2019s entertaining show, the girl jumped from the building.Ming Shu was sure there was only the girl herself on the rooftop when she left. Although the girl had struggled, she was dead in her heart. Thus, it was not a murder: she committed suicide.Cheng Yan\u2019s gaze became complicated and his voice lowered a bit. \u201cSince you knew she wanted to commit suicide, why didn\u2019t you stop her?\u201dMing Shu tilted her head with a subtle smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d When she left, the girl was just standing on the rooftop. She didn\u2019t make any move to jump off. It totally made sense for Ming Shu to say she didn\u2019t know.\u201c\u2026\u201d I really don\u2019t know how to describe this girl . Cheng Yan took a deep breath. \u201cI found some clues at the junior department. Do you want to know?\u201d\u201cWill you be so kind as to tell me?\u201dCheng Yan felt helpless. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t tell you, you will search for yourself. It\u2019s better for me to tell you than put you in danger.\u201dMing Shu pondered for a while, then nodded with a smile. \u201cGreat.\u201dCheng Yan was somewhat relieved. Sometimes she just didn\u2019t follow the logic of normal people. He was really afraid she wouldn\u2019t agree.But\u2026Now she agreed, which made his heart even more uncertain.\u201cAhem\u2026 well, now we are partners?\u201d Cheng Yan asked carefully.\u201cIf you think so,\u201d Ming Shu said without much care.\u201c\u2026\u201d Why is it so hard to chase a girl!What about capturing her heart with flowers? Being the Prince Charming?What about marrying her after saving her life? Being the hero?Lies!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But I found these students are very reluctant, even scared of making up classes. Some will be terrified hearing others unintentionally speak the words \u2018making up lessons.\u2019\u201dCheng Yan led Ming Shu to the junior department. \u201cThe head of the junior department is Pan Zhiguo, who is having an affair with Shi Yaxin. I followed him several times. Before, when you saw me in the school, I was trailing him. And the two voices you heard that second time, it was Pan Zhiguo and Shi Yaxin.\u201dCheng Yan finished talking, but then found Ming Shu was eating with rapt attention, not listening to him at all.\u201cStop eating, we\u2019re about to arrive at the junior department,\u201d Cheng Yan reminded her.Ming Shu looked up and put away the snack. \u201cWhat kind of dirty business did you find them doing?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Nothing yet.\u201d Sometimes Pan Zhiguo and Shi Yaxin went to the old teaching building, but he found they were just having secret trysts.Under the amused gaze of Ming Shu, Cheng Yan felt somehow a little awkward. He had been investigating this matter for some time, but failed to make any significant progress.It was Friday and the school had been closed for the weekend holiday. All the doors in the junior department were locked. Ming Shu and Cheng Yan climbed over the wall to get in.It seemed the security guards here were more numerous than in the senior department. Before walking further, they met two security guards patrolling around the school.School was out now, but the security guards were still patrolling, which was too unscientific.\u201cIt\u2019s over there.\u201d Cheng Yan pointed at a teaching building. The students were all making up lessons in that building.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the library?\u201d They made up lessons in the library instead of using classrooms, were they out of their minds?\u201cIt is. Classes are made up in the library every week. There\u2019s only one entrance, which is guarded, so I haven\u2019t entered,\u201d Cheng Yan explained in a whisper.The students were still in there when it grew dark. Ming Shu crouched in the flowers while eating the WantWant Crunchy Rice Balls. She was a little impatient as a result of hunger.Her snacks were eaten up.Forget about this, I\u2019m going to look for some food.Ming Shu stood up and was about to leave. Cheng Yan pulled her back by the wrist. \u201cShh!\u201dSome students started to come out of the library. Most of them walked toward the dormitory building in silence. The atmosphere was particularly depressed.Following the students, Shi Yaxin left the library with a stack of textbooks in her arms. Some slow students were frightened to see her, like mice running into a cat. They hurried to catch up with the students further ahead.\u201cFollow her.\u201d Ming Shu stared at Cheng Yan\u2019s hand which was pulling on her clothes and said, \u201cLet go of me.\u201dCheng Yan calmly released her clothes. \u201cI\u2019ve followed her but didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re stupid.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026Cheng Yan felt it was a mistake to agree to work together with Ming Shu. He thought she wanted to follow Shi Yaxin to find some clues, but it turned out\u2014Cheng Yan witnessed Ming Shu back Shi Yazhan into the corner of a dark alley. Was it too late for him to wear a silk stocking on his head?\u201cAre you students of the senior department?\u201dGreat, it\u2019s too late now.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Shi Yaxin was fairly calm. \u201cIf the school finds out you\u2019re harassing a teacher in the dark, do you know what the consequences will be?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Ming Shu studied Shi Yaxin from head to toe and answered with a smiling tone, \u201cTeacher Shi, there\u2019s no need to be nervous. Regardless, you are not a good person either.\u201dNot a good person\u2026\u201cThis student\u2026 Are you the Lu Meng from the senior department?\u201d Shi Yaxin had a small impression of this girl. She was cute and was an excellent student at the senior department. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou know it very well in your heart, don\u2019t you, Teacher Shi?\u201dThe smile on Ming Shu\u2019s face was too glaring, which made Shi Yaxin feel a bit flustered. Does she know something?Ming Shu reached out to grab Shi Yaxin\u2019s handbag.\u201cStudent Lu Meng, what are you doing!\u201d Shi Yaxin clutched her handbag tightly. \u201cYou are a good student, how can you rob someone?\u201d\u201cIf a teacher can do bad things, why can\u2019t I?\u201d Ming Shu didn\u2019t know what Shi Yaxin did, but she was good at making up things to casually rave about.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Shi Yaxin felt even more alarmed in her heart. She unintentionally loosened her grip.Ming Shu put more strength into her own, nabbing Shi Yaxin\u2019s handbag.Shi Yaxin was startled back to herself, but it was too late to take the bag back.Ming Shu dug out the cell phone from her handbag. It was locked by fingerprint. Ming Shu then violently forced Shi Yaxin to unlock the phoneThere was nothing special in the phone, but several numbers were dialed shortly after school ended.Ming Shu called one of the numbers.\u201cHello? Teacher Shi, my child has gotten home, thank you for your concern.\u201dShi Yaxin leaned against the bumpy wall behind her, her heart pounding uneasily. She didn\u2019t know what the smiling girl in front of her wanted to do, but she had a very bad feeling right then.Hearing the voice over the phone, Shi Yaxin relaxed a little unreasonably.Ming Shu dialed three numbers in succession; they were all answered by parents. It seemed Shi Yaxin was confirming whether the students had gotten home.Just as Ming Shu was about to dial the fourth number, a text message came with a ding dong sound.\u201cStudent Lu Meng, what do you want to do!?\u201d Shi Yaxin roared. \u201cI\u2019m not yourteacher, but I\u2019m a teacher at this school. Aren\u2019t you afraid of me going back to tell the headmaster about this?\u201d\u201cWell, if so, Teacher Shi has to muster the courage to tell on us.\u201d Ming Shu smiled and held the phone up before Shi Yaxin.A picture was shown on the screen, in which a little girl was standing in shadow. Below read a couple of sentences:Today\u2019s goods were great. Money has been transferred into the account, don\u2019t let me down next week.The momentum Shi Yaxin just drummed up slowed and weakened as soon as she saw the words. Her face turned pale instantly.\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is. It must have been sent by mistake.\u201d Shi Yaxin defended herself in vain.\u201cWell, maybe the girl happened to be in our school\u2019s uniform and in our school\u2019s library as well.\u201d Ming Shu spoke in a gentle voice. \u201cTeacher Shi, do you believe that?\u201dDim lights shone on Shi Yaxin. With half of her face hidden in darkness, she kept silent at first. But faced with Ming Shu\u2019s inquiry, she started to cry aloud, hands holding her head.\u201cTeacher Shi, are you feeling pained? You can put an end to this pain yourself.\u201d The gentle voice of Ming Shu seemed to be bewitching her. It lightly burrowed to the bottom of her heart, planting roots of confession.Shi Yaxin looked up and stared at the lovely girl opposite her. Those two smiling eyes seemed to carry all of her deepest secrets.\u2026Shi Yaxin was from the countryside. Her family was in poor financial condition. Thus, despite the fact she was admitted to a famous university, ultimately she went to a normal university for her younger brother.After graduation, she worked in a primary school. The salary was very low. Worse yet, the headmaster was a rogue who repeatedly harassed her. Finally, at a staff gathering, he got her drunk and brutally raped her.She wanted to eliminate the headmaster, but he had a tough background. In the end, she not only failed to punish him, but was also slandered for seducing him shamelessly. She was submerged in endless criticism.When she was about to kill herself to prove her innocence, she met Pan Zhiguo, the man who led her onto an even more terrible road.At first, Pan Zhiguo was good to her. He didn\u2019t mind what happened to her and arranged for her to teach junior students. She also thought she had met a good man. She would chuckle to herself, thinking about how she\u2019d forget the past and live a happy life with Pan Zhiguo.However, life again chose to play a huge joke on her.Liked it?

    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: League of Poor Students (25)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsMost of the students in the junior high school department were poor students who performed well academically and couldn\u2019t afford a fancy school\u2019s tuition. So this, a junior department of a famous high school that could offer discounts to students, naturally was their first choice.These students came to this school longing for academic success, but actually entered a den beyond their expectations.Pan Zhiguo would choose those students whose families were in extremely difficult financial straits and who were easily controlled. Then, on Pan Zhiguo\u2019s order, Shi Yanxin would approach them and ask them to stay after school to make up lessons with various excuses.Having an innocent and kind face that could fool others, Shi Yaxin was allowed in the school.Those students were regarded as goods and provided to scum to select.When Shi Yaxin saw the deal for the first time, she was also hugely frightened and had nightmares for several nights. After that, every time she met those students at school, she would tremble with fear.But Pan Zhiguo threatened her, saying she couldn\u2019t regret her choices and she would be treated as goods too if she didn\u2019t help him.Her task was to ask students to stay after school to make up lessons, which was much easier the second time around. And any resistant students would be brought to the old teaching building and locked inside, becoming terrified after only one horrific night.Then Pan Zhiguo would use a carrot-and-stick method and the students had to obey him.\u201cI really don\u2019t want\u2026\u201d Shi Yaxin cried so heavily that she couldn\u2019t even breathe, speaking on and off. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry for them.\u201dPlaying with the cell phone, Ming Shu continued to smile even after hearing such a story. \u201cDo you know who\u2019s doing business with Pan Zhiguo?\u201dShi Yaxin shook her head. \u201cEvery Friday, I only bring the students to the library. Those who are selected will be taken away and I\u2019ll watch the leftover students. I don\u2019t know what happens after, it\u2019s taken care of by Pan Zhiguo.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever been curious about it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Shi Yaxin seemed to remember something horrible; her face became paler. \u201cI followed him once but was found. Then\u2026 I didn\u2019t dare to try again.\u201dBeing young and with their tails caught by Pan Zhiguo, these students were easily controlled after being threatened.Shi Yaxin told them that when she came here, this business had been going on for over two years. But she didn\u2019t know when it started.After graduation, some students would directly work in Pan Zhiguo\u2019s entertainment venues. As for those who didn\u2019t obey, they would be sold, which Shi Yaxin once heard unintentionally when Pan Zhiguo was chatting on the phone.\u201cDidn\u2019t anyone investigate the missing people?\u201d Cheng Yan got a chance to ask this.A person was missing, didn\u2019t anybody call the police?\u201cPan Zhiguo\u2019s background is powerful\u2026\u201d Shi Yaxin said, \u201cand he would investigate every student\u2019s background. He never chose those students whose backgrounds are powerful or who are local. Most of the students he chose came from the countryside.\u201dMing Shu spoke with Shi Yaxin alone for a while and then let her go.\u201cLu Meng, do you realize how dangerous this is?\u201d Cheng Yan didn\u2019t agree with letting Shi Yaxin go. \u201cIf she tells Pan Zhiguo, we\u2019ll be at risk.\u201dWho supported Pan Zhiguo so as to make him so fearless? If they acted rashly and alerted them, no one could know what their enemies would do to protect themselves.\u201cResults come with risk. If we don\u2019t want to bear the risk, we won\u2019t get any results.\u201d Ming Shu left, shaking herself. \u201cAnd I like the risk.\u201dWhat she wanted was only excitement.Cheng Yan felt he couldn\u2019t catch up with her thoughts. Always when you were thinking about how to finish this step, she had skipped it already and moved on.There seemed to be a gap between ordinary people and geniuses.\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cDeal with him!\u201d How could she complete her task and get Hatred Points if she didn\u2019t deal with Pan Zhiguo.\u201c\u2026\u201d What I\u2019m asking is how to deal with Pan Zhiguo, not whether to deal with him!Cheng Yan thought. \u201cHow do we deal with him?\u201dAll romantic advice says not to deny what girls say. Even if what she says is wrong, the boy must agree with her.Scratching her head, Ming Shu was a little depressed. After a while she looked at Cheng Yan with shining eyes. \u201cCall the police?\u201d This is the easiest way.\u201cAccording to Shi Yaxin, Pan Zhiguo has powerful backers. Calling the police is unrealistic.\u201d If Pan Zhiguo really had support, it would be more difficult if they called the police.\u201cWell, how about kidnapping?\u201d If we can\u2019t ask for help from the police, we can do it ourselves.Doing things oneself, one would have ample food and clothing.Do you have any scientific and realistic ideas? You either call the police or kidnap him, do you think that the police station belongs to your family so that you could ask help from them or they would support your illegal plan? Cheng Yan thought.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it. Promise me you\u2019ll behave yourself.\u201d Cheng Yan warned Ming Shu in case she tried to kidnap Pan Zhiguo by herself.He didn\u2019t think that she was kidding just now. She really would kidnap Pan Zhiguo.Before Cheng Yan could come up with a plan, another student committed suicide at school. This time, she cut her wrists and died in the bathroom. It was said that the bathroom was full of blood when the student was discovered. The scene was shocking.And the word \u201cretribution\u201d was written in blood on the floor.Ming Shu learned this from Cheng Yan. The school hid the news, but Cheng Yan knew some details because of his uncle, the headmaster.\u201cThose students\u2026\u201d Cheng Yan hesitated.\u201cThey tried to draw people\u2019s attention.\u201d Holding her chin in her hands, Ming Shu said slowly, \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t pointed out that there was blood mixed with the oil paint in the auditorium, there would have been another who would guide people to discover it. The oil paint case didn\u2019t draw much attention and died down easily.\u201cThey know it doesn\u2019t work until someone dies. So one girl committed suicide by jumping from the building and now another girl died by cutting her wrists in the bathroom.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Cheng Yan was confused.Ming Shu pointed at her head, saying, \u201cBecause I have a brain.\u201dThey thought that as long as the oil paint mixed with blood was investigated by the police, some evidence must be found. However, the police discovered nothing.Then it came to the girl on the roof. She didn\u2019t know whether her death would attract people\u2019s attention or would be hidden by others, so she struggled hard.Now it came to the girl who committed suicide in the bathroom.She expressed her hopelessness with her blood to draw the public eye, hoping that someone could rescue them.If no one investigated this time, it was believed that another girl would die soon.Pan Zhiguo could threaten them, but he couldn\u2019t prevent them from dying.\u201cWell, let\u2019s help them.\u201d\u201cI thought you would stand by indifferently.\u201d Cheng Yan was surprised. She had seen a girl leap from the roof and didn\u2019t blink. Now she said she would help them.Ming Shu stood suddenly, lowering her head so her eyes were covered by her bangs. After a while, she looked up with a familiar smile on her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand me.\u201dCheng Yan was stunned for a second. He really didn\u2019t understand her.Liked it?

Although he had a strong background, it would draw attention if these events couldn\u2019t be stopped.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How did you persuade them?\u201d Pan Zhiguo shouted at Shi Yaxin, unable to restrain his anger.Shi Yaxin\u2019s hands were clasped before her, sweat on her palms. She answered in a tremulous voice, \u201cI have tried my best.\u201dPan Zhiguo stared at her with his fierce, wolf-like eyes. He grasped her neck, baring his teeth and saying, \u201cWhat I want isn\u2019t that you try your best. Do you really know why I allowed you to stay here? If you can\u2019t do your job well, what\u2019s the use of you?\u201dShi Yaxin seemed to be frightened by him. Clasping Pan Zhiguo\u2019s hands, she begged him with a sob, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know it\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t do my job well. I promise I\u2019ll persuade them properly next time and won\u2019t let them\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough,\u201d Pan Zhiguo interrupted her, helping her to stand steadily and adjusting her collar. He said gently, as if he were another person, \u201cXiao Ya, I have told you many times: Don\u2019t be so careless. Why didn\u2019t you listen to me? I told you to be careful, be careful\u2014\u201d Pa!A slapping sound rang out. Shi Yaxin\u2019s head turned because of the slap. The obvious imprint of a hand soon appeared on her face.\u201cSorry\u2026\u201d Not daring to resist, she apologized quietly.Pan Zhiguo caught Shi Yaxin\u2019s collar again and pulled her close to him, threatening her. \u201cShi Yaxin, I\u2019m telling you, if you do something in secret to ruin me, I will deal with you harshly.\u201dShi Yaxin was so frightened that she trembled, shaking her head over and over. \u201cI won\u2019t. I won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThat would be best.\u201d Pan Zhiguo pushed Shi Yaxin away. \u201cGet out.\u201dClutching her clothes tightly, Shi Yaxin quickly ran out and didn\u2019t dare to breathe until she was far away from Pan Zhiguo.Then she carefully took out the recorder hidden in her clothes and turned it off, sending a message after she looked at the cell phone\u2019s screen for a while.Ding !Ming Shu tilted her head and glanced at her cell phone. Then she put down her fork and opened the message.The light of the screen illuminated the slight smile on her face.\u201cLook, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d Ming Shu showed Shi Yaxin\u2019s message to Cheng Yan. \u201cPan Zhiguo dares to do that at school, do you think he\u2019s a fool? Cheng Yan, did you evade taxation?\u201d\u201cWhat taxation?\u201d Cheng Yan asked unconsciously.\u201cIQ taxation.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Would you die if we had a nice chat? Cheng Yan thought.Ming Shu lowered the cell phone and replied quickly. Then she took her fork and continued to eat her noodles.\u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d Cheng Yan took the phone to see.But nothing was shown in the messages and the original message from Shi Yaxin disappeared too.\u201cWhat do you intend to do? Lu Meng, behave yourself.\u201d\u201cI gave you a chance, but your way didn\u2019t work. So now we should carry out my plan.\u201d It wasted so much time and still didn\u2019t work, Ming Shu thought.To waste time is to waste life.\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Her plan is kidnapping or something similar. It isn\u2019t a good method , Cheng Yan thought.But Ming Shu focused on eating and ignored Cheng Yan.Can\u2019t he stop talking when we\u2019re eating? Ming Shu thought.\u201cLu Meng, what are you going to do?\u201d Cheng Yan thought that his image was ruined, but he had no other choice since Ming Shu was difficult to pursue.\u201cLu Meng, Pan Zhiguo doesn\u2019t mess around. If he finds us, he won\u2019t let us off.\u201cDon\u2019t risk yourself, I\u2019ll think of other methods.\u201dMing Shu put down her fork, making a slight sound that caused Cheng Yan to stop talking and stare at her. What does she want to do? he thought.Ming Shu just smiled a bit and asked the waiter for the bill.But Cheng Yan felt a chill go down his spine, as if a cold current came suddenly in March and people felt the chill in their bones.Cheng Yan didn\u2019t notice Ming Shu doing anything special. She went to and left school on time every day. But he still felt worried, so he sent her home after school every day in case she put herself in danger.\u201cCheng Yan came to school again.\u201d\u201cEh, what\u2019s the relationship between Lu Meng and Cheng Yan? Why does he pick her up every day?\u201d\u201cAh! Why isn\u2019t it me that Cheng Yan picks up?\u201dThe girl students\u2019 envious gazes fell on Ming Shu constantly. Even Ye Miaomiao poked her arm and winked at her vaguely.They all said that Cheng Yan didn\u2019t dedicate himself to Ming Shu because he didn\u2019t appear in person.Was he dedicating himself to Ming Shu now that he did?Ming Shu peered out the window and saw Cheng Yan leaning against the wall of the corridor outside the classroom, head lowered to look at his cell phone. The light of the sunset cast on him what seemed to be a warm, dreamlike halo. He looked like the Adonis from ancient Greek mythology.Ring\u2014As soon as the bell rang, the classroom became noisy. The girls gathered at the window, infatuated with Cheng Yan\u2019s handsome face.Ming Shu packed her things, most of which were snacks, without hurry.Then under many girls\u2019 envious gazes, Ming Shu exited the classroom, carrying her bulging bag.Cheng Yan moved close to Ming Shu to talk to her. But Ming Shu was indifferent to him, which made the other girl students jealous.She didn\u2019t know she was lucky.\u201cCan you not follow me?\u201d Ming Shu was annoyed at him following her around all the time. The way you stick to me, am I a prisoner? Ming Shu thought.\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me your plans, so I\u2019m following you,\u201d Cheng Yan said with a firm expression. \u201cI won\u2019t let you do anything dangerous.\u201dPressing her tongue against the roof of her mouth, Ming Shu took a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to plant a bomb, do you want to come?\u201d???Where did a bomb come from? Is she kidding with me? Cheng Yan thought.It was obvious that Ming Shu wasn\u2019t kidding. She took out a junior department school uniform that Cheng Yan had no idea how she got. Then she changed into the uniform and went to the library with her bag.It was lunch break, so there were students in the library.Cheng Yan followed her with confusion on his face, feeling astonished in his mind.Why did he follow her?How could he know if there was anything she wouldn\u2019t do if he didn\u2019t follow her?There were only a few monitors in the library, so there were many blind spots. Cheng Yan saw her take out a time bomb that was set to ten hours and place it in a corner of the library.Cheng Yan was keeping watch for her. Only God knew why he kept watch for her.Cheng Yan felt his back dripping with cold sweat by the time they came out of the library.She was really brave.\u201cDo you really want to bomb the library?\u201d The time she set was ten hours from now, during which there was no one in the library. She didn\u2019t want anyone die. \u201cWhat would you do if the police investigate you? This is so illegal.\u201d\u201cToday is Friday,\u201d Ming Shu answered with a smile.What\u2019s special about Friday? Is Friday suitable for blowing up libraries?Friday\u2026Pan Zhiguo would arrange for the students to be dealt with in the library on that day.There was something odd here.Cheng Yan became clever for a second because he was shocked by Ming Shu\u2019s strange behavior.Except when he was in class, he watched her almost all the time. When did she get a time bomb?Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were told that a bomb was placed in the library of the junior department of a high school and it was going to blow up at ten.So the counter-terrorism division ordered the police to surround the library at once.Many students who were studying in the library were asked to leave by the policemen. After searching the whole library, they only found one of the two time bombs that were mentioned in the anonymous e-mail, leaving the other one.During the search, an armed policeman found a way to the basement, the scale of which was beyond his imagination, and reported to his boss quickly.In the basement, there were not only students, but also some improperly dressed high-society people. It was an extremely extravagant set-up and shocked many.The counter-terrorism division realized the situation was serious and reported to their superiors that many underage children were involved in the case. The inspection team from the capital hadn\u2019t left yet. Hearing that, they set up a special task force at once and gathered the best detectives to investigate.Standing on the roof of the old teaching building, Cheng Yan looked at the chaotic junior department, feeling complicated.Was there such an option? Cheng Yan thought.Although Pan Zhiguo had a powerful background, he still couldn\u2019t interfere with the counter-terrorism division\u2019s work. So this move from the counter-terrorism division, which he had never considered before, surprised him greatly.Apologies, please forgive the fact that Cheng Yan, an ordinary person, couldn\u2019t think up such a unique plan.Did Lu Meng ever think that although the library would be exposed this time, she was also at risk? How could he help her if she was investigated by the counter-terrorism division?\u201cIf they don\u2019t discover the basement or any other evidence concerning Pan Zhiguo this time and he escapes as a result, what should we do?\u201d Pan Zhiguo was ever so cautious. Even though his criminal acts were exposed, he could still find a way to escape.Flipping her bangs, Ming Shu replied, \u201cWhat are you afraid of? If he escapes this time, we\u2019ll design another trap for him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Do you think he\u2019s the Chinese cabbage and you can make another trap for him whenever you want?Cheng Yan even wanted to open Ming Shu\u2019s skull to see what she was thinking.Ming Shu jumped down from the roof, stretching. \u201cI\u2019m going home to eat.\u201dDo you have any appetite even now? You made such a big fuss and now you\u2019re leaving. Did you consider the feelings of these people who were forced to be involved?Cheng Yan felt distraught and thought:Why do I like her!Can I regret my feelings now?The next day\u2026All the news outlets reported what had happened in the library.According to the police, in that so-called time bomb, they only found some crystalline substances which proved to be sucrose\u2014white sugar\u2014rather than explosives.Whoever placed the time bomb in the library might have wanted them to find the basement.Just as Cheng Yan expected, Pan Zhiguo denied everything and insisted that he knew nothing, pinning all the blame on Shi Yaxin. He hadn\u2019t left any evidence that could incriminate him.However, Shi Yaxin had filed a statement to the police and disclosed what he had done three days ago. She also persuaded some students to identify Pan Zhiguo as the culprit.Pan Zhiguo\u2019s attorney believed these students had mental issues born of fear and were guided by Shi Yaxin, so their statements couldn\u2019t be taken as evidence.Just when Pan Zhiguo thought he could clear his name, an unexpected witness appeared. This witness not only identified Pan Zhiguo but also handed in evidence.Pan Zhiguo didn\u2019t have much contact with these students, but he had to contact those Money Bosses who did business with him. Those people were not as naive as students and kept some evidence.Pan Zhiguo didn\u2019t know why anyone would identify him since no one could escape if this matter was uncovered by the police.Pan Zhiguo failed this time. People like him would never sacrifice themselves to protect others. Therefore, knowing he had no way to escape, he confessed what he had done and informed the police who supported him all this time.All of Pan Zhiguo\u2019s businesses were closed down by the police. He had smuggled and killed people, which was much more serious than forcing students to sell their bodies, so he would spend what remained of his life in prison even though he had turned himself in.Using Pan Zhiguo\u2019s information, the task force caught the big boss, as well as the countless officials and high-society people involved.Ming Shu\u2019s plan worked because of the task force\u2019s timely actions, his business being caught in the act, and the Money Boss\u2019s report. Otherwise, Pan Zhiguo would have successfully gotten away this time.It succeeded due to luck and strength.What Cheng Yan worried about most was not Pan Zhiguo, but the fact that Ming Shu placed the time bomb in the library, which would cause big trouble for her. Inciting fear and panic in the populace was illegal too.But Ming Shu still wasn\u2019t investigated after several days, which relieved Cheng Yan.Pan Zhiguo was sentenced to life in prison and the rest of his accomplices were also condemned. Because of her report and her part in the evildoings, Shi Yaxin also received a prison sentence.Because the children needed psychological care, the junior department temporarily suspended class as it was investigated.This matter caused heated discussion which lasted until the finals.As it was the same as during mid-terms, the straight-A student\u2019s final grades surprised everyone again.The first bad score could be an accident, but there must be something wrong if the straight-A student got a bad score a second time.Facing people\u2019s questioning gazes and teachers\u2019 bombardment of questions, Ming Shu responded with a smile, completely without a care. She disappeared at the time the holiday began and was caught by Cheng Yan after he waited three days at her house.Of course, Ming Shu had gone to eat during those three days, so Cheng Yan volunteered to treat her to delicious food.Ming Shu was unwilling to go with him at first, but Cheng Yan persuaded her parents, who weren\u2019t around most of the time, and they entrusted her to Cheng Yan without a worry.Am I your kid?Am I your biological kid?What did Chengcheng promise you? Or are you going bankrupt and want to save yourselves by selling your daughter?\u201cMengmeng.\u201d Cheng Yan went to her home with a suitcase early in the morning, changing the way he addressed Ming Shu. \u201cI entrust myself to your care.\u201dMing Shu closed the door, leaving that handsome face outside.What fucking care.\u201cMengmeng! Let me in. Your parents will cut down on your allowance if they learn you shut me out.\u201d Cheng Yan\u2019s face appeared in front of the window.Looking at the person outside the window with his arms akimbo, Ming Shu took a deep breath and then walked over with a smile on her face, drawing the curtains all of a sudden.I need food to calm myself down.Kacha\u2014The sound of the door being opened rang through the hallway, the security door unlocked by somebody. The suitcase came first and then Cheng Yan\u2019s annoying face appeared. \u201cMengmeng, look!\u201dIn Cheng Yan\u2019s hand was the key to her house.Ming Shu threw the pillow on the sofa at him, smiling a little ferociously. \u201d Are you their biological child? \u201cThey even gave you a key. What kind of deal did you all make?Cheng Yan caught the pillow easily. \u201cMengmeng, give it up. By the way, your mom told me that she gave the maid a holiday, so it\u2019s only you and me here. Like a love nest.\u201dMing Shu smiled, her arms crossing over her chest. \u201cI\u2019ll give you an unforgettable love nest.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dLiked it?

It\u2019s fine if you want to order me around, but you shouldn\u2019t harm your own body.\u201dShe would never touch the food he had prepared for her personally. If he intended to order takeout, he had to discuss with her the whole time! Even when the takeout was laid out on the table, she wouldn\u2019t touch it until she was on the brink of starvation. What an odd lady!But what could he do?The only thing he could do was spoil her!Ming Shu placed her hands over her empty stomach, staring at the food on the table and licking her lips. Finally she picked up the chopsticks and began eating.For the whole summer, Cheng Yan was tortured almost to the point of doubting his life. But he would never give up. As a real man, he believed, he had to be persistent.\u201cThe new school term is starting in a few days. Do you want to buy anything?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go out and have some fun, maybe you\u2019ll see some interesting things to buy?\u201d Cheng Yan insisted on making an effort.\u201cNo.\u201dCheng Yan was rejected pitilessly yet again. I\u2019m not giving up! he roared inside. Thinking for a little while, he dialed Ye Miaomiao\u2019s number.Later, Ming Shu got a call from Ye Miaomiao upon finishing the food. Before Ming Shu opened her mouth, an impatient and excited voice emerged from the other side: \u201cMengmeng, Mengmeng, that Jing Fu Restaurant introduced new dishes recently, let\u2019s go have a taste!\u201dMing Shu swallowed the \u201cno\u201d and asked, \u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come to your house later!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dThe minute Ming Shu hung up the phone, a text message came to Cheng Yan\u2019s phone\u2014 Nailed.Cheng Yan fell silent. This method didn\u2019t work for him. He had already tried to induce her with delicious food, but she always seemed to have extremely strong self-control when faced with food he offered her.When on earth had he displeased her?When the two girls went out together, Cheng Yan followed them shamelessly. He was really abandoning all his dignity!\u201cMengmeng, it\u2019s still early, why don\u2019t we go shopping?\u201d Ye Miaomiao suggested on their way to the Jing Fu Restaurant. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent all your time staying at home, that\u2019s too unhealthy! You need some fresh air, what do you say? Let\u2019s do it!\u201dBut meeting Ming Shu\u2019s smiling eyes, Ye Miaomiao sensed danger at once. She smiled back fawningly. \u201cNo, no, let\u2019s forget about that.\u201dMengmeng\u2019s smile was getting scarier and scarier now\u2026\u201cThere are new movies playing recently, perhaps we can go to see a movie?\u201d Cheng Yan seized a chance to speak.\u201cGreat, great!\u201d Ye Miaomiao agreed immediately. \u201cMengmeng, are you going?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Ming Shu refused. She set her sights on the street out of the car window.Only couples would go to places like a movie theater, why would I go there? Who knows what this goblin Cheng Yan wants to do to me? she wondered.Cheng Yan gave Ye Miaomiao a look, and the latter began to shake Ming Shu\u2019s arm pleadingly. \u201cCome on, please, I haven\u2019t seen a movie in so long. Mengmeng, please come see a movie with me, all right?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to see a movie.\u201d Who hasn\u2019t seen a movie? Can a movie be eaten?\u201cI\u2019ll buy tasty snacks for you.\u201dWell\u2026Ming Shu pretended to be demure. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll consider it.\u201dWho the hell knew why her Mengmeng had become a total food slave! Ye Miaomiao couldn\u2019t help wondering.That\u2019s it! Not a foodie, but a food slave, an even higher level of obsession with food.Ye Miaomiao then took the chance to offer her ultimate weapon to convince Ming Shu. She continued, \u201cI\u2019ll treat you to lobster! Special offer! They wouldn\u2019t be available on a normal day, how\u2019s that?\u201dLobster! Special offer!Ming Shu curled her lips and showed a slight smile, her eyes twinkling with light. \u201cMovies are quite boring, but\u2026 occasionally watching a movie is not that bad.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d I knew it! She would do anything as long as you gave her food , Ye Miaomiao thought.\u201c\u2026\u201d But why didn\u2019t this method work for me? I\u2019m confused. Cheng Yan was stunned.Then he thought he could finally watch a movie with her in harmony, but the truth was, she didn\u2019t even sit beside him. Ye Miaomiao tried to change seats with her, but was soon rejected with a single glance. From the start to the end of the movie, Cheng Yan was totally lost in thoughts of how to draw Ming Shu\u2019s attention, and the movie\u2019s plot was entirely neglected by him.Ming Shu really liked Jing Fu Restaurant\u2019s food. If it wasn\u2019t that Ye Miaomiao stopped her, for fear she might attract many onlookers to watch the \u201cKing of Eaters,\u201d she would have kept eating till the end of the day.\u201cMengmeng, later I\u2019ll go home by myself, you don\u2019t need to send me home. You can go back with\u2026 Ouch!\u201d Someone ran into Ye Miaomiao while she was talking and almost knocked her down. \u201cHow is this happening? Are you blind or\u2026\u201dYe Miaomiao held back her next words. She looked at the person in front of her, her expression becoming a little complicated.\u201cYe Miaomiao, what did you say about me?\u201d Jin Yuqi sounded a bit harsh, especially when she saw Ming Shu behind her. The hatred in her eyes was totally exposed.Ever since that event, Jin Yuqi hadn\u2019t showed up at school. They all said she was engaged to Shangguan Feng.\u201cIt\u2019s you who ran into me,\u201d Ye Miaomiao refuted without giving any impression of weakness. \u201cI was walking and you just appeared suddenly in front of me. Does it even make sense that I ran into you first?\u201d\u201cYe Miaomiao, you hit me and now you\u2019re making up excuses?\u201d Apparently Jin Yuqi wanted to cause trouble. \u201cHaving spent a lot of time with a certain someone, you seem to have forgotten basic manners?\u201d[Guest, gain another round of Hatred Points and this mission will be finished. ] The Harmony System always knew the perfect time to show up and urge Ming Shu to do such things.Ming Shu sighed deeply in her heart. Some bad things might happen sooner or later if I continue to get urged like this!Just calm down.\u201cJin Yuqi! You\u2019re\u2026\u201dMing Shu pulled at Ye Miaomiao to stop her. Ye Miaomiao turned with a grunt and then stepped back. Ming Shu took a few steps forward, standing before Jin Yuqi.With a pair of smiling eyes, the colorful and flashing neon lights were scattered around in Ming Shu\u2019s dark pupils, casting beautiful rays that inspired a feeling of extremely comfortable softness in others.Yet it was exactly the owner of this face that had pushed her into this situation. Jin Yuqi ground her teeth, but somehow, she always had a feeling of weakness when standing before this woman.Jin Yuqi straightened her back, trying to overcome this feeling. \u201cLu Meng, what do you want to do?\u201d\u201cWell, I want to communicate honestly with you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Jin Yuqi got a surprised look on her face.Ming Shu smiled. She pulled Jin Yuqi by her wrist and dragged her toward a remote spot off to the side.Cheng Yan and Ye Miaomiao looked at each other for a little while. What is she doing? they both wondered.Jin Yuqi couldn\u2019t free herself of Ming Shu\u2019s grip. She became a little scared. \u201cLu Meng, let me go! What are you doing!\u201d\u201cLu Meng! You bitch, let go of me! I\u2019m calling the police!\u201d\u201cHelp\u2026\u201dJin Yuqi begged help from the passersby on the street when they looked their way curiously. She didn\u2019t expect Ming Shu would do anything good. The unknown danger was causing her to panic.But before the passersby realized what was happening, the yelling girl had already been dragged around the corner, disappearing from their sights.The people gazed at one another, then returned to their own business like nothing happened.Jin Yuqi was taken to a dark corner, and Ming Shu didn\u2019t give her any chance to speak, just beat her up fiercely.Jin Yuqi suffered the unprovoked beating, but the pain in her body still couldn\u2019t compare to the pain deep in her heart.Why did she have to meet this bitch Lu Meng?Why did she always find trouble with her?Why! She always offended her and did unexpected things to her.She hated her![Hatred Points at full capacity, the task is complete.]The Harmony System had known that Ming Shu wouldn\u2019t leave this world since she was a total foodie, so it just skipped the following questions.Liked it?

It was as if she hadn\u2019t been abusing Jin Yuqi.Jin Yuqi lay on her stomach. Seeing Ming Shu\u2019s figure disappear into the darkness, the hatred beneath her eyes spread like a blazing fire.\u201cLu Meng\u2026 I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Why, why did she have to suffer all of this? She should be the winner.Jin Yuqi struggled to stand up after lying there for a little longer. She walked back to Jing Fu Restaurant\u2019s front door, leaning against the wall. As she was looking for someone to call the police for her, she saw Shangguan Feng getting ready to get into a car with a girl.Shangguan Feng\u2026Ignoring her aching body as well as her embarrassment, Jin Yuqi rushed out to push the girl against the car door. She demanded, \u201cShangguan Feng, who is she? Why are you with her? What are you going to do?\u201dThe girl was frightened into hiding behind Shangguan Feng and asked in a coaxing voice, \u201cFeng, who is she? She\u2019s so fierce, I\u2019m scared.\u201dShangguan Feng protected the girl with his arm, and he turned his nose up at Jin Yuqi as he gazed at her messy state. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re my fiance, how is it none of my business!\u201d Jin Yuqi became extremely angry. \u201cShangguan Feng, have you forgotten your promises? You said you loved me and would take care of me for our whole lives! Now we just got engaged, how could you do something like this! Shameless!\u201d\u201cJin Yuqi, how could you do those kinds of things to me when you were using me?\u201d Shangguan Feng sneered. \u201cWhat do you think I am? Your slave?\u201dHe would never forgot how those people at school looked at him.Jin Yuqi did that to him. How could he forgive her so easily?\u201cLu Meng planned the whole thing! She intended to destroy us, you can\u2019t just blame me for everything. If you\u2019re a man, go trouble her!\u201d Jing Yuqi dumped all the responsibility on Ming Shu.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Shangguan Feng reached out to pinch Jin Yuqi\u2019s cheek, leaning closer with wondering eyes. But as Jin Yuqi nodded her head, he suddenly threw her off. Without anything to support her, Jin Yuqi staggered and fell to the ground. The cold and ironic voice of Shangguan Feng reached her ears from above. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m still stupid enough to believe you?\u201dHe was so regretful. He wondered why he always followed her advice before. Was he a lunatic?Shangguan Feng put his arm around the girl, lowering his eyes arrogantly to her fallen form. \u201cJin Yuqi, behave yourself. The Jin family does not have any time to protect you now.\u201dRecently the Jin family had been involved in a corruption case, which had put it in a dangerous position. That was why Shangguan Feng was able to have his full swing.\u201cFeng, don\u2019t be angry. Let\u2019s go have fun.\u201d The girl patted Shangguan Feng\u2019s chest and spoke in spoiled tone. She also gave a dismissive glance to Jin Yuqi.Jin Yuqi was breathing heavily in anger. Now almost anyone could look at her that way! She just couldn\u2019t believe it.Shangguan Feng grunted before getting into the car with the girl on his arm. The car then drove away ruthlessly, leaving Jin Yuqin alone, sitting in that spot, talked about and pointed at by the surrounding people.\u201cWhat are you looking at! Who allowed you to look at me! Go away, go!\u201dJin Yuqi got up from the ground and began to yell at those people like crazy.Probably because Jin Yuqi was really in a maddened state and looked too scary, the onlookers all scattered immediately.Jin Yuqi staggered as she left. It seemed she had nowhere to go in this noisy city. An unprecedented feeling of coldness overwhelmed her.\u201cHey! Watch out!\u201d\u201cSh*t, are you blind?\u201dJin Yuqi ran into many people along the way, and most of them responded with abuse.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you all right?\u201dWhen Jin Yuqi hit another person, a girl\u2019s soft voice and a boy\u2019s nervous one rang out one after the other.\u201cI\u2019m okay\u2026\u201d The girl looked up to Jin Yuqi, and the minute she saw Jin Yuqi\u2019s face, she was stunned. After recalling for a little while, the girl asked tentatively, \u201cSister Jin Yuqi?\u201dHearing this, Jin Yuqi looked at the girl confusedly. After recognizing the girl clearly, an angry and shameful feeling mixed with a bit of fluster rose from the bottom of her heart. Why was Qian Duoduo here?Jin Yuqi lowered her head, hiding her face behind her bangs. She hurriedly burst out, \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken,\u201d then fled.\u201cAm I mistaken?\u201d\u201cProbably. Didn\u2019t you just say you were hungry? Come on, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go. We have to make up missed lessons for you.\u201dThe voices of the two faded away as they walked further. Jin Yuqi turned back to see the intimate figures. She fiercely dug her nails into her palm, blood dripping, but she didn\u2019t seem to feel it.\u2026Three months later\u2026Jin Yuqi and the Jin family totally split up. She was evicted from the family in the end, just the same as in the plot she had known before.In the story where Qian Duoduo was the female protagonist, Jin Yuqi was rightly evicted from her family.She intended to change the ending, but in the end\u2026 it was still the same ending she received. The boys who confessed to her before were now all scared away.Filled with hatred, Jin Yuqi was on the edge of madness.She must have revenge.\u2026The first target of her revenge was Ming Shu. Pitifully, Jin Yuqi was beaten by Ming Shu and brought into the police station when Ming Shu called 110. It had already been a month when Ming Shu heard things about her again.Jin Yuqi drove a car into Shangguan Feng.Similarly, Qian Duoduo was also hit by the car, but only got slightly injured. Afterward, Jin Yuqi continued to hit several people madly before the police seized her again.Brother Jiang filed a lawsuit against Jin Yuqi. Jin Yuqi was put into the asylum for mental disorder.As for Shangguan Feng, he became a vegetable. He may not be able to wake up for the rest of his life.\u2026Graduating from high school, Ming Shu went from an excellent student to a poor student. She attended a common university.But accompanied by Cheng Yan, college life was never quiet. Ming Shu didn\u2019t like Cheng Yan at all, but the latter harassed Ming Shu all the time.The whole school knew that these two were \u201cquarrelsome lovers.\u201dWhen two poor students crowded together, the possibility of making trouble increased exponentially. Cutting classes, fighting, failing exams\u2026 just name it. There were nothing that the two didn\u2019t dare to try.Ming Shu usually fought for food.Meanwhile, Cheng Yan usually fought for Ming Shu.Finally, they graduated from college. But Cheng Yan still wouldn\u2019t let Ming Shu go. They played a game of cat and mouse for several years, during which lots of people had introduced girls to Cheng Yan, but they were all rejected by him. There seemed to be only one girl in his eyes.He chased after Ming Shu alone!He just couldn\u2019t stop!What the hell was wrong with him.After many years passed, Ming Shu still had a baby face. Cheng Yan had grown up into a mature man, with an attractive style of tyrannical and celibate quality.\u201cCheng Yan, so many years have passed, can\u2019t you just let me go!\u201d All she had dreamed of was staying with her dear snacks forever. Why was it so hard!What an insidious man!\u201cIs it that hard for you to like me even for a while?\u201d Cheng Yan asked miserably.\u201cIs it that hard for you not to like me even for a while?\u201d Ming Shu huffed angrily. \u201cWould you please stop chasing after me?\u201d This man didn\u2019t like her at all.Wasn\u2019t there a saying that went like\u2026\u201cThe less you get, the more you want?\u201dThroughout all these years, she still couldn\u2019t understand why Cheng Yan had to chase after her like such a psychopath.She had tried everything she could think of to get rid of him, but all failed. He didn\u2019t leave even with her beatings and abuse. She was fed up with him now!Cheng Yan took a deep breath and reached out to Ming Shu. \u201cMengmeng, get down here first, it\u2019s not safe. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201dBut Ming Shu grabbed onto the handrail with a weird expression. \u201cCheng Yan, you forced me here.\u201dThe minute she spoke the last word, Ming Shu loosened her hand.Cheng Yan\u2019s pupils dilated in fright. He rushed over, trying to catch her, but her soft clothes slipped from between his fingers.The wind and sunlight were all he caught.Liked it?

The corners of his mouth twitched a little; then, without any hesitation, he also jumped down.Ming Shu had just stood up when another figure dropped from above and hit the cushion by her side, the force of which again made her lose her balance. A warm palm caught her wrist, and Cheng Yan got onto her body, gazing at her gloomily.They looked at each other for a long while.\u201cLu Meng, you win.\u201dAfter finishing this sentence, Cheng Yan got up and left.Ming Shu stared at his figure through the cushion. Soon, his back disappeared in the crowd.\u201cMengmeng, isn\u2019t this going too far?\u201d Ye Miaomiao found Ming Shu and pulled her up from the cushion. \u201cI saw Cheng Yan was quite down when he left. Just now, he did jump down after you.\u201d\u201cBecause there\u2019s a cushion here.\u201d Ming Shu brushed at her clothes and thought, Only a coward wouldn\u2019t have the courage to jump.Ye Miaomiao revealed a contemptuous expression. \u201cYou really think anyone would dare jump down from a building? Mengmeng, you have no idea how lucky you are. Cheng Yan is an excellent man. He\u2019s been chasing after you for so many years, do you know how many girls out there envy you? But you don\u2019t value him at all, what a poor man.\u201d\u201cWell, you can marry him if you like. Just don\u2019t let him bother me.\u201d I have offered my whole heart to snacks, how can I love someone else? Ming Shu thought.Ye Miaomiao pinched Ming Shu\u2019s arm. \u201cOkay, stop it. If my boyfriend finds out, he\u2019ll kill me!\u201d\u201cWell, what a pity.\u201d Ming Shu shook her head. She paid the workers who provided the cushion, then went straight to the nearest restaurant.\u201cI just don\u2019t understand. Why don\u2019t you like Cheng Yan?\u201d Throughout all these years, even if you didn\u2019t fall in love with him at first sight, maybe you have some feelings for him now? Ye Miaomiao wondered.Cheng Yan was indeed a poor student before, but he had changed greatly these years. He was no longer that troublesome boy.\u201cWhy should I like him?\u201d What a strange question.Because Cheng Yan dedicated himself to Ming Shu for many years, but she never responded, others began judging her as ruthless, treading on such a sincere heart.Some even said she was purposely playing Cheng Yan. They believed she should have told Cheng Yan clearly if she didn\u2019t like him, instead of wasting his time.What?Hadn\u2019t she expressed specifically since the beginning that she didn\u2019t like Cheng Yan?Yes, dislike!Now it was her fault?I\u2019m feeling wronged, okay? How should I defend myself?Ye Miaomiao scratched her head. \u201cFine, fine, you don\u2019t like him. But what kind of man do you like? There are also many other men admiring you nowadays, but which one do you like?\u201dMy heart has broken worrying over your happiness, but you\u2019re not aware of it at all!Ye Miaomiao was bleeding inside.\u201cHumph, they don\u2019t deserve me.\u201d\u201cYou? Who do you think you are?\u201d Ye Miaomiao rolled her eyes at Ming Shu. \u201cI say, no one will marry you in the future. Look at yourself, staying at home almost everyday, only knowing how to find food, like a boring lady in ancient times. Do you even live in the twenty-first century?\u201dMing Shu raised her eyebrows slightly, a knife and fork in hands. \u201cWho told you that a woman has to marry someone?\u201dYe Miaomiao gave her a helpless look. \u201cWon\u2019t you feel lonely when you\u2019re on your own? Since the world has men and women at the same time, it makes sense to find your other half. You are violating the natural law.\u201d\u201cNatural law? Can that be eaten?\u201d\u201cEat eat eat, all you care about is eating.\u201d Ye Miaomiao gave up. \u201cOkay, as you will. I dare say Cheng Yan will not pay attention to you, either. I want to see how you\u2019ll live your life by yourself!\u201dMing Shu shrugged her shoulders indifferently.I will live with my snacks, isn\u2019t it simple?If I feel bored, I\u2019ll go make some trouble. This world is so lively, anywhere could be a great place to stop and see the sights. Is it even possible for me to feel lonely?Of course not!Ye Miaomiao was angered and grabbed her bag, getting ready to leave. Ming Shu held onto her clothes and curled her mouth in a beguiling manner. \u201cLiushui, how about eating some seafood tonight?\u201dYe Miaomiao looked down to stare at the girl gazing up at her with sparkling eyes. She kept silent before freaking out: \u201cI\u2019m going mad!\u201d\u2026Just like Ye Miaomiao predicted, Cheng Yan didn\u2019t show up from that day forward. Their lives seemed to have split in different directions.But occasionally, Ye Miaomiao would report Cheng Yan\u2019s recent condition to Ming Shu.People on the outside held different opinions on their relationship. But Ming Shu didn\u2019t care. Later, she left the city to pursue fine food in other places.When she left, she got an MMS from Cheng Yan.The content was a little odd. It was a small and antiquated yard, looking like a picture within a picture. But she didn\u2019t know where it was.After many years, when Ming Shu had returned to the city, she occasionally let Father Lu see the saved picture in the phone. Father Lu pointed at the little yard and asked surprisedly, \u201cIsn\u2019t this the place where we lived before? How did you get this photo?\u201dMing Shu looked to the picture as well and said, \u201cDid we live there before?\u201d\u201cRight. When your grandpa and grandma were still alive we all lived in that house. Later, after they passed away, we moved out. Back then, you were so naughty, playing around\u2026\u201d Father Lu was caught in distant memories and spoke for a long time.Ming Shu captured several key words from Father Lu\u2019s redundant descriptions.\u201cDad, did you and Cheng Yan meet a long time ago?\u201d It can\u2019t be like those outdated infant matrimonies, right?\u201cRight! Otherwise we wouldn\u2019t dare to leave you alone with that kid.\u201d Father Lu got up to search for a while in the study. Soon he handed a photo album over to Ming Shu. \u201cWe thought you would be together, who knows\u2026\u201dThe album contained many photos, most of which were childhood photos of the Host. Occasionally a little boy would be present, which should be Cheng Yan.\u201cDad, who\u2019s this?\u201d Ming Shu pointed at a little girl in a princess dress. It clearly wasn\u2019t Lu Meng.\u201cThat\u2019s your elder cousin. She passed away of illness when you were eight.\u201d Father Lu sighed pityingly.According to Father Lu\u2019s memory, after the cousin was gone, Ming Shu also fell seriously ill. Later Grandma and Grandpa passed away one by one. They were afraid that the house was an ominous place, so after the funeral, they quickly left with Lu Meng.Lu Meng had a memory problem after recovering from the illness. As she grew up, lots of childhood memories became more and more distant and were totally forgotten.\u201cIf I\u2019m gone, you have to protect Mengmeng, take care of her. You must promise me.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care. If you don\u2019t promise, I\u2019ll never see you again.\u201d\u201cOkay. I promise you.\u201d\u201cMengmeng is healthier than me. She is going to live longer than me, too. I hope she will live happily for me, see the world that I won\u2019t have the chance to see.\u201d\u201cShe will.\u201dMing Shu had a strange dream that night. In the dream, she seemed to have returned to that small yard and met with her elder cousin.Ming Shu woke up blankly. Covered in her quilt, she stared outside the window at the darkness.So this was why Cheng Yan didn\u2019t let her go? To fulfill the promise made to a young playmate?Right, that was how she felt for Cheng Yan as well. He was trying to complete a mission, instead of loving her for real.From the indifference in the beginning to the inexplicable pursuit afterward\u2026But when did he find out she was that Lu Meng from his childhood?Whatever, it was none of her business. That Lu Meng had long disappeared from this world.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Cheng Yan didn\u2019t get married for the rest of his life. Well, not for a lifetime; at least when Ming Shu left the world, Cheng Yan was still single.Ming Shu died in a car accident in that world, a huge pile-up. She could have survived it, but at the critical moment, a white light suddenly appeared in front of her eyes. She was then drawn back to the room of white clouds.Wasn\u2019t that annoying?[Lu Meng\u2019s original life was over.] the Harmony System explained.A glimmer of a smile passed through Ming Shu\u2019s eyes quickly. \u201cFor the next world, can you stop arranging me many unreliable admirers?\u201d The key point was that they weren\u2019t even admiring her.Who do you think I am, a scrap picker?[That is beyond my control. ] Every character has a stage, a course of life. And it is unchangeable.The white cloud screen appeared.Name: Ming ShuHatred Points: 8000Extension Task: CompletedThis time she got 8000 Hatred Points!Sure enough, was it more cost-effective to obtain Hatred Points from a group?\u201cNext world, next world.\u201d She couldn\u2019t wait to eat.[\u2026] I won\u2019t try to guess the Guest\u2019s thoughts.\u2026\u201cMiss, do we still have to move forward? It\u2019s getting dark. I\u2019m afraid we might be in danger if we continue to move. Miss Bai was crossing the line\u2026\u201dA clear female voice suddenly rang in Ming Shu\u2019s ears. A gentle breeze blowing past her cheeks brought with it a trace of heat and a faint rotten stink.Ming Shu quickly opened her eyes. She found herself standing in a sheltered forest, weak light breaking through the thick rustling leaves. Occasionally, the chirps of insects and birdsong would reach her ears.Two people were with her. The woman was standing by her side, looking down deferentially\u2014she should be the person that just spoke to her. The man, however, stood a little further away from them, warily observing the surroundings.Ming Shu curled her lips up. \u201cFind a place to rest.\u201d\u201cYes, Miss.\u201dMing Shu didn\u2019t dare to say much as she was waiting for the new story at this time. She followed these two people to their destination before receiving the background information from the Harmony System.This was a Xuanhuan world.Xiao Rufeng, the fake protagonist, was a murderer before. During a mission, she was betrayed by her people. Then she crossed to the Xuanyuan Continent, becoming the seventh Miss, or Miss Seven, of the Xiao family, who was unpopular among her relatives.Miss Seven was a loser. She didn\u2019t know who her father was and her mother had died long ago. Miss Seven was fat and ugly, as well as a total anathema. Her relatives always caused trouble for her and spurned her. She lived a hard life.After Xiao Rufeng crossed through, she opened the doors of her universe and remade her spirit pulse.From then on, she followed a successful path of weight loss, detoxification, and beautification. Miss Seven began to practice her skills, shocking the world with her power as well as proving herself to them.The typical plot of Lady Loser\u2019s counterattack against life.The Host was called Zhi Po, the only disciple of the Master of Death Valley himself.The moral of this name was to effect a miraculous cure, bringing the dying back to life. Even if the soul was broken, it could be restored.Obeying the Master\u2019s last wish, Zhi Po left the valley to find the daughter of the Master\u2019s old friend. She would protect the daughter, ensuring her a peaceful life of joyfulness and well-being.The Host did find the girl, but unfortunately she was not a good person. Hearing the Host\u2019s explanation, she began to order the Host to bully the fake protagonist and others in a variety of ways. In the end, she even dared to fancy Xiao Rufeng\u2019s man. She pestered the Host endlessly to help her win that man.The Host had a one-track mind. She promised to protect the girl when the Master left, so even if she was reluctant in her heart, she had to do what she was told. She and Xiao Rufeng butted heads over many things.Xiao Rufeng took a fancy to her silver needle, which was passed down from generation to generation of Death Valley\u2019s disciples. Later she schemed to get the silver needle, and the Host was driven to a tragic death.But after the Host was killed, that daughter of the Master\u2019s old friend showed no grief or sympathy. She even nurtured a grudge against the Host for being useless. The Host\u2019s dead body was thrown aside to feed the lowest level of spirit beasts.Of course, the daughter of the friend didn\u2019t meet any good end.Daring to pursue the sparkling fake protagonist\u2019s man, wasn\u2019t that asking for death?Zhi Po, with such an important identity, came to a miserable end.The protagonist aura was really strong!After Ming Shu received the story, she thought for a moment and recalled where they were now\u2014the Windy Mountain Range of Demons.The Xuanyuan Continent was filled with Qi, the element which could be harnessed to augment internal organs. Most people here majored in Qi practice. They advocated at force, respecting the powerful Qi practitioner. The one who was strong had the right to speak.The Windy Mountain Range of Demons was a boundless forest; no one knew it ended. Some said it was connected to another world, while some believed it was the end of the world.There was a variety of different opinions. But no one had been to the end of the Windy Mountain Range of Demons, so no one could confirm what the truth was.The Windy Mountain Range of Demons was a dangerous place, but was also full of spirit beasts and rare treasures. Thus it had become one of the most important places to practice on the Continent.This time, the Host was here because she had followed the friend\u2019s daughter\u2014Bai Yanran.Earlier, when they met a tough spirit beast, Bai Yanran pushed the Host ahead to protect her. She, on the other hand, had already left.Right now was the point in the plot where the Host had chased away the spirit beast and was getting ready to find Bai Yanran again.Since the Host was not the main character, the main plot naturally had nothing to do with her. So these scenes weren\u2019t included in the original background information.\u201cMiss, I know it\u2019s not my business, but Miss Bai is not worth your loyalty at all. You are the Master of Death Valley, who in this Continent wouldn\u2019t respect you? While this Miss Bai, she treats you like a servant! Even if the old Master were alive, he wouldn\u2019t have allowed you to be treated like this\u2026\u201dMing Shu turned to the girl, smiling. \u201cHui Xue, you also think Bai Yanran is annoying?\u201dThe girl raised her head in surprise; it seemed it was quite inconceivable to hear such a sentence from Ming Shu. \u201cMiss? Are you\u2026\u201d All right? she thought.The Miss was directly calling Miss Bai\u2019s name and saying she was annoying?\u2026 She was a lot more than annoying, she was totally ungrateful and shameless.If it weren\u2019t for the Miss, she would have died many times.\u201cMiss, Hui Xue was wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have talked about Miss Bai like that.\u201d Hui Xue bowed her head again and wondered, Is the Miss speaking contrarily? She is a bit capricious today, maybe I should shut up.\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d Ming Shu waved her hand carelessly. \u201cI also think she\u2019s annoying.\u201dThe Host obeyed her Master\u2019s wish to protect Bai Yanran, but Bai Yanran took it as an opportunity to order about the Host. If the Host didn\u2019t possess stubborn integrity, if it were another who had accepted the Master\u2019s request, things would be quite different.Hui Xue widened her eyes slightly. \u201cThen why did you\u2026?\u201d Accommodate her?\u201cI won\u2019t be like that anymore.\u201d Ming Shu curled the corners of her mouth in a smile. The Host accommodated others, but that was her choice. Now that Ming Shu was in this body, she would never accommodate anyone.Hui Xue was filled with doubt inside. But thinking of today\u2019s matter, she reckoned that her Miss was too disappointed at Bai Yanran and said these words.\u201cIt\u2019s good for Miss to think it through.\u201d Anyway, it couldn\u2019t be better for the Miss to ignore that Miss Bai. \u201cOur Miss has an honorable status, not anyone could order you about like that.\u201dEach Master of the Death Valley was a great doctor, the most highly skilled.There was a famous saying on the Continent that almost everyone knew:There is no disease or patient that can\u2019t be cured by Death Valley, except those who are rejected by it.Liked it?

Even if the lords of those well-known aristocratic families were here, they would not dare to disrespect our Miss. That Miss Bai, however, is too\u2026 It just annoys me whenever I think of her. Can\u2019t believe that Miss always told me to stay calm before. Hui Xue was lost in her thoughts.\u201cIs there any food?\u201d Ming Shu poked the burning branches with a stick. Her eyes reflected the flames, glittering with intelligence. There must be a lot of delicious food in this world.\u201cJust wait for a moment,\u201d Hui Xue said quickly. \u201cLiu Feng, Miss is hungry, go get something to eat.\u201dThe man in the distance turned around. He glanced at Ming Shu with an unreadable look, then disappeared in a flash. The rustling of leaves came from the deep forest, which startled the night birds into flight. Soon everything turned calm again.Liu Feng and Hui Xue followed the Host since childhood. Hui Xue was more vivacious; with a sensitive and meticulous disposition, she was mainly responsible for taking care of the Host\u2019s diet and daily life needs. Liu Feng, who wore a poker face all day, was a little careless, but he mastered a very powerful force; even unwilling to communicate, he would always do whatever the Miss asked, playing the role of a coolie and escort.Because of Bai Yanran, the two were driven back to Death Valley by the Host in a later period. This directly led to the Host\u2019s hopeless plight when she was attacked.\u2026 Affected by the protagonist aura, any impossible plot seemed possible.Apparently, Bai Yanran took primary responsibility for the miserable end of the Host, but the Host herself also played a role. If she were more flexible, how would she have died that way. What a pity.Of course, this didn\u2019t have anything to do with Ming Shu. She was here to cause trouble for Xiao Rufeng. She had to play the villain again.But anyway.The Host was certainly an out-and-out villain in the story. But from the Host\u2019s point of view, she was just trying to fulfill the Master\u2019s last wish. Was she wrong?Different standpoints led to different arguments about good and evil.\u2026Liu Feng came back with two dead hares. Perhaps it was because this world was rich in Qi, both the hares looked near twice as big as those of a normal world, with plenty of meat.After finishing her meal, Ming Shu leaned against a tree trunk to rest. Hui Xue sat beside the campfire, occasionally glancing sidelong at Ming Shu as she stoked the flames.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dHui Xue was a bit startled. She calmly pretended to withdraw her gaze and stammered, \u201cNo, nothing, I didn\u2019t look at anything.\u201dMing Shu pulled her coat tighter around her and leaned slightly toward Hui Xue with a pair of smiling eyes. \u201cHui Xue, you know, lying girls will become ugly\u2026\u201dHui Xue could no longer hide her surprised face. Before, the Miss didn\u2019t go find Bai Yanran because she had figured it out, but now, how to explain that the Miss suddenly changed personalities? She had been accompanying the Miss since she was a little girl, and no one was more familiar with the Miss\u2019s personality than her.The present Miss was too weird. But except for the weird feeling of her character, her essence was still the same as the Miss.\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Hui Xue swallowed and said carefully, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d Was the Miss bewitched?\u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d I can eat a whole hare in one go.Hui Xue hesitated. \u201cBut\u2026 but before you rarely smiled like this.\u201d She didn\u2019t see the Miss smile ever since they left Death Valley to find Bai Yanran.But today, after the Miss said they wouldn\u2019t follow Bai Yanran again, the smile on her face never disappeared.\u201cBefore is before, now is now.\u201d Ming Shu leaned back against the trunk, relaxing her body. \u201cDo you know the meaning of living? It\u2019s to achieve happiness. If you live an unhappy life, you\u2019d only be living in pain. If so, it\u2019s better to just end your life.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Did Miss just realize something during meditation? Why can\u2019t I understand what she\u2019s saying? \u201cWhat if the circumstances are tough and life just can\u2019t be happy?\u201dThere were too many uncontrollable factors in this world. Any factor could lead to tragedy, and not every course ran smoothly.\u201cFor those happy people, they would be happy no matter where they are.\u201d Ming Shu pushed aside some stray hairs near her ear. \u201cAnd I\u2026\u201d I will find ways to make myself happy.Hui Xue tilted her head, waiting for the follow-up. Yet Ming Shu looked away and didn\u2019t intend to open her mouth again.Hui Xue was a little confused in her heart. But thinking from another perspective, the Miss was the smartest, so what the Miss said must definitely be right.\u201cAs long as you are happy, Miss. Hui Xue only wants you to be happy.\u201d She was totally a blind fan of her Miss.\u2026What was the most abundant thing in Windy Mountain Range of Demons?Exotic flowers and rare herbs, as well as spirit beasts.People on the Continent would catch the spirit beasts mainly for two reasons. One was to tame them, thus using the tame beasts for fighting; the other was to kill them, taking out the beast crystal to sell or exchange for other things.But Ming Shu\u2014\u201cThat one is edible, go catch it.\u201d Ming Shu pointed to a cattle-like spirit beast a short distance away and gave orders to Liu Feng with greedy eyes.All the running beasts can be eaten.I\u2019m going to stay here forever!Liu Feng flashed to catch the beasts, who were alarmed and fled toward the woods. Then several strange howls came from deep within the forest, sending birds flying overhead. Before long, the strange sounds disappeared. Liu Feng dragged a spirit beast twice the size of his body out of the forest.He unloaded the spirit beast before Ming Shu and turned to stand aside.\u201cMiss\u2026 you still want to eat?\u201d Hui Xue looked at the dead beast as her mouth twitched. The Miss had already eaten up three spirit beasts along the way, but they\u2019d only marched a few miles!The meat of spirit beasts also contained Qi, which only a few people could digest. Consequently, the high-level spirit beasts generally weren\u2019t used as food.\u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d Ming Shu looked back at Hui Xue, showing a starving face.Hui Xue was full of concern. \u201cMiss, I\u2019m worried that your body can\u2019t bear too much Qi. Can you digest all the Qi in the spirit beast meat? If the Qi can\u2019t be absorbed by your body, it will accumulate to the maximum capacity and cause health issues. And\u2026 why would you be hungry?\u201dRight, that\u2019s the point.Practitioners like them usually didn\u2019t need to eat food for two or three months.\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d Ming Shu averted her eyes quickly. \u201cI\u2019m trying to advance, so it makes me hungry. Right, that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The last sentence, you were explaining to yourself?It did require a lot of Qi to advance. Hui Xue felt Ming Shu\u2019s pulse to confirm the normal circulation of Qi in her body. After hesitating for a while, she made a fire and roasted the meat under the anticipatory gaze of Ming Shu. She still doubted though.The scent of roasted meat pervaded the woods. Ming Shu looked like a cute pet waiting to be fed.\u201cMiss, some people are fighting.\u201dWhatever, whatever, let them play.Ming Shu kept silent, so Hui Xue and Liu Feng had no other choice but to continue their roasting.\u201cMiss, they are coming over to us.\u201d The noisy voices were far away at first, but at present they were approaching.\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Let them play freely, don\u2019t disturb them.\u201d So torturous to wait for the meat.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss!\u201d Hui Xue batted away Ming Shu\u2019s greedy paws. \u201cIt\u2019s not yet roasted. By the way, Miss, soon those people will get here\u2026\u201dJust before Hui Xue finished the sentence and Ming Shu withdrew her paws, a dark shadow flew swiftly toward them from the left.All of a sudden, sparks flew and the meat bounced against the closest tree trunk, falling to the grass.Ming Shu\u2019s eyes widened as she witnessed the meat rolling in circles on the grass, then rolling to the soil, stained with lots of \u201ccondiments.\u201dMy! Roasted! Meat!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Who dares to knock over my roasted meat!Drag them out for a beating! Beat them to death!Ming Shu glanced at the shadow who\u2019d hit against the trunk heavily along with the meat. Information flashed across her mind. They were wearing the uniform of the Imperial School.They were all students of the school.Don\u2019t ask why there was a word for uniform in a Xuanhuan world. There just was. No matter if it was reasonable or not, it was needed for the plot.Bai Yanran also studied at the Imperial School. This time she came to the Windy Mountain Range of Demons just because of an organized school activity for students to practice.\u201cYang Shufeng, take it out!\u201d Several people in the same uniforms jumped out of the forest, including men and women.After they yelled, they surprisingly found some others were with them, which abruptly froze them where they stood. The air turned stagnant at once.Liu Feng and Hui Xue returned to Ming Shu. Ming Shu was staring at the dropped meat sadly, the meat she hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to eat.\u201cAren\u2019t they Bai Yanran\u2019s people? What are they doing here?\u201d Someone recognized Ming Shu.\u201cThe Bai family is very powerful. We\u2019d better not offend them.\u201dOne of the boys stepped forward and held his fist in the other hand. \u201cWe are solving some personal grudges, it\u2019s none of your business. So please forgive our unintended offensive.\u201dMing Shu was still staring at the meat and didn\u2019t respond.Hui Xue and Liu Feng didn\u2019t dare to say anything either. They just looked at those people.The group over there hesitated for a while, thought they were agreed, and turned their eyes to Yang Shufeng again.Yang Shufeng slowly stood up by holding the trunk. He ignored the pain forcibly and said angrily, \u201cYou\u2019re going too far. I found it first, why should I give it to you.\u201d\u201cHahaha, you found it? Who can prove that?\u201d a boy on the opposite side sneered. \u201cHand it over and we will let you go.\u201d\u201cThieves!\u201d Yang Shufeng was too angry, blood spraying from his mouth. And coincidentally, it was sprayed on the roasted meat.\u201cWhat a jerk! Yang Shufeng, you asked for it.\u201d The young man who spoke winked at his companions and they swiftly flanked Yang Shufeng on both sides.\u201cWait!\u201dThe girl\u2019s pleasing voice pierced through the air like the sound of beads dropping on a jade plate, crisp and cheerful.People on the other side had to stop, turning to the boy who gave orders just now.\u201cYou are Miss Zhi Po, right?\u201d The boy approached several steps. \u201cYou work for the Bai family, and we don\u2019t intend to be your enemy. But if you are going to help Yang Shufeng, then don\u2019t blame us for fighting. Perhaps a single one of us couldn\u2019t surpass the Bai family, but all of us combined would be a worthy rival.\u201d\u201cRelax. I\u2019m a reasonable person.\u201d Ming Shu walked past Hui Xue with a smile. Her long dress swung with her steps, forming a graceful figure. She pointed at Yang Shufeng. \u201cLiu Feng, take him.\u201dYang Shufeng\u2019s eyes widened. He apparently didn\u2019t know when he had offended the girl before him.Hearing this, the students on the other side also didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cAnd them.\u201d Ming Shu turned around, pointing at the others again.Those students were stunned. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, what do you mean?\u201dMing Shu smiled lightly. \u201cWasting food is shameful behavior, especially\u2026 wasting my food.\u201dWhat?How was this related to the food?Liu Feng\u2019s combat power was far beyond these students. Within a short time, he had taken down all of them to throw at Ming Shu\u2019s feet. Then, with a stony face, he retreated to one side.\u201cMiss Zhi Po, in what way did we offend you?\u201d The students piled on the ground were muddled and they began to question Ming Shu one after another.\u201cWas it Bai Yanran who told you to do this to us?\u201d\u201cWhere is Bai Yanran?\u201dYang Shufeng sneered from the side. Now none of them could escape.Ming Shu strolled around them with her hands behind her back. Her eyes rested on Yang Shufeng and another student. \u201cYou two, go catch me the same type of spirit beast. Then we\u2019ll let this all go. Otherwise, I\u2019ll kill you all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What\u2019s the Miss doing? Hui Xue thought.\u201c\u2026\u201d I feel calm at heart, but don\u2019t know what to say , Liu Feng thought.The others had ten thousand alpacas running about widely in their heads. What the hell?Even though they couldn\u2019t understand what was going on, their lives were in the hands of Ming Shu now, so they had to go catch the spirit beast. Yang Shufeng was injured earlier, so he\u2019d only be a liability. When he returned, he became even weaker. And the other student also got hurt, blood staining their skin and making them look very miserable.Since the spirit beast was caught, Ming Shu kept her word to set them free. Then, sitting down, she began to roast the meat.\u201c\u2026\u201dThey couldn\u2019t believe it!Boom!Before anyone could take a chance to breathe, a strange sound suddenly emerged in the distance. What followed were some human screams, heading in their direction.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dWho the hell knew what was the matter. Everyone looked toward the source of the sound anxiously, and soon, a human being appeared in their sights. The man ran over with an unstable gait, his face filled with horror. It seemed something terrible was chasing after him. He hoofed it past them.Then a second person.A third one.One of the students grabbed a fleeing man and asked loudly, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cRun! There\u2019s a sixth level spirit beast behind us.\u201d The man shook off the student\u2019s hand with a frightened expression. \u201cDon\u2019t grab me. You want to die, but I don\u2019t!\u201dThe spirit beasts could be divided into ten levels. Those between levels one and four were common, those of level five were less common, and those of the sixth were rare. If the students worked together to fight spirit beasts between levels one and four, they might have a chance of winning, but level six\u2026They would be killing themselves.\u201cLet\u2019s run.\u201d\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Someone pointed at Yang Shufeng, who was leaning against the trunk weakly.The leader gritted his teeth and said, \u201cYang Shufeng, take out the healing herb!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming!\u201d Yang Shufeng spat on the ground. \u201cI\u2019ll never give it to you thieves!\u201dWhisper\u2026Rustle\u2026Just as the two were at a stalemate, some noises came from the grass. Everyone was alarmed and stared at the source.Two figures came out from the grass. After seeing many people before them, the two were also alarmed. Behind them, more figures showed up in quick succession, all wearing the same school uniform. They were students, too.\u201cZhi Po.\u201d A girl\u2019s voice broke the weird silence first, and its owner walked straight to Ming Shu. \u201cWhere have you been? Why didn\u2019t you come after me? Do you know I almost died?\u201dMing Shu looked up to give her a glance. This girl was Bai Yanran. With a pea-like face, she should be very popular.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me whether you live or die.\u201dBai Yanran\u2019s eyes widened disbelievingly. Her spoiled Miss\u2019s temper burst out all of a sudden. \u201cAren\u2019t you here to protect me? You dare talk back to me! Go kill that beast quickly! Or you will be punished. Go! What are you looking at? Just go!\u201d\u201cMiss Bai, may I remind you that it was you who abandoned our Miss before.\u201d Hui Xue couldn\u2019t stand Bai Yanran anymore. Besides, the Miss also said she wouldn\u2019t tolerate Bai Yanran in the future. It was unnecessary for her to eat humble pies now.Bai Yanran shouted back fiercely, \u201cWho do you think you are! Cheap slave! I\u2019m talking to her, you shut up!\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To everyone\u2019s surprise, she suddenly hit Bai Yanran on the back of her hand with the twig. \u201cWhat she said is what I said. Did I allow you to point fingers at my people?\u201dBai Yanran achingly exclaimed. Her fair hand turned into a red, swollen bun with visible speed. Bai Yanran covered the hand with a pair of fiery, angry eyes. \u201cYou dare to hit me.\u201dWhat happened to this woman? Before she would do anything she was told. How come this time she behaved so strangely.\u201cI hit you, so what?\u201d Ming Shu chuckled. \u201cDo you think you are a goddess that I don\u2019t dare hit you?\u201dBefore, Zhi Po could bear your willfulness, but I\u2019m not that kind.\u201cZhi Po, did you forget who you are?\u201d She dared to laugh, though not a thing was funny.Bai Yanran\u2019s chest fluctuated rapidly. She was breathing heavily in her fury.Ming Shu raised her eyebrows. \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you tell me who I am?\u201d\u201cYou are here to protect me as a servant, what else could you be!\u201d Bai Yanran seemed to have lost her mind with rage, saying this without thinking.She felt a little regretful as well after finishing that sentence. But after thinking for a while, she convinced herself that she was right. Zhi Po indeed came to protect her, and she usually ordered her about like a servant, so wasn\u2019t she a servant?\u201cBai Yanran, are you out of your mind? Our Miss being your servant, do you think you are worthy?\u201d Hui Xue was finally able to hold her head high. Bai Yanran really thought herself a big shot, wasn\u2019t that amusing? If it weren\u2019t for the Miss tolerating her before, she\u2019d have been killed by Liu Feng many times over.\u201cI\u2019m the dignified Miss of the Bai family. Why aren\u2019t I worthy?\u201d Bai Yanran said arrogantly with a straight back. \u201cZhi Po, I now order you to bring me back the beast.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hui Xue was shocked by Bai Yanran\u2019s shameless behavior.Ming Shu smiled at Bai Yanran and said softly, \u201cOkay, wait here for me and don\u2019t leave.\u201d\u201cMiss!\u201d Didn\u2019t the Miss say she wouldn\u2019t care about Bai Yanran anymore? How come she now listened to her again?\u201cYou don\u2019t need to follow. Watch the meat.\u201d Ming Shu pointed at the roasting meat on the fire, which was already changing color with a tempting smell, and rolled up her sleeves as she walked into the grass, bypassing the crowd.Bai Yanran disdainfully grunted at Hui Xue. \u201cWhen she returns, I\u2019ll let her punish you.\u201dTo dare to talk back to me, this slave must be tired of living. I will teach her a lesson or she won\u2019t realize who is the master here.\u201cAll right, everyone. Don\u2019t worry, Zhi Po will kill that spirit beast.\u201d Bai Yanran turned around with great confidence and spoke to the others.The crowd hesitated. Some people still chose to leave, and some die-hard fans of Bai Yanran stayed.The earlier students seemed to not be on Bai Yanran\u2019s side; they left as well with the half-dead Yang Shufeng dragging behind them.A few other people stayed.Among the remaining, there was a handsome man in black. He was very outstanding with his tall figure and unique style. You could tell immediately that he was non-human\u2026 To be serious, he was obviously not an ordinary person with just one look.The man was surrounded by several escorts, one of which was holding a woman. That woman looked pale; she seemed to be seriously injured somewhere.Bai Yanran\u2019s eyes fell on the man; she felt her heart skip a beat. Until now she had been too angry to notice him.She swiftly adjusted her hair and wore a shy, sweet smile on her face. Bai Yanran walked to him enchantingly and said in a tender tone, \u201cLord Seven, don\u2019t worry. Zhi Po is kind of a doctor. When she comes back, I\u2019ll let her take a look at Sister Fei\u2019er.\u201dBai Yanran\u2019s eyes were full of affection. But as she glanced at the woman in the escort\u2019s arm, a hidden hatred suddenly appeared in her eyes.\u201cIs she?\u201d the man responded indifferently. He continued in an alienated but polite voice, \u201cThen we\u2019ll rely on Miss Bai, if you please.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my honor to help you,\u201d Bai Yanran answered coyly.\u2026One hour later, Ming Shu emerged from the grass. Hui Xue immediately approached, and as she came near, she was startled to see something big behind Ming Shu. Her scalp tingling, Hui Xue subconsciously wanted to shout for Liu Feng.\u201cShh.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s warm finger lightly pressed on her lips. She was confronted with a pair of smiling eyes and swallowed her words hard.Out of the corner of her eye, Hui Xue saw the spirit beast staring at her, tilting its head. It had a pair of glass-like eyes, which were filled with doubt and fear instead of ferocity. The spirit beast grinned at Hui Xue, exposing its white teeth.\u201c\u2026\u201dMiss is going to stir things up!\u201cZhi Po, where is the spirit beast?\u201d Bai Yanran was watching them from close by. That arrogant appearance made Hui Xue really want to slap her.Ming Shu moved aside a bit and reached out to push away the concealing grass. \u201cHere it is, your spirit beast.\u201dThe spirit beast was alerted by the action; it squatted in the grass with fierce eyes, staring at the other people. Once the grass was parted, the spirit beast immediately jumped out, rushing straight at Bai Yanran.This happened too fast. Perhaps Bai Yanran was too scared, for her whole body froze on the spot and she stared at the spirit beast like a loser.At the critical turning point, a man next to her pulled her down. They rolled a few times on the ground. The spirit beast fanned the air. The escort of that Lord Seven took the opportunity to draw the attention of the beast, leading it away from Bai Yanran and to the others. The scene was extremely chaotic.\u201cCome help!\u201d The sixth level spirit beast was not easy to deal with. The escort called out to the students who were retreating slowly toward the fringes.Through the disordered figures, Lord Seven looked to the woman who had sat down at the campfire. She was watching the chaotic battle cheerfully, her chin propped on her palm. The woman wore all white, covered in a red robe.Because of the flickering flames, the woman was bathed in soft light. She looked very gentle.However, this woman did bring back a beast to attack them. And now, she was calmly sitting there to watch them, like she was enjoying a play.Lord Seven\u2019s eyes again rested on Ming Shu\u2019s robe, the pattern on which was a little familiar to him. It seemed he had seen it before somewhere.\u201cWatch out, Lord!\u201dThe spirit beast approached Lord Seven soundlessly. It opened its big mouth and was about to bite him.Lord Seven frowned, raising his hand to block it. With his clothes floating, a strong air flow burst from his sleeve, directly hitting the beast in the belly. The spirit beast was thrown toward a distant trunk and fell down, groaning sorely.Lord Seven\u2019s expression distorted. Surging Qi was flowing fiercely through his body and his injury became worse. But he adjusted his breath, not losing his fighting vigor.The beast\u2019s animal intuition was telling it that it had better not piss off this man.The spirit beast howled at Ming Shu; the latter waved the branch in her hand and said, \u201cRun, silly.\u201dThen the spirit beast belted out another howl and glared at Lord Seven for a moment before turning around to jump into the grass. It disappeared into the woods.\u201cZhi Po, what\u2019s wrong with you!\u201d Bai Yanran got rid of the man holding her and rushed to Ming Shu, saying sharply, \u201cWhy did you bring the spirit beast back to attack us?\u201dMing Shu smiled as she fiddled with the branch in her hand. \u201cWould you please be reasonable? It\u2019s you who asked me to bring it back, and you didn\u2019t say you wanted it dead or alive. Wasn\u2019t I doing what you asked? Speaking of what\u2019s wrong with me, that\u2019s what you should ask yourself, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d When did she tell her to bring it back? Bai Yanran spluttered, \u201cI told you to kill it, kill it, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d\u201cThe silly little thing struggled to grow into a big spirit beast, how could I have the heart to kill it?\u201dThe others\u2019 eyes bulged speechlessly. Could you please put the roasted meat away before talking nonsense?Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She couldn\u2019t suppress her anger, though. What\u2019s wrong with this Zhi Po, seriously . It had only been a few days since last time they met. Why was she like a totally different person? Especially with her rude attitude.\u201cI\u2019m not crazy.\u201d I\u2019m doing very fine.\u201cWhat on earth do you want to do? Why did you let the spirit beast attack\u2026\u201d Bai Yanran lost her words all of a sudden and her beautiful eyes gradually filled with disbelief. \u201cYou, you can rein the beast?\u201dAll the people present, including Lord Seven, turned to Ming Shu at the same time.There were all kinds of professions on the Xuanyuan Continent. The most common was the spiritual master. Anyone could become a spiritual master as long as they had a spirit pulse. The difference was in the levels, which ranged from the lowest to the highest.And besides the popular profession of spiritual master, there were other professions such as pharmacist, weapon refiner, master tactician, and beast-reining master.Among them, the most respectable were the pharmacist and the beast-reining master.It was not hard to understand that the pharmacist was of great importance. Who wouldn\u2019t be sick or injured during their lifetime?A beast-reining master, on the other hand, was able to rein in a spirit beast, making it easier for humans to tame. It was well known that taming a reined spirit beast was much easier than taming an un-reined one, with a 90% risk deduction.The spirit beast was ferocious and brave. Once it was tamed, it would become a powerful weapon. The higher a spirit beast\u2019s level was, the harder it was to tame. At this moment, the beast-reining master would play an import role.\u201cReining in a beast?\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s smile widened. \u201cThis skill seems quite powerful, but I can\u2019t.\u201dClearly Bai Yanran didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cIf you can\u2019t rein in a beast, why did the spirit beast listen to you?\u201d Only a beast-reining master could drive a beast. She must be capable of beast-reining.Beast-reining\u2026The purpose of coming to the Windy Mountain Range of Demons this time was precisely to catch a strong spirit beast to tame. If she knew how to rein in a beast, wouldn\u2019t it be easy for her to tame a powerful one? Bai Yanran was chuckling to herself in her heart.If she had known that Ming Shu mastered the beast-reining method, she wouldn\u2019t have treated her like that.Why didn\u2019t she tell her that she had this skill before? Now, in such a situation, does she want me to apologize to her in person? Bai Yanran pondered.\u201cWell, it just listened to me on its own. What could I do about that. You can ask it to follow you if you like.\u201d Ming Shu tore off a piece of roasted meat, and the irresistible smell immediately floated into the air.Bai Yanran was still struggling over whether to apologize or not when the woman who had been placed in the escort\u2019s arms suddenly moaned. She seemed unconscious, scratching at her clothes and skin constantly. Within a short while, her fair skin was all scratched up, tiny streams of blood beginning to appear.Ming Shu observed the messy scene on the other side as she chewed the delicious meat.Lord Seven stood in the crowd with his hands behind his back. He didn\u2019t seem panicked at all, not even changing his cold expression. Ming Shu licked her fingertips and asked, \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201dHui Xue looked over and followed Ming Shu\u2019s gaze. \u201cHe is the Seventh Lord of the Royal Family, Feng Cheng. The sick woman is his future wife, Lady Seven Xiao Rufei.\u201dXiao Rufei? The fake protagonist was called Xiao Rufeng\u2026 This Xiao Rufei seemed to be the legitimate Miss of the Xiao family, the formal female protagonist of this world. She should have lived a happy life with the male protagonist Feng Cheng.But unfortunately, as Xiao Rufeng\u2019s body was occupied by another person from another world, Xiao Rufei had to face a tough life. She was pressured by Xiao Rufeng in many ways, losing all kinds of opportunities. Furthermore, she ended up with a broken family and died bitterly.The fake protagonist was too cruel.I have to eat another spirit beast to calm down.[Extension Task: Gain Hatred Points from Bai Yanran.]From Bai Yanran? Isn\u2019t that a piece of cake? This task is of no technical content at all, it won\u2019t allow me to show off my real strength. Can I have another task?[No. ] This is a serious task, how can you change to another casually?Then\u2026 could you send a more challenging one?[The task isn\u2019t allowed to be sent unless it satisfies the conditions.] The Harmony System rejected her again. It was a system of principles, how could it compromise with the Guest\u2019s sweet words? [Feng Cheng is a conditional extension task. You can offend him as many times as possible.]Hey hey hey!Didn\u2019t you just say you wouldn\u2019t compromise easily?[\u2026] I didn\u2019t say anything.As Ming Shu was having a \u201cfriendly\u201d chat with the Harmony System, Bai Yanran ran over hurriedly from the other side. Her tone sounded a little uncomfortable, but still carried an arrogant \u201cMiss\u201d style. \u201cZhi Po, go have a look at her.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dBai Yanran glanced over and lowered her voice. \u201cHe is Lord Seven. You\u2019d better not displease him. Just go take a look, and tell him that you can\u2019t fix it.\u201dDo you think I want to save that Xiao Rufei? Of course not!Bai Yanran was only too anxious for Xiao Rufei\u2019s death. She was the one that was born to be the wife of Lord Seven. Why should that bitch occupy the position of the future Lady Seven?\u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d\u201cZhi Po!\u201d Bai Yanran was directly rejected twice. She couldn\u2019t help losing her temper and yelled in a shrill voice. But for fear that others would notice, she deliberately lowered her volume, which then sounded exceptionally weird. \u201cAre you going to do it or not?\u201dMing Shu smiled with moon-like eyes and eyebrows, her thin lips opening and closing. \u201cI won\u2019t do it. You can check her by yourself.\u201d\u201cIf I could do it, would I ask you?\u201d Bai Yanran grunted. \u201cIt\u2019s your honor to be ordered by me. Zhi Po, don\u2019t go too far. Without the protection of the Bai family, do you think you could survive in the Continent with your beast-reining method?\u201dThe latter part of the sentences were a bare threat.This sought-after profession was naturally a dangerous one.There\u2019s a saying: If I can\u2019t get what I want, no one else can have it, either.\u201cWell, since you said that\u2026\u201d Ming Shu answered in a rising tone. Bai Yanran thought her threat worked. But before she could even begin to smile, Ming Shu continued, her following words smashing her heart like heavy stones. \u201cI will definitely live happily on this Continent, but you may not be able to witness it.\u201dCouldn\u2019t you finish the sentence in one breath!Besides, what did she mean, Bai Yanran may not be able to witness it? Was she cursing her to die?\u201cZhi Po, you are going too far!\u201dMing Shu threw away the bones and took out a handkerchief to wipe her hands. \u201cFirst, I didn\u2019t sell myself to you. Second, I don\u2019t owe you money. I have every right to reject you. So, may I ask you how I\u2019m going too far?\u201dIn fact, she didn\u2019t have any obligation to save Xiao Rufei; even if she had, Death Valley saved people according to certain rules. No one was entitled to be saved.Before, the Host was kind of stupid, maybe for the sake of the plot. Throughout the whole story, the Host tolerated Bai Yanran and was led by the nose by her.This dramatic plot was truly amazing.Snacks were needed to calm emotions right then.Bai Yanran gritted her teeth. Glimpsing Feng Cheng coming this way, she instantly replaced her grim expression with an aggrieved face and tearful eyes. She said in a weeping voice, \u201cPlease, Zhi Po, just go take a look at Sister Fei\u2019er. I know it was all my fault before. But Sister Fei\u2019er is in danger now, go check on her, okay? I will pay you for the diagnosis.\u201dWhat?The whole Continent owes you an Oscar!So good at acting, why don\u2019t you enter showbiz?Feng Cheng approached with his escort, right on time to hear these words from Bai Yanran. He indifferently swept his gaze over Bai Yanran. Ming Shu wondered whether he caught their earlier conversation.He kept silent. The escort looked at Ming Shu and held his fist in his other hand. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, sorry to bother you, but could you take a look at Miss Xiao?\u201dMing Shu turned her smiling eyes to Feng Cheng and pointed at Bai Yanran with her finger. \u201cIf you want me to see the patient, you have to order your people to beat her.\u201d\u201cZhi Po, you\u2026\u201d Bai Yanran was beyond shocked now. It was hard to express her new level of shock, so far above the original level.Subtle changes were observed on Feng Chen\u2019s face. The escort was completely stunned.Was something wrong with his ears?The escort covered his blunder and said, \u201cWith all due respect, Miss Zhi Po, weren\u2019t you Miss Bai\u2019s person before?\u201d\u201cDo you want the diagnosis or not?\u201dLiked it?

Or had she met him several times? Well, it was not important\u2026 What was important now was that Xiao Rufeng had successfully drawn the attention of Feng Cheng, making him realize she was different from the rumors.However, Xiao Rufei occupied the position of the future Lady Seven now. Even if Feng Cheng wasn\u2019t fond of Xiao Rufei, he wouldn\u2019t stand by on the sidelines and watch her suffer, for the sake of the Xiao family.But if he accepted Ming Shu\u2019s proposal, he would have to offend the Bai family.Although he was from the royal family, in reality, the royal family and these noble families had large gaps between each other. It would cause trouble to offend any one of them.\u201cMiss Zhi Po, could you make another demand?\u201d Seeing his lord hesitate, the escort volunteered to speak out. \u201cAny rare and valuable objects. You need only name it, the royal family and the Xiao family will not let you down.\u201dWith just one sentence, the Xiao family was also dragged into the negotiation. No matter what requirements Ming Shu would ask, the Xiao family had to undertake half of the responsibility.These people were too shrewd to lose any pennies.\u201cWell, don\u2019t blame me, then.\u201d Ming Shu smiled to see them off. \u201cLord Seven, there\u2019s nothing I can do for you, please leave now.\u201dBeing the male protagonist, Feng Cheng had his own thoughts. He took a profound look at Ming Shu, and somehow, let his eyes fall on the pattern of her robe again.Where on earth had he seen it before?Watching Feng Cheng leave, Bai Yanran caught her breath again. It was too scary.\u201cZhi Po, you hold on!\u201d Bai Yanran dropped these threatening words. She dared cause her trouble with such malicious schemes; luckily Lord Seven didn\u2019t agree.\u201cWhatever. Are you going to eat me?\u201d Ming Shu was quite at ease.Anger turned Bai Yanran\u2019s eyes red. She glanced over at Feng Cheng and ran to him in a trot, abandoning her argument with Ming Shu.Ming Shu laughed lightly and continued eating.\u2026\u201cLord, Miss Xiao is getting worse now. We\u2019d better leave this place immediately,\u201d the escort suggested.Feng Cheng looked thoughtful, focusing his eyes on the woman moaning in pain. He then said in deep voice, one hand holding his jaw, \u201cShe was poisoned by the black-eyed golden viper. We need the healing herb to detoxify her, or nothing will help even we leave.\u201d\u201cBut the healing herb is too hard to find. I\u2019m afraid that before we get it, Miss Xiao might\u2026\u201d The healing herb was a very precious kind of herb, which could remedy all kinds of poisons.\u201cThe healing herb? When I arrived here, I heard someone shouting at a man for the healing herb.\u201d Although Bai Yanran wasn\u2019t willing to save Xiao Rufei, this was the perfect chance for her to draw Feng Cheng\u2019s attention.\u201cWhere\u2019s that man?\u201d the escort immediately asked.Looking around, Bai Yanran didn\u2019t find the man she saw earlier. \u201cIt seems he has left\u2026\u201d\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have gone far, I\u2019ll go chase him,\u201d the escort immediately said, turning to Feng Cheng to await his order.After a three-second pause, Feng Cheng nodded.The escort then left hurriedly to chase after Yang Shufeng and those students.The remaining escorts found it a little unbearable to see Xiao Rufei in pain, and someone suggested, \u201cLord, let me force that woman over so that she can make Miss Xiao feel better in the meanwhile.\u201dFeng Cheng didn\u2019t answer. He stared at Ming Shu\u2019s red hem drooping on the ground.\u201cLord?\u201dFeng Cheng returned to himself and ordered, \u201cFind a place to rest first.\u201dThe escort was a bit unwilling, throwing a glance at Ming Shu. But thinking that the woman might be capable of reining a beast, he then was convinced that it would be wise for the Lord not to contend with her so casually.\u2026The escorts didn\u2019t catch up with Yang Shufeng and those students. Xiao Rufei\u2019s condition was getting more and more serious. Bai Yanran volunteered to take care of Xiao Rufei. Feng Cheng agreed, for she might do the job more conveniently as she was of the same gender as the patient.Right now, a group of people were camped in a relatively open area, taking a rest.After Ming Shu finished her meat, she leisurely strolled near them with Hui Xue and Liu Feng. But she didn\u2019t get closer to them, just kept wandering not far away.The others were full of confusion, not knowing what she wanted to do.However, there was a clear boundary between them and Ming Shu, and neither side crossed over the line.Bai Yanran finally accepted the fact that Ming Shu would no longer listen to her, so she let go of the idea of ordering her about now. But deep in her heart, she was thinking of taking revenge for today, trying to find a way to teach Ming Shu a lesson.When it grew darker, everyone noticed Ming Shu starting to roast meat again.The tempting smell of the meat floated over, making their mouths water.But they had all grown up with servants and no one was willing to go hunting. More importantly, they had lost all their strength during the day being chased after by the sixth level spirit beast. They were too tired to move.\u201cYanran, what\u2019s wrong with that Zhi Po?\u201d Someone approached Bai Yanran, asking with a grouchy stare pointed in the direction of Ming Shu.Before, when Zhi Po was with them, they didn\u2019t have to worry about the food at all, because the two servants beside her would do everything for all of them.\u201cWho knows,\u201d Bai Yanran answered resentfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t beg her to come with me. Now she\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder, who does she think she is!\u201d\u201cYanran, if you didn\u2019t treat her that way, we might have avoided these unpalatable things now.\u201d A girl sitting opposite them blamed Bai Yanran, her tone ironic.Hearing this, Bai Yanran exploded. \u201cWhat do you mean? Are you blaming me?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, don\u2019t mistake me, Yanran,\u201d the girl immediately denied, but her tone was still iffy. \u201cBut I heard that she took the initiative to protect you. She was not your servant, how could you command her like a slave?\u201dBai Yanran was about to erupt. Then she saw Feng Cheng coming this way out of the corner of her eye, so she merely glared at the girl before putting on a smiling face for Feng Cheng.The girl rolled her eyes at Bai Yanran and whispered, \u201cIf not for your family, who would tolerate you? Now you dream to latch onto Lord Seven, what a joke.\u201dThe others also looked at each other and then quickly averted their gazes.Truly, they didn\u2019t like Bai Yanran; she always ordered them about and acted like she was the queen. But they could do nothing about it. She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth!Late at night, the camp quieted down.Ming Shu chewed on a bone like a dog. She stared at the campfire before her and pondered, What to eat for breakfast?Hui Xue sat next to Ming Shu. She was too sleepy to hold up her head.Ming Shu reached out to hold Hui Xue\u2019s slumping form, preventing her from hitting her head. Hui Xue was then gently placed against a tree trunk.Liu Feng, who stood in the tree, looked down to catch this picture. His calm black eyes flashed. The Miss seemed more approachable now and smiled more often.But that smile was not the same as in Death Valley. He couldn\u2019t tell what the difference was, though.Rustling\u2026Some weak sounds suddenly emerged from the woods behind them. Ming Shu turned her head to peer into the darkness, then she stood up, propping herself on the trunk and doing a little stretch. The Feng Cheng\u2019s escorts also heard the noises. But seeing Ming Shu stand up, they thought it was Ming Shu making the noise. After staring at her for a few seconds and not hearing the strange noises again, they slowly drew back their gazes.But something didn\u2019t seem right. Pondering uncertainly, the escorts turned to the source again.There was only a campfire there, the flames swaying with the night breeze. Nothing to see but the shift of dark and light.Even the one standing in the tree was gone.\u201cAooooo~!\u201dSeveral dark shadows leaped out from the darkness. The leading one was the very same sixth level spirit beast that chased them during the day.\u201cBeast attack!\u201d\u201cAhhh!\u201dLiked it?

Even Liu Feng wouldn\u2019t be able to win the fight for sure.\u201d A face appeared from among the leaves nearby. \u201cAnd moreover, not all students in the Royal School are talented ones. Some disciples from the big families were admitted because they met the requirements to pass through.\u201d\u201cYou are saying they were admitted through the back door?\u201dHui Xue choked, but had no reason to refute her. \u201cMaybe you can put it in that way\u2026\u201dMing Shu began to lose interest. \u201cIt\u2019s boring, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go have some night snacks.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d#How to deal with the Miss becoming more and more obsessed with food? Emergency. Waiting online.#Ming Shu returned after finishing her night snacks to find that these people were still being besieged by the spirit beasts.\u201cWhat a long-lasting war!\u201d Animals are indeed more powerful than humanity.Ming Shu told Hui Xue to stay where she was while she walked toward the spirit beasts\u2019 circle from the grass. Hearing her footsteps, the sixth level spirit beasts were alerted and looked over, roaring angrily to warn Ming Shu away.These spirit beasts were like huge cats with magnified features, long tails, and similar in size to tigers. There was a tuft of flashing hair between their eyebrows, thus people on the Continent called them thunder cats.Don\u2019t ask Ming Shu why they chose to call them thunder cats or why there was a tuft of flashing hair. She didn\u2019t understand the unique style of people on the Continent, either.\u201cAooo~!\u201d The spirit beast which showed up earlier this day growled, and the other beasts unwillingly retreated to gave way to Ming Shu.\u201cZhi Po, what do you want to do?\u201d Seeing Ming Shu appear, one of the survivors shouted. \u201cWhy did you drive the spirit beasts to attack us? What\u2019s your purpose?\u201d\u201cYou can talk nonsense, but you can\u2019t eat everything.\u201d The other person widened his eyes in surprise. Ming Shu waved her hands smilingly, \u201cSorry, I mean you can\u2019t talk nonsense and can\u2019t eat everything either. Did you witness me driving the spirit beasts to attack you?\u201d\u201cThe present situation can\u2019t be counted as evidence?\u201d The spirit beasts standing before them weren\u2019t evidence?\u201cDid I drive you to attack them?\u201d Ming Shu asked one of the thunder cats beside her seriously.The thunder cat shook its head with a howl.\u201cSee? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d Ming Shu innocently spread her hands. \u201cIt might be that one of you has done unthinkable things to offend them, otherwise, why did they just attack you?\u201d\u201cYou are the beast-reining master, of course they\u2019d listened to you.\u201d Some people still didn\u2019t believe her.[The Guest is able to earn many Hatred Points easily by taking the blame for others.]\u201c\u2026\u201dOkay, I have to educate you now.Earlier you encouraged me to kill people, and now began to praise the behavior of taking blame for others?Are you serious? Why couldn\u2019t you suggest some dignified actions?\u201cGreat. I did it! What can you do to me!\u201d Ming Shu raised her hand to give orders vigorously. \u201cKids, go on! Kill them!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Is this human a nutcase? the thunder cats thought.Everyone was alarmed. But they soon found the thunder cats were looking at Ming Shu as if she was a loser. Only the leader seemed to be staring at her with fear.Embarrassing atmosphere.Depressed feeling.Ming Shu waved her hands again and then touched her own hair, smiling. \u201cWell, you guys continue. I\u2019ll\u2026 go eat something.\u201dI told you these thunder cats have nothing to do with me. You had to see it for yourselves, satisfied now? I\u2019m not a so-called beast-reining master![\u2026] Was the host making herself a joke?No, the Host was here to tease others.\u2026Rumbling\u2014The moment Ming Shu turned around, a spark produced by a spirit force collision suddenly blazed into the night. As the thunder cats and all the people looked up to see, a human figure appeared in the crowd all of a sudden.Some \u201cthing\u201d seemed to be following her. Lots of trees were knocked down and a huge figure was gradually revealed.It was a bear.The bear\u2019s body was as big as a hill. Those towering trees were all pushed down effortlessly by its casual movement.Spotting the bear, the thunder cats were scared into an unwilling retreat, howling lowly.\u201cIt\u2019s a seventh level spirit beast! A seventh level!\u201d the silent crowd suddenly exclaimed.\u201cWhy is a seventh level spirit beast appearing in this place?\u201d\u201cZhi Po, that vicious woman, she must want to kill us all.\u201dThese frightened people held Ming Shu accountable for the situation without any hesitation.Ming Shu pointed to the person who just appeared. \u201cAre those objects attached to your necks just for decoration? Apparently the bear was led here by her, how\u2019s it related to me?\u201dMing Shu was fine with the Harmony System wronging her, but now these people intended to blame her for everything? No way.Everyone looked in the direction Ming Shu pointed. They hadn\u2019t noticed a new person appear in their group until now. And that person was retreating to the edges, getting ready to sneak away.\u201cXiao Rufeng!\u201d Bai Yanran recognized the person and called her name with widened eyes. \u201cWhy are you here? Weren\u2019t you\u2026\u201d Dead?Of course, she closed her mouth in time, swallowing back that last word.That figure had been discovered so she stopped retreating. She then stood still and looked at the others. Her meaty face was stained by a black birthmark, appearing a bit hideous.This was Xiao Rufeng, the fake protagonist.The present Xiao Rufeng hadn\u2019t begun her counterattack.Xiao Rufeng scoffed with a pair of cold eyes. \u201cSorry, Miss Bai, I\u2019ve let you down. I\u2019m still alive.\u201dHer sharp eyes turned quickly to rest on Ming Shu, who was standing behind the thunder cats at that time. Xiao Rufeng seemed to find it a bit odd that Ming Shu wasn\u2019t at Bai Yanran\u2019s side. She was standing all alone in the shadows.The light ended just at her feet. She stood over there like a shadow herself, expression unclear and essence indiscernible.\u201cWhat are you talking about! It has nothing to do with me.\u201d Unexpectedly, this person had a strong sense of determination. That she should be alive after being chased into a group of spirit beasts\u2026!Xiao Rufeng was very \u201cfamous\u201d and the present people all knew her. But they all looked at her with contemptuous eyes. \u201cXiao Rufeng, did you lead the bear here?\u201d\u201cWhat if I did, what if I did not?\u201d Xiao Rufeng averted her gaze carelessly, her face filled with arrogance.The bear was getting closer and closer. Everyone was too nervous to breathe. \u201cXiao Rufeng, you pissed off the bear, so you must face it by yourself. Don\u2019t get us in trouble!\u201d\u201cChase her out!\u201d\u201cRight, since she led it here, we should force her to lead it away.\u201dSomeone walked toward Xiao Rufeng. Xiao Rufeng put her hand behind her back, a flash of coldness crossing her eyes.\u201cNow we are in a dilemma. If you want to fight, wait till we resolve this,\u201d Feng Cheng\u2019s escort rebuked.The escort\u2019s words also expressed Feng Cheng\u2019s opinion. Though unwilling, these people didn\u2019t dare disobey Feng Cheng. They stared at Xiao Rufeng furiously.Ming Shu got ready to leave, but the thunder cat blocked her way with several mournful howls, rubbing its head against her thighs.\u201cPal, that\u2019s a bear.\u201d Ming Shu pointed at the approaching hill. \u201cDo you see that? A bear. Bears kill people. Let me pass.\u201d\u201cWuwu\u2026\u201d The thunder cat growled at its fellows. Then several thunder cats jumped fearlessly into the dark toward the bear.Soon, the roars of the bear carried to them. The bear was lured in another direction.The thunder cat looked at Ming Shu again, hopefully and fearfully.\u201c\u2026\u201d Who told you to lead it away!Fool!Liked it?

The thunder cat bit her clothes, howling, \u201cAoo\u2026\u201dMing Shu tried to pull her clothes free but failed, so she turned to look at the thunder cat with a sigh. Then she looked at the confused people standing away from her.\u201cWho took its egg? Just eat\u2026 no, give it back.\u201d I wonder if the eggs of thunder cats are edible.\u201cWhat egg?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t either. I didn\u2019t see any eggs.\u201d\u201cDoes the thunder cat lay eggs?\u201dOnce this remark was out the group suddenly fell quiet. They realized that the thunder cat seemed to have kittens instead of laying eggs. What kind of egg was it looking for?\u201cOkay, I asked, but it\u2019s up to them whether or not to give back your egg. Now let go of me.\u201d Ming Shu pulled at her clothes again.The thunder cat purred, reluctant to open its mouth, then turned to the other side, roaring. It probably meant to say to return the egg and avoid dying.Ming Shu really wanted to tell it that the novel\u2019s hero and heroine as well as the fake protagonist were all here. Even if you had a tenth level spirit beast beside you, you wouldn\u2019t be able to kill them. This is your fate! Probably your egg has been eaten.[\u2026] Do you think everyone is like you? Eat, eat, eat, what else do you know?Although several thunder cats had left for the bear, the remaining ones still outnumbered the humans, thus no one dared to make any rash moves.\u201cWho took it?\u201d Feng Cheng\u2019s fierce gaze swept across the crowd. But most people were dazed, not knowing anything about the egg.\u201cLord Seven, this must be Zhi Po\u2019s conspiracy. She is trying to find an excuse to kill us. Apparently thunder cats don\u2019t lay eggs.\u201d Someone boldly put forward his personal opinion.Feng Cheng glanced at the speaking person.\u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t say anything wrong.\u201d That man was a bit scared to look into the eyes of Feng Cheng, his voice almost unheard.\u201cWhoever took it, just hand it over quickly, or nobody can leave.\u201d One of Feng Cheng\u2019s escorts continued, \u201cNo matter what kind of egg, just take it out.\u201dFollowing the escort\u2019s sentence, Feng Cheng pointed at a person and said in an assured tone, \u201cHand it over.\u201dThat man flushed. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t take it.\u201dFeng Cheng slightly narrowed his eyes. The temperature seemed to have dropped several degrees. The man still tried to quibble, his body trembling. \u201cI really didn\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201cSearch him.\u201dFinally, the escort found an egg on that person. It was the size of a fist, the shell covered in colorful vertical stripes. No one present knew what animal would lay such an egg. Even Feng Cheng was confused.The escort held the egg, carefully approaching the thunder cat. He put the egg on the ground, then returned to the crowd.The thunder cat jumped out swiftly and picked up the egg in its mouth. It stared at the people over there for a while. Then, with a howling sound, all the thunder cats immediately scurried into the surrounding shrubs, disappearing without a trace.\u201c\u2026\u201d Ungrateful , Ming Shu thought.\u2026The bear returned shortly after the thunder cats left. The group scattered everywhere in panic. They didn\u2019t get rid of the bear until dawn.For some unknown purpose, Xiao Rufeng didn\u2019t take advantage of the chaos to escape.\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d After a break, everyone suddenly found they had deviated from their mapped route. They totally had no idea where they were at this moment.\u201cCheck the map.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. It can\u2019t tell where this place is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all Xiao Rufeng\u2019s fault.\u201dWith the quarreling going on in the front, Ming Shu walked slowly far behind them.Hui Xue was trying to figure out their location. Holding the map for a long time, she frowned and said worriedly, \u201cMiss, we seem to be near the Mountain of Dragon Bones.\u201d\u201cHave you ever seen such a colorful egg?\u201d Ming Shu touched her own chin, a meaningful smile on her face.\u201cWhat?\u201d Hui Xue was a little confused about Ming Shu\u2019s unexpected question. \u201cWhat kind of colorful egg?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wondering whether it\u2019s edible.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Our Miss didn\u2019t listen to me at all. Hui Xue took a deep breath. \u201cMiss, we\u2019re arriving at the Mountain of Dragon Bones.\u201dDragon?\u201cCan I eat it?\u201dHui Xue tried hard to force a smile on her face. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. The Mountain of Dragon Bones is very dangerous.\u201dDeath Valley, because of its need for a variety of rare and treasured herbs, often came in and out of the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. From one generation to another, the Valley gradually composed the most exhaustive, detailed map of it on the Continent.And the Mountain of Dragon Bones\u2026\u201cMiss, did you just say the Mountain of Dragon Bones?\u201d Feng Cheng\u2019s escort showed up out of nowhere, looking at them with a somewhat distorted expression. \u201cHow do you know this is the Mountain of Dragon Bones?\u201dLiu Feng appeared all of a sudden with a cold face. He blocked the escort\u2019s access to Ming Shu and Hui Xue.The escort wasn\u2019t surprised at all since he had already seen Liu Feng\u2019s actual strength. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, I meant no harm, I just happened to hear you mention the Mountain of Dragon Bones.\u201dHui Xue quickly folded the map, staring at him with alert eyes.The escort\u2019s gaze gleamed a little. It was surprising that they should have a map.Even the royal map, which had been drawn by countless people for the royal family, couldn\u2019t provide any useful information on this place.But these three\u2019s map seemed to still be viable, and it mentioned the Mountain of Dragon Bones\u2026Who are they?\u201cOh, it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d Ming Shu uttered this sentence rather abruptly. She turned her eyes as if she just saw the escort standing in front of her and, surprised, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cMiss zhi Po, just now this Miss said this is the Mountain of Dragon Bones.\u201d The escort expressed his doubts. \u201cIs it?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Ming Shu turned to ask Hui Xue.Hui Xue covered her chest with her hands, face dark. How should I answer? Or should I shut up? If I say something wrong, Miss will be angry again.The escort didn\u2019t get the answer he wanted, but was driven away. He then returned to Feng Cheng helplessly.\u201cI\u2019m so hungry. Liu Feng, go get some food.\u201d Ming Shu chose a place to sit down, holding her chin. She watched Feng Cheng\u2019s group from a distance. \u201cWhat kind of place is the Mountain of Dragon Bones?\u201d\u201cThe Mountain of Dragon Bones is one of the most dangerous places in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. It\u2019s rumored that this place was buried beneath dragon bones. The resentment of the dead dragon has taken root here. Anyone who entered the Mountain wouldn\u2019t be able to leave alive, so disciples of our Valley would walk around to avoid it,\u201d Hui Xue answered quickly while muttering to herself, Doesn\u2019t the Miss know this already?\u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d\u201cMiss, the point is we seem to be near the Mountain of Dragon Bones now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dHui Xue almost lost her mind. Miss, can\u2019t you be a little more nervous?\u2026\u201cI heard her mention the Mountain of Dragon Bones,\u201d the escort reported to Feng Cheng. \u201cThey seem to have a map, but I didn\u2019t see it clearly. Who are they, Lord?\u201dFeng Cheng glanced at Ming Shu\u2019s side. He also wanted to know who they were.\u201cGo and bring Bai Yanran here.\u201d\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201dBai Yanran thought Feng Cheng called her for some good reason. She came along with a happy and shy expression, but was only asked about the matter of Ming Shu.Bai Yanran hated Ming Shu secretly in her heart, but she didn\u2019t dare to show that resentment on her face. She belittled Ming Shu using both overt and covert words, exaggerating the facts at her own will.\u201cIn the beginning, she offered her services. Now that I think about the whole thing, I have to say she must\u2019ve hidden her evil purpose. Fortunately she exposed herself early, or I would still be in the dark.\u201d Bai Yanran looked entirely miserable. \u201cI was so kind to her but she used me. I\u2019m sorry, Lord, it\u2019s all because I trust people so easily.\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That was it? She didn\u2019t intend to quit. \u201cLord, actually I have\u2026\u201d\u201cXiao Rufeng, you\u2019re such a bitch, a bastard without a mother\u2019s education. Don\u2019t you look in the mirror? Look at your ugly face, how dare you compare yourself to Rufei.\u201d The sound of an angry rebuke interrupted Bai Yanran\u2019s confession.Feng Cheng looked to the source. A girl in the group as well as several others confronted Xiao Rufeng, some food scattered on the ground. Xiao Rufeng bowed her head, her expression unseen.The girl abused Xiao Rufeng with words for a while, but it seemed to not be enough for her. She was about to physically beat Xiao Rufeng; meanwhile, Xiao Rufeng couldn\u2019t bear such humiliation for much longer.A great argument war was about to begin.Main characters: Xiao Rufeng, Miss Nobody, Feng Cheng, Bai Yanran, and a number of extras.Audience: The golden triangle team of Death Valley.Er\u2026 plus a thunder cat.As the other side was trapped in endless quarrels, the thunder cat jumped out of the grass, lowering its head wearily. It spat the egg out from its mouth and pushed it toward Ming Shu using its nose.\u201cYou\u2019re giving me this to eat?\u201d Ming Shu picked up the egg to throw it excitedly into the fire.The thunder cat immediately bit on her sleeve, shaking its head strongly. It\u2019s not for you to eat.\u201cIf it\u2019s not for me to eat, why did you give it to me?\u201d Ming Shu threw the egg aside.The thunder cat whined with a desperate look. It stretched out a paw to pull the egg back. With its nose touching the egg continuously, the thunder cat seemed to be trying to wake it up.\u201cNo breathing, it\u2019s dead.\u201d Hui Xue didn\u2019t have the heart to see the thunder cat in pain. It looked so pitiful.Hearing this, the thunder cat grew more despairing. It pressed on the egg and started to cry aloud, purring.\u201c\u2026\u201d Are you serious? As a spirit beast, is it necessary for you to cry so energetically?Ming Shu thought.\u201cMiss, check this, is there any hope of rescuing it?\u201d Hui Xue looked at Ming Shu with imploring eyes. She seemed to have forgotten the fierce and cruel aspect of the thunder cat. Before such furry animals, she was completely helpless to resist.\u201cI\u2019m not a veterinarian.\u201d Being the dignified Master of Death Valley, am I supposed to treat a spirit beast?\u201cWuwu\u2026\u201d The thunder cat constantly used its paws to tug at Ming Shu\u2019s clothes.Ming Shu pulled her clothes back, ignoring it.The thunder cat looked at Ming Shu, its eyes radiating hope and confusion as well as fear.It cried for a while before leaving without the egg. But it came back quickly, placing a branch weighed with bright red fruit before Ming Shu.\u201cThat\u2019s fire cloud fruit,\u201d Hui Xue exclaimed. \u201cSo many\u2026 A lot more than the Valley\u2019s stock.\u201dMing Shu picked it up to have a look. There were four fruits on one branch, each the same size of grapes. She took one to shove into her mouth.\u201cMiss, are you\u2026\u201d Hui Xue was shocked. She reached out to grab the remaining fruit from Ming Shu\u2019s hand. \u201cSpit it out, quickly. Miss, the fire cloud fruit can\u2019t be eaten like this. It will kill you.\u201d The fire cloud fruit was of strong quality and must be refined before eating.Ming Shu dodged aside. She quickly picked off the remaining three fire cloud fruits, shoving them all into her mouth.\u201c\u2026\u201dWe\u2019re finished , Hui Xue thought.\u201cLiu Feng!\u201d Hui Xue cried. Her loud voice even quieted down the noisy people arguing nearby.Liu Feng jumped down from the tree, staring at Ming Shu silently. Ming Shu threw away the branch and said breezily, \u201cThese may be fake fire cloud fruits. As you can see, I\u2019m feeling very well.\u201dTears were forming in Hui Xue\u2019s eyes. She stepped forward to grab Ming Shu\u2019s wrist and feel her pulse. It was very stable.\u201cHow could it\u2026\u201d She wouldn\u2019t be wrong, that was fire cloud fruit.The thunder cat took the opportunity to bring another bunch back. Just as Ming Shu was about to take it, Hui Xue grabbed it first. \u201cMiss, even if there\u2019s no side effect, you can\u2019t eat.\u201dI don\u2019t know why Miss is fine after eating the fruit, but what if there is some sequela?I can\u2019t let Miss take the risk.Ming Shu felt a little full now. After deliberating for a while, she decided not to fight with Hui Xue. She sat back in her place, picking up the egg. Slightly turning her head, she impressively encountered countless pairs of eyes looking at her.She curled her lips and chuckled lightly. \u201cAre you enraptured by my beauty? I will become proud if you continue to look at me this way.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Psychopath , everyone thought.Let\u2019s continue our arguing.\u2026Finally, the debate that centered around Xiao Rufeng came to an end because of one sentence from Feng Cheng.Xiao Rufei fell ill again. Originally Xiao Rufeng didn\u2019t intend to save Xiao Rufei, but Feng Cheng took her aside. It seemed they made an unknown deal with each other. Then Xiao Rufeng came back to feed Xiao Rufei a Dan medicine with a cold expression.Once she took the Dan medicine, Xiao Rufei clearly became better. But she still needed to be detoxified.They had to leave this place as soon as possible.Most of the people continued to move forward. But as they walked, they found themselves circling back to their original spot\u2014the woman named Zhi Po was still sitting under a tree, fiddling with a colorful egg.A thunder cat lay next to her, its gaze following the spinning egg. It was such a harmonious scene\u2026 Not even a little!All because of that egg! They were besieged by thunder cats. But now the egg was being toyed with by this woman. What the hell?!\u201cLord Seven, what kind of animal do you think that egg belongs to?\u201d Xiao Rufeng stood beside Feng Cheng with crossed arms, looking at the others in the distance.\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Feng Cheng answered briefly.\u201cMiss Xiao, do you know?\u201d the escort asked.\u201cI\u2019m a loser, how could I know.\u201d Xiao Rufeng shrugged, mocking herself.The corners of the escort\u2019s mouth twitched a little. This Miss Seven of the Xiao family is truly a unique individual.Xiao Rufeng and Feng Cheng both knew the girl over there was not easy to deal with. No matter whether what they had gone through before had something to do with her, they shouldn\u2019t disrespect her now.They\u2019d better talk about this later, after leaving this place.So they stopped the discussion about the egg.The escort hesitated to ask. \u201cLord, we\u2019ve probably been trapped here. That Zhi Po has a map, maybe we should find a way to borrow it?\u201dBai Yanran wandered closer deliberately because she saw Xiao Rufeng standing near Feng Cheng. She happened to catch that Zhi Po had a map. Her beautiful eyes rolling, she immediately suggested, \u201cLord, let me go borrow the map. Anyway, she was my servant before.\u201dAs long as I get the map, Lord Seven must think highly of me later.Xiao Rufeng looked at Bai Yanran like she was an idiot.\u201cXiao Rufeng, what is that look on your face?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a look of congratulations. I wish Miss Bai good luck,\u201d Xiao Rufeng said sarcastically.\u201cJust you wait!\u201d Bai Yanran was the kind of person who couldn\u2019t stay calm with any provocation. She would be irritable immediately after being taunted.Leaving once Feng Cheng answered, the angry Bai Yanran directly went over to Ming Shu.Ming Shu threw the egg to the thunder cat and adjusted her clothes. \u201cThat idiot is coming to be humiliated.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Where\u2019s the idiot? Why did you fix your clothes for the idiot?Just as well, it\u2019s not so easy to meet such a stupid female supporting role , Ming Shu thought.It\u2019s a rare opportunity, so let\u2019s just make the most of it.\u201cZhi Po.\u201d Bai Yanran stood before Ming Shu and got straight to the point, saying, \u201cYou have a map of this place, right? I want to use it.\u201dMing Shu smiled. \u201cWho told you I have a map? Go ask the one who told you that. I don\u2019t have any map.\u201dBai Yanran frowned, \u201cDon\u2019t beat around the bush. I know you have it. How about this, you give me the map, and I will not cause you trouble again. You and I will be even later.\u201dMing Shu raised her fist to her lips, coughing out a chuckle.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She tried to shield the injured part, but the stick fell on her body constantly, leaving no time for her to take action. There seemed to be spirit force behind every hit, for each time, Bai Yanran felt as if her skin was going to split.Ming Shu wore a calm smile during the whole process. That deadwood had clearly changed into a powerful weapon in her rising and falling hands.Bai Yanran tried to gather her spirit force to fight back. But each try ended in vain because Ming Shu just didn\u2019t give her any chance!\u201cZhi Po, are you crazy? Stop it!\u201d Bai Yanran shouted in a broken voice. She finally got a chance to flee. Standing far from Ming Shu, arms around her shoulders, Bai Yanran stared at the crazy bully with angry red eyes.This damn woman, she dared beat me before so many people.Ming Shu waved the stick in her hand and asked, \u201cStill want the map?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Bai Yanran was breathing heavily due to fury, face flushed and eyes shining with billowy hatred. She gritted her teeth. \u201cZhi Po, you will pay for what you did today.\u201dShe would let this woman know what\u2019s worse than death.Fiddling with the stick in her hand, Ming Shu smiled breezily and didn\u2019t say a word.But she looked more irritating that way than if she had rampantly retorted.Bai Yanran stomped her feet angrily and turned around to run away. Someone tried to pay her some care, yet was ignored. Soon she ran out of everyone\u2019s sights.\u201cMiss, Bai Yanran was infuriated by this\u2026\u201d Hui Xue said worriedly after Bai Yanran\u2019s figure completely disappeared. \u201cShe is narrow-minded and likes to get up to little tricks, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201dAs the saying goes, fair and honest revenge is better than intrigue and secret conspiracy. The latter just left you nowhere to hide.\u201cHui Xue, this place is the Windy Mountain Range of Demons.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the Windy Mountain Range of\u2026\u201d After pausing for a moment, Hui Xue understood Ming Shu\u2019s words.The Windy Mountain Range of Demons was thousands of miles away from the Bai family, and Bai Yanran\u2019s followers either died or got separated. So it was not so easy for Bai Yanran to scheme something.Ming Shu kept silent. What she was thinking was, Killing a person in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons is easy, and won\u2019t draw much attention.Clearly Hui Xue misunderstood her meaning, but Ming Shu didn\u2019t intend to explain.\u2026\u201cMiss Zhi Po, what do we have to do to borrow your map?\u201d The escort came to negotiate with Ming Shu under Feng Cheng\u2019s order.Ming Shu was now riding on the thunder cat with an extremely unrestrained and frank posture and was fiddling with that colorful egg. Hearing the question, she looked up slightly to sweep a glance over the escort. She said slowly, \u201cYou really want to know?\u201dThe escort solemnly nodded. \u201cAs you just mentioned, if this place really is the Mountain of Dragon Bones, we are all in danger now. We\u2019d better get out of here as soon as possible. You too, Miss Zhi Po.\u201d\u201cBut I have the map, I can leave on my own. Why should I lend it to you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d That\u2019s why I asked you what do you want so as to share the map with us! If Miss Zhi Po has any demands, just tell us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s simple.\u201d Ming Shu jerked her chin toward Feng Cheng, saying smilingly, \u201cI\u2019ll lend you the map when your lord is dead.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d This is simple?He wanted to cut this woman.She dared curse the lord!The escort didn\u2019t dare to look into the eyes of his lord as he returned to report. Since he began working for Feng Cheng, he had never seen anyone provoke the lord like this bold and arrogant woman.Feng Cheng glanced over at Ming Shu with his gloomy eyes. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What? What\u2019s interesting! Such a disrespectful woman. If they\u2019d been at the capital city now, she would have been cut into pieces to feed the wolves a thousand times over.Xiao Rufeng leaned against the trunk as her eyes moved back and forth between Feng Cheng and Ming Shu, not knowing what she was thinking.\u2026Ming Shu refused to share the map; Feng Cheng and his people could do nothing about it. They tried to find the right direction again several times but still couldn\u2019t get out, so they decided to go deeper.Since they couldn\u2019t leave they\u2019d rather go deeper to have a look.This idea was put forward by Xiao Rufeng, which was naturally doubted by many of them. In the end, these people didn\u2019t stop arguing until Feng Cheng commanded them to keep going.No one knew exactly whether there were dragon bones buried under the Mountain of Dragon Bones. But they all knew it was a dangerous place. They were too scared to go on steadily once they heard this place might be the Mountain of Dragon Bones. If it wasn\u2019t for Feng Cheng leading the way, they would have fled.The trees were not tall on the Mountain of Dragon Bones, and the sunshine easily broke through the canopy, gleaming brightly on the fallen leaves covering the ground. The leaves rustled as the group marched past.The sun was strong, and any exposed skin burned like it was on fire, almost on the edge of explosion.The further they marched, the stronger the burning sensation was.At last, all of them were too hot and tired to move.\u201cI can\u2019t do this, too hot and thirsty.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so tired, I can\u2019t walk any further. Can we just rest for a while?\u201dComplaints rose up in succession, and the ones at the front had to stop. Because of her obesity, Xiao Rufeng\u2019s entire face was dripping with sweat, but her expression didn\u2019t change much. Compared to those tired and gasping people, she was much hardier.\u201cIt\u2019s like a stove in here, damn, what a hell of a place this is. I don\u2019t want to walk!\u201d Bai Yanran lost her \u201cMiss\u2019s temper\u201d and sat to the side right away, without considering the situation.\u201cBe careful!\u201d an alarmed voice cried suddenly.A snake\u2019s head appeared behind Bai Yanran, flying above the ground of fallen leaves, and the snake\u2019s tail swiftly slipped out from under them, wrapping around Bai Yanran\u2019s body. Bai Yanran was frightened into screaming hysterically, yet completely forgot to counterattack.By the time she remembered to fight back, her hands and legs were all wrapped tightly in the snake\u2019s coils and couldn\u2019t move at all. The snake squeezed tighter, and Bai Yanran felt as if her internal organs had been squished together and the air consistently pressed out of her. She had to open her mouth to breathe.The snake\u2019s body was a golden yellow, the scales dazzling in the sunlight. It was a huge snake; its length was unknown, because there was still a long section of it concealed by the leaves.The eyes of the snake were also golden, without the slightest impurity.\u201cHelp! Help me\u2026\u201d Bai Yanran shouted to the crowd in a quivering voice. \u201cWhat are you thinking about! Help me! Lord Seven, help!\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d A crisp sound rang out from a distance. \u201cMiss Xiao, why did you disturb the snake? It was soundly asleep.\u201dEveryone looked to the speaker at the same time.Including that huge golden serpent.The woman was standing slightly above them, on a stone. Her red robe floated in the air in a natural arc, making the white dress underneath appear extremely holy. She held an unknown fruit, staring at it interestedly with a perfect smile. The maid stood below, but the escort was nowhere to be seen.Hearing Ming Shu\u2019s words, Xiao Rufeng narrowed her eyes a bit, but her facial expression remained unchanged.No wonder the fake female protagonist was worthy of being a killer. Probably, her calm was much stronger than a normal, real female protagonist.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone followed Feng Cheng\u2019s gaze; Xiao Rufeng suddenly became the focus of the present, while the serpent, as well as Bai Yanran who it had \u201ckidnapped,\u201d were ignored.Xiao Rufeng put her hands in her sleeves, cleared her throat, and said, her voice neither humble nor self-important, \u201cMiss, what do you mean? I was standing the furthest away, how could I have disturbed it?\u201dBefore, when Bai Yanran bullied her, this woman was always an accomplice. Although she didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d fallen out, she still held a grudge for the original Xiao Rufeng.\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d Bai Yanran was in despair. She was in this situation, how could these people turn to that woman? Couldn\u2019t they save her first?But no one noticed her.\u201cXiao Rufeng, why did you disturb the serpent?\u201d Someone who disliked Xiao Rufeng immediately grasped this chance.Xiao Rufeng sneered. \u201cDidn\u2019t you bring your brains with you?\u201dThe others were about to talk back, but the woman\u2019s voice carried over to stop them.\u201cI also think they didn\u2019t bring their brains with them.\u201d Ming Shu shoved a fruit into her mouth. \u201cWhy are you looking at me? Miss Xiao said it, I just echoed it. Hers was the original sin.\u201d\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d\u201cXiao Rufeng, I knew you were planning some evil things. Are you going to put us to death!\u201d\u201cXiao Rufeng is a total disaster, we shouldn\u2019t travel with her.\u201dMing Shu meant to arouse conflict between Bai Yanran and the others. But at this time, the silly miss was not here, so these people were more willing to argue with Xiao Rufeng.Ming Shu pondered for a moment. She realized it wasn\u2019t because Bai Yanran had no bone to pick with them, but because Xiao Rufeng was the fake protagonist.With the protagonist aura, it was like being equipped with an attention-grabbing apparatus.Xiao Rufeng became a little angry, but she couldn\u2019t show it on her face. She had to suppress her desire to quarrel with these people.\u201cHelp\u2026\u201d Bai Yanran\u2019s face turned pale, her voice getting weaker and weaker.The serpent hadn\u2019t encountered such a situation before. Apparently it had \u201ckidnapped\u201d an unimportant person.These hateful humans dared ignore it.The serpent shook its tail and threw Bai Yanran away. Then, almost at the same time, its golden tail flew toward Xiao Rufeng, curled around her ankle, and fiercely dragged her toward it.Xiao Rufeng was dragged on the ground, instantly sliding a few meters. But she calmed down quickly and gathered a ball of light made of spirit force to hit the serpent in the tail.The Serpent hissed angrily in pain. But it didn\u2019t release Xiao Rufeng; instead, it sped up to drag her to its side.Its huge body wrapped around Xiao Rufeng in continuous spirals.The tail tip, as sharp as a sword, was pointing at Xiao Rufeng\u2019s neck. Only a little strength was needed to pierce through her whole neck.This all happened in a few seconds; everyone had yet to recover from arguing with Xiao Rufeng, but already Xiao Rufeng had been seized by the serpent.\u201cHuman, get out of here.\u201d The serpent stared at Feng Cheng with a pair of golden eyes. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll kill her first, then kill all of you.\u201dThe atmosphere quieted down strangely.Even Xiao Rufeng gently took a breath, her eyes flashing with joy.\u201cIt can speak.\u201d Ming Shu looked back to Hui Xue. \u201cIs it a saint beast or a divine beast?\u201dThe higher a spirit beast\u2019s level was, the smarter it would be, and it might even understand human language. But to speak human words, it had to be a saint or divine beast.\u201cMiss, shh.\u201d Hui Xue shook her head at Ming Shu.Liu Feng jumped down from the tree as well, staring at the serpent over there with a cold face. He tightened the muscles throughout his whole body, getting ready to fight.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, is it powerful?\u201d Ming Shu was a little puzzled seeing the two act nervously.Hui Xue lowered her voice. \u201cIf it really is a saint beast, much less us, not even Liu Feng could deal with it.\u201d\u201cOf that niubility?\u201dHui Xue was a little unfamiliar with the word \u201cniubility,\u201d but combined with the context, she could just barely understand its meaning. \u201cEven if the most powerful holy spiritualists on the Continent were here, they may not be able to win against a saint beast. The saint beasts are the closest to the Divine Ones.\u201dOn this continent, a holy spiritualist was the most powerful kind of human. The number of holy spiritualists on the Continent could be counted on the fingers of one hand.As for the Divine Ones\u2026They hadn\u2019t been seen in almost a thousand years.\u201cThat\u2019s really powerful,\u201d Ming Shu praised insincerely.\u2026As Ming Shu and Hui Xue discussed, Feng Cheng and the serpent also exchanged ideas. Then the serpent somehow let its gaze fall on Ming Shu\u2019s figure.\u201c\u2026\u201d Why are you looking at me? What do you want?The serpent stuck out its scarlet tongue. \u201cAs long as she gives me the egg, I will help you leave the Mountain of Dragon Bones.\u201dThe egg?How was this related to the egg again?Ming Shu took out the colorful egg from the folds of her clothes. She had been warming and cultivating it with her spirit force these days, which gave it a sound environment to keep breathing. But it was still too weak and could die at any moment.Feng Cheng spared a glance for Xiao Rufeng, who was as cool as a cucumber. \u201cShe is not one of us.\u201d\u201cHmph, that\u2019s none of my business. Either give me the egg, or you all die here.\u201d The serpent\u2019s eyes were filled with viciousness. \u201cThe skeletons buried here will welcome your company.\u201dFeng Cheng frowned and turned to look at Ming Shu. Both this woman and the serpent were hard to deal with.If he hadn\u2019t been injured before, they might have had a chance if they fought the serpent\u2026\u201cZhi Po, hand that useless egg over! I don\u2019t want to stay here, I want to get out.\u201d\u201cMiss Zhi Po, give it what it wants. This is a saint beast, not a common spirit beast.\u201dBefore Feng Cheng opened his mouth, the others couldn\u2019t help speaking one after another.The first reaction of these people upon seeing the saint beast was to run rather than seize it. It could be said that a saint beast was almost impossible to defeat.\u201cAo wu!\u201d The thunder cat stopped Ming Shu with its head against Ming Shu\u2019s flank, eyes imploring. You can\u2019t give it the egg. It will eat it.\u201cThe egg is really edible?\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s eyes brightened.\u201cAo wu.\u201d No no no, it isn\u2019t.If the thunder cat could cry, it might have cried aloud right then. It went a long way to bring the egg back, but the egg was dying. Now the egg finally recovered a little, yet was discovered by the serpent. Apart from the serpent, even the woman here wanted to eat the egg.It really couldn\u2019t be eaten!\u201cMiss Zhi Po, the egg can save our lives. Could you give it to the serpent?\u201d Although they didn\u2019t know what kind of egg it was, if it was desired by a spirit beast, it must be a valuable egg.But now it was difficult to protect themselves, let alone an egg.Ming Shu smiled with curved eyes and eyebrows. Under the gaze of the thunder cat and the serpent, she slowly loosened her fingers.The colorful egg dropped from her hands. The thunder cat and the serpent took action at the same time, but the former was near Ming Shu, so it grabbed the egg with its mouth quickly and twisted around, leaping into the jungle behind it.The serpent chased after it swiftly, Xiao Rufeng still wrapped in its tail. The leaved were dragged along by the snake\u2019s body. The crowd now discovered that what they just saw was only the tail and head of the serpent. The middle portion of its body was completely hidden under the leaves.The fierce wind produced by the serpent\u2019s movement knocked the others off-kilter. Some were disoriented by the huge body.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Won\u2019t you thank me?\u201d I told you I\u2019m not a scumbag.[\u2026] Put away the egg in your hand before saying that.The others stood up from the ground and looked to Ming Shu. Her smiling face was really annoying. Seeing her holding the colorful egg, all their gratitude vanished immediately.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d How was the egg still in her hand? What did the thunder cat just take away?They clearly saw her throwing away the egg!The serpent wanted this egg. If it found itself cheated, the consequences would be disastrous.\u201cLord, what should we do now?\u201d Xiao Rufeng was taken away by the serpent.But these people didn\u2019t intend to save her. What would the Lord plan to do?\u201cYou stay, and the rest follow me.\u201d Feng Cheng tossed a deep glance at Ming Shu.\u201cLord, the serpent is not easy to deal with. It is unwise to go after it like this.\u201d The escort tried to persuade Feng Cheng not to go.But Feng Cheng swept his eyes over him; the escort closed his mouth all at once.Feng Cheng left with some others to chase after the serpent. Meanwhile, Ming Shu jumped off the stone with the egg and told Hui Xue to make a fire. She was going to roast the egg.Everyone looked at the spirals of smoke floating into the air, feeling a little weird. What on earth was that woman doing?\u201cYanran, before\u2026 didn\u2019t you find there\u2019s something wrong\u2026 with her brain?\u201dThrown away by the serpent, Bai Yanran then returned to the team, but she looked a little messy. Faced with everyone\u2019s doubts, she grunted. \u201cHow would I know.\u201d Who the hell knew whether that Zhi Po was bewitched or not.Just now, this group of people ignored her like she didn\u2019t exist, and now they dared to come to her?Bai Yanran\u2019s expression made the surrounding people a bit embarrassed. They tried to justify themselves. \u201cYanran, It was a saint beast, we could do nothing about it\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for us to defeat a saint beast. Don\u2019t be angry with us, Yanran. You\u2019re always a lucky dog, no matter what happens you\u2019ll be fine.\u201dHearing these flatteries, Bai Yanran grunted again, sarcastically. She originally looked down on these people; if they were not needed as attendants, she wouldn\u2019t have talked to them. This time, treating her in this way, Bai Yanran was definitely too angry to show them a pleasant face.Yet Bai Yanran seemed to have forgotten: This place was the dangerous Windy Mountain Range of Demons, a place that could even trap and kill the senior Master.It\u2019s neither the Royal School, nor did it belong to the Bai family.After talking to themselves for a while and being faced with Bai Yanran\u2019s arrogant attitude, several students stopped trying and stood aside with each their own thoughts.\u201cMiss, it seems they are quarreling with each other.\u201d Hui Xue squatted next to Ming Shu, wearing a slightly contemptuous look. \u201cBai Yanran has a bad temper. She offended lots of people before at the Royal School. Now at the Windy Mountain Range of Demons she still acts like everyone is a servant. I dare say, if she really disrespected the heartless and cruel ones, she\u2019ll doubtless be killed in secret.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Ming Shu stared at the egg in her hand and didn\u2019t care about others at all. She turned to the flame, moved the egg above the fire, then slowly opened her fingers.\u201cMiss!\u201dIt was Liu Feng\u2019s voice. A little hoarse, but not unpleasant to hear. Ming Shu rarely heard his voice; now with his sudden call, she looked to him compliantly.But all of a sudden, Ming Shu felt a dark shadow come over her, an indistinct figure standing in front of her. An exotic aroma floated to her nose and the egg was snatched from her hand.Ming Shu was stunned for a moment, then suddenly realized what was happening.Someone dared to rob me of my food!? Seriously?!Ming Shu reversed her fingers to catch the person\u2019s hand. However, the minute she touched the other\u2019s skin, that human figure suddenly changed into a cloud of smoke, drifting to the opposite side like lightning.The smoke led the flame to another side, and the licking flames immediately lit the surroundings. Within a short time, the flames rose quickly and a natural burning barrier appeared.The smoke slowly condensed into a human form on the other side of the fire.That \u201cman\u201d was dressed in a white robe, which was embroidered with some obscure golden patterns. The front was slightly open and upper half of his black hair was tied back, while the lower half was casually draped over his shoulders and chest. Under the smooth hair, delicate collarbones were exposed.The fire whistled, reflecting a magnificent landscape in the man\u2019s deep, dark eyes.The man had a somewhat pale face, but his soul-stirring beauty still impressed everyone. He curled his mouth in a coquettish smile, his sudden appearance not unlike a demon incidentally come down to the human world. The shade of his lips was somehow bloodthirsty.The colorful egg was now held in his hand, the joints articulated. It looked like he only needed a little strength to break the egg.Ming Shu held her breath a little.Everyone fell into a weird silence. Only the burning fire still sang with abandon.The man\u2019s very breath seemed charming; he was altogether too flirtatious, like an evil spirit that could steal one\u2019s soul. But at the same time, he possessed some imperceptible purity, as pure as the purest creature at the beginning of the world, unstained and clean.Two extremes were combined inside one single person.Ming Shu lowered her gaze. Her smiling voice broke the silence. \u201cHui Xue, how did this silly person appear?\u201dStartled back to herself, Hui Xue strove to move her sights away from the man standing opposite them. She answered in an intricate and obscure voice, \u201cHe\u2026 seems to be\u2026 the Master of Drunken Flower Pavilion.\u201d\u201cWho cares about some so called Drunken Flower or Grass Pavilion! Didn\u2019t you see him rob my food?\u201d Ming Shu pointed at the man. Her smiling cheer was mixed with savage aggression.To dare to grab my snack!I\u2019m going to beat him badly!Ming Shu rolled up her sleeves, getting ready to take action. But Hui Xue pulled her clothes in a timely manner. \u201cMiss, calm down. That Master of Drunken Flower Pavilion is not so simple, he\u2019s quite abnormal.\u201d\u201cAbnormal?\u201d Who could be more abnormal than me?Hm\u2026 it seems something is not right\u2026Forget about it. What\u2019s most important now is to get the egg back.Ming Shu broke free from Hui Xue and jumped over the wall of fire to her screams, straightforwardly attacking the man\u2019s vitals. Again, before Ming Shu could touch him, he instantly changed into a plume of smoke and slipped away, right through Ming Shu\u2019s fingers.\u201cDeath Valley is really losing its power with each generation.\u201d The man\u2019s silvery voice carried through the fire, reaching the ears of Ming Shu. It was like a sneer, but his tone also contained contempt.Ming Shu shook her sleeves and smiled, saying, \u201cOkay. You\u2019re powerful, you\u2019re the best.\u201dThe man raised his eyebrows slightly. He seemed a little confused about why Ming Shu started to praise him all of a sudden.Just as he was observing her, a chill suddenly went down his spine and a strong force was aimed at his back. He quickly moved sideways to avoid it, but with the wind whistling past his ear, a warm hand grasped his arm. His surroundings were turned upside down, then he was suddenly pressed upon by a heavy weight.The woman\u2019s face appeared over him, grinning.Ming Shu kicked the fallen person\u2019s body angrily. Then, stepping on his chest, she bent over him with a smile, her hands propped on her knees. \u201cFellow, you dared to take my egg. Who gave you the courage?\u201dThe man was stunned, staring at her for a few seconds. Then he suddenly opened his mouth: \u201cGirl, your clothes are open.\u201dMing Shu remained unmoved.I\u2019ve been playing this trick since a long time ago. Don\u2019t presume to get me with it!The man\u2019s expression stiffened for a moment. He had a weird feeling about the smile of the woman above him.Undoubtedly, her smile was as natural as the spring wind of March, but he could see the chilly sharpness beneath that smiling facade, hidden like blades. It was as if her \u201cfake\u201d smile could fling those cold, sharp blades at him at any moment.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She found something was wrong as soon as she touched the egg.Dead?Can a dead egg be eaten?[\u2026] Is this the time to think about whether a dead egg is edible or not? Don\u2019t tell me, she raised the egg with her own warmth these past days just to eat it? the Harmony System wondered.This idea was scary, but without knowing why, the Harmony System felt this was the truth.What a suffocating truth.Taking the opportunity whilst Ming Shu focused on the egg, that man turned into smoke again. With no body beneath her foot, Ming Shu\u2019s frame wobbled a little and she almost fell to the ground.\u201c\u2026\u201d What the hell is this little goblin?He kills the egg, and now wants to leave soundly?That! Is! Impossible!However, the man did not intend to run away. He transformed into a human again in midair and patted his dust-free clothes with slender fingers. \u201cMaster of the Valley, do you know what that is in your hand?\u201d\u201cFood.\u201dJust now it was still alive, but then it had been toyed with to death.Ming Shu was very manic inside. She put away the egg and dragged a branch in her hand, a spark next to her. Swiftly and violently, she threw the branch at the man. The spark seemed to ignite the air, and countless flames swept toward him.The man\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. He avoided the flames with a few easy dodges.But soon, the flames fanned by Ming Shu surrounded him on all sides, as if they had felt, like sentient beings, Ming Shu\u2019s intention. The flames continued to engulf the vegetation in an attempt to make themselves taller and stronger.\u2026\u201cDamn! You humans tricked me!\u201d The serpent\u2019s roar resounded through the sky, and a golden light erupted from the woods all of a sudden. Then the serpent halted its huge body in a rush, knocking down the surrounding trees. They collapsed with a thunderous noise.The flames were reflected in the golden pupil of the serpent, and in the swaying lights, two figures occasionally met and then parted again. Each time they fought hand to hand, the flames around them seemed to grow higher and higher.Standing on the other side of the fire were many \u201cspectators,\u201d who were paying close attention to that side.The serpent was burning inside, as ferocious as the real fire before its eyes. It had only been a moment since it left here, why did this turn into a sea of flame? It was hard to find such a place to live!The serpent raised high its head and rushed toward the fire angrily.Its momentum was very fierce, such that the flames did not leave any mark on its moving gold-colored body. Meanwhile the two who were focused on their fight over there did not seem to notice. The serpent was filled with resentful hatred now. Deplorable human beings, who dared to trick it and even burn its nest. It was going to eat them.The serpent was getting nearer, about to open its big mouth to swallow Ming Shu. However, as it rushed at them, the two standing before its nose stepped aside at the same time. The serpent didn\u2019t hit anybody, only passing by them.Ming Shu turned over in the air and landed on the back of the serpent on her toes, then easily jumped opposite. She lifted the branch, which was like a sharp-edged sword in her hand, to rush to the man again.The man had wanted to avoid her, but that stupid serpent slipped behind his back and blocked the path, so he was hit in the shoulder.Although the sharp stick looked scary, it only caused him some pain, and no other \u201cside effect\u201d was showing.Just a bluff\u2026And he had been afraid of getting hit.The girl seemed a little vexed, her smile almost gone. But in the next moment the corners of her mouth rose, and some weird ripples appeared in her eyes.Somehow, the man\u2019s body shivered. He dodged again to avoid the serpent\u2019s sneak attack. The serpent was totally irritated now. It pressed on the flames with an angry roar and surrounded Ming Shu and the man with the coils of its body.But the two didn\u2019t seem to care about the serpent. They didn\u2019t stop fighting and changed positions constantly by stepping on the serpent. The serpent chased after them, looping around itself, and finally twisted itself into a knot, unable to move. It dropped down to the ground with a hiss, struggling.The man was about to step on the serpent\u2019s head to pose handsomely, but before he could, he received a fierce punch to the waist. His whole body was knocked down, falling on the serpent.Then a branch touched his forehead.Even if he knew it was a bluff of a weapon, at this moment he still felt it could easily pierce through his forehead.\u201cMaster of the Valley, what do you want?\u201d The man gave up resisting and lay down to look at Ming Shu.Ming Shu poked his forehead with the stick, saying clearly, \u201cPay me back with the same egg.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The man\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cMaster, what do you think that egg is?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t be able to find another egg like that for her even he searched the whole Windy Mountain Range of Demons.Ming Shu squatted down to grab his clothes, pulling him closer. \u201cOr I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dThe man reached out to take Ming Shu\u2019s hand, leaning even closer to her. That strange scent floated over. \u201cI certainly cannot repay you with that egg. What say you if I offer myself, paying you with two better ones?\u201dMing Shu couldn\u2019t tell what the scent was. It was very light and comfortable, not pungent, and made one eager to meet any of his requirements.Ming Shu frowned, her gaze sweeping over the man who was almost reclining on her. She could even feel the man\u2019s long eyelashes brushing against her chin, the sensation itchy.The man\u2019s dark and sparkling eyes were of some intoxicating magic, luring those he gazed at.\u201cIndecent!\u201d Ming Shu suddenly slapped the man\u2019s head.When I was acting indecently toward women, you were perhaps not yet born!The man was stunned. She actually beat him over the head!But soon Ming Shu taught him a truth, that she not only beat him over the head, but also beat him everywhere. Countless punches fell onto his body, which were far more painful than the stick.The man hurriedly transformed into smoke and ran away.When he reappeared, however, he seemed everything but embarrassed, as if the person who was beat just now wasn\u2019t him. His pale face revealed a bit of horrible bloodthirstiness. \u201cI underestimated Death Valley\u2019s Master.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t affected by his sorcery at all. Her smiling eyes never showed any captivation throughout the process. He had met such a kind of person before, but he had not met anyone who had such a strong resistance to him.Ming Shu threw away the branch, got up, and squinted at the man in the distance. \u201cTo run away when you\u2019re losing, are you human?\u201d Damn, this idiot has a certain skill, I can\u2019t pin him down. What should I do? Emergency, waiting online.\u201c\u2026\u201d Seems there\u2019s something not right with that sentence?Shouldn\u2019t she have said \u201cAre you a man\u201d instead of \u201chuman\u201d? How did she add more to it? She just upgraded the issue from a man\u2019s ability to a racial problem!The man retained the same look, and the tip of his pink tongue licked his pale lips. \u201cThe egg has died, but if you want, I can make it up to you with other objects. Of course, if you want, I\u2019m also willing to offer you myself.\u201d\u201cWho cares, I just want my egg.\u201d This sentence seems a little strange somehow, was this her illusion?\u201d Hiss! \u201d You two evil people standing on my body, have you thought about my feelings?The man still wanted to say something, but turning his eyes from her, he saw some people approaching from afar. His body slowly turned into smoke again. As a faint breeze blew, he disappeared before Ming Shu\u2019s eyes.Only his clear voice reached Ming Shu\u2019s ears, floating upon the wind, alluring. \u201cIf you want, come to me at the Drunken Flower Pavilion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d I don\u2019t go whoring.Wait, don\u2019t run, aren\u2019t you powerful?Ugh! I\u2019m angry! Where\u2019s my snacks? I need to calm down.\u201d Hiss! \u201d Stupid mortal, get off of me!Taking a look at the stupid serpent twisted into a donut, Ming Shu touched the snake\u2019s body and whispered, \u201cThis should be edible, but\u2026 would it affect my IQ if I eat such a stupid thing?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d I am a dignified saint beast. This human, you dare think to eat me!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Rufeng and Feng Cheng both disappeared in a strange place; they searched the whole place several times yet found no one. So they came back to get more helpers.Obviously, Feng Cheng was more important than the stupid serpent. The returned escorts took the remaining ones with them and went to find their Lord again. Though Bai Yanran and the others didn\u2019t go, they kept a distance from that serpent.The fire was getting stronger and stronger, spreading to the edges of their location. They had to leave this place and march forward again.Someone intended to catch the stupid serpent, but he was scared back before getting any closer to it.It was really a bit stupid, but its strength didn\u2019t lose out. If a common person tried to take it down, they\u2019d only be killing themselves.\u201cHiss!\u201d You foolish mortal, come back! Don\u2019t run!After those people left, Ming Shu took the lifeless egg, approaching the serpent. \u201cWell, let me ask you a question. If you give me a satisfying answer, I will help you untie yourself.\u201d\u201cHumph, no human is kindhearted. Do you think I will believe you?\u201d The serpent\u2019s voice was full of distrust.Ming Shu smiled carelessly. \u201cOkay, then, sorry to interrupt.\u201dThe serpent was a little doubtful as it saw Ming Shu turn around to leave, but soon it grew anxious. \u201cYou, wait, stop.\u201dMing Shu turned to look at it.The golden pupils of the serpent narrowed into slits. It spit out its scarlet tongue. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201dAlthough it did not want to help this human at all, it really wanted the egg.The human was cunning, and the serpent was just the same.Ming Shu raised the colorful egg. \u201cWhat is this egg?\u201d\u201cGive it to me and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201dMing Shu thought for a moment, then threw the egg at it. The serpent grabbed the egg with its free tail. But before it could become ecstatic, its glee was put out just like a pot of cold water poured onto a fire. \u201cIt\u2019s dead, how did it die? What did you do?\u201dWas this creature a fool? Didn\u2019t it hear the conversation before between her and that Master of the Drunken Grass Pavilion?\u201cYou didn\u2019t say whether you wanted it dead or alive.\u201d Ming Shu spread her hands helplessly, her smile sweet.\u201cAhh!\u201d The serpent roared, its twisted body rolling on the ground like a hill. The ground trembled under its movement as well.\u201cWow, wow, calm down, okay? I didn\u2019t kill this egg. It was the goblin from earlier, he did it, you should blame him.\u201d Ming Shu immediately dumped the responsibility onto the man as she saw the serpent was going mad.The serpent truly had a worrying IQ; it really stopped going mad after hearing Ming Shu\u2019s words. With its long tail, it tossed the egg back to Ming Shu and said angrily, \u201cThis is a divine beast\u2019s egg. I\u2019ll be able to upgrade if I eat it. Damn, where does that human live? I\u2019m going to find and punish him.\u201dDivine beast?Is this something prepared for the female protagonist?Ming Shu began to recall the story. It seemed the fake female protagonist indeed got a divine beast at the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. Originally, without her stirring everything, the story\u2019s plot developed very smoothly and seriously. Xiao Rufeng counterattacked all the way, acquiring rare and valuable treasures, and walking a very smooth uphill road.Wow, how am I so amazing?[\u2026] What? Weren\u2019t you recalling the plot? How\u2019s it suddenly turned into boasting about yourself?Ming Shu took the dead egg and prepared to leave.The serpent became anxious at once. \u201cHey, human, you said you\u2019d help me out.\u201d\u201cDid I say that?\u201d Ming Shu turned around with a light smile, and recalled for a moment before she suddenly realized something. \u201cAh, yes, I said that. But that was a give-and-take condition of mine, and you altered it, so\u2026 I can\u2019t help you.\u201dWhat if it attacked her when she set it free? She wasn\u2019t that stupid.Ming Shu looked at the serpent with regretful eyes, then she jumped out of the fire while shaking her head.\u201c\u2026\u201d What did she mean by that last look?Regret for what?Not eating it?Why did it come up with this terrible idea.Ah! So angry!The serpent was angered into a ball. Abominable human, really cunning.\u2026The ground of the Mountain of Dragon Bones was like a furnace. The air was little more than billowing heat waves, with the clear sound of explosions ringing out occasionally.\u201cWhat the hell is this place?\u201d Bai Yanran fanned herself with her hands, but everywhere was full of heat waves. She coughed and had to put down her hands.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we wait for Lord Seven and his people? Are we going to get out like this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not safe for us to stay here, either.\u201d The fire was big enough to burn them at any time, not to mention that dangerous serpent.\u201cWhere\u2019s Zhi Po?\u201dEveryone looked back but found no one behind them. The one who was following after them now was gone. They had marched so far just because Zhi Po was at their backs. But where was she?Someone walked back a distance; after a moment, he returned with a weird look. \u201cShe\u2019s over there\u2026 eating.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAt this time, she was in the mood to eat.Why hadn\u2019t she been stuffed to death?\u201cYanran, why don\u2019t you go ask her how we can get out of here. Doesn\u2019t she have the map?\u201dA girl rested her eyes on Bai Yanran.But Bai Yanran had been rejected by Ming Shu a few times. Even if she were an idiot, she would have known she\u2019d better not ask for more humiliation. She merely grunted at the girl\u2019s proposal. \u201cGo yourself.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you close to each other? Yanran, we really want to get out. If we continue walking blindly, we might die here sooner or later.\u201dBai Yanran still sat by. She was not going to beg that bewitched bitch.Everyone looked at each other for a while. \u201cLet\u2019s take a rest here.\u201dThe temperature was too high, they could only stand where they were. With such a high temperature, the place was still surrounded by wild vegetation. No withered plants were within sight, which made everyone feel creeped out deep inside.Where on earth were they right now?\u201cBai Yanran, what are you doing, give it back!\u201d\u201cI should drink first.\u201d Bai Yanran caught the kettle, still possessing the arrogant attitude of a \u201cMiss.\u201d She ordered, \u201cRelease your hand.\u201d\u201cBai Yanran, you are going too far! This is my water.\u201d Right then, in this blistering environment, water was of great importance. Naturally, she wasn\u2019t willing to share it with Bai Yanran, a petty and overbearing young lady.\u201cYours? You are nothing but a petty dog of mine!\u201d Bai Yanran shouted as she fiercely made to beat the other. In her eyes was a mixture of hatred and anger. Before, when she was held hostage by the serpent, she asked for help, but none of these people cared.\u201cBai Yanran, that\u2019s enough!\u201d Some could not stand the scene and stepped forward to pull Bai Yanran away.\u201cDon\u2019t overdo it, do you think this is your Bai family?\u201dBefore, they stomached her misbehavior all because of the Bai family behind her. But now, in a situation of life and death, it was hard to say whether they could escape safe and sound. They were already submerged in resentment and anger in the bottom of their hearts, and now Bai Yan was drawing their ire to herself. They started to blame and scold her one after another.Faced with a united opposition, Bai Yanran was angered until she burst into laughter. She pointed at them with her index finger. \u201cGreat, great, are you rebelling against me? Have you forgotten your flattering looks when you followed me?\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions were becoming uglier and uglier.\u201cIf you were not the Miss of the Bai family, who would have treated you well? No one could bear your bad temper!\u201d the one who was robbed of her water shouted back at Bai Yanran.Bai Yanran formed a fist fiercely with her dangling hand, her visage vicious. \u201cYou just wait\u2026 I\u2019ll make you regret when I get out.\u201dLiked it?

Is it proper to roast it?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s not proper, it\u2019s dead anyway. We are doing good to give it a worthy death.\u201d Ming Shu began to talk nonsense seriously.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a divine beast egg! Miss!Neither a chicken nor duck egg!After being roasted in the fire for a long time, the \u201cdivine egg\u201d didn\u2019t even change color. It wasn\u2019t stained with any dust.Ming Shu removed the egg and tapped on it. Cold. In other words, it had been roasted for a long time but did not even grow warm.\u201cMiss, the fire is coming this way. We\u2019d better leave.\u201d Hui Xue peered in the distance; the fire was approaching in a line. It was really urgent they go now.Ming Shu threw the egg back into the fire and stared at it intently.\u201c\u2026\u201d Again?The fire was getting closer and closer, and Hui Xue was getting more and more anxious. She waved Liu Feng to her side to get ready to take Ming Shu forcibly away. But just at this time, the flames three meters away from them seemed to be restrained by something, curling toward the ground.Ming Shu took a glance at it. Then she removed the egg from the fire again and stood up, patting her clothes. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What?Now you want to leave?Didn\u2019t you just insist on staying?\u201cMiss, how\u2019s the fire\u2026\u201d\u201cThe big guy is going to show up.\u201d Ming Shu slightly curled her lips. \u201cWe\u2019d better run quickly, or there won\u2019t be any chance later.\u201dThe corners of Hui Xue\u2019s mouth twitched. Seeing as the Miss was smiling so confidently, Hui Xue thought she would be able to easily defeat anything. But it turned out she was just thinking about running away.\u2026Actually, when Ming Shu said they\u2019d better run, she meant they\u2019d better find a proper place to watch the \u201cfun.\u201dHui Xue was totally speechless. The Miss was now able to tell lies without blushing.\u201cAre there really dragons here\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Hui Xue widened her eyes, greatly shocked and surprised.Ming Shu muttered as she chewed on an unknown fruit: \u201cWhat\u2019s so surprising about a dragon skeleton?\u201d Without any meat, what was the point of that? Dislike.At this time, they were at a higher vantage point. The skeleton of a dragon was slowly breaking out from underneath the ground. The sound of a dragon roaring swept across the forest, and the strong presence of the divine beast seemed to force all on the continent to bend their knees.\u201cThe dragon skeleton is still the dragon!\u201d Hui Xue was excited. \u201cThe dragon has already disappeared from the Xuanyuan continent. We should be seeing a dragon skeleton!\u201dSeeing Hui Xue so excited, Ming Shu focused her attention on the milky-white skeleton and asked, \u201cCould it be eaten?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The divine beast egg is still in your hand. Are you going to make some soup with dragon bones?Ugh, the dragon is the head of the divine beasts. It can\u2019t be eaten! Cannot!Is the Miss going mad?Honglonglong\u2014The skeleton of the dragon was very large. The moment it broke out, the surrounding mountains began to fall apart. On Ming Shu\u2019s side, the earth also swayed, but it didn\u2019t go so far as to collapse.\u201cMiss, look, there\u2019s a human.\u201d Hui Xue pointed to the tail of the dragon skeleton. A human figure was running up along the spine.It was precisely Xiao Rufeng.Xiao Rufeng was having a dogfight with the dragon skeleton as mountains and rocks collapsed and trees and branches flew about, the dragon\u2019s roar filled with anger. Xiao Rufeng was knocked down to the ground several times by the skeleton, but she would get up every time and continue to battle.\u201cYou stay here, and don\u2019t follow me.\u201d Ming Shu made to get down.Hui Xue widened her eyes again. \u201cWhat are you going to do, Miss?\u201d Are you really planning to retrieve the dragon skeleton for soup?Min Shu smiled as she put her finger to her lips. \u201cShh.\u201d\u201cMiss\u2026\u201dMing Shu flashed aside and disappeared into the jungle. Avoiding the main battlefield, Ming Shu sneaked to the edge and found a hidden place to sit down.After a long time, Xiao Rufeng and the dragon skeleton were still fighting each other. Ming Shu became a bit sleepy and yawned. \u201cHas she finished? Why does it take her so long?\u201d[\u2026 The process of getting a gold finger is usually hard.] It\u2019s not that easy to acquire a powerful \u201cweapon,\u201d sometimes it may cost you days of battle.But\u2026 Guest, what do you plan to do hiding here?Why do I always have a feeling that the Guest is planning some evil things\u2026Amazingly, each time the Guest would find new ways to gain Hatred Points\u2026 What was this inexplicable expectation all about?Ming Shu took out the egg and played around with it since she had nothing better to do now. The thunder cat didn\u2019t return after leading the serpent away. She wondered if it had died.\u201cWhat?\u201dSuddenly Ming Shu uttered a surprised sound and loosened her hand. The colorful egg began to rise up slowly, and swirling Qi was gathering around it.Ming Shu snatched it back again. Then all of a sudden, the accumulated Qi around the egg vanished. Touching the egg, Ming Shu\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cStill alive?\u201dThe colorful egg struggled, trying to break away from Ming Shu.\u201cLet go of me!\u201d The voice of a young child rang out.\u201cAh, it can speak.\u201d Ming Shu was startled into loosening her grip again. The colorful egg dropped down to the ground with a crisp sound.\u201cAhhhh, terrible human.\u201d The childish voice sounded a little crazy.Ming Shu poked at it with a finger. \u201cYou asked me to let you go. Why are you angry now? Are you a girl? With such a changeable temper\u2026 Uh, were you pretending to be dead?\u201dThe colorful egg rolled opposite her resentfully and answered, \u201cYou humans are all bad! You want to absorb my force. If I didn\u2019t pretend, I would have been killed!\u201dMing Shu held the egg still and talked to it as if talking to a naughty kid. \u201cWell, be reasonable! I only wanted to eat you instead of absorbing your force or whatever\u2026\u201d So earlier, the fool from Grass Pavilion absorbed its force?He could even absorb the force of a divine beast\u2026 Cool!\u201cIs there any difference between eating me and absorbing my force?\u201d The egg turned angry.\u201cThere is a difference in nature,\u201d Ming Shu said with a smile. \u201cRegardless, the snake also tried to eat you, why do you only blame humans? Racial discrimination?\u201dThe egg became even angrier. \u201cAll of you are terrible creatures, you\u2019re birds of a feather.\u201d\u201cWow, a newly born little baby, how could you know that saying?\u201d Ming Shu slightly raised her eyebrows.\u201cHumph, I inherited it.\u201d The egg was both angry and proud. The former was because it had been pressed by Ming Shu again, and the latter was because of its \u201cliteracy.\u201d\u201cInherit? Do you have a family, brothers or sisters? Where are they?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Why is she paying attention to such a bizarre point? If I tell her, is she going to find them to eat?Humans are really terrible.The egg kept silent for a moment. Then suddenly it burst into loud cries, and the tone of the whole scene changed rapidly. \u201cWuwuwu\u2026 Please don\u2019t eat me, I taste terrible! Wuwu\u2026 it\u2019s so difficult for me to grow up\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMing Shu loosened her hand unhappily and said, \u201cStop crying, ugh, it annoys me. Relax, I won\u2019t eat something that can speak.\u201dA creature that could speak usually possessed intelligence. She would always try to avoid these things.Liked it?

It carefully began to absorb the Qi around it, replacing the force absorbed by that odious human being.If it hadn\u2019t played dead so timely, it may have truly died.Humans are so terrible.Or rather\u2026 this world is terrible. I want to go home, wuwuwu!Absorb Qi and then go home.Absorb Qi and then go home.Ming Shu held her chin and looked at the increasing Qi around the egg. With so much Qi being absorbed, wouldn\u2019t it be stuffed to death? Ming Shu couldn\u2019t help reaching out to poke it, but the egg seemed to predict her intention and swiftly rolled out of reach. Following after it were multiple streams of floating Qi, constantly entering through the eggshell.As the egg was absorbing Qi happily, the ongoing battle between Xiao Rufeng and the dragon was finally coming to an end. Undoubtedly, the winner must be Xiao Rufeng.The huge skeleton disappeared all of a sudden, and Xiao Rufeng also fell down upon the ground due to loss of strength. The whole mountain range was now covered in vast silence.Ming Shu stood up in a rush.The colorful egg was startled by Ming Shu, forgetting to absorb the Qi. Carrying some fearful worries, it looked up to Ming Shu at a 45-degree angle.What are you doing!You scared me.Ming Shu rolled her sleeves up as she walked toward the battlefield, breathing into her belly\u2014it was time to work.The egg paused, then it absorbed Qi as it rolled after Ming Shu.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Seeing Ming Shu dragging away the woman on the ground, the egg became more confused.\u201cPicking up the corpse,\u201d Ming Shu answered. Waiting for such a long time, just for this moment, ha, effortless. Ming Shu kicked it and continued, \u201cStay out of my way, you\u2019re going to make me sprain my ankle, do you know the consequences?\u201dThe egg rolled aside worriedly. But after hesitating for a while, it rolled back to Ming Shu\u2019s side again. \u201cThis woman is surrounded by plenty of Qi, so comfortable.\u201dMing Shu took a look at it. The egg was scared into rolling away again. \u201cOkay, okay, I won\u2019t absorb her Qi, it\u2019s all yours.\u201d\u201cZhi Po\u2026\u201d Xiao Rufeng still had some consciousness. She was being dragged by the legs along the ground, trying to lift her head to look at the person ahead. \u201cWhat\u2026 What do you intend to do?\u201dMing Shu turned to her and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll take you home. Uh, don\u2019t thank me. I\u2019ll be proud of myself.\u201dThat smile was very weird and Xiao Rufeng had a bit of a bad feeling. \u201cStop, put me down.\u201d\u201cSorry, Miss, but I have a task to finish.\u201d\u201cTask? What task?\u201d What is this woman talking about?The task\u2014of gaining Hatred Points!Ming Shu released Xiao Rufeng\u2019s legs and turned around. She raised a hand, then slammed it down. Xiao Rufeng was smacked into a coma.The egg rolled a few meters away fast. This woman was so cruel!Ming Shu continued her work. After a while, the egg slowly rolled to her feet again. \u201cWell, could I just absorb a little of her Qi? I really want it\u2026\u201dThe Qi of this woman was so comfortable, bathing in it was like being in a mother\u2019s embrace.So eager to have that, I want that.\u201cJust a little.\u201d The egg rolled around Ming Shu. \u201cJust give me one breath, please, the rest is all for you.\u201dMing Shu lifted her foot and kicked the egg unhesitatingly. The egg was launched out all the way to the distant jungle.\u2026Recently, the most widely spread news on the continent was the birth of a divine beast egg. It was unknown where the news originated from. Besides this, the continent was always flooded with many different rumors. No one ever knew whether they were true or not, but it didn\u2019t prevent some people from believing them.Before long, someone was said to have heard the dragon howling in the forest of the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. Then it was rumored that a divine dragon was born.\u201cA divine dragon! If I can have a divine dragon, it won\u2019t be a dream to dominate the continent.\u201d\u201cYou really are dreaming. You don\u2019t even know if the news is true or false. Dragons have long disappeared from the Xuanyuan continent. How is it possible there is a dragon now?\u201d His companion poured cold water on him.\u201cWell, what if it is true?\u201d\u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t be yours.\u201d\u201cHey, why do you have to be against me, em?\u201d\u201cStop arguing. Do you know the latest news?\u201d Seeing the two were about to quarrel, the rest of the people quickly stopped them.\u201cWhat news? Is it more exciting than the birth of a divine dragon?\u201dThe man smiled confidently. \u201cHehe, do you know the Drunken Flower Pavilion?\u201d\u201cThe biggest brothel on the continent, who does not know? What, is there some new beauty?\u201d Women of the Drunken Flower Pavilion were all beauties, but the most amazing was that they could not only enhance your force but also let you experience\u2026 Well, you would never forget that special experience. But usually, most people went there just once, or else they may lose all their fortune.\u201cJust two days before\u2026\u201d The man deliberately paused. \u201cThe Drunken Flower Pavilion was made into a mess by someone.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cReally? Who is so bold to cause trouble for the Drunken Flower Pavilion?\u201dActually, right now, the one they were discussing was sitting opposite them, a baozi in her mouth as she gazed at the egg rolling on the table.After finishing the baozi, she reached for the egg and threw it out the window.\u201cAh!\u201d An exclamation came from outside. \u201cWho is so unscrupulous, throwing stones!\u201dThe person who was hit looked around angrily. He did not find the murderer, so he kicked the egg fiercely against the wall. The poor egg rolled to one side, but then a pair of dark-embroidered boots blocked its way.This aura\u2026The egg suddenly froze and instantly changed into a deathlike state.A slender hand picked it up. White clothes floating, the man curled his lips up lightly. His smile was like a spring blossom, draining the surrounding scenery of color immediately.\u201cMaster, how is this egg still alive?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also curious.\u201d The man tightened his grip and tried to absorb its force again. However, just like last time, no force could be felt. It was a dead egg.But just now, it was obviously alive.\u201cMaster.\u201d A man came over in a hurry and bowed. \u201cWe\u2019ve found her. She\u2019s right in this restaurant.\u201cShe is the new master of Death Valley. A few days ago, after getting out of the Windy Mountain Range of Demons, she went to the Xiao family to send Xiao Rufeng home, then she went straight to the Drunken Flower Pavilion.\u201dThe man looked up slightly to the restaurant. He just went out for a trip, but when he returned, his Drunken Flower Pavilion was totally destroyed. Although the Pavilion was only an empty shell, as the master of it, he should be angry about it being destroyed.\u201cMaster, we have to seek help from Death Valley, but the Valley\u2019s master seems to have taken us as enemies. Is there any misunderstanding?\u201dThe man stood with his hands behind him, pondering. He would never reveal that he had robbed her of the divine beast egg earlier at the Mountain of Dragon Bones, which directly earned her vengeance.She\u2019s so narrow-minded!But he ordered calmly, \u201cFollow her first, report to me when you find something abnormal.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d\u2026Xiao Rufeng was returned to the Xiao family by Ming Shu in perfect condition.She really was merely sent to her home.And on the way home, Ming Shu beat her.But it was tough for Xiao Rufeng to stay with the Xiao family.Xiao Rufei, the favored real protagonist, and others from the school hadn\u2019t returned; even Lord Seven hadn\u2019t come back. She actually returned first, all by herself. For one thing, the Xiao family wouldn\u2019t leave her alone, and for another, other families also came to question her.\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t know! I don\u2019t know!\u201d Xiao Rufeng shouted to these people irritatedly.This was why that woman sent her back?To make her the target of criticism?Xiao Rufeng quickly calmed down. She couldn\u2019t jump into the trap that woman set for her.\u201cHow could you not know. You went in there together, so why did you come back alone, safe and sound? You piece of trash!\u201d The person speaking was Bai Yanran\u2019s father.\u201cWell, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m trash, so what could I do to your little daughter?\u201d Xiao Rufeng agreed and askedLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No one in the Xiao family was willing to stick up for her; instead, they joined many outsiders in questioning her where Xiao Rufei was.She was sent back by the woman named Zhi Po, so she had no idea where Xiao Rufei and those people were, either.Finally Xiao Rufeng was detained in the dungeon of the Xiao family. Her relatives threatened that if she didn\u2019t tell them the whereabouts of Xiao Rufei, she would not be let out.The dungeon had been set up to be difficult to escape.Before Xiao Rufeng could think of a way to escape, she heard Xiao Rufei and Lord Seven had returned already. But Xiao Rufei was seriously injured and her life was in danger.With a joint search and rescue by the Royal School and various major families, the rest of the students also came back one after another.Xiao Rufei was trapped in a coma all the while. The Xiao family invited plenty of famous healers from all over the continent to treat her, but none of them could cure Xiao Rufei.Xiao Rufei\u2019s mother, driven by great resentment and anger, relieved all her wrath upon Xiao Rufeng. Xiao Rufeng was fed medication to suppress her spirit force, thus she didn\u2019t have any strength to resist. Each time she would be tortured almost to death.But deep in Xiao Rufeng\u2019s heart, she held an unyielding belief. As a former dignified killer, she crossed over here with much more advanced ideas in mind. Now at the mercy of these people, she felt angry and humiliated. She kept thinking of an opportunity to get herself out.Unfortunately, before she could escape the Xiao family, she would be discovered and taken back every time.\u201cXiao Rufeng, if you dare to run again, I will break your legs.\u201d Xiao Rufei\u2019s mother stood opposite the iron bars of the cell and condescended to Xiao Rufeng, accompanied by girl servants. \u201cRufei is home now, but if anything bad happens to her, I\u2019ll let you offer your life.\u201dThinking of how weak Xiao Rufei was now, Mother Xiao couldn\u2019t help hating the person in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, loser! It\u2019s not enough for you to bring death to your parents, so now you want to murder my Rufei!\u201dXiao Rufeng\u2019s body was fully covered in injuries. She looked up slowly to the woman outside, curling up the corners of her mouth, and coldness gathered in her deep eyes.For this moment, I will let you know the consequences, I promise.Mother Xiao met with Xiao Rufeng\u2019s eyes unintentionally, and she was suddenly startled a bit to take a step back. But she calmed herself immediately. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your identity, loser! You go in there and beat her as violently as possible. Let her know who she is. What do you think the Xiao family is? Your home? Next time, if she escapes again, you will all be punished!\u201dThe last sentence was spoken to the guards.Seeing Xiao Rufeng being punched and kicked, Mother Xiao could finally vent half of her anger. She sneered again and then left the dirty dungeon with the servant girls in tow.Xiao Rufeng was even more covered in injuries now and lay there weakly. She clutched the straw strewn on the ground, eyes filled with unprecedented hatred.The Xiao family\u2026 and that Zhi Po\u2026Just wait. I will have my revenge.\u2026Ming Shu had stayed in the city for a few days. She didn\u2019t hide her identity, though. Since she certainly would be recognized, at least it would be known she was from Death Valley.Not surprisingly, the Xiao family visited her for Xiao Rufei\u2019s sickness. But Ming Shu didn\u2019t expect the Bai family would also come to her.\u201cMiss, the Lord of the Bai family came in person, will you meet him?\u201d Hui Xue stood beside Ming Shu. Although she didn\u2019t want to see anyone from the Bai family herself, she had to listen to what the Miss wanted.\u201cHave the people from the Xiao family gone?\u201d\u201cNot yet, they\u2019re all there.\u201d Hui Xue glanced outside. \u201cNow that the whole Xiling City knows you\u2019re here, I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t take a long time for those visitors to flock.\u201dThe reputation of Death Valley was definitely not for nothing, and the number of people who wanted to ask for treatment was just large enough to queue around Xiling City in many circles.\u201cWho does the Bai family want to treat?\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t say.\u201d Hui Xue shook her head, moving her eyes around, and guessed, \u201cIt\u2019s possibly\u2026 about what happened to Bai Yanran?\u201dBai Yanran was the most favored and valued in the Bai family. Now the Lord of the Bai family came to the door personally. Except for Bai Yanran, who else it could be about?Ming Shu rubbed her chin lightly. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.\u201dSo does the Miss want to meet him or not? Hui Xue wondered.These people all gathered outside the inn, blocking the way. She suspected that within a short time, the inn owner would come up to drive them away for making trouble.Ming Shu didn\u2019t give a certain answer, and Hui Xue didn\u2019t dare to ask again. Normally, the Miss was a reasonable and insightful master, except before, when she was obeying Bai Yanran\u2019s orders weirdly.And recently, the Miss was still a bit weird, smiling more and eating more, but at least the former reasonable and insightful Miss had come back.The Miss would tell her when she had made a decision.Hui Xue was still a blind fan of her Miss. Poor innocent girl, she would never have thought her Miss had long been replaced by another person.\u201cOh, right, Miss, here\u2019s the invitation sent by Drunken Flower Pavilion.\u201d Hui Xue remembered and took out a gilded invitation card covered in carved flower patterns from her sleeve to hand to Ming Shu.Three enlarged words, Drunken Flower Pavilion , were particularly prominent on the invitation.Drunken Flower Pavilion?Inviting her?What, does he want to grab my snack again?Ming Shu opened the invitation with her index finger; nothing strange was written on it. It was only inviting Ming Shu to attend the opening ceremony of Drunken Flower Pavilion ten days from now.Well, Ming Shu just destroyed his place, and now he was going to open another already?Are the rich people now all willful like this?Impressive.Ming Shu turned over the invitation again and again, suspecting it may hide some unknown message. But it truly was just an invitation. She turned back to Hui Xue and asked uncertainly, \u201cHe\u2019s inviting me to destroy his new place?\u201dHui Xue was a little shocked and carefully said, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s more like he\u2019s showing off.\u201dWasn\u2019t he saying, You worked hard to destroy my place, but I could just open another one in an instant . And he should be so generous to send an invitation to the Miss. If this was not showing off, what else could it be?Ming Shu fell into silence for a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s the grudge between Death Valley and Drunken Flower Pavilion?\u201dIt might be a coincidence that the man had taken the egg; perhaps he needed its force. But after that, his disdainful tone and provocations both seemed to hint at something. If the two groups were not enemies to each other, then that man was definitely playing stupid.Hui Xue frowned as she searched her memories. \u201cAs far as I know, there shouldn\u2019t be such a thing. But I don\u2019t know too much about some stuff in the Valley. Everyone knows the Drunken Flower Pavilion is a brothel, but it also dabbles in many other industries. It\u2019s an extremely large force. No one dares to disrespect it willfully.\u201d\u201cIs he very powerful?\u201d Before, Ming Shu had fought with that man, and he indeed was disadvantaged. He didn\u2019t seem to have hidden his real strength.\u201cNot exactly, I heard his force is not strong. But he practices an odd technique which can control people\u2019s hearts and minds. The controlled person will do whatever they are told and has no means to rebel, it\u2019s frightening.\u201dMing Shu thought of the man\u2019s appearance before, and she was suddenly covered in goosebumps all over.Drunken Flower Pavilion, this force was mentioned in the story several times, but it wasn\u2019t the main point. Later in the plot, it didn\u2019t appear at all. Apparently the Pavilion and its master were not important.\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cQing Chen, everyone called him Lord Qing Chen or Master Qing Chen.\u201d\u201cHis image doesn\u2019t exactly match his name.\u201d How could that man use the nameQing Chen , his appearance had nothing to do with \u201cunworldly,\u201d it was a total waste. Ming Shu pushed the invitation to the edge of the table using her index finger, and as she lifted her finger the invitation dropped to the ground. Ming Shu then smiled slightly. \u201cIt must be a final dinner, too dangerous, I\u2019m not going.\u201dShe was a party person.However, the man had a criminal record of grabbing her snacks, she\u2019d better not go there.I have to resist the temptation.Everything can be sacrificed except my snacks.Liked it?

But the inn was guarded both before and after, and none of them saw Ming Shu.Father Bai was so anxious that he paced back and forth in front of the inn while people from the Xiao family stood on the sidelines. They just minded their own business and didn\u2019t violate the boundary between them.When the two sides unintentionally had some eye contact with each other, they would move away quickly as if seeing something they disliked.The two families had been rivals for many years. Now that they gathered here together, it was really a bit awkward.\u201cLord, Lord, the Miss is showing crazy symptoms again!\u201dThe servant of the Bai family arrived in a rush. He couldn\u2019t even breathe and his face was still a little restless. It seemed the Miss he was talking about was really making a huge mess.Father Bai\u2019s face turned black. He looked at the inn and waved as he gritted his teeth. \u201cGo, let\u2019s go upstairs to invite her.\u201dHe didn\u2019t believe he would ever be able to meet that person from Death Valley. The Bai family was not a small force or school, either, but now he was left outside and didn\u2019t even see anyone from the Valley. It was beginning to annoy him.\u201cLord\u2026\u201d Others of the Bai family stopped him. \u201cIf we offend the people from Death Valley, the Miss might not have the chance to be treated by them.\u201dAt this time, Father Bai felt a mixture of anger and anxiety within. He went straight upstairs despite the persuasion.Seeing this, the Xiao family\u2019s people also followed him up. The inn was originally a spacious place, but with these people standing inside, it suddenly became crowded.\u2026Liu Feng was guarding the door. Seeing so many people coming forward aggressively, he immediately revealed a weapon. There was no expression on his cold face, but his meaning was obvious. If they dared to step closer, he would not be polite to them.Father Bai endured his anger and shouted with his fist slamming into his other hand, \u201cThe lord of the Bai family is here to pay a visit.\u201dThe Xiao family was standing behind him and they didn\u2019t take further action. With Father Bai as the provoker, they couldn\u2019t be more willing to watch.Liu Feng didn\u2019t move. He peered at the people before him like a statue.Father Bai was just feigning politeness and didn\u2019t even bend his body, his eyes fixed on the tightly closed door.Time seemed to have a voice, ticking and walking.Every sound pierced his heart.Squeak\u2014They didn\u2019t know how long it was before the door was slowly pushed open. The servant girl they had met several times before came out from inside, her hands folded in front of her body. She walked to Liu Feng with small and unhurried steps. Liu Feng then put away his weapon and stepped back slightly.Hui Xue slightly bowed. \u201cLord Bai, I\u2019m sorry but the Miss is not here, you won\u2019t see her today.\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s that possible! My people didn\u2019t see her come out,\u201d Lord Bai blurted out in a loud voice. \u201cIs it that the Miss inside is unwilling to meet me? What requirements does she have? She need only open her mouth, as long as she can cure my little daughter, I won\u2019t let her down.\u201dAs long as a person could be bribed, they would not be difficult to deal with.But, obviously, this time Father Bai hit a nail house.\u201cLord Bai, you might know the rules of Death Valley.\u201d Hui Xue smiled slightly and answered in a warm and polite tone, \u201cWe only choose our patients following our heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Screw that following your heart nonsense.The rules of Death Valley had always been the strangest ones among the various major forces on the continent.Following their heart basically meant it was up to their mood. It meant that a disciple of Death Valley could see a patient if they liked, and they could also refuse to treat a patient if they wanted.Commonly known as\u2014It depends on the mood.Weren\u2019t they just too willful?Yes, they were!\u201cLet me see your Miss.\u201d My people have waited here all this time. How could she leave without anyone the wiser? She must be looking for an excuse to avoid us,Father Bai thought.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lord Bai, the Miss really is not inside.\u201d Hui Xue really wasn\u2019t telling a lie. Who the hell knew where the Miss was? She just went out to tell something to Liu Feng, and when she returned, in the blink of an eye, the Miss had disappeared.What could she do? She could do nothing but keep calm. She couldn\u2019t let these people know she didn\u2019t know where her Miss was, that was too unprofessional.\u201cToday I must see her. She is a healer, wouldn\u2019t she be merciful?\u201d Father Bai was thrilled and he got ready to break through the door.The weapon put away by Liu Feng was pulled out again.\u201cHey, move, move, excuse me, please let me through.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s temporarily blocked here. Change direction.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cNo reason.\u201d\u201cHey, did you buy the inn? Why are you blocking my way? And, more importantly, why are you piled at my door? Are you robbing me?\u201d With so many people, too.Insidious.Fortunately, there was no food in the room.\u201cMiss!\u201d Hui Xue screamed with excitement but immediately calmed down a little. \u201cYou are back.\u201dThe surrounding people subconsciously turned their heads and looked to where the noises came from. The people at the back moved aside to clear the way one after another. At the end of the passage, a woman in a red dress was standing there with a smile, looking at them.Behind her were rays of light that rested on her shoulders, forming a warm halo that enveloped her body, holy and comforting.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d Father Bai and the Host met once at the Bai family\u2019s place before, but they didn\u2019t talk. Right now, seeing Ming Shu appear here, he was surprised into widening his eyes. \u201cYou are the disciple of Death Valley?\u201dMing Shu lifted her foot to walk along the passage, and the fiery red robe floated with her voice. \u201cIf I\u2019m not, are you?\u201d\u201cYou know my daughter, right?\u201d Father Bai was suddenly excited. He indeed had seen this woman beside Bai Yanran, Yanran should know the person from Death Valley, great! Father Bai held back his eagerness and continued, \u201cSince you are Yanran\u2019s friend, I will just tell you straightly: My daughter has been out of sorts, perhaps you could go to see her and make a diagnosis?\u201dHearing this, the Xiao family all changed their faces a little and tried to speak up.But Ming Shu didn\u2019t give them any chance to speak. Wearing a gentle and harmless smile, she walked through the human passage and stood five meters away from Father Bai. \u201cI find something interesting.\u201dFather Bai was filled with question marks. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs there a specific function for your Bai family?\u201dFather Bai was more confused. What did she mean?Ming Shu continued to come forward and smiled back toward the crowd when she arrived at Hui Xue\u2019s side. \u201cYou are all so self-righteous.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I don\u2019t eat human\u2026\u201d Meat .Ming Shu coughed. Under the strange gaze of Father Bai, she retained the same smile. \u201cDo I know your little daughter? Are we close? Or does she look like a goddess that needs me to worship her and have a look at her?\u201d The greater Bai Yanran\u2019s hatred was for her, the better. She must be mad with hunger before she would go to see Bai Yanran.[Host, you can go to see Bai Yanran, and then do something to her\u2026 It might be easier for her to hate you. You\u2019re only one step away from completing the task. ] The Harmony System incited Ming Shu with bad ideas, blah blah blah\u2026Ming Shu thought to herself, What a suffocating operation, it\u2019s too much.Uncle Harmony, could you spend ten minutes facing the wall and think about your name\u2019s meaning before you try to stir things up?Am I the kind of person who will comply with others\u2019 casual suggestions?[Our mission is to collect Hatred Points, through what means is not important. Moreover, Bai Yanran is not a good person. Just think, if it wasn\u2019t for her, would the Host have come to such a miserable end? Of course, I\u2019m just offering you an easier way to get Hatred Points. What you decide is not my business and I have no right to interfere.] The Harmony System was only interested in Hatred Points. Other things were not within its scope of consideration.#I have a terrible system, how should I handle this? Waiting online. Emergency.#Liked it?

He sneered coldly and said, \u201cLittle girl, don\u2019t speak so madly. This world is bigger than you think. Your Death Valley is not invincible.\u201dMing Shu smiled indifferently and didn\u2019t get angry at all. \u201cThen you can go find the invincible to treat your daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d It felt like a fist punching cotton: useless.If you couldn\u2019t anger someone in any way, then this person was either a fool or an elite.Clearly the woman opposite was not a fool.The atmospheres of both sides were somewhat rigid.\u201cMiss.\u201d After appreciating such a good play, the Xiao family\u2019s people finally stood out and said with a much better attitude, \u201cWould you please go with us to take a look at our Miss Xiao? We promise you a large reward.\u201dMing Shu showed a big smile to the Xiao family. Just as those people thought they might have persuaded her, the girl with her pair of moon-like eyebrows spoke out her refusal firmly. \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhy? Miss, can you give us a reasonable explanation?\u201d The Xiao family was not angry, but they didn\u2019t give up. If they couldn\u2019t invite this woman from Death Valley, their Miss would suffer a lot and no one else seemed able to cure her.Before they came here to invite this doctor, the Lord told them to complete the task no matter what it cost.Thinking for a while, Ming Shu said innocently, \u201cI\u2019m not in the right mood.\u201dThe Xiao family continued to propose various conditions, trying to impress Ming Shu. However, Ming Shu had no interest at all. Then, suddenly, silence befell them.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here?\u201d A clear voice rang from the other side, breaking the strange atmosphere.It was a man dressed in gorgeous clothes. With his handsome appearance, it seemed anyone who took a glance at him would be obsessed. He was leaning against the door frame with crossed arms. He gazed sideways at them, but in fact, all that was reflected in his eyes was Ming Shu\u2019s figure in bright red.It was like a burning fire, radiating dazzling light and forming a deep and vast universe in his dark pupils.Ming Shu rested her sights on the man only for a second, then quickly moved aside. Why should she meet this procurer again!\u201cQing Chen\u2026\u201d Father Bai\u2019s face also changed slightly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dThis place was not the site of Drunken Flower Pavilion. Why was the evildoer Qing Chen here? What was his purpose?\u201cWhy can\u2019t I be here?\u201d Qing Chen approached from the other side. His rather long hem dragged along the ground, as soft as a feather passing by. \u201cLord Bai can come to seek medical treatment, why can\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Father Bai blurted out.Qing Chen moved his eyes a little, and his clear voice sounded slightly ridiculing. \u201cI thought it was not a secret on the continent. Lord Bai seems to be ignorant.\u201dA bright light flashed upon Father Bai\u2019s mind. He thought of that rumor that spread on the mainland.It was rumored that the master of Drunken Flower Pavilion could not live over 26 years.The Drunken Flower Pavilion seemed to be looking for charismatic healers all the time. And this was just like confirming the rumor. No one in the Pavilion had ever come out and denied it.So he really couldn\u2019t live over 26?\u201cLord Bai, the Xiao family, everyone, since the Miss has refused all of your requests, please don\u2019t act like clingy babies. Aren\u2019t you embarrassed for yourselves?\u201d Qing Chen didn\u2019t stop talking. \u201cNow, would you like to be kicked out by me, or\u2026?\u201dThen he omitted the following words, gazing at Father Bai smilingly.Father Bai\u2019s eyes were filled with complexities. He wanted to argue, but was a little awkward.\u201cYou\u2019re not the only disciple of Death Valley, let\u2019s go.\u201d Father Bai forced himself to find an excuse and left.There were many disciples in Death Valley. He didn\u2019t believe that he couldn\u2019t find a person to treat his daughter. But we\u2019re not done on today\u2019s issue , he thought.Ming Shu slightly raised her eyebrows. She just smiled and didn\u2019t say anything.Hui Xue\u2019s expression was one of simmering laughter. If Lord Bai knew that the people of Death Valley all listened to the Miss, she didn\u2019t know whether he would be angered to death.The Xiao family looked at Ming Shu, then looked at Qing Chen, but eventually they only had to leave, too.As soon as the two gangs left, the corridor was empty and it seemed the air was beginning to circulate properly again.With his mouth curled up, Qing Chen broke the silence first. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, I helped drive away two troublemakers for you. How do you plan to thank me?\u201dMing Shu raised her fist. \u201cHow about this?\u201d\u201cMiss Zhi Po, that may be a little rude.\u201d Qing Chen\u2019s facial expression remained unchanged. \u201cEarlier, Miss Zhi Po smashed my place, I haven\u2019t had time to thank you.\u201dIs this man a fool?I destroyed your place and you want to thank me?This is real city folk\u2014always knowing how to have fun.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, it\u2019s really not a big deal.\u201d Ming Shu began to cooperate with his acting.\u201cIn fact, I have long wanted to renovate. But with so many emotional years spent there, I never had the heart to do it. This time, Miss Zhi Po helped me make the decision. I should thank you with both feeling and reason.\u201dMing Shu offered a big and bright smile. \u201cWell, then would you please pay the demolition fee?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d When it came to shamelessness, no one dared compare to this one. Qing Chen took a deep breath. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, let\u2019s just drop these hypocritical conversations, isn\u2019t it boring?\u201d\u201cDid I start it?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Well, okay, it\u2019s me,\u201d Qing Chen admitted frankly and naturally changed topics. \u201cI wonder if we can go to have a meal together, Miss Zhi Po?\u201d\u201cAre we very close?\u201d He\u2019s inviting me to dinner, which is strange enough considering we fought before. It must be a trap! I won\u2019t go no matter how tasty the food is , Ming Shu thought.Qing Chen shared ambiguous eye contact with Ming Shu. \u201cWe had such chemistry with each other, remember?\u201dWTF?! Who had chemistry with such an idiot! Don\u2019t describe a battle as lustful activity! I\u2019m a serious woman.Ming Shu maintained a calm smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal if I touched you? Are you a little girl or what, a touch will make you pregnant?\u201dInternally, Qing Chen was losing his grip, but he couldn\u2019t show any sign of that. Resisting the volcanic feeling, he went straight to the point: \u201cMiss Zhi Po, as you heard just now, I have serious things to tell you.\u201d\u201cMedical treatment?\u201d Ming Shu smiled. \u201cI can\u2019t do that, you need to look for someone else.\u201d\u201cFuck.\u201d Qing Chen could not help but burst out with foul language.The vision that Ming Shu had just tried to shove aside solidified on Qing Chen\u2019s face again, and her expression became a little strange.Qing Chen quickly disguised this by looking straight into the questioning eyes of Ming Shu. \u201cMiss Zhi Po is the master of Death Valley. If you can\u2019t cure the disease, would there be anyone else in the world who can?\u201dCalm down , Qing Chen said to himself.I have to calm down. I cannot ruin the character setting for me!I can\u2019t do this!He wanted to strangle this woman.\u201cRegardless, I can\u2019t. You\u2019re welcome to leave now.\u201d Ming Shu waved her hand at Qing Chen, looking like an innocent bystander.She had no interest in saving other people\u2019s lives; this skill was too boring for her.\u201cZhi Po\u2026\u201dHe\u2019s like an annoying fly, buzzing buzzing buzzing\u2026I told you I can\u2019t cure a disease.I! Cannot!Before Qing Chen finished the following sentence, Ming Shu had already rushed at him like an arrow.Boom!Clatter!Qing Chen\u2019s figure was swept away and slammed into the potted plant in the hallway. The pot was fiercely cracked, and porcelain and vegetation were strewn all over the floor.A lot of mud had splashed on Qing Chen\u2019s clothes, and a few leaves were stuck in his hair, making him look rather embarrassing.I want to kill her. Is that okay?But the character setting can\u2019t be broken.Which bastard set this rule!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Qing Chen was slumped down outside the door.As soon as she went into the room, she saw the eye-catching colorful egg expose itself on the table, rolling around willfully.This little thing rolled back by itself?The colorful egg perceived Ming Shu\u2019s arrival, so it rolled to the edge and began to bounce up and down. \u201cIt\u2019s so scary, that man is horrible!\u201dMing Shu pulled out a chair and sat down. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dThe colorful egg rolled in a couple of circles, back and forth, acting like a spoiled brat. It voiced in a pitiful tone, \u201cThe outside world is awful! I\u2019m scared.\u201dMing Shu twitched her mouth, pointing to herself with one finger. \u201cSo you mean I\u2019m not scary?\u201dThe egg somehow trembled its body. \u201cWell\u2026 you are fine, you said you won\u2019t eat living things that can speak.\u201dIf it were not for this sentence, it wouldn\u2019t have come straight to her after escaping from that man.\u201cI don\u2019t eat, but\u2026\u201d Ming Shu prolonged her words with a meaningful smile. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean people around me don\u2019t eat, right?\u201dWhat a naive egg.!!!Is that true?Why is my fate so miserable!Wuwuwu, I want to go home.\u201cYou must be scaring me on purpose,\u201d the colorful egg tentatively said, voice airy and grieved.I\u2019m such a cute egg, why does everyone want to eat me? I\u2019m not delicious at all!\u201cI\u2019m not scaring you, kid.\u201d Ming Shu picked up a fruit from the tray and took a small bite. \u201cLater I\u2019ll let Hui Xue cook you.\u201dHearing this, the poor egg jumped up and down anxiously, making crisp noises constantly like an uneasy child.Finally it shouted aloud, \u201cYou are a bad person! You are all bad!\u201dThen it angrily rolled down from the table and bounced out through the open window, disappearing from Ming Shu\u2019s sight.The latter focused on eating her fruit, nonchalant.As she finished one fruit and was about to have another, the egg jumped in from outside again, trembling fiercely with a frightened \u201cexpression.\u201dMing Shu was surprised. \u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d Has it overcome the fear of being boiled alive, or\u2026 is my charm so irresistible?The colorful egg rolled its eyes at Ming Shu secretly, saying extremely quickly, \u201cThat serpent is here!\u201dSerpent?The figure of a stupid snake in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons flashed across Ming Shu\u2019s mind.\u201cAhh!\u201dScreams started coming from outside constantly, accompanied by the crash of fallen objects.Ming Shu stood up and walked to the window to take a look. The street was a scene of chaos, and a little further away, a huge golden monster was winding its body this way.The buildings were all destroyed in its passing.\u201cIt\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming.\u201d The colorful egg jumped beside Ming Shu\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s coming to eat me.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you a divine beast egg?\u201d Ming Shu looked down at it. \u201cYou\u2019re scared of that one?\u201dThe colorful egg bounced even more fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m still young\u2026 In human terms, I\u2019m still an infant! How is it possible for me to beat an adult?\u201dMing Shu concluded simply, \u201cYou mean you are weak.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very powerful!\u201d protested the little egg.Ming Shu said doubtfully, \u201cThen go fight with it! Why are you scared?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d The egg hesitated for a little while, and then found a reasonable excuse for itself. \u201cI\u2019m still a baby, I can\u2019t fight it. When I am born and out of the shell, I will be way more powerful than the serpent.\u201dHumph, I\u2019m not weak.I\u2019m just not born yet.\u201cThat is called being weak.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d I\u2019m not weak, I\u2019m not!The golden serpent came straight toward the inn. Hui Xue and Liu Feng walked in. The former stared at the serpent with fear and urged Ming Shu, \u201cMiss, it\u2019s coming near, let\u2019s get out of here first.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not coming for me, why should I leave?\u201d Ming Shu said smilingly.\u201c\u2026 Not for you?\u201d Hui Xue for sure didn\u2019t agree with her Miss. Had she forgotten how she abused the serpent at the Windy Mountain Range of Demons? If it wasn\u2019t coming for revenge, then what else?Ming Shu pointed at the uneasy egg. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely coming for this one. We only need to hand it over and everything will be settled in peace.\u201dThe egg rolled back several meters right away, stuck itself into a corner, and complained in a crying tone, \u201cYou\u2019re a cruel human! You\u2019re heartless.\u201dMing Shu nodded with her smiling eyes, staring at the egg, and then asked seriously, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I am heartless, but what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d What does it have to do with others if I\u2019m cruel?The egg completely went crazy.What\u2019s wrong!She should asked me what\u2019s wrong with her cruelty! Does she feel proud of that? What\u2019s this pride for!Besides, I am such a cute and powerful egg, how could this woman not want me? Is she a woman? Is she even a human!She\u2019s worse than a beast!\u201cMiss, it\u2019s here.\u201dThe minute Hui Xue finished the sentence, the golden serpent slithered forward handsomely and successfully landed its head outside Ming Shu\u2019 window, knocking a neighboring house into the air.Just its head was about the size of a window.Its golden eyes were like two big copper bells, staring straight at Ming Shu, gloomy and treacherous.\u201cHi.\u201d Ming Shu greeted the serpent with a wave.The serpent spit out its scarlet tongue, saying ferociously, \u201cHuman, give me the divine beast egg, and you shall survive.\u201d\u201cStupid snake, I\u2019ll survive?\u201d Ming Shu chuckled. \u201cYou should worry about yourself.\u201dShe was implying something by saying this. The golden serpent followed Ming Shu\u2019s gaze, then it saw several figures were running at full speed toward it in a circle formation. Narrowing its hostile eyes, the serpent lashed its tail in a rush, cutting the buildings in half with loud noises. It then quickly lifted its glossy tail again, the gathering Qi causing objects to float into the air, their sharp edges aimed at the approaching figures.Swoosh\u2014With a strike of its tail, the scattered objects in the air flew out in all directions with a swift and fierce momentum.Liu Feng stepped forward to block the flying debris for Ming Shu, and Hui Xue took the chance to grab Ming Shu\u2019s wrist. \u201cMiss, go!\u201dHui Xue pulled Ming Shu along to flee the inn via the front door. As soon as they stepped out, the inn was cut up and collapsed to the ground. Surrounded by the wavering dust, the figure of the serpent became more and more indistinct.\u201cAhem hem\u2026\u201d Hui Xue waved her hands to fan the dust and led Ming Shu to s safer location. But suddenly, her wrist was pulled hard by Ming Shu and she was dragged back several steps. Then a huge object crashed down just in front of her from above.\u201cBe careful, baby.\u201dA stream of warm breath flowed passed Hui Xue\u2019s ear; she swallowed silently.\u201dT-thank you, Miss.\u201dIf the Miss hadn\u2019t pulled her back just now, she would have been hit by the fallen object. But why did it feel a little strange\u2026\u201cMiss Zhi Po, we meet again.\u201dMing Shu loosened her grip on Hui Xue and looked to the side. Qing Chen was standing just a few steps away from her, in an even more gorgeous outfit, looking like a colorful butterfly.His stunning elegance hadn\u2019t been reduced by the dust and ashes of the ruins.That was a real procurer right there.Ming Shu smiled lightly. \u201cLook at you, are you falling in love with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What a shameless narcissist. Qing Chen harrumphed a cold laugh and replied, \u201cIs Miss Zhi Po always so narcissistic like this?\u201dMing Shu admitted humbly, \u201cWell, not that much.\u201dWhat?! Who said I was praising you!Qing Chen forced himself to hold back his violent impulses. He pasted on a fake smile and said, \u201cI really hope that Miss Zhi Po\u2019s medical skill is as good as her thick skin.\u201dLiked it?

But\u2026 for Ming Shu, she would definitely refuse to save people. Treating a disease was just a waste of time and life bar.The girl was standing opposite him, wearing a smiling face; even her eyes were smiling at him, you just couldn\u2019t find any hint of viciousness in this picture. But such a \u201csweet\u201d girl had just said the above words, which made one want to kill her and cut her into pieces\u2026Qing Chen took a deep breath. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, you are not qualified in name only, are you?\u201d\u201cWell, take your chances and you\u2019ll know.\u201d I may not be qualified to cure diseases, but I have much experience in torturing people to death, Ming Shu thought.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s not the right time to chat.\u201d Hui Xue took the chance to stop them as she perceived the two seemed to want to have a hot debate right here and now. \u201cThe serpent is coming.\u201dIn the ruins, the golden serpent was sliding through quickly in their direction, followed by some humans attacking it constantly. But the spirit force slamming against it was just like scratching an itch, not lethal in the least.With a clear objective in mind, the golden serpent rushed straight toward Ming Shu.Two little figures on the ground were reflected in its golden pupils. These two ignored me, AGAIN! Just like last time.Ahhhh!Being born as a dignified saint beast, the serpent had never been neglected like this by two tiny humans. This was total defiance, disrespect! It had to make them pay for what they did.The golden serpent\u2019s tail swept from the side. Ming Shu and Qing Chen went into action at the same time. They separated in two different directions as the golden serpent swept past from below, then they exchanged positions. The serpent\u2019s tail did not even brush their clothes.Qing Chen moved some small steps to keep balance, dusting his gorgeous robe and saying unhurriedly, \u201cMiss Zhi Po, your strength is not bad.\u201d\u201cWell, you too.\u201d This man\u2019s strength is not that good, but his ability to escape should be decent.These two pretentious people continued to ignore the golden serpent, starting to flatter each other.The golden serpent was totally enraged. Its tail changed direction and stabbed at Ming Shu with a fierce wind.Ming Shu snatched a stick out of the air and struck it toward that tail with force. The serpent thought that was just an ordinary piece of wood, so it ignored it. However, when the stick landed on its tail, unbearable pain spread from its tail to its whole body, deep into its bones.\u201cHissss\u2014\u201d The golden serpent couldn\u2019t help groaning in pain.Hateful humans.\u201cLeave this place.\u201d Ming Shu rushed to Hui Xue in just a few steps and pulled her to run away.Hui Xue was stunned and wondered, Were you just bluffing the serpent, Miss?Ming Shu had run away, leaving Qing Chen all alone in the same spot.What\u2019s wrong with this woman? I thought she was going to have a fight with the saint beast\u2026 Who\u2019d have thought that she\u2019d just give it a kick and run away? Sh*t\u2026 What\u2019s the difference between this and hiding away before provoking a tiger by kicking its ass? Qing Chen had a storm raging in his head.No way, he should also run.But Qing Chen stopped halfway. He grabbed onto the ends of his clothes tightly.No, I cannot run. I\u2019m the master of Drunken Flower Pavilion, running away is not a thing that a master should do.I can\u2019t run.The character setting is not allowed to be violated.The result of not being able to run was that Qing Chen and the golden serpent battled each other across several streets. After destroying countless buildings, Qing Chen barely preserved his image with the assistance of his people, who arrived afterward.Meanwhile, nobody had noticed where the culprit had gone.Qing Chen was infuriated almost to the point of cursing.\u2026The golden serpent was the \u201cking\u201d in the city of Xiling. Born as a powerful saint beast, people of all the big families could do nothing about it. They had heard that even Feng Cheng didn\u2019t succeed in defeating it. The serpent was destroying the city like crazy.They couldn\u2019t rest easy with that. The major families had begun to discuss countermeasures. Even if they were unable to kill the serpent, they had to drive it away.Of course, some selfish people had also tried to tame the golden serpent for their own use. However, the saint beast was not so easy to deal with. Every one of them ended in vain; some even paid with their lives.These people\u2019s actions increasingly angered the golden serpent. It vented its anger on the whole city, destroying almost the entirety of Xiling and causing heavy casualties.\u201cMiss, Miss, Feng Cheng negotiated with the golden serpent.\u201d Hui Xue rushed inside with the latest news. \u201cThe serpent asked them to surrender you and Qing Chen and Xiao Rufeng, or it would massacre the city.\u201d\u201cXiao Rufeng?\u201d Was she mistaken?Hui Xue nodded. Right, it\u2019s Xiao Rufeng, who was sent back to the Xiao family after you picked her up in the mountains.\u201c\u2026\u201d It was understandable to surrender her and Qing Chen, but Xiao Rufeng\u2026 For what? It forgot that it desired the colorful egg?What was the untold connection between the golden serpent and Xiao Rufeng?Ming Shu thoughtfully touched her wrist. Confused pieces of information flashed one by one before her mind\u2019s eye, eventually summing up into useful conclusions.Before, the golden serpent took Xiao Rufeng away briefly. Possibly something had happened during that time. The golden serpent\u2026 Was it the golden finger for Xiao Rufeng?WTF\u2026 There was no such stupid snake in the plot!Director! A snake is invading the world!The colorful egg seemed to be Xiao Rufeng\u2019s golden finger.However, the egg ought to be robbed by Xiao Rufeng from Xiao Rufei. But now there was no intersection between the egg and Xiao Rufei, so Xiao Rufeng had no chance to grab it. So the plot just arranged a new golden finger for Xiao Rufeng?Sure enough, she was the beloved reborn.If one golden finger was gone, no need to worry, because there would be a second one, a third one\u2026I need to eat snacks to calm down.\u201cThen?\u201d It was impossible for Feng Cheng to accept the deal easily as he was the male protagonist.Hui Xue swallowed worriedly. \u201cAfter the final negotiation, they only need to hand over you and Xiao Rufeng.\u201dThe background of Qing Chen was the Drunken Flower Pavilion. The power of the entire Pavilion couldn\u2019t be neglected by Feng Cheng.Therefore, in the end, only her, being the \u201cdisciple\u201dof Death Valley, and the unfavorable Xiao Rufeng of the Xiao family, became victims.\u201cMiss, if they knew your identity, they would not dare to hand you over. You\u2026 come on, stop eating, Miss. They are planning to hand you over for the peace of Xiling!\u201d\u201cWell, they are not the ones who make decisions.\u201d Ming Shu protected the snacks and answered, \u201cDo I look so easygoing as to agree with them?\u201d\u201cMiss, there are a lot of powerful masters in Xiling. We cannot defeat so many people.\u201d Xiling was equivalent to the capital of the Xuanyuan mainland, where countless masters and predecessors could be hidden.In order to protect Xiling, it was highly possible that those people would turn to these master elders.These old monsters were beyond tough, and they would be difficult to deal with. In that case, the Miss would be in danger.Ming Shu tilted her head and asked, \u201cIf they are that powerful, why don\u2019t they directly handle the golden serpent?\u201dHui Xue was shocked by the question, not knowing how to answer.\u201cHui Xue, do you know why?\u201d Ming Shu stared at Hui Xue with her chin held in her palm.Hui Xue nodded, then quickly shook her head.\u201cBecause the weaker side is always easier to deal with. Everyone loves playing the bully.\u201dMing Shu drew a circle on the table\u2019s surface and said gently, \u201cSacrificing an unimportant person in exchange for more lives, they think it\u2019s justice.\u201dHer fingertip stopped in the middle of an invisible circle, flowing lights flashing inside her eyes. \u201cBut not everyone will accept to be the sacrifice and serve the so-called justice. When one stands against this, other people will unhesitatingly criticize them, abuse them, and put on their head the heavy hat of \u2018sinner.\u2019 Together they will push this person into the abyss.\u201dLiked it?

Ming Shu supported herself on the railings of the inn and looked at the large crowd below in quite a pleasant mood. \u201cSo many people are here. It looks like I\u2019m very important.\u201dHui Xue was totally speechless. She looked to Liu Feng, who was squatting on the beam, and found the same helpless feeling in his eyes. Miss, they did not come to invite you to a feast. They are here to invite you to death, okay?Could you take it a little more seriously?\u201cMiss.\u201d Hui Xue pulled on Ming Shu\u2019s clothes, not letting her leave. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go downstairs.\u201dMing Shu patted Hui Xue\u2019s hand lightly and smiled. \u201cThey have come all the way to invite me, how can I not go, right? That would be impolite.\u201d There must be a big show, I\u2019m not gonna miss it .\u201cMiss!\u201d Hui Xue stamped her feet anxiously. \u201cThose people don\u2019t have kind intentions. What should we do if something unexpected happens? You\u2019re the master of Death Valley. You have to keep yourself safe.\u201dThere was only one disciple in Death Valley for each master. Now that the old master had passed away, and the Miss hadn\u2019t gotten any disciples of her own, if something bad really happened to Miss\u2026 How should the Valley deal with that? Miss was behaving irresponsibly by risking her life, both to herself and to the Valley.\u201cRelax, I have nine lives!\u201d Ming Shu said in a proud voice. \u201cThese people are not strong enough to hurt me.\u201dIf she didn\u2019t want to die, who could force her?Naturally, Hui Xue could do nothing about Ming Shu. Soon they were dramatically escorted by the crowd to an open space in the center of Xiling.At this time, the open space was surrounded by countless people from all the families around the city. Meanwhile, the golden serpent slithered over a building, its head held high, and gazed at the people below.Feng Cheng stood in the middle of the crowd. He was surrounded by some old men, all of whom were sage-like in appearance and looked compassionate, with no worldly desires.These people should be the so-called powerful predecessors.Ming Shu walked into the circle of people with a calm smile, her red robe floating in the wind. She displayed no signs of fear or nervousness. She cast her mild gaze directly into everyone\u2019s eyes.She looked like an innocent and harmless girl. The air seemed to move easier upon her arrival.She was a person who obviously did not have powerful momentum, but her sense of presence was stronger than anyone else present.All of the eyes were moving with the red-clad figure, some complicated, some regretful, some indifferent, hateful, jealous\u2026\u201cMiss Zhi Po.\u201dA middle-aged man from the Xiao family stepped forward and blocked Ming Shu.Ming Shu stopped. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dThe lord of the Xiao family quietly watched Ming Shu. This girl could stay calm even under such circumstances.Lord Xiao took a few more steps forward and lowered his voice. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, as long as you promise to treat Rufei, the Xiao family will help you handle this matter. This is a favorable transaction, what do you say?\u201dSince Feng Cheng could negotiate with the golden serpent, the Xiao family could also start another negotiation. That\u2019s why Lord Xiao could offer this suggestion to Ming Shu.But Ming Shu lifted her hair. \u201cWell, I say it\u2019s unnecessary. I can handle this myself. Why do I need your help?\u201dIf a fist couldn\u2019t handle a matter, then one could count on fact and reason.[\u2026] It seems the fist equals to fact and reason in the Guest\u2019s understanding. So\u2026 what\u2019s the difference?Lord Xiao had been informed of Ming Shu\u2019s stubbornness earlier by his people, and it was said she was very conceited. Considering that most disciples of Death Valley had medical skills unmatched by ordinary people, it was understandable that they may be conceited. However, he didn\u2019t expect this person to be so arrogant.\u201cSince Miss Zhi Po said this, she must be very confident.\u201d Lord Xiao changed his tone.Ming Shu reached out to cover her mouth, yawning, then put down her hand and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not that confident. Don\u2019t frighten me, Lord Bai. I\u2019m just a weak girl, it\u2019s impolite for you to talk to me like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d What\u2019s wrong with this person? Was she acting on purpose?He wanted to save her life.Since she disrespected me like this, then don\u2019t blame me for being ruthless.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. You are talking too much. Where is the other person?\u201d The golden serpent grew impatient. His big head fell violently a few meters down, pressuring the crowd into moving back a few steps.Lord Xiao spared a glance for Ming Shu, then waved toward the back. Soon Xiao Rufeng was brought out.Her bloodstained clothes were a total mess. With such weak breathing, it seemed she might die at any minute.Ming Shu took out a few pieces of dried meat from within her sleeves. She watched Xiao Rufeng be dragged to her side as she chewed the dried meat.Xiao Rufeng still had some breath. She tried hard to lift her eyelids, accurately capturing Ming Shu\u2019s figure. A fierce and sharp light flashed past her eyes, but all she could do now was shiver. Her cracked lips trembled. \u201cZhi Po\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s me.\u201d Ming Shu answered in a bright tone. \u201cYou are alive? Great.\u201dXiao Rufeng\u2019s body shivered even more fiercely, and she squeezed out a few words through her teeth. \u201cZhi Po, don\u2019t be too proud too early. Who will win or lose is not yet settled.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Ming Shu continued to chew on the dried meat with smiling eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who wins or loses. What\u2019s important is\u2026 do you hate me?\u201dI\u2019m not here to compete with you. I\u2019m here for Hatred Points!Xiao Rufeng\u2019s hands clenched into fists, and her blood-red eyes filled with hatred.Hatred?How could she not hate her.This woman had troubled her many times. She was also the cause of the present situation. She certainly hated her.If she survived today, she must make this woman suffer. She had been a killer for so many years, which had earned her much experience in torturing people.\u201cAs agreed, we give you these two people, and you exit the city, back to the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. Never show yourself in Xiling again.\u201d Feng Cheng, as a representative, stood up and negotiated with the golden serpent.\u201d Hiss , rest assured. I\u2019m not like you humans who eat your words.\u201d The golden serpent sneered.Humans were sinister and deceitful. They never kept their word.Even beasts kept their word more strictly than humans.Feng Cheng looked at Ming Shu and Xiao Rufeng. A wisp of gloomy light appeared in his eyes. This Xiao Rufeng was definitely not a loser, as she appeared on the surface. As for that Zhi Po\u2026After several strange and quiet seconds, Feng Cheng waved his hand to order his escorts to take them to the serpent.Xiao Rufeng curled her mouth even more at Ming Shu.Let\u2019s wait and see.Ming Shu calmly shoved the last bit of meat into her mouth, patting her hands, and asked, \u201cAre you really handing me to this stupid snake?\u201d\u201cHiss hiss\u2014\u201d Stupid snake? What?!The golden serpent hissed at Ming Shu for a few moments, but it didn\u2019t move. Seeing this, the onlookers broke the silence. \u201cZhi Po, it was all your fault. You think we don\u2019t know what happened in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons? It\u2019s you who caused the trouble, don\u2019t dare to drag innocent Xiling people into death with you.\u201d\u201cWhat? Could you be just a little reasonable?\u201d Ming Shu pointed at the Bai family and continued, \u201cThe first person who caused trouble was the Miss of the Bai family. How did it become me?\u201dHad it not been Bai Yanran who intended to get in close contact with the golden serpent using her beautiful buttocks? How could such not have alerted the golden serpent?\u201cWhat are you talking about! How is it possible that Yanran offended it. Don\u2019t try to defend yourself by framing innocent people,\u201d Lord Bai shouted back immediately.Ming Shu picked her ear with her pinkie finger, smiling. \u201cCalm down, why are you so excited! Did I blurt out the truth?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d\u201cNonsense? Then why are you shouting? Did you take the wrong medicine?\u201d\u201cYou wronged my Yanran, why can\u2019t I argue about the truth? Don\u2019t you pull Yanran into the water!\u201d Lord Bai continued his shouting, face red with agitation.She is the one who has taken the wrong medicine!Liked it?

When did I not allow you to argue? I just asked why you\u2019re shouting.\u201d Ming Shu spread out her hands innocently. \u201cAre you showing off your splendid and loud voice? Come on, save it for bedtime. We are not the right people for you to share with.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone pretended they didn\u2019t understand what she was saying.Lord Bai\u2019s expression clouded for a while. Then finally he sneered and said in a louder and serious voice, \u201cZhi Po, don\u2019t try to deflect our attention! Escorts, take her down. Today, even if the master of Death Valley were here, he would surrender you for the protection of the innocent citizens of Xiling.\u201dMing Shu laughed. \u201cAre you the master of Death Valley? How do you know the master would surrender me?\u201dMe surrendering myself, seriously?\u2026\u201cDeath Valley is famous for healing people. Doctors are all kindhearted. Saving the world is what they should do,\u201d Lord Bai answered with a confident face, taking his thoughts for granted.Ming Shu smiled brightly at Lord Bai. \u201cWell, you are guessing it wrong, Lord Bai. I will not hand myself over.\u201d\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d Lord Bai was a bit confused for a while, and it took him a little longer to react. \u201cYou dare to pretend to be the master of Death Valley? Who gave you the courage?\u201d\u201cI am the master. How am I pretending?\u201d Of course it\u2019s the Harmony System that gave me the courage.[\u2026] It\u2019s none of my business.\u201cHahaha, if you are the master of Death Valley, I will be the ancestor of it.\u201d A burst of laughter came from the crowd, followed by even louder laughter.\u201cThis woman must be crazy. She dares to say she\u2019s the master of Death Valley. Perhaps her identity as a disciple of Death Valley is also a lie.\u201d\u201cNo wonder she didn\u2019t dare to diagnose anyone! If she had seen any patients, she would be exposed!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s not any news of a new master in Death Valley. How is it possible that the master suddenly became a little girl? Does she think we are all fools?\u201dFeng Cheng closed his mouth tightly, and his eyes fell on the dark patterns on Ming Shu\u2019s red robe. He was wondering why the patterns were a bit familiar to him. Now it was clear. The patterns could only be used by the master of Death Valley. But no one knew exactly what the patterns were.It looked a bit like grass, but more like a flower once one looked closer.But even so, whether she was the real master or not was hard to determine at this time.Lord Bai waved his hand to quiet down the crowd. \u201cZhi Po, don\u2019t try, do you know who the master of Death Valley is?\u201d\u201cThe Miss is the master of our Death Valley. She is not pretending to be anyone.\u201d Hui Xue forced her way into the crowd and rushed to Ming Shu. \u201cDo you want to be enemy to all of Death Valley?\u201dOur Miss rarely left the Valley. When she did, she didn\u2019t use her identity as the last disciple of Old Master. Then Old Master suddenly passed away, and the Miss left the valley after the funeral. We didn\u2019t have time to announce the appointment of a new master.\u201cLittle girl, this is not something that can be believed with words alone. Evidence must be produced.\u201d If they easily believed her words, then anyone could say they were the master of Death Valley. And there would be lots of masters!Hui Xue reminded Ming Shu. \u201cMiss, the jade.\u201dMing Shu blinked. What jade?Did she have something of jade?The corner of Hui Xue\u2019s mouth twitched. She lowered her voice. \u201cThere\u2019s a jade on you, did you forget?\u201dMing Shu thought for a while. Is there? Uh\u2026 Seemingly\u2026She searched in her wide sleeves carefully, but besides a pile of dried meat, there was no sign of any jade.\u201c\u2026\u201dHow many pieces of dried meat did she store in her sleeve?\u201cHahaha, still acting? What, where\u2019s your evidence?\u201d\u201cThey didn\u2019t even prepare props for the acting, how brave they are.\u201d\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201dThe mocking was getting louder and louder.\u201cMiss, where did you put the jade?\u201d Hui Xue became a little anxious. \u201cSearch thoroughly, please, you mustn\u2019t eat it.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Can the jade be eaten?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Hui Xue stared at Ming Shu. She was afraid that the Miss might eat everything!Ming Shu comforted Hui Xue. \u201cOkay, okay, don\u2019t worry, let me see.\u201dIf it couldn\u2019t be eaten, then it must be somewhere.It was too difficult for Ming Shu to look for a jade in a pile of snacks.\u201cJust laugh.\u201d Ming Shu said to the laughing crowd with a good-natured attitude. \u201cLater you will cry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Was she really a fool?Hui Xue wished she could find a place to hide. When it came to other \u201cimportant\u201d people, their appearance was either gorgeous or imposing.Why was the style of her Miss so bizarre?Have you ever seen anyone searching for a jade in a pile of snacks when it was needed for a display of power?No, right?She hadn\u2019t witnessed such a scene before, either.Ming Shu looked for a long time, and finally she touched a piece of jade. Her eyes lit up with joy. \u201cHere it is.\u201d She pulled out the jade pendant happily and threw it to Hui Xue.Hui Xue checked the jade over and over again before finally sighing in relief. Luckily the Miss didn\u2019t eat it.Seeing Ming Shu really taking out a jade \u201cprop,\u201d the others gradually stopped laughing. There is a jade? Is it real or not?Hui Xue grunted coldly. Her fingers loosened, and the jade dangled in the air. \u201cOpen your eyes, this is the token jade of Death Valley.\u201dThe jade was totally exposed. The suet-like white jade was engraved with a scarlet character surrounded by dark lines. And the lifelike jade seemed to have some red lights flowing around it.Every disciple of the master of Death Valley had a jade, which was obviously more advanced than the ordinary jade. Usually the jade was circled by strong and thick Qi, making it more precious than normal jade.The atmosphere suddenly calmed down.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a fake jade! Who knows if you haven\u2019t counterfeited it?\u201d Some people in the crowd still didn\u2019t believe it.This woman looked like a fake master!Hui Xue held the jade tightly and stared at the man with her beautiful eyes. \u201cIt is well known the jade pendant of the master of Death Valley is made of ancient jade with thousands of years of history. There is only one jade on the mainland. It\u2019s impossible for our Miss to master the ability to create one.\u201d\u201cCan I take a look?\u201d Feng Cheng said.After hesitating for a while, Hui Xue turned back to Ming Shu. The latter didn\u2019t stop her, so Hui Xue passed the jade over.Feng Cheng inspected the jade carefully. His brow wrinkled deeper and deeper, and finally he returned it to Hui Xue. \u201cIt is indeed an ancient jade. She\u2019s not lying.\u201dThis statement undoubtedly proved the identity of Ming Shu.\u201cImpossible\u2026\u201d Lord Bai didn\u2019t believe it.How was it possible that the master of Death Valley was such a young girl?Hui Xue hung the jade pendant on Ming Shu\u2019s waist, and her little face was full of coldness. \u201cHow is it impossible?\u201dIt is impossible!However, Lord Seven said that jade was real\u2026Ming Shu played around with the jade and continued Hui Xue\u2019s words: \u201cSo, now you still want to hand me over to that stupid snake?\u201dIt was two completely different things to offend an ordinary disciple of Death Valley and to offend the master of it.\u201cBut it\u2019s you who\u2019s responsible for this matter\u2026?\u201d A weak voice sounded.\u201cIt\u2019s true. Even if you are the master of Death Valley, you can\u2019t get all of us into trouble.\u201dAre you kidding me?!Just make it clear! In the beginning, it was Bai Yanran who alerted the stupid snake. Later, the stupid snake took a fancy to the divine beast egg, and it just had to grab it!What did this have anything to do with me? What did I do?What! Did! I! Do!\u201cYou forgot that master of the Drunken Grass Pavilion. He also provoked the serpent, how could you not hand him over?\u201d I didn\u2019t cause the trouble all by myself. These people blame everything on me alone. Do I look that weak?Drunken Grass\u2026When did the Drunken Flower Pavilion change its name to Drunken Grass? Did Qing Chen know about this?Liked it?

Before, this human ignored it, which it might have tolerated, but now she dared to let others ignore it so flagrantly. Intolerable!The stupid serpent got furious, and its tail swept over like a growing vine. It directly attacked Ming Shu and Xiao Rufeng, trying to wrap them up.Ming Shu moved her body aside easily to avoid the tail. But the escorts who were carrying Xiao Rufeng were scared by the attack and dropped her quickly. Then Xiao Rufeng was successfully wrapped in the serpent\u2019s tail.\u201cHiss hiss\u2014\u201d Hateful humans, I\u2019m going to tear you up.Especially that evil woman.The stupid serpent lifted its entire body up and tried to attack Ming Shu. But suddenly, its body froze in midair for a second, and the next second it swiftly slipped backward and ran away.In the dust, the golden figure of the serpent gradually disappeared. If it were not for the messy ruins everywhere, it would seem as if the golden serpent had never showed up.This was it?\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cWhy did it leave? Are we good here?\u201d\u201cXiao Rufeng was taken away\u2026\u201dHearing the name of Xiao Rufeng, everyone was silent for a moment. In these people\u2019s minds, Xiao Rufeng was nothing but a loser, a total disaster. But now the golden serpent took Xiao Rufeng and left Ming Shu here\u2026 This undoubtedly confused them.Ming Shu propped her chin on her fingertips with smiling eyes. It really is Xiao Rufeng\u2019s golden finger\u2026After a few moments, she grabbed a piece of dried meat from her sleeve, chewed it, and turned to look at the crowd.No condemnation or anger could be seen in her eyes; instead, she looked calm and mild. But it was precisely this indifference that made others feel cold and creeped out.The Xiao and Bai families were showing the most unpleasant faces. Since they\u2019d just offended her, the possibility of getting her to see patients was zero.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Ming Shu put her hands behind her and dragged her words out. \u201cDo you want to pack me up and send me to the stupid snake?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHui Xue, remember: For all these people who are present today, our Death Valley will never treat them. All their relatives and the 18 generations that succeed them are not allowed to seek our help.\u201dHui Xue was slightly surprised. Our Miss is so cruel. But these people deserve it. They actually wanted to trade our Miss\u2019s life for their peace.After announcing a new rule for Death Valley, Ming Shu left unhurriedly with Hui Xue and Liu Feng. But her brisk voice could be clearly heard from afar.\u201cLet\u2019s go to eat some roasted duck.\u201d\u201cMiss, you are still hungry?\u201d\u201cI was scared today so I need to eat much more food to comfort myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d You were scared? We were scared, okay?!\u201cLord\u2026 is that woman really the master of Death Valley?\u201d Feng Cheng\u2019s guard was skeptical. \u201cShe used to follow Miss Bai\u2026\u201dFeng Cheng looked murkily in the direction Ming Shu left. A piece of red cloth was disappearing from his sights. \u201cGo check it out.\u201dThere must have been some signs of this new master of Death Valley.\u201cYes, my Lord.\u201d\u201cLord, the saint beast\u2026 it took Xiao Rufeng away. It didn\u2019t seem like it was going to hurt her. Was there some trick?\u201dEven the guards sensed something unusual, so naturally Feng Cheng also thought about it.But Feng Cheng was a little confused at this time. He kept silent for a moment. \u201cClear up the mess first. The rest will be discussed later.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, my Lord.\u201d\u2026\u201cMiss\u2026\u201dAfter the golden serpent disturbed Xiling, the whole city was caught up in a strange atmosphere. In this situation, the most common scene was that of the master of Death Valley coming in and out of all restaurants.More than that, occasionally the escort of the master could be seen dragging a spirit beast back to the city.Then some smoke would arise from somewhere.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s here.\u201d The maid pointed at the smoke not far away and whispered, \u201cMiss, even the lord didn\u2019t persuade her. Do you really want to go?\u201dBai Yanran had a veil over her face, and the smoke was reflected in her gloomy eyes. \u201cMy face\u2026 It can only be cured by Death Valley, right?\u201dThe maid slightly lowered her head, looking scared. \u201cYes\u2026\u201dThe lord had turned to many people for help, but everyone said only Death Valley could cure it.Bai Yanran clung to her clothes, her heart sinking. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cMiss\u2026\u201dThe maid walked faster to catch up with Bai Yanran. They headed toward the smoke.This was a quadrangular courtyard. It seemed very noisy and children\u2019s laughter was coming from inside continuously. Bai Yanran pushed her way in, and the scene presented to her was unexpectedly harmonious.Several children were running and singing around the campfire. The meat was roasted in the middle, already changed into an attractive color. In the air was the tempting smell of food.In the corridor nearby, a girl in red was leaning against a pillar, a faint smile between her eyes and brows. She watched the playful children while nibbling at a piece of meat.A dark shadow suddenly appeared in front of Bai Yanran. The chilled air almost sent her hair standing upright.Liu Feng blocked her gaze and stared at her with cold eyes, obviously indicating she was unwelcome here and had better leave.Bai Yanran took a deep breath and raised her head. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Zhi Po.\u201d\u201cThe Miss won\u2019t see any guests now.\u201d Hui Xue stepped up from the side, only to blink and walk closer. \u201cBai Yanran?\u201dThis woman dared to come to the Miss?Isn\u2019t she afraid the Miss will kill her?\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Hui Xue asked with her hands on her hips.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Zhi Po.\u201d Bai Yanran pointed to Ming Shu as she answered. The maid pulled her clothes behind her lightly. Although Bai Yanran was somewhat impatient, she softened her attitude a little. \u201cI\u2019m looking for your master.\u201dHui Xue sneered. \u201cOur Miss won\u2019t see any guests now. As I just said. Miss Bai, please go back.\u201dThis woman treated the Miss so miserably before, now she dares to come to us. Who gave her the courage?Bai Yanran didn\u2019t move. She looked over Hui Xue and stared at Ming Shu, shouting, \u201cI know why you were coming to me before, Zhi Po. Your master asked you to protect me, right? The master owed my mother, and he wanted you to repay her for him. Are you going to violate his wishes?\u201dMing Shu lifted her head slightly. The children in the yard suddenly stopped playing and looked at Ming Shu with innocent expressions. Showing a warm smile, Ming Shu waved at them and said, \u201cYou should go back to class. Come on, this sister needs to handle something.\u201dThe children then ran to the door with hands covering their smiling mouths. Some slow kids looked back as they were running. \u201cSister, don\u2019t tell the teacher that we came to you.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Ming Shu smiled in answer.These children were students from an old-fashioned private school next door. There was a door connected to the other side, so the smell of roasted meat lured them over.Ming Shu didn\u2019t drive them away. Thus, from time to time, they would sneak in to share the meat.After all the children left, Ming Shu threw out the bones in her hands and pulled out a handkerchief, wiping slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dBai Yanran suddenly breathed a sigh of relief. This secret was discovered in the belongings left by her mother, but she was not sure if it was true. Now that Ming Shu admitted it in person, she was completely relieved.Now there might be some hope that her face would be cured.However, Ming Shu\u2019s next sentence extinguished Bai Yanran\u2019s faint hope immediately.Ming Shu stepped down elegantly, an extremely soft smile on her face. \u201cSo what?\u201dThat was the mission Zhi Po needed to accomplish, not her.She was Ming Shu, not Zhi Po. She was here to acquire Hatred Points. Nothing more, nothing less; it was that simple.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Bai Yanran\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou must protect me. This was the agreement between my mother and your master. How can you break it?\u201dLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now you are asking me to continue the so-called agreement. Miss Bai, you are so funny.\u201d The Host was a silly girl, do you think I am also a fool? Stupid!\u201cThis is what your master owed to my mother.\u201d Bai Yanran remained unconvinced. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for my mother, your master would have died long ago.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what happened between my master and your mother. Does it have anything to do with me?\u201d Ming Shu raised an eyebrow and laughed. \u201cIf you want to argue, talk to my master. I can\u2019t convey your message to him.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dBai Yanran never expected that Ming Shu would be so indifferent and act so outrageously!Bai Yanran had to throw the handle after the blade. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to be universally condemned for your ungratefulness, cure my face! Or I will ruin your reputation.\u201d\u201cOh, I have offended so many people, I don\u2019t care about offending a few more. Whatever you like.\u201d It\u2019s become so comfortable to gain Hatred Points, the more the better.Bai Yanran\u2019s face twisted under the veil and she gritted her teeth, saying, \u201cZhi Po, fine, just you wait.\u201dShe turned around and got ready to leave. But Liu Feng took out his weapon, blocking her way.\u201cZhi Po, what do you want?!\u201d Bai Yanran looked at Ming Shu, alarmed.What do I want? I\u2019m going to kick your ass!What else? Are you expecting me to invite you for dinner?What kind of place does she think my house is? The vegetable market? Anyone just comes in and out at will?The key point is\u2026 she disturbed my meal!Ming Shu rolled up her sleeves. \u201cWell, if you\u2019re going to spread rumors, I\u2019ll certainly help you. It will be more persuasive when you have some \u2018evidence\u2019 on you, won\u2019t it? So I\u2019m going to offer you some evidence now. Don\u2019t thank me so much. I just can\u2019t stop helping others.\u201d\u2026 What?Bai Yanran retreated subconsciously. Her little maid had already been frightened with cold feet. She didn\u2019t dare to breathe now. She\u2019d told the Miss that they shouldn\u2019t come here.\u201cNo, don\u2019t come over\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, it will only take a little while.\u201d\u201cZhi Po, if you dare hurt me, my father will not let you off,\u201d Bai Yanran shouted with a broken voice, expecting that Ming Shu would hesitate to disrespect Lord Bai. Right now she really felt terrified of this woman in front of her.Ming Shu curled her lips.Then Hui Xue and Liu Feng witnessed a cruel one-sided assault.Hui Xue even found it a bit unbearable to watch. The Miss had become more violent compared to before. She didn\u2019t show any mercy to women now\u2026Meanwhile, Liu Feng\u2019s expression remained unchanged. He even wanted to join in.\u2026After Bai Yanran was fiercely beaten by Ming Shu, the Harmony System immediately sounded with a pop-up message, showing that the Hatred Points had all been gathered.Ming Shu pondered quietly for a while. The Harmony System didn\u2019t know what she was pondering, but it was certainly not something good.Now the last mission was to collect full Hatred Points from the fake female protagonist.But the question is\u2026 Where\u2019s Xiao Rufeng? Since no one knows where she is, how should I obtain Hatred Points?So\u2026She\u2019d better take time to eat some food.A few days later, Ming Shu heard that Feng Cheng took Xiao Rufei away from Xiling City to seek medical treatment. Without Xiao Rufeng, although they still made slow progress, things were finally going smoothly.Maybe I should go irritate Feng Cheng and complete an additional task , Ming Shu couldn\u2019t help thinking.However, before she had time to put the idea in practice, Ming Shu was overwhelmed by public opinion from the entire city.It was Bai Yanran\u2019s revenge.Not knowing how, Bai Yanran successfully incited those people, who had offended her before, to uniformly accuse Ming Shu of being ungrateful and indifferent. They said Ming Shu had no benevolence as a doctor. Someone like this was absolute scum, the dregs of society, and she wasn\u2019t worthy of being the master of Death Valley, and many more similar discussions.In short, right now, everyone in the city believed that she deserved death.But Ming Shu wasn\u2019t affected at all. She even enjoyed this bustling scene just like everybody else. But Hui Xue couldn\u2019t be more angry and anxious. She couldn\u2019t wait to go out and fight with those people for 300 rounds.\u201cMiss, something went wrong.\u201d One day, a few days later, Hui Xue came to the door hurriedly. A \u201cthing\u201d was following after her like a small tail, making its way through, bouncing as it went. Ming Shu looked at it and it immediately rolled to hide behind the door.Hui Xue didn\u2019t seem to notice she had brought something back. She promptly reported, \u201cMiss, some disciples of Death Valley mutinied.\u201d\u201cBai Yanran is so influential?\u201d She has the power to instigate the Death Valley disciples? I underestimated her!\u201cSome disciples were incited to expel you from Death Valley.\u201d Hui Xue was too angry. \u201cWhen Old Master was alive, some people had already displayed restlessness. This time you left the Valley immediately after inheriting the master\u2019s position, which may have given those people an opportunity.\u201dIn the final analysis, it was because the Miss hadn\u2019t set a solid foundation of prestige.Most people in Death Valley still remained unconvinced by the Miss\u2019s abilities, and the Miss didn\u2019t let them get to know her in time.\u201cMiss, shall we go back to the Valley?\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cObviously to clean house!\u201d These traitors, the Death Valley wouldn\u2019t tolerate them. The Miss was the only owner of Death Valley.\u201cClean house and deliver ourselves into their hands?\u201d Since they dared to rebel, they must have prepared nets waiting to catch them.\u201c\u2026\u201d This seems quite reasonable.\u201cDo you really think Bai Yanran has such great power?\u201d Disciples in Death Valley always appeared and disappeared mysteriously, and it was not easy for common people to meet them, let alone egg them to rebellion.If Bai Yanran\u2019s worrying IQ could come up with such a great idea, she wouldn\u2019t have been a supporting role.\u201cMiss, you mean\u2026\u201d There\u2019s someone behind this?Ming Shu smiled. She didn\u2019t know if there was anyone behind it, but she knew that it was going to be fun\u2026I just can\u2019t help looking forward to it.\u2026During the period of Death Valley\u2019s internal strife, many people chose to side with the rebels. Ming Shu was denounced by the united people, and they asked her to get out of Xiling.Outside her house, people gathered together to shout slogans all day long. They tirelessly repeated the same sentence, broadcasting the same 3D show excitedly.\u201cThese people are so boring. Why can\u2019t they change to a new sentence?\u201d Ming Shu couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.Beside Ming Shu\u2019s hand lay a colorful little beastie. It was the same size as a little puppy, and also looked like a dog. Its short tails were wagging restlessly and the eyes were so watery. Anyone who saw this adorable little beastie would want to touch and pet it.Its furry little paws were fiddling with the colorful egg, the surface of which had lost its previous luster and become dark.Hui Xue stood beside it and was eager to touch it, but this little beastie was not kind at all. It didn\u2019t allow anyone to touch, even the Miss was no exception.She didn\u2019t know where the little beastie came from. It just suddenly followed Miss in one morning. But Hui Xue found that the color of this little beastie was the same as the dark colorful egg. And ever since it appeared, the egg ceased to move.Hui Xue thus suspected it was a divine beast coming out of the colorful egg.But the classification was still unknown\u2026Ming Shu was totally impatient and tired of the shouting outside. She unhappily took a look at the little beastie, who was interestedly playing with the egg.Sensing the gaze from Ming Shu, the little beastie stopped and stared back.What are you looking at?Ming Shu reached out and tried to catch the little beastie. But before she got any closer, the hair on the little beastie suddenly rose, a deep roar emerging from its throat.Pa . Ming Shu pushed it ruthlessly. The little beastie was too small and it dropped down into the grass with the egg in its arms. The grass engulfed its entire body.But it jumped out of the grass immediately, arguing. Although it was only some strange mumbling, Ming Shu understood its meaning.You hit me again!Its small arms and legs were so cute.Ming Shu harrumphed. She rolled up her sleeves, getting ready to play fight.Just as her sleeves were rolled up, a breeze blew past her. Then a familiarly strange scent floated before her nose.Liked it?

Additionally, he held a new folding fan and was waving it like a graceful beauty.\u201cDidn\u2019t I beat you fiercely enough last time?\u201d Ming Shu offered a standard smile. \u201cWould you like to have a luxury package?\u201d\u201cMiss Zhi Po\u2026\u201d Qing Chen took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m not here to fight.\u201dQing Chen\u2019s eyes fell on the little beastie, who was struggling to climb out of the grass. He narrowed his eyes a little. This is what came out of the egg of the divine beast? It looks so\u2026 fashionable.\u201cNot here to fight, then what are you doing here?\u201d You want to take my snack again?Qing Chen turned his gaze back and curled the corner of his mouth up into a beautiful arc. \u201cMiss Zhi Po is now in trouble. I simply came to solve the trouble for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Ming Shu looked at Qing Chen like she was staring at a freak. \u201cHas your brain been squeezed by the door? Or has it been eaten by an insect?\u201dDon\u2019t think that you have a deceitful face and you can casually make up stories.I\u2019m not a fool!Qing Chen went crazy inside and said with difficulty, \u201cMiss Zhi Po, I\u2019ll help you solve this problem. You just need to help cure my disease. You won\u2019t lose anything.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather let you die.\u201d I\u2019m not going to do such charity .\u201c\u2026\u201d Can I kill her?Who told me that this task was going to be very easy with this beautiful face?Bullsh*t!Ming Shu turned around and got ready to go outside. Behind her, the fluffy little beastie pushed its egg forward to keep up with Ming Shu.Qing Chen couldn\u2019t help putting his foot out, blocking its way.The colorful hair all over the little beastie\u2019s body suddenly went up. It swelled like a hedgehog and stared wrathfully at the long leg in front of it. Its small claws clenched the egg tightly as if someone would try to take it away.Qing Chen was thinking that this little beastie was interesting, then he heard the faint sound of Ming Shu passing over.\u201cI advise you not to provoke it.\u201d Even I couldn\u2019t touch it at will, this fool would dare to place his foot so casually.\u201cThis is what came out of the divine egg?\u201d Qing Chen didn\u2019t take back his foot, blocking the little beastie\u2019s way, and he asked curiously, \u201cWhat kind of divine beast is it?\u201dHe only knew that it was a divine beast egg, not what kind it was.Now this little beastie came out of the egg\u2026 He had never seen the same kind before.\u201cYou ask it.\u201d How should I know?Ming Shu smiled a bit weirdly, and it seemed there was some expectation in her eyes. What was she expecting?Qing Chen thought confusedly and he subconsciously took back his foot.At almost the moment he withdrew his foot, he saw the woman show a regretful expression.Sure enough, it was a trap\u2026Fortunately I realized it.The little beastie spared a glance for Qing Chen, then flattened its fur. It continued to push the egg and followed Ming Shu groggily, like a colorful Tangyuan rolling on the ground.Qing Chen stared at the little beastie following Ming Shu out of the yard. Soon there were groans and loud cries coming from outside one after the other.Qing Chen lifted his flowery skirt and walked out of the yard.The scene outside was very unsightly.The woman, dressed in her fiery robe, was sweeping across the battlefield with a broom. That inconspicuous broom, at this time, was like a powerful weapon in her hand. These people mourned continuously and didn\u2019t have any opportunity to fight back. They were all defeated by a common broom.What the hell? Was the broom some kind of legendary weapon?Qing Chen hugged his arm. Although his heart was surging, he had to paste a charming smile on his face and pretend to be very interested.My face is stiff.This is the first time I find acting so hard.Why did I come to suffer like this?Ming Shu twirled the broom in the air in a showy manner and stamped it on the ground. She then breathed a sigh of relief and smiled. \u201cTomorrow, if you dare come here and shout slogans to disturb me, I promise you will experience better service than this. If you are brave, just attack me altogether. Your death will be your own responsibility.\u201dThe crowd stared at the \u201cbroom woman\u201d Ming Shu with hands covering on their chests.The atmosphere calmed down strangely.Someone suddenly yelled in a loud voice, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d The people on the ground climbed up one after another and left supporting each other.Qing Chen hugged his chest and walked down the steps, meeting Ming Shu\u2019s eyes. \u201cMiss Zhi Po just let them go so easily?\u201d\u201cOr what? Do I need to heal them?\u201d Ming Shu dropped the broom and clapped her hands. \u201cMy treatment is very expensive. Common people can\u2019t afford it.\u201d\u201cHow expensive? Maybe I can afford it.\u201dMing Shu grinned and said, \u201cLife.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHealing someone to death.This principle was very impressive to Qing Chen.\u2026Since Ming Shu had beaten away those who were shouting outside her house, more and more people began to come to her. The beaten ones didn\u2019t shed any blood at the time, but a few days later, they would be unable to move. They felt powerless and their limbs became too heavy to lift. It seemed no one could cure them.\u201cMaster, that woman is very wicked. None of those she beat were spared, even Death Valley could do nothing about the symptoms.\u201dQing Chen was lying in a rocking chair, swaying casually. \u201cThe Death Valley people came out?\u201d\u201cShe hasn\u2019t gone back. Death Valley\u2019s people couldn\u2019t sit still. They must come out.\u201d The guard paused. \u201cMaster, perhaps we could try someone else? Other people in Death Valley have good medical skills. Maybe\u2026\u201dQing Chen opened his folding fan neatly, covering half of his face and furrowing his eyebrows slightly. \u201cNo, I only want her to treat me.\u201d\u201cMaster, you wouldn\u2019t be\u2026 taking a fancy to her?\u201d That woman was conceited and arrogant. Besides her identity as the master of Death Valley and her good-looking face, what else could attract the master so strongly?\u201cPfft.\u201d Who would like that madwoman.The guard looked at Qing Chen, surprised.Qing Chen quickly used the folding fan to cover his face in a sort of disguise. \u201cI have my own plans. Don\u2019t ask, just go.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Yes, Master.\u201d The guard left, glancing back from time to time.Why did he have a feeling that the master was acting a little strange recently.Did the master really like that woman?The guard shuddered. How terrible.\u2026At night, Ming Shu was feeling hungry and couldn\u2019t fall asleep.The little beastie fell asleep with the egg in its arms next to her. Ming Shu slapped it suddenly, and the little beastie woke up with a start. It was so angry it bared its teeth at Ming Shu fiercely.What are you doing!Why did you hit me again!If I don\u2019t grow taller in the future, it\u2019s all your fault.Ming Shu looked at it calmly. The little beastie groaned and moaned from deep in its throat. Meanwhile, it moved aside with the egg to make room for Ming Shu.\u201cCan\u2019t speak now? You are evolving in reverse?\u201d Ming Shu showed a contemptuous face.The little beastie bared its teeth at Ming Shu again, protesting fiercely.\u201cIt\u2019s useless to show your teeth. You can\u2019t speak now, can you?\u201d It dared to treat me like this! Hoh! Little beastie.\u201c\u2026\u201d Humph, just wait for it, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!After bullying the little beastie, Ming Shu smiled and got out of bed to look for food. On the way, she saw Liu Feng standing in the dark like a pillar.He didn\u2019t seem to need any sleep. Ming Shu had never seen him sleep, anyway. Even if she got up in the middle of the night, Liu Feng would appear beside her. He could be awarded the title of Guard of the Year.After Ming Shu finished eating, Liu Feng disappeared. She was wondering why when she heard a muffled sound not far away, like a heavy object falling to the ground.Liked it?

He just had a finger in every pie.At this time, Qing Chen was standing in front of several \u201ccorpses.\u201d The moonlight sprinkled his face, lending a silvery halo to his outline. He looked like a night elf, and was even more fascinating and intriguing.But Ming Shu felt that kind of strange pure breath again.In a brief moment of stillness, that feeling disappeared without a trace. There was only the seductive procurer standing before her eyes. The procurer smiled and said in an intoxicating voice, \u201cMiss Zhi Po, you are too careless. Look, so many people have sneaked into the house and you didn\u2019t know.\u201dMing Shu looked beyond the \u201ccorpses.\u201d\u201dWhere\u2019s Liu Feng?\u201d\u201cI let him rest for a while.\u201d Qing Chen dragged his long dress and walked to stand in front of Ming Shu. He leaned forward slightly, and the strange scent gradually became stronger. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, the moonlight is very good tonight. It\u2019s perfect for healing, what do you think?\u201dWTF? Psychopath!What does good moonlight have to do with healing?Ming Shu relaxed her wrists and, in the anticipatory eyes of Qing Chen, she put on a light smile. \u201cI think it\u2019s more suitable for beating you.\u201d The next second, she clutched Qing Chen\u2019s collar and maneuvered him into a neat overarm throw. Then Qing Chen was flung to land together with several dead bodies.Qing Chen lay on the corpses helplessly.Is she a woman?Is she even a woman!Do you think that Qing Chen will give up like this?No!He was a persistent person, and he wouldn\u2019t give up until Ming Shu agreed to treat him.But Qing Chen was also a smart person. He always appeared at the right time and would never annoy Ming Shu, sometimes he even gave Ming Shu a hand. However, Ming Shu didn\u2019t buy his \u201ckindness.\u201d Every time he would be either thrown out or driven out, which made the entire Drunken Flower Pavilion lose fac.Qing Chen almost became skeptical about life.\u2026May 9th.The emperor\u2019s birthday. Many big shots were invited to attend the celebration.Somehow Ming Shu also received an invitation. After her \u201cfierce\u201d temper was revealed to the public, for this period, apart from Qing Chen who still dared to harass her brazenly, the rest had all kept silent.Even those rebellious disciples of Death Valley didn\u2019t show up.Actually, these people of Death Valley shouldn\u2019t be blamed. Usually when someone was betrayed, they would be very angry and anxious, but this didn\u2019t seem to apply to Ming Shu. She didn\u2019t respond with any ferocity to the whole thing, and her behavior basically said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay if you want to rebel, just don\u2019t bother my eating.\u201dThis totally confused the rebels from Death Valley, and they didn\u2019t dare to take any action.\u201cMiss, are we really going inside?\u201d Hui Xue was a little hesitant as she gazed at the majestic palace gates.Ming Shu ignored the little beastie\u2019s resistance and put it inside her sleeve with the egg. \u201cWe\u2019ve arrived at the doorway. If we leave now, we\u2019ll be laughed at by them.\u201d It might be fun.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Hui Xue tried to persuade Ming Shu. \u201cHey, Miss, wait for me.\u201dMing Shu entered the palace with the invitation.Before walking too many steps, Ming Shu was blocked by Bai Yanran. Her face had recovered and a Death Valley disciple stood beside her. Seeing Ming Shu, the disciple\u2019s head bowed with guilt.\u201cYi Ming, you\u2026\u201d Hui Xue pointed at the disciple disbelievingly.Bai Yanran proudly held her head high. \u201cZhi Po, have you slept well lately? Well, it would be a good thing if you hand over Death Valley, so you won\u2019t have to suffer anymore.\u201dMing Shu smiled at her meaningfully.After a few seconds\u2026\u201cAh!\u201dBai Yanran\u2019s screams drew everyone\u2019s attention.Ming Shu waved her hand unhurriedly and said, \u201cShe\u2019s in my way.\u201dBai Yanran fell to the ground awkwardly, drawing all kinds of gazes from different directions. For Bai Yanran, these stares were like raging flames, burning her heart.She looked at Ming Shu with a dark face, hatred surging within. Bai Yanran couldn\u2019t understand. Obviously the woman standing before her eyes was the one who\u2019d been scolded by the whole continent, and she should be despairing and crying all day long. But why did she still look so natural and unrestrained?\u201cShe is that Zhi Po? Why is she here in the palace? Death Valley is now a mess, but she doesn\u2019t seem to be anxious. It\u2019s really a pity that Death Valley has been passed onto her. Even its reputation will be destroyed.\u201d Some people began to talk about Ming Shu with each other.\u201cWell, she could do nothing about it\u2026?\u201d\u201cBut she is very powerful. Even that many people didn\u2019t best her.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of being powerful? After so long, when did she show her medical skills? What is Death Valley? It\u2019s a place famous for healing. No matter how powerful she is, it\u2019s useless if she can\u2019t heal anyone.\u201d\u201cRight\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you discussing?\u201d\u201cWhat else could we be discussing, it\u2019s that Death Valley\u2026\u201d The voice of the answering person cut off abruptly, and his heart beat fast. He turned his head carefully. His face suddenly twisted and he stuttered, \u201cMa\u2026 Master Qing Chen.\u201dHow\u2014how how how is he here!All the voices seemed to disappear at the same time. Qing Chen casually walked past them, each step seeming to take a century.As Qing Chen approached the scene of the \u201caccident,\u201d another \u201caccident\u201d suddenly occurred.Shua!Bai Yanran bounced up from the ground and a cold light flashed in her hand. A whip inlaid with sharp barbs appeared out of nowhere, making a crisp sound as it cut the air.Bai Yanran\u2019s gaze was full of hatred. She cracked the whip toward Ming Shu fiercely.Ming Shu shook her finger in the air to stop Liu Feng.She then turned to avoid the whip. Bai Yanran had poured so much Qi into the whip, the air seemed to become tight and awful because of it.Kill her.I\u2019m going to kill her.Bai Yanran waved the whip quickly and poured more and more Qi into it. The long whip dropped from above, leaving Ming Shu nowhere to hide.It seemed the whip would fall on Ming Shu any minute, but Ming Shu grasped its other end with her bare hands, pulling in a rush. The whip tightened.Blood rushed out of Ming Shu\u2019s palms, but she still maintained a light smile. Then with one fierce tug, Bai Yanran staggered and was pulled down to the ground.Ming Shu drew the whip to circle around Bai Yanran and tied her up easily.Bai Yanran struggled, but the barbs plunged deeply into her body, causing her no small amount of suffering. She screamed, \u201cZhi Po, you bitch, let me go!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Ming Shu picked her ears as if she didn\u2019t hear the words clearly.\u201cBitch! Let go of me. I am the young Miss of the Bai family. How dare you do this to me. I\u2019ll let you die. Are you deaf? Save me!\u201d The last sentence was shouted to Yi Ming.Yi Ming wanted to help, but he was scared of Ming Shu and Liu Feng, so he remained motionless.\u201cI don\u2019t care who you are. Even if you\u2019re a goddess, I\u2019ll teach you a lesson today.\u201d I\u2019m not the kind of person who will be kind to women.Bai Yanran\u2019s voice was altered because of the pain. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d\u201cYes, I dare.\u201d Ming Shu smiled happily and pressed hard with her hand. The whip wrapped tighter, such that Bai Yanran couldn\u2019t speak due to great pain.I wasn\u2019t responding to you, so you assumed I\u2019m easy to bully?\u201cZhi Po, stop it!\u201d Father Bai arrived with many followers, and the surrounding people made way for them one after another. His expression was both tense and angry. \u201cRelease Yanran.\u201d\u201cWhy should I listen to you?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d As Yanran was in Ming Shu\u2019s hands, Father Bai didn\u2019t dare to provoke her even though he was furious.Liked it?

And everyone\u2019s scalp tingled with Bai Yanran\u2019s screams.Lord Bai was beyond angry; he ordered his people to stop Ming Shu. But apparently Liu Feng and Hui Xue wouldn\u2019t watch their Miss be besieged, so they joined the battle to help Ming Shu. The scene became very confusing.\u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201d\u201cWhen did I hit you?\u201d\u201cFuck! You won\u2019t admit it, but I saw it with my own eyes.\u201d\u201cAre you blind?\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck did you say? Who\u2019s blind? Asshole, beat him!\u201dThe melee spread to the surrounding crowd, and eventually it evolved into a huge free-for-all.Qing Chen stood outside the chaotic crowd and sighed.In his lifetime, he would never have any chance to save the girl like a hero.Just watch the show quietly! After Bai Yanran was rescued, the melee also stopped. Those people stood in a row, confronting Ming Shu.Ming Shu slowly patted the folds of her clothes into place, feeling hungry.Too much energy has been wasted, I need to eat some food to replenish it.\u201cWhen I heard that someone is fighting at the gates of the palace I didn\u2019t believe it. Now it seems to be true. You are all so energetic.\u201d A young man who was somewhat like Feng Cheng in appearance came in their direction, surrounded by many people.Compared to Feng Cheng\u2019s indifference and abstinence, this man appeared to be treacherous. At first sight, you could tell he was born to be a villain.\u201cLord Four.\u201d\u201cLord Four.\u201dLord Four nodded and stepped to the middle with his hands clasped behind his back. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here? This is the entrance to the palace. How dare you fight here?\u201dLord Four\u2019s face darkened as he finished the last sentence, and he looked very unhappy. \u201cYou all came to celebrate the birthday of Father today. But I see you are causing trouble.\u201d\u201cLord Four, it was not us, it\u2019s she who started this.\u201d Causing trouble in this forbidden zone was a serious crime, so someone passed the buck to Ming Shu immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s all her fault.\u201dLord Bai also stood up. In neither a respectful nor offensive manner, he said, \u201cLord Four, this was begun by Zhi Po. She threatened the life of my daughter and made rude remarks. I had no choice but to fight.\u201dBai Yanran was supported by several people off to the side, her condition extremely weak. She tried to speak, but she didn\u2019t have the strength to even open her mouth; she could only offer a heavy nod to agree with what Lord Bai had said.And many people behind them echoed Lord Bai\u2019s words as well.It\u2019s her.It\u2019s her.Our poor scapegoat Ming Shu.\u201c\u2026\u201d These little goblins are not only blind in their eyes but also blind in their hearts. They are blind in everything!After listening to all the accusations, Lord Four let his sharp eyes fall on Ming Shu. He squinted and kept silent for a long while before speaking. \u201cAre you the master of Death Valley, Miss Zhi Po?\u201dMing Shu offered a smile and said, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d She\u2019s lying through her teeth!\u201cWhy did you start a disturbance at the palace gates, Miss Zhi Po?\u201d Everyone knew she was the new master of Death Valley, so Lord Four just ignored Ming Shu\u2019s denial and cut to the chase.\u201cWhat did I do?!\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s bright and beautiful face was full of innocence, and she stated with smiling eyes, \u201cWhich of your eyes have seen me creating the disturbance? Don\u2019t talk wildly! I was just beating a person. How could I have known all that\u2019s wrong with them, they just joined the fight all of a sudden. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201dI was fighting on my own, but these people had to join in and battle chaotically. What else could I do?Our Guest seemed to be so proud of beating others\u2026Lord Four was a little speechless as well. The master of Death Valley seemed to be a bit different from normal people.\u201cIf you had not beaten Yanran first, would we fight with you? Lord Four, don\u2019t listen to her nonsense. She was holding my daughter hostage first and then hit her. Now she\u2019s trying to shirk responsibility!\u201d Lord Bai shouted angrily.\u201cThen why did you beat Miss Bai, Miss Zhi Po?\u201d\u201cShe blocked my way.\u201d What\u2019s wrong with hitting a punching bag?\u201c\u2026\u201dI really don\u2019t know how to continue this conversation now . Lord Four gave up.Awkwardness spread in the air, and time seemed to have frozen.Ming Shu suddenly swept her eyes over Lord Four, and she paused for a moment on his waist. The words she then spoke shocked everyone: \u201cWas it you who urged Death Valley to rebel?\u201dLord Four\u2019s back was tense and his hands inside his sleeves slowly tightened.\u201cMiss?\u201d Hui Xue was also surprised. The Miss almost didn\u2019t seem to care about the rebellion of the Valley. Why was she now saying so definitively that Lord Four was the person behind the insurrection?\u201cI was joking.\u201dHui Xue\u2019s mouth twitched. Lord Four faked a smile and said, \u201cMiss Zhi Po, this joke is not funny at all.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Ming Shu continued, \u201cNow I\u2019m sure. Lord Four, why did you incite Death Valley\u2019s people to rebel?\u201dShe was assured in her tone.Lord Four\u2019s mood fluctuated a lot with Ming Shu\u2019s every sentence. Unconsciously, cold sweat had spread all over his body. But he soon calmed down. She\u2019s nothing but a chit of a girl, there\u2019s no need to worry about her.\u201cMiss Zhi Po, mind your irresponsible remarks. You said I incited your people, do you have any evidence? If you don\u2019t have any evidence and just slander me, you will be punished for disrespecting a royal family member.\u201d Lord Four\u2019s tone became tougher and his eyes sharper.People around them were all scared into silence, not even daring to breathe.This Zhi Po just started a big fight, now she\u2019s offending Lord Four. How daring is she?Ming Shu let out a deep chuckle and answered firmly, \u201cI have no evidence, but it is you.\u201dEven if there was evidence she would be too lazy to explain. It would waste her energy. The waste of energy is a waste of time, and the latter means a waste of life.Lord Four intentionally or unintentionally glanced at Yi Ming next to him. Yi Ming trembled and shook his head. He didn\u2019t reveal anything.The interaction between the two was hidden. But Ming Shu was holding her chest and staring at Yi Ming. Under Ming Shu\u2019s smiling eyes, Yi Ming felt like he\u2019d been caught in bed with Lord Four. Cold sweat suddenly dripped down his back, and with a shifting gaze, Yi Ming didn\u2019t dare to look at Ming Shu.\u201cHmph, Miss Zhi Po, how can you make up such stories so easily? Aren\u2019t you afraid we\u2019ll laugh our teeth off?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t laugh your teeth off, since you\u2019ll be losing all your teeth in just a moment,\u201d Ming Shu said softly. Her voice was like the spring breeze in March blowing past people\u2019s cheeks; it was so gentle that everyone almost neglected what she was saying.But what she said\u2026Was really not something that could be neglected.But what does that mean?Lord Four didn\u2019t understand, and no one else present did, either.\u201cWhat she meant was that your teeth will be beaten off.\u201d A joyful voice suddenly echoed down to them from above.Everyone was attracted to this voice. They looked up simultaneously to see a flowery \u201cbutterfly\u201d sitting on the stone lion at the palace gates. With his fair collarbones exposed to the air through slightly opened clothes, the man assumed a seductive posture, raising one of his hands to block the sun like a delicate girl. His thin and light pink lips were shining with a charming hint of gloss, alluring to anyone who saw him.The red walls and green tiles behind him lost their color; the entire world was left with only that figure in bright color. Just a glimpse of him would capture anyone\u2019s heart.It\u2019s him again!He always shows up in such eye-catching ways, each and every time. Does he really think he\u2019s selling his body?A person who snatched her snacks, Ming Shu always disliked.No, she hated such a person.She was just so tired of these psychopaths in each world.The only good news was that this one was not a crazy wooer.This fool had a clear goal\u2014to treat his disease.But he was just daydreaming. She would never waste time curing someone. If she had any time, it was better to eat a few more snacks so she would be stronger when fighting.Okay, that\u2019s enough. I\u2019ll just drop these boring thoughts and give him a beating first.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The surrounding people stepped back one after another like a group of frightened little beasts and made room for the battle.Ming Shu pressed down with the sword, producing even more dazzling sparks against the barrier.Lord Four felt the sword was bearing on him with incredible weight. It seemed if he was distracted for just one second, the barrier of Qi would be broken and the heavy sword would cut him in two.How was this woman\u2019s strength so great?Stranger still was that he could not see through her strength.Shua\u2014Boom!Lord Four had to take out his own weapon to fight with Ming Shu. His weapon was a first-rate spirit weapon, while Ming Shu was holding an ordinary sword in her hand. However, she was not taking the backseat in this battle.Clank\u2014The sword and Lord Four\u2019s weapon collided with each other, making a harsh and sharp noise.Ming Shu dragged the sword in a backward sweep. Somehow Lord Four felt a strong vibration against his wrist, then he lost his weapon. Lord Four was shocked; it was too late to condense Qi. All he could do was block the sword with his bare hands, then his entire body was thrown by the inertia.The sword was just an ordinary sword. But in the eyes of the viewers, the sword seemed to shine with a layer of light, very powerful.Even the owner of the sword was confused and shocked. Was this really his sword?Ming Shu took control of Lord Four with lightning speed and put him on the ground. \u201cYou better not move, my sword doesn\u2019t have eyes; I presume you don\u2019t want to see it cut your lord by accident.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s words successfully froze the onlookers on the spot.She flipped her bangs chicly, bent down, and clasped her knee with one hand. The posture was so domineering, like a bandit swaggering into a village. Her clean face was reflected in Lord Four\u2019s pupil. She patted his face with the sword. \u201cIs it you who egged on the disciples of Death Valley to rebellion?\u201dLord Four was completely unable to move, and he couldn\u2019t find a way to fight back with spirit force.\u201cNo,\u201d Lord Four denied. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, you\u2019re attacking a royal family member. Are you declaring war against our royal family?\u201dMing Shu showed a deeper smile.What are you talking about, idiot, Ming Shu grunted in her heart.Lord Four had a scalp-tingling feeling, which made him recall many years ago when he was kept in the dark by his father for making mistakes. It seemed the darkness was going to breed some terrible monster to devour him.What does this woman want to do\u2026 Lord Four felt a little anxious.But soon, Lord Four, as well as the onlookers, knew what Ming Shu was going to do.It was not enough for her to beat Bai Yanran, she also wanted to beat Lord Four.\u201cWas it you who urged Death Valley to rebel?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dMing Shu asked again after beating him for a while, and when she got the same denial, she continued the cycle.When had Lord Four been tortured so fiercely? Never! Even in front of Feng Cheng, he was never in such an embarrassing situation.\u201cLiu Feng\u2026 Are we going to be beaten if we stop the Miss right now?\u201d Hui Xue clasped her hands together and asked Liu Feng with difficulty. The latter was standing stiffly next to her, like a sculpture.Wearing an expressionless face, Liu Feng answered, \u201cYes.\u201dHui Xue wanted to cry. Weren\u2019t they saying to come to the banquet? Why had the Miss already beaten two people before the banquet started? She could understand why Bai Yanran was beaten\u2014she deserved it!But this Lord Four\u2026The Miss said he had incited the Death Valley disciples to rebel. Did she have any evidence? If not, beating him like that would definitely get them hunted down and killed!Lord Four didn\u2019t want to admit it.But he was afraid that he would be beaten to death like this.And outrageous as it was, none of his people came forward to rescue him.\u201cArrest her!\u201d Lord Four hoarsely yelled at his guards. \u201cAre you dead?\u201dThese idiots, he was beaten like this, but they still stood there. What was the use of them!Lord Four\u2019s shouting seemed to finally wake everyone up. They took out weapons and walked toward Ming Shu.Hui Xue and Liu Feng also joined the battle, and the melee that\u2019d subsided just now resumed.Ming Shu seemed to have endless strength, plus her speed was so great, no one could do anything to her. A circle of people was beaten down, then another circle of people came forward, but no one defeated her.Eh\u2026 so hungry.I\u2019m done.Ming Shu pulled Lord Four, who hadn\u2019t had time to escape from the battleground, back toward her. She placed the cold sword against his neck. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201dLord Four turned back in horror with an extremely disbelieving face. She had clearly been blocked on the other side just now, why had she suddenly appeared next to him?W-H-Y!\u201cCome, Lord Four, I need your cooperation.\u201dCooperation with what?Lord Four looked at the sword on his neck and then struggled about, trying to resist. But Ming Shu could easily hold him back.At this point, Lord Four was facing the smiling face of the woman before him, but he only felt her sneer.Lord Four had to cooperate with Ming Shu to save his own life.\u201cHey.\u201d Ming Shu held Lord Four and shouted at the crowd in the distance, \u201cStop, or I will show you the acrobatics of splitting head and body.\u201dSplitting head and body?Isn\u2019t that\u2026WTF?The people were forced to stop to look at Ming Shu weirdly.Liu Feng and Hui Xue quickly returned to Ming Shu, standing separately to her left and right.The scene now resembled a wedding ceremony that had been interrupted. The groom had been smatched by the \u201crobber,\u201d and the atmosphere became inexplicably awkward.Even the procurer had shifted to a more comfortable position, waiting to see the next big show.Ming Shu forced Lord Four to sit down, making it easier to turn around. Then she faced Liu Feng and said, \u201cLiu Feng, go buy some food for me.\u201dLiu Feng\u2019s weapon trembled a bit in his hand. Did he just hear wrongly?Hui Xue was now wearing a desperate expression. You didn\u2019t hear wrongly. The Miss just told you to buy some food.Everyone was shocked.What was this situation?Weren\u2019t they in a fight? Why was she going to eat?Did she even have any fighting spirit?She ought to respect them!Lord Four was held by Ming Shu. Everyone else was in dead silence, not even daring to breathe freely. All they could do was complain in secret.Of course Liu Feng wouldn\u2019t disobey Ming Shu\u2019s orders, and soon he brought a bunch of food back. If not for present circumstances, he could even roast a whole pig or sheep on the spot.Surrounded by a circle of people, Ming Shu was still able to eat calmly and elegantly. The audience was totally attracted to her great appetite, and they just couldn\u2019t wait to join her.The tempting smell of meat was floating around the battlefield.This was probably the weirdest thing they had experienced this year.Liked it?

His heart was falling apart like a mountain collapsing, the broken pieces hitting him on the brain. \u201cI\u2014I\u2026 I don\u2019t understand\u2026 what\u2026\u201dLord Four\u2019s hands were tied back, and his forehead was covered with cold sweat.\u201cWas it you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lord Four breathed heavily with a pale face. \u201cYou\u2014you want\u2014you want to beat me to admit it?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t even present any evidence, but she insisted that he did it. Lord Four felt both wronged and angry. No one had dared to treat him like this before!Ming Shu turned him over and stepped on his chest. She used the sword to cut his clothes open and pointed at some trace on his waist. \u201cIt\u2019s Fuluo flower, and only Lord Four\u2019s mansion has this kind of flower in the whole of Xiling.\u201dLord Four glanced at his waist. He didn\u2019t remember when and how it had been stained with the pollen. But\u2026 \u201cSo what?\u201dMing Shu turned to Yi Ming. \u201cCoincidentally, the same pollen also appeared on his body.\u201dLord Four subconsciously looked over to Yi Ming. Yi Ming was looking down at himself and found Fuluo flower pollen in his sleeve. His face became pale.Fuluo flower was a kind of very delicate flower, which was transported from exotic lands thousands of miles away from Xiling. This flower was hard to preserve and would die with a little carelessness. It took a lot of manpower and resources to just deliver Fuluo flowers to Xiling.Plus that Fuluo flower had no medicinal value, so even if people knew the Fuluo flower was very beautiful, few would bother to grow it.Only Lord Four loved the Fuluo flower and grew many in his mansion.Hui Xue\u2019s sharp gaze fell on Yi Ming. The latter was even more like a frightened bird. He was trembling heavily and pulled on his sleeves tightly. He didn\u2019t dare to speak.\u201cSo what? This proves nothing,\u201d Lord Four argued hoarsely. \u201cEven if he has it on his body, it can only prove that he had been to my mansion. How can you prove that I told him to do anything?\u201dMing Shu moved her eyes to Yi Ming and smiled. \u201cAs far as I know, every disciple of Death Valley will take a type of medicine when they enter the Valley. This medicine is colorless and odorless, which can strengthen the body and improve cultivation. But, at the same time\u2026\u201dYi Ming looked up with surprise, and he wondered what Ming Shu was saying.Even Hui Xue was a little confused.She didn\u2019t know about it at all\u2026Ming Shu paused for a few seconds and said, \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s highly toxic; only the master of Death Valley knows how to deal with it. The Dan medicine that Death Valley makes you take every month is the antidote. What do you think the consequence of your rebellion is?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201d It\u2019s not true, how can Death Valley give such medicine to its disciples?Yi Ming shook his head. He didn\u2019t believe it.\u201cAren\u2019t you feeling heat throughout your whole body? Your abdomen is sore and your ears are humming\u2026\u201d Ming Shu described softly and slowly.Yi Ming\u2019s face gradually became red, and he seemed to really get hot in his body. His lower abdomen was getting sore and the surrounding voices became difficult to hear. All the symptoms were the same as what Ming Shu had just said.Was it true?There were really many things in Death Valley that the ordinary disciples didn\u2019t know, and it was true that every month the Valley would give them Dan medicine to take\u2026The more Yi Ming recalled, the more scared he became. Cold sweat was streaming down his forehead, and he finally went down on his knees and confessed in tears, \u201cMaster, Hong Yan forced us, he forced us to betray you.\u201d\u201cWho is Hong Yan?\u201d Ming Shu turned to ask Hui Xue.This name was a bit familiar.But Ming Shu was too lazy to think. It was more convenient to ask Hui Xue directly.Hui Xue was pulled back from her daze. She swallowed and explained in a low voice, \u201cHong Yan was a disciple of the Valley. He arrived at the Valley together with you. He was originally the most likely person to become the new master of the Valley. But, there was a little accident. Hong Yan lost his opportunity after treating a patient without the permission of Old Master, which almost led to that person\u2019s death. Three years ago, Hong Yan caused trouble again and was driven out of the Valley by the master. At that time, you were practicing alone in the Valley, so you didn\u2019t know about it.\u201dMing Shu understood immediately.Therefore, this Hong Yan felt the Host had snatched away what he deserved, and now he wanted to take it back.There\u2019s nothing new, just out-of-date plots.\u201cSo what do you want to do?\u201dYi Ming felt he was getting more and more uncomfortable. He didn\u2019t dare lie and spilled everything he knew.Hong Yan secretly contacted Death Valley. He learned that the old master died and the new master was not present. Then Hong Yan immediately implemented his own plan. First, he persuaded some people in Death Valley to join him, and for those he couldn\u2019t convince, he tried every possible way to change their minds, including both baiting and threatening them. As long as he could have the people of Death Valley on his side, Hong Yan would use whatever method he wanted.Hong Yan had left Death Valley for three years and had now become very strange. Sometimes, they had a feeling that Hong Yan was not a normal human.After convincing the disciples, Hong Yan teamed up with Lord Four. Yi Ming was not sure what they were planning. Part of Death Valley now listened to the orders of Lord Four.He did not expect to meet Ming Shu, and Ming Shu didn\u2019t play the game according to common sense. She directly started the fight at the palace gates!What was even more unexpected was, the disciples of Death Valley were all under her control\u2026\u201cWhere is Hong Yan?\u201d Ming Shu interrupted Yi Ming\u2019s following narration.\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Yi Ming shook his head. \u201cI really don\u2019t know. Every time there is a new order, he will contact us. We act according to his instructions.\u201dMing Shu touched her chin, thinking for a while. She raised her slender brows and glanced at Lord Four.Men!All they cared about was power, women, and wealth.The present emperor was old, but he had not yet selected his heir. Everyone knew that Feng Cheng was most likely to become the heir, so it was not surprising that Lord Four may have his own plans.Hong Yan wanted Death Valley, while Lord Four wanted the emperor position. If the two joined hands\u2026Perhaps they were planning something even more ambitious.\u201cHe is the disciple of your Death Valley.\u201d Lord Four gritted his teeth and denied insistently, \u201cOf course he would say anything you want him to say. What do you want by slandering me?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything yet, what are you anxious about? Feeling guilty?\u201d Ming Shu smiled.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lord Four choked. Hatred began to well at the bottom of his heart.\u201cThe emperor is here\u2014\u201dA sharp voice sounded from the behind them and the bright yellow imperial chariot gradually approached. A tall and upright man wearing the dragon robe walked into the crowd, surrounded by many followers. He was in his fifties. On his serious face, no signs of emotion could be observed. Even seeing Lord Four beaten into a swollen bun by Ming Shu, his expression did not seem to shift. He was totally immersed in the smell of nobility.The scene suddenly seemed to be moving in slow motion.\u201cWhat are you quarreling about here?\u201d Emperor\u2019s voice was very loud, breaking the shackles of time. \u201cWhat do you think the palace is? Your playground?\u201dIt was meant to be a perfect birthday ceremony, but someone dared to start a fight at the palace gates. Everyone gathered here, while he waited inside for a long time only for nobody to arrive.The emperor\u2019s inner rage had almost accumulated to the critical point. If it were not for the good image an emperor must maintain, he might have exploded on the spot.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had been beaten to this condition, which would force the emperor to act accordingly.Before coming out, the emperor had known how it all started. The master of Death Valley was indeed a big shot, but the royal family was not so weak to be bullied casually.Just as the emperor was about to get angry, Qing Chen suddenly stood on the back of the stone lion. His height became higher than the average all at once, which successfully attracted the attention of everyone.The crowd began to hear some faint oohs and ahhs.Qing Chen could always amaze the public whenever and wherever possible.Like a kaleidoscope, he would show different kinds of beauty each time.Qing Chen was very satisfied with this and smiled. \u201cYour Majesty, I have something to report.\u201dThe emperor unhappily frowned. How was the master of Drunken Flower Pavilion also here?Just now, Qing Chen had been lying on the stone lion. The emperor only noticed Ming Shu and didn\u2019t see him at all.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The emperor asked unhurriedly.Death Valley, Drunken Flower Pavilion\u2026 neither were easy to deal with.Qing Chen\u2019s glittering eyes swept across all the people present, and his following words were clear and sweet. \u201cLord Four gathers his own soldiers in secret and intends to rebel.\u201dThe crowd went into an uproar the minute Qing Chen finished his sentence.Although the emperor didn\u2019t change expression, his eyes revealed a frightening light.The last thing an emperor would allow to happen was rebellion.\u201cQing Chen, what are you talking about?\u201d Lord Four took the lead to get angry, but he was restrained by Ming Shu and couldn\u2019t move. He could only yell at Qing Chen, \u201cI had nothing against you, why are you slandering me? Father, I\u2019m 100% loyal to the family, he\u2019s talking nonsense, don\u2019t listen to an outsider!\u201dThe emperor looked at Lord Four with a gloomy gaze, but his words were said to Qing Chen with deterrence, \u201cMaster Qing Chen, do you know what you are talking about?\u201dThis old guy dares to deter me!Qing Chen held back the urge to swear at the emperor and continued: \u201cOf course, if Your Majesty wants to see evidence, our Drunken Flower Pavilion can provide it.\u201dThe emperor gave a look to the escorts. Taking the order, the escorts immediately began to drive the crowd out.Lord Bai, with his daughter Bai Yanran still in bad condition, didn\u2019t know whether they should go or not. He meant to seek justice for Bai Yanran, but how did the situation finally develop into Lord Four\u2019s rebellion?This change was so\u2026 so fast.\u201cLord Bai and Lord Xiao, you stay.\u201d The emperor opened his mouth.Lord Bai and Lord Xiao looked at each other but then quickly moved their eyes away. Lord Bai ordered his people to take Bai Yanran back for treatment first, then he stood aside together with Lord Xiao.Soon the crowd was cleared out, leaving only a few involved parties.\u201cLord Four, do you have anything to say?\u201d The emperor looked at his fourth child, who was in quite an awkward situation now, and asked this. It was hard to discern the emperor\u2019s real emotions through his majestic voice.\u201cFather, you must believe me, I have no plans,\u201d Lord Four argued loudly.Lord Four knew very well his royal father\u2019s personality. If he couldn\u2019t make his father believe him today, he was afraid that\u2026\u201cWhat evidence do you have, Lord Qing Chen? Present it now.\u201d The emperor ignored his son and asked Qing Chen for evidence. \u201cI must remind you, Lord Qing Chen, the consequences of provoking the royal family are serious.\u201d\u201cI understand, Your Majesty.\u201d Qing Chen took out a small whistle the size of a section of bone from his clothes, blowing it. No sound came out. But soon, someone appeared out of nowhere and handed something to Qing Chen.Someone broke through the palace gates, but the escorts didn\u2019t notice at all. The emperor\u2019s whole heart sank.This Drunken Flower Pavilion had become more and more elusive.Qing Chen\u2019s Drunken Flower Pavilion, under the guise of a brothel, was actually in the business of collecting information, assassination, robbery, etc. It was no exaggeration to say that he knew very well the major forces throughout the whole continent.Qing Chen handed the evidence to the emperor. Lord Four was still held by Ming Shu. He couldn\u2019t see what Qing Chen had handed over to the emperor, so he stretched his neck to look, feeling both uneasy and angry inside.Why did Qing Chen, the she-male, also make trouble for him?\u201cGuards!\u201d the emperor suddenly roared. He looked at Lord Four with an ambiguous gaze and ordered, \u201cGo search Lord Four\u2019s mansion.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d What did Qing Chen show the emperor exactly? \u201cFather, I really am not rebelling. You must believe me, someone is making up things to slander me.\u201dThe emperor sneered and ignored Lord Four\u2019s pleas.Qing Chen covered his face with a fan, revealing only a pair of fox-like eyes, and winked at Ming Shu.Ming Shu habitually responded with a smile, glittering lights radiating out from her beautiful eyes. She looked lively and happy.However, apart from this, one couldn\u2019t tell any of her other emotions.Ming Shu took out a packet of cakes from her clothes, transferred Lord Four to Liu Feng, then walked to the side, resuming her \u201chappy time.\u201d The emperor glanced at her, seemingly dissatisfied, but remained silent. He stood alone on one side with hands clasped behind his back, looking deep into the palace gates.Compared to a person who only wanted to stop and interfere with Ming Shu, Qing Chen\u2019s way of helping was obviously more \u201cpopular\u201d with Ming Shu.The guards sent out by the emperor soon returned, bringing back a lot of things uncovered in Lord Four\u2019s mansion. There was not only a brand new dragon robe, but also a few captured subordinates. Frightened by the majestic image of the emperor, the captured ones confessed everything easily.Lord Four tried to stop them from confessing, but in the face of facts, all of his arguments and explanations seemed to pale, and finally he became so angry he fainted.\u201cOld Four, you disappoint me.\u201d The emperor shook his head, his majestic face showing a bit of pain, but it was immediately replaced by fury. \u201cGuards, take Lord Four down.\u201dThe emperor looked at Lord Bai, intentionally or unintentionally.Under the elusive gaze of the emperor, Lord Bai suddenly became nervous.He was aware that the emperor let him and Lord Xiao witness this scene today to deter them\u2026 Although the emperor was old now, he knew everything on the continent as if looking into a seeing glass.Since he could punish Lord Four without any hesitation, naturally he would find ways to deal with them, who seemed to have surpassed the royal family these past years.The guards took the order to seize Lord Four. But Liu Feng was holding Lord Four and he didn\u2019t seem to want to let him go. After confronting each other for a little while, it seemed the two sides were going to fight again. Qing Chen spoke out in time.\u201cYour Majesty, may I make a request?\u201d Qing Chen asked, but his tone was not one of asking a request.The emperor was impatient internally, but he pretended to be listening on the surface. \u201cWhat request, just say it.\u201d\u201cI hope Your Majesty will leave Hong Yan to Miss Zhi Po. The man used to be a disciple of Death Valley, and it is reasonable to let Death Valley punish him.\u201dThe guard beside the emperor whispered something in his ear.Pondering for some time, the emperor answered, \u201cThe request is granted. Once that person is arrested, he will be transferred to Death Valley. But\u2026 I hope master Qing Chen will not intervene in the royal family\u2019s affairs.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m busy, all right?\u201d Qing Chen couldn\u2019t help rolling his eyes.\u201cWhat did you say, Master Qing Chen?\u201dQing Chen immediately forced a smile. \u201cNothing, Your Majesty, please rest assured. I\u2019m not interested in the royal family\u2019s affairs.\u201d\u201cRemember what you said today.\u201dThe emperor glanced at Ming Shu, who was still eating, then he sneered and left with his guards.Liu Feng let go of Lord Four with the consent of Ming Shu. But Ming Shu came forward suddenly and knocked out one of Lord Four\u2019s front teeth in front of the remaining onlookers. She shook her fist and waved. \u201cOkay, take him away.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Your Majesty, come back! Look what this woman has done!Liu Feng\u2019s face twitched with his speechlessness. He was 100% sure that if Miss and the master of Drunken Flower Pavilion teamed up, the entire continent would not be enough for them to play with.Lord Bai and Lord Xiao had their own scheming to do and had no intention to stay, so they also left. Before he made his exit, Lord Bai gave Ming Shu a hostile and meaningful look.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since there was no more fun to watch and no reason to cause trouble, Ming Shu got ready to leave as well, her snacks in her arms.But Qing Chen appeared in front of her without any warning and that strange fragrance floated to Ming Shu\u2019s nose again.What a perfumed girlish man!Ming Shu subconsciously covered the snacks, moving back her body a little. Then she stared at the butterfly before her and asked, \u201cWhat?\u201dThis procurer showed up suddenly again. Is he planning to take my snacks?Qing Chen felt funny and helpless. \u201cYou\u2019re like the little beastie!\u201d Both were food protectors.Ming Shu had meant to refute, but she swallowed the words that came to her lips and said, \u201cIf there is nothing, just get out of my way.\u201dQing Chen moved to the side, giving way for Ming Shu. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, I did help you a lot today. You really won\u2019t think about treating my illness?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your help.\u201d She could have dealt with it herself. Who let him suddenly step forward and take the opportunity to help her strike.\u201cWhatever, I helped you, right?\u201d Qing Chen shamelessly took the credit for himself.Ming Shu glanced at him, saying nothing.Because Qing Chen was telling the truth.Ming Shu didn\u2019t like to owe people, even if it was not what she requested. The fact was he did help her.But\u2026She really didn\u2019t want to treat the butterfly that snatched her snacks.Ming Shu still didn\u2019t say anything. She continued forward with her head lowered.Qing Chen ground his teeth, resisting the urge to destroy the character setting. Then he caught up with Ming Shu immediately.\u201cMiss Zhi Po, what should I do to make you treat me?\u201d Qing Chen pulled on Ming Shu\u2019s clothes. \u201cIs it so difficult to take a look at me?\u201dHe just wanted to cure his illness.Wasn\u2019t that simple!\u201cWhat should I do to make you leave me alone? There are so many doctors in the world. Is it difficult to find another one besides me?\u201d Ming Shu pulled back her clothes.Qing Chen pulled on them again. \u201cBut only you can cure my sickness.\u201dMing Shu pulled back. \u201cWhat sickness?\u201d\u201cLovesickness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dQing Chen blurted out the sentence, and after a while he was aware of something strange. But the word had been spoken. He could only force a smile and pretend to make a calming stance. \u201cSo it can only be cured by you, Miss Zhi Po.\u201dRight! If I let her fall in love with me, I wouldn\u2019t worry that she will not cure me!Great! I\u2019m really a genius!\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go back and wait for death?\u201d Ming Shu became impatient, getting ready to leave.Screw your lovesickness!I see he is having death sickness.\u201c\u2026\u201dGod, couldn\u2019t I just force this girl to treat me?Qing Chen calmed his temper and revealed a trademark smile. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, are you really going to show me such ungratefulness?\u201dUn! Grate! Ful! Ness!Ming Shu really wanted to slap his face, let him know what ungratefulness truly was.Persuading herself, Ming Shu shoved two cakes into her mouth and said, \u201cFine, I can cure you. But after you are cured, promise me that you will not appear in front of me ever again. For the rest of your life.\u201d\u201cDeal.\u201d Qing Chen raised his smiling face and agreed.You think I want to see you?If it weren\u2019t for this task, he would have killed her himself.\u2026Ming Shu took out her dusty medical tools, sitting in the yard decently. It looked like she was a qualified doctor with amazing skills.Qing Chen was sitting opposite her. The atmosphere between the two was very strange, with no one breaking the silence, and they seemed to be competing in who could keep their smile longer.Hui Xue was totally confused. She looked at her Miss for a while, then looked at Qing Chen again.What are they doing?Are they competing for the better-looking smile?Surely the Miss is more good-looking!\u201cMiss Zhi Po.\u201d Qing Chen couldn\u2019t help breaking the silence, for he was afraid smiling longer might give him a stiff face. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201dJust be tolerant, I\u2019m sitting opposite a psychopath.Hearing this, Ming Shu found a preserved fruit in the small bag next to her and put it into her mouth. Then she handsomely rolled up her sleeves, beckoning Qing Chen to show his hand.Qing Chen suddenly felt a little worried. He carefully reached his hand toward Ming Shu.Ming Shu\u2019s hand was very warm, just like the impression she gave people.A layer of soft light covered Ming Shu, which transformed her figure into something hazy and beautiful.A breeze passed through the courtyard, swaying the green branches.Qing Chen was a little lost.The inch of skin that she was pressing against began to heat up and the coagulated blood began to circulate.Then the heat quickly disappeared. Qing Chen looked up at the woman opposite him, encountering a light smile. \u201cWhat kind of sickness do you think you have?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d So who is the patient now?Will a doctor ask the patient this kind of question?!Will they!If he knew what sickness he had, why would he need a doctor?Does she have even some professional ethics?!\u201cA genetic disease.\u201dHis father didn\u2019t live longer than twenty-six. He was only five years old then, and he watched his father die in front of him. His pained face still seemed to appear in Qing Chen\u2019s mind now.It was said his grandfather also died at the age of twenty-six. Therefore, they had an unwritten rule in the family: they must be married upon coming of age, so as to ensure the survival of the family.However, Qing Chen thought this kind of pain shouldn\u2019t be passed onto the next generation, so he broke the rule and refused to get married.\u201cDo you have any idea of the disease, Miss Zhi Po?\u201d He had seen many doctors, but most said they could do nothing about it.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Ming Shu grasped his chin. \u201cYou are probably poisoned.\u201dQing Chen almost sprayed out a mouthful of blood all over Ming Shu. He had firmly believed that it was a genetic disease for so many years, now she was telling him it was poison? Probably? Couldn\u2019t she be a little more reliable?Is she a quack? Or does she wish to take the opportunity to kill me?\u201cWhat poison?\u201d He would like to hear her explanation.Ming Shu grinned. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dPu\u2014Don\u2019t stop me, I\u2019m going to choke this psychopath.\u201cMiss Zhi Po!\u201d Qing Chen almost gritted his teeth. But after a moment, he loosened his teeth and smiled meaningfully. \u201cIt looks like Miss Zhi Po really wants to see me a lot, are you falling in love with me?\u201d\u201cHard to say.\u201d Ming Shu answered with a more brilliant smile. \u201cAfter all, your delicate body may not be able to satisfy me.\u201dThe hair all over Qing Chen\u2019s body raised. Help, someone is talking dirty.Qing Chen tried hard to suppress his violent mood. \u201cI am really poisoned?\u201dThe genetic disease which had been told of in the family for several generations now suddenly became a poisoning. Qing Chen felt his family were all idiots.And this poison! How is it so strong as to pass down from generation to generation! Does it think it\u2019s a heirloom?\u201cProbably.\u201dQing Chen stared at Ming Shu for a few seconds, then suddenly got up, holding the table, and leaned closer to Ming Shu. \u201cCan you get rid of it?\u201d\u201cMaybe.\u201d Not a very certain tone.This is also the first time I\u2019m an excellent doctor. I\u2019m still not skilled in this business, so it\u2019s understandable if there is any mistake.A patient asked the doctor, What disease have I got?The doctor said, You are probably poisoned.The patient accepted it.Then the patient asked the doctor again, Could the poison be detoxified?The doctor answered casually, Maybe .May\u2026 be?Does she even think about the psychological burden of the patient? Where\u2019s her responsibility toward her patient?What the hell\u2026 I think I\u2019ve met a quack.Pondering alone for a long time, Qing Chen slapped the table suddenly: \u201cI decided!\u201dHe had no other choice but to believe Ming Shu.\u201cOkay, okay, easy there.\u201d Ming Shu picked up the bag containing her preserved fruits. He almost touched my snacks . \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, you\u2019ll die.\u201dYou\u2019ll die!Qing Chen calmly took back his hand and changed to his normal look of a beautiful and flowery butterfly procurer. \u201cWhen do we start?\u201dIf she can\u2019t cure me, I will choke this quack.Ming Shu looked up at the sky. \u201cIn a few days.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Why did she look to the sky?Ming Shu just glanced at him with a smile, then got up with her snacks and left.A colorful \u201cdumpling\u201d fell from her sleeve and rolled a few laps on the ground. With the fur covering its whole body standing on end, the furry beastie pushed its colorful egg to follow after Ming Shu, seemingly complaining about something.\u201c\u2026\u201d Why can\u2019t we just let him die?Liked it?

She seemed to have something to say.\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026\u201d Hui Xue didn\u2019t know how to say it. Ming Shu turned around and looked at her. Hui Xue continued: \u201cWhen you were practicing alone in the Valley, Master Qing Chen once came to our Death Valley. The old master diagnosed him, but then let him leave without saying a word.\u201dHe went to Death Valley before? Since the master of the Host could do nothing to help him, why does he feel that I can save him?Is it because I\u2019m better-looking than the Host\u2019s master?Hui Xue looked around carefully, acting like a thief. \u201cAfter that, the old master often got lost in thought, sometimes for a whole afternoon. During that time, we didn\u2019t even dare to speak loudly. Later, one time, I heard the old master talking to someone in the room. He mentioned Qing Chen, the Windy Mountain Range of Demons, the Mountain of Dragon Bones, something like that. Before I could clearly hear what it was, he discovered me, and guess what?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThere was no one else in the old master\u2019s room!\u201d Hui Xue said.\u201cMaybe the master was talking to himself.\u201dHui Xue scratched her head. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible. But at that time, the old master looked very gloomy, and I was forced to keep silent about what I had heard. Miss, I think Master Qing Chen\u2019s illness must be difficult to cure, you\u2019d better leave him be.\u201d\u201cBut I have promised him.\u201d How can you repent if you promise something to others? Unless\u2026 after he\u2019s dead.Hui Xue\u2019s mouth twisted worriedly. \u201cMiss, have you found out what kind of illness Lord Qing Chen is suffering from?\u201d\u201cAlmost\u2026 but considering what you just said, I\u2019m a little uncertain.\u201d Qing Chen seemed to have been involved in something unusual, and if so, his \u201cillness\u201d was certainly not that simple.\u201cWhy?\u201dDid I say anything wrong just now?\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.\u201d It sounds quite interesting.Back on the Mountain of Dragon Bones, in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons\u2026Coincidentally, the golden serpent that took Xiao Rufeng away and the dragon skeleton that fought with Xiao Rufeng were both from the Mountain of Dragon Bones.Hui Xue blinked her innocent eyes with confusion.But soon Hui Xue dropped it. She could always believe in the Miss easily and wholeheartedly.\u201cMiss, wait for me.\u201d Hui Xue caught up with Ming Shu. \u201cMiss, I still have something to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cMiss, you said that people in Death Valley have all taken that\u2026 Is it true?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWell, earlier you told Yi Ming that disciples of Death Valley have taken a kind of Dan medicine, and the antidote is only available to the master.\u201d\u201cDo you believe that?\u201d She just made it up casually. The medicine that disciples of Death Valley took monthly was to keep them strong and calm, preventing some disciples from overdoing the practice out of impatience.\u201cBut Yi Ming\u2026\u201d The symptoms on him were exactly the same as Miss said.\u201cI used some medicine on him then. He will be all right after the effect wears off. Right, I just remembered, where is Yi Ming now?\u201dAfter all, the body she was occupying was that of a skilled doctor. It should be easy to understand that she had some medicine with her.Hui Xue opened her mouth with surprise as she listened, and she answered, \u201cLiu Feng has punished him according to the rules of the Valley. But Hong Yan hasn\u2019t showed up. He took away most of the disciples of Death Valley, we must find him as soon as possible.\u201dThe disciples who didn\u2019t follow Hong Yan now had gotten into contact with Liu Feng. They were all searching for Hong Yan everywhere right about now.\u201cSince he wants Death Valley so eagerly, he will definitely appear again. There\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d The enemy is in the dark while I\u2019m exposed, it\u2019s better to keep calm.Hui Xue looked up to the sky, speechless. No need to worry?How is that possible? Who knows what crazy things that Hong Yan will do? And it\u2019ll be too late when something unexpected really happens.\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Hui Xue tried to analyze the pros and cons to Ming Shu, blah blah blah\u2026 But the latter didn\u2019t seem to have accepted even a punctuation. All she ever did was eat and sleep\u2026\u2026The turmoil in Xiling had put the public in an uneasy and horrific situation.The emperor raged against the rebellion of his fourth son and cleaned up political affairs. Any clique member related to Lord Four was investigated and punished. What everyone didn\u2019t realize was that the emperor had long known up until now. He was just waiting for an opportunity to take action.The opportunity to take down all the partisans of Lord Four in one fell swoop.Qing Chen reclined on the big tree in the courtyard, lamenting, \u201cThat\u2019s the cruel and ruthless royal family, same as always.\u201dThis time he just made a wedding dress for the emperor. Because of this psychopath.A total losing business!Ming Shu wasn\u2019t eating anything right then. Instead, she was pounding some herbs very carefully, with a few ancient books spread open and at hand. She pursed her lips slightly, and from the perspective of Qing Chen, it seemed she was bearing a light smile.Qing Chen floated in silence to her other side, reaching for one of the ancient books.\u201cMiss Zhi Po, don\u2019t tell me you are learning how to do this right now?\u201d Qing Chen threw away the ancient book, pinned to the spot speechlessly.\u201cWell, you can always stop me.\u201d What a wordy man. She wasn\u2019t born a doctor! What was wrong with learning!Ming Shu mashed all the herbs and poured them on a clean handkerchief. \u201cYour hand.\u201d\u201cWha\u2026\u201d What?Qing Chen clenched his fist, resting his thin lip upon it. \u201cWhat do you want to do with my hand?\u201d\u201cDuring the diagnosis period, you must listen to me in every aspect.\u201d Ming Shu looked up at this man who was far too beautiful. \u201cHave you forgotten what you promised me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d He did make that kind of promise, but\u2026 He looked at the handkerchief, slowly rolling up his sleeves and offering his arm, and said uncertainly, \u201cMiss Zhi Po, remember you\u2019re the master of Death Valley, you\u2019re a highly skilled doctor\u2026\u201dWhy do I always feel that this woman is not a skilled doctor?She is a quack.And I am a guinea pig\u2026Qing Chen\u2019s hand was very pale, an abnormal color. The blood vessels and veins could be seen clearly.Ming Shu pressed a few times on his arm, seemingly discerning something, then pulled out a knife\u2014WTF!?Qing Chen stepped back a few meters in a rush. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, did I do anything wrong? Why are you holding a knife?\u201d\u201cCome here.\u201d Ming Shu had a perverted smile on her face.\u201c\u2026\u201d No way.But finally Qing Chen was forced to accept a cut on the arm, right on the vein!Looking at his blood streaming out continuously, Qing Chen felt these might be his last moments in this world.Meanwhile, the \u201cmurderer\u201d looked very calm, placing all the mushy herbs on the bleeding wound. Qing Chen didn\u2019t know what the herbal concoction was, but it felt cool and comfortable. Soon, not only did the blood stop, but the pain disappeared.After that\u2014He couldn\u2019t feel his arm.It didn\u2019t seem to be his hand.As time went by, Qing Chen saw the wound begin to overflow with dark blood. The color\u2026 it looked as thick as ink, with a certain strange smell.Qing Chen leaned closer to check it out.His suddenly straightened his body as if he had seen something terrible. Looking toward Ming Shu, he stammered out, \u201cMiss Zhi Po\u2026 you\u2026 what did you put in my body?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t speak wildly, it was already in your body.\u201d\u201cI have\u2026 worms in my body?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d Ming Shu looked closer. The dark blood turned out to be many tiny worms. She rubbed her chin and murmured, \u201cIt turned out to be worms.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Qing Chen smacked the table disbelievingly. Is she really a doctor?Ming Shu lifted a hand to open the ancient books. The pages were turned quickly and loudly; he didn\u2019t know what she was looking for.The little beastie was lying beside Ming Shu\u2019s bag full of snack. One of its claws rested on the egg, and the other was trying to remove a snack from inside the bag.Ming Shu glared at it with her split vision, and the little beastie glared back, fur bristling.What! You don\u2019t feed me, that\u2019s abuse of a small animal!I\u2019m still growing!The little beastie grabbed the snack bag swiftly, then rolled down to the ground with its precious egg. Soon its small figure disappeared into the thick grass.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Qing Chen, who was immersed in the shocking realization that there were worms in his body, was pulled back by her unusual \u201cvibe.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Qing Chen asked as he caught Ming Shu\u2019s arm. \u201cPlease, doctor, do something to get the worms out of me.\u201dAs soon as he thought of worms in his body, Qing Chen felt itchy all over.While Ming Shu was held up by Qing Chen, the little beastie had taken the chance to hide in the deep grass, leaving no trace behind.Damn, is this fool doing it on purpose? He helped another idiot steal my snacks!Ming Shu stood there for a few more seconds before sitting back down again.\u201cHave you heard of undead insects?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve only heard of undead bodies,\u201d Qing Chen answered truthfully, and then he was laughed at by Ming Shu.This woman could express all her emotions with a smile. Qing Chen couldn\u2019t help admiring Ming Shu.\u201cThe undead insects are a kind of parasite that can leech off the human body. They live by absorbing the strength and vitality of the human body. The host body sometimes will have a rapid heartbeat and struggle to breathe, and they live no longer than thirty years.\u201cOnce someone is poisoned, the insects will enable them to absorb any Qi in the world, which will alleviate the symptoms caused by the parasite. But this Qi couldn\u2019t be used by the poisoned person themselves.\u201dBefore, Qing Chen tried to take the colorful egg just because of its rich Qi.Qing Chen frowned and his expression became slightly serious. Apparently, Ming Shu was right.He did have an accelerated heartbeat and found it hard to breathe. But he always thought it was because of his weak physical condition; he never thought they were related to his \u201cillness.\u201d\u201cCan the undead insects be\u2026 cleared out?\u201d Undead insects\u2026 This term was not familiar, but it didn\u2019t seem that strange, either.They may first have appeared in foreign lands.\u201cSure.\u201dQing Chen\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cHow?\u201dMing Shu revealed a weird smile to Qing Chen. The latter suddenly had a bad feeling.\u2026The poison of undead insects could be removed at one point.But that was a long time ago.Because dragons existed at that time.But now, there were no dragons.The method of detoxification was very simple: Drinking dragon\u2019s blood would cure all. Because dragon\u2019s blood had the greatest masculine energy in the world, and the undead insects were just the opposite.Interestingly, the undead insects were originally born from tainted dragon bones.The two could be said to reinforce and restrain each other.\u201cIs there still a dragon in this world?\u201d Qing Chen was a little desperate. Dragons had not appeared in the past few hundred years. It was said the dragons had long gone extinct. Where could he find a whole dragon?Is this a joke?This task is impossible to complete!\u201cThere is.\u201d During the later portion of this story, the fake protagonist would have a dragon. But it was not clear where it came from. The plot she got was simplified, and many details were murky.Since the fake protagonist could have a dragon, it proved that dragons must exist in this world. But the world didn\u2019t know this.Qing Chen turned around and looked at Ming Shu. \u201cReally?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dCan I just kill this psychopath?Finally, Ming Shu, under the harassment of Qing Chen, told him impatiently that he could go to the Mountain of Dragon Bones to try his luck.The Mountain of Dragon Bones was buried with a dragon. If there really was a dragon in the world, the most likely place would be there.But\u2014\u201cWhy should I go with you?\u201d She didn\u2019t want to go to the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. She only wanted to be a quiet foodie.\u201cMiss Zhi Po, you promised to cure me. I am still poisoned now, of course you have to go with me.\u201d Qing Chen stepped closer to Ming Shu, and his faint fragrance lingered around her.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going.\u201d\u201cMiss Zhi Po, come on.\u201d Qing Chen rushed to Ming Shu. \u201cThere are many delicious foods in the mountains. Don\u2019t you want to have a taste?\u201d Qing Chen clearly mastered the best way to seduce Ming Shu.No gold or silver treasures, and no need to prepare long stories.Just food.Ming Shu fell into silence.Food\u2026She recalled the spirit beast meat that she ate in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. The meat\u2019s quality was much better than ordinary meat. Tempting!\u201cLet me consider it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The colorful \u201cTangyuan\u201d jumped out and shook Ming Shu\u2019s skirt, rolling its big, jewel-like eyes.Go with him, go with him!\u201cGo away.\u201d Ming Shu kicked little beastie aside. \u201cI didn\u2019t get even with you for last time.\u201dWhat even? We\u2019re family, my eating equals to your eating? Don\u2019t be so stingy!Little beastie continued to act cute.\u201cWho is your family! I tell you\u2026\u201d Ming Shu suddenly paused. She looked at Qing Chen, who was staring thoughtfully and confusedly at her and the little beastie, then naturally changed the topic. \u201cWe\u2019ll go tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay. Miss Zhi Po, please rest assured, I will prepare everything and let you travel without worry,\u201d Qing Chen immediately answered, and at the end he didn\u2019t forget to add: \u201cI will take enough snacks for the journey.\u201dQing Chen gathered his clothes and realized something: Ming Shu could communicate with this divine beast, but\u2026 she seemed to be more than just communicating with this beast, she was able to communicate with all the beasts.\u2026In the Windy Mountain Range of Demons\u2026The burning sun hung high in the sky, and the air seemed to be on fire. It was extremely hot.A group of people were walking in the woods. The most striking person on the team was a flowery butterfly. He walked at the forefront, waving a fan. The people behind him had sweat all over their foreheads, but he looked the most cozy.\u201cMaster, we should be arriving at the Mountain of Dragon Bones soon,\u201d the guard reported to Qing Chen while checking the map.\u201cGreat.\u201d Qing Chen stopped and turned. The minute he turned around he was frightened. \u201cWhere is Miss Zhi Po?\u201dThe guard turned back as well and also found the team was only comprised of their own people.Ming Shu and her two followers were gone.\u201cJust now they were still behind us\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you to focus on her, you\u2026\u201d Qing Chen almost got angry, but he forced it back in time. \u201cGo back, find them.\u201dThis was the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. One wrong turn may get them lost.When Qing Chen found Ming Shu, she was poised on a tree and picking fruit. Hui Xue and Liu Feng stood below, looking up at her. Both of them were a bit unspeakably awkward.Ming Shu jumped down the tree with her fruit.\u201cMiss Zhi Po.\u201d Qing Chen gritted his teeth. \u201cNext time you want to pick fruit, just tell me. How could I allow you to do this hard work?\u201d\u201cMaster Qing Chen, you\u2019d better take care of yourself.\u201d Ming Shu smiled lightly at him as she put the fruit in her bag. The little beastie was squatting beside her, picking the fruit with its claws and shoving them into its mouth.Ming Shu stared at it, and it quickened its actions. As Ming Shu was about to beat it, it took one last second to put more fruit into its mouth and then rolled aside with bristling fur, staring back at its \u201cowner\u201d angrily.\u201c\u2026\u201d Like owner, like pet.Did you forget your identity? This is a divine beast?Can\u2019t you behave like you are a real divine beast?But Qing Chen restrained his mood quickly. He bent down to help Ming Shu store the fruit. \u201cWhy does it hold its eggshell?\u201dSome hatched beasts did collect their own eggshells after birth, but this divine beast\u2026 After birth, its eggshell was still intact, and it held its eggshell like that ever since it hatched!Ming Shu glanced at the little beastie, who grasped its eggshell even more tightly with its claws, staring at Ming Shu and Qing Chen in alarm.It\u2019s mine!Ming Shu pulled her gaze away and smiled at Qing Chen. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dQing Chen didn\u2019t believe her at all. She must know.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She didn\u2019t want to see the little beastie, and the little beastie didn\u2019t seem to want to see her.When the two saw each other, they\u2019d either be glaring at each other or the little beastie would steal food, then get thrown away, kicked away, buried in the soil, hung on the tree\u2026What a mysterious relationship.After having walked a long time, they finally arrived at the Mountain of Dragon Bones.The Mountain of Dragon Bones was destroyed a lot last time, with bare rocks and collapsed dead wood. But the heat was not any less, the hot sun baking the ground. They felt they were not stepping on the ground, but on an oven. Some people were too hot to breathe.But Qing Chen was not affected by the heat at all. With his feet not touching the ground, he floated forward like a flower fairy.\u201cHow should we find the dragon?\u201d Qing Chen floated to Ming Shu. \u201cThe Mountain of Dragon Bones is so big. Are we searching the whole place on foot?\u201d\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you scream aloud to see if it will come out?\u201d Ming Shu raise her eyebrows at Qing Chen.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026On a mountaintop not far from them, a woman was sitting with legs crossed at the highest peak, staring at the scene below. With the naked eye, there was actually nothing to be seen, but she seemed to have seen everything. Her eyes were filled with hatred.\u201cThey are coming.\u201d A man\u2019s voice rang out from behind the woman. Then her whole body was enveloped in two arms, and the man\u2019s cold breath floated to her ear. \u201cYou can take revenge.\u201d\u201cI will let her beg for death.\u201d The woman clenched her hands into fists.\u201cI will help you,\u201d the man said intimately.The hatred at the bottom of the woman\u2019s eyes was growing more intense.The woman was none other than Xiao Rufeng.When she was kidnapped by the golden serpent, she left a mark on it. She intended to tame the golden serpent after separating from Feng Cheng.Unexpectedly she was brought back to Xiling ahead of time. When she thought she might have missed the opportunity, the golden serpent fortunately appeared again and gave her the chance to escape.She was taken by the golden serpent to the Mountain of Dragon Bones.But when she was taming the serpent, something unexpected happened again.The dragon skeleton that was conquered by her earlier suddenly reappeared. She was affected and fainted. When she woke up, the serpent had disappeared and was replaced by the man in front of her.He devoured the golden serpent, occupying the snake\u2019s body and replacing it with the dragon skeleton. She couldn\u2019t tell what the man was now.And she was tamed by this man.She tried to control him, but eventually she was punished and controlled instead. It was more precise to say that she was tamed by him.The man was very powerful, so powerful that she didn\u2019t dare to resist. Fortunately, as long as she was obedient, the man would be nice to her, and even promised to avenge her.Xiao Rufeng\u2019s body suddenly stiffened.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the man asked.\u201cShe\u2026\u201d Xiao Rufeng pointed below. \u201cShe seemed to see me.\u201dThe man looked in that direction. A red figure was standing on a rock, staring this way. The expression on her face could be seen clearly. It was a wide smile, and she seemed to have found something really interesting.Ming Shu touched her chin and looked thoughtfully at the mountains over there. The trees were so tall and thick. In fact, she didn\u2019t see anything. She just felt that there was an uncomfortable air on that side.The little beastie lay at her feet, playing with the colorful egg not that interestedly.That dreadful thing, there\u2019s nothing to look at. Are you hungry?\u201cDreadful?\u201d Ming Shu grumbled. \u201cDo you know what is over there?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Qing Chen was confused.\u201cNot talking to you.\u201dQing Chen blinked and jumped up to Ming Shu\u2019s side. At a glance, he saw the little beastie holding the egg and rolling to the other side. Its vigilance was especially cute.The little beastie waved its claws at Ming Shu, negotiating the conditions.You give me the bag and I will tell you what it is.Ming Shu held tightly onto her snack bag, then threw it to the little beastie after all kinds of hesitant considerations. The little beastie flashed its complacent eyes and plunged into the bag happily. After a moment, it rolled out with an even rounder and bulkier belly, while the bag was empty, no fruit left behind.The full little beastie crawled out in a satisfied mood.It is the dragon-snake . Annoying .\u201cDragon-snake? The descendant of a dragon and snake?\u201d The snake family had the blood of dragons and could ascend to dragons through cultivation, and the descendants of the dragon and the snake were quicker to ascend. Why did this silly kid say it was annoying?He is not a descendant of the dragon and the snake. He grabbed the body of that stupid snake and replaced the dragon skeleton. Then he produced himself as the dragon-snake.Dragon skeleton\u2026Ming Shu was silent, then suddenly she looked at Qing Chen beside her. \u201cDo you know what is buried here?\u201d\u201cA dragon.\u201d Qing Chen rolled his eyes internally. \u201cIt\u2019s because a dragon was buried here that it\u2019s called the Mountain of Dragon Bones.\u201dMing Shu smiled meaningfully. \u201cBut the buried dragon\u2026 was it buried dead?\u201dAlthough the dragon had died, its grievances were still around here. Was it really grievance?What if it was not buried, but suppressed or sealed here?Besides, the golden serpent took Xiao Rufeng away, and if that golden serpent had been killed, then Xiao Rufeng\u2026She was definitely not dead, so she was very likely with the dragon-snake.Wow, that\u2019s interesting!Qing Chen blinked. \u201cZhi Po, you seem very excited.\u201d Even if it wasn\u2019t buried, was that exciting? Her eyes almost turned green, too scary\u2026This psychopath surely couldn\u2019t be measured by ordinary people\u2019s thinking.\u201cDo I?\u201dQing Chen nodded. Apparently!Ming Shu jumped off the rock.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cUp the mountain to hunt the dragon,\u201d Ming Shu said briskly, her bright voice slowly sounding throughout the mountains.To see if Xiao Yufeng is here.If she\u2019s here, let\u2019s obtain some more Hatred Points.She was a dedicated person.[\u2026] It sounds beautiful, but you just want to cause trouble.Qing Chen was stunned. Going up the mountain to hunt the dragon? Do you think the dragon is an earthworm? You\u2019re hunting it? Dame, wait!\u2026Xiao Rufeng didn\u2019t expect Ming Shu would come so soon and with so many people. She didn\u2019t know what to do for a time.\u201cHey.\u201d Ming Shu, like an old friend, waved to Xiao Rufeng. \u201cLong time no see.\u201dThat familiar smile and familiar tone.Both were so disgusting and hateful.The man behind her patted her shoulder; Xiao Rufeng\u2019s uneasiness seemed to vanish in the same moment. She exhaled a shaky breath and sneered. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been a long time, Zhi Po.\u201d\u201cYou have found a new backer? He looks\u2026 um, unpresentable?\u201d The man\u2019s whole body was wrapped like a briquette, not even a hair was visible.Is he cosplaying? Final Destination?\u201cThe people who have seen me are all dead.\u201d The man\u2019s voice was as calm as stagnant water.Ming Shu could feel a cold gaze watching her from the briquette with fierce pressure. It was really uncomfortable.\u201cWow, you\u2019re powerful.\u201d Ming Shu\u2019s smile remained unchanged. It seemed she had not been affected by the pressure and praised the man insincerely.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe man moved as if to begin the battle. But Xiao Rufeng stopped him. She stepped into Ming Shu\u2019s line of sight and confronted her directly. \u201cZhi Po, I have a question. Perhaps you can answer me?\u201d\u201cWell, you need to ask it first.\u201d Who knows what question you will ask, I\u2019m not that stupid to promise you immediately. What a fool.\u201cWhy are you causing trouble for me?\u201d She couldn\u2019t understand this all this time.Before she listened to Bai Yanran\u2019s orders and targeted her, that was understandable. But later, she and Bai Yanran split up, and she still continued to cause her problems. Apart from Bai Yanran, she and Ming Shu hadn\u2019t had many disagreements before.Why does she hate me so much?\u201cThis question\u2026 Let me think\u2026\u201d Ming Shu held her chin in contemplation.Liked it?

If not I can make up another one for you.\u201dQing Chen covered his hand on forehead, sighed. He didn\u2019t want to stand with this psychopath. People will send him to a mental hospital together with her!Xiao Rufeng: \u201c\u2026\u201dMing Shu\u2019s words somehow angered the dragon-snake. He sneered, then leaned over to Xiao Rufeng\u2019s ear and whispered something. Ming Shu couldn\u2019t hear what they said, but from the expression on Xiao Rufeng\u2019s face, she guessed it was nothing good.Ming Shu broke off a branch on the road side conveniently, waving it about in the air. The leaves rubbed against each other and rustled constantly.The two opposite turned to this way at the same time.The green leaves suddenly flew to them like sharp blades, blocking their sight in an instant.The dragon-snake pushed Xiao Rufeng aside and quickly raised his hand. Then, suddenly, all the leaves were shattered by an invisible power and dropped to the ground.The opposite woman heaved a regretful sigh.\u201cYou sneak attacked!\u201d Xiao Rufeng stabilized her body and shouted.The branch in Ming Shu\u2019s hand had become bare. She gently waved the branch like a cantor. \u201cWhat is a sneak attack? I am standing in front of you. You ignored me, now you blame me for sneak attacking? Shame on you.\u201d\u201cWhat is the difference between your behavior and a sneak attack?\u201dMing Shu\u2019s lips curled in a light smile, her eyes sparkling with flickers of light. It looked like a calm lake surface being broken, ripples spreading out. Ming Shu looked even gentler in this way.Xiao Rufeng became a little vigilant.She had seen many \u201csmiling tigers,\u201d who were the most difficult to deal with. Because you never know what kind of dangers and traps are hidden under their smiles.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShua!The branch swept through the air, making a murderous sound.Xiao Rufeng felt a black shadow flash past her front. The wind seemed to carry blades, slicing her skin. In the next moment, her body was pulled on by some hand, and her whole person twirled in a circle. After losing her sense of direction, her back hit the cold stone.Ming Shu\u2019s smiling voice sounded out from above her head. \u201cThis is called a sneak attack.\u201dMing Shu flung away Xiao Rufeng\u2019s hand, pointing to her chest with the branch. The branch was hanging softly, and it seemed to possess no lethality whatsoever.But Xiao Rufeng had a premonition. She felt it only required a little effort, and then the woman before her would be able to kill her with this soft, non-destructive branch, piercing her throat.Xiao Rufeng held her breath subconsciously.Whizzing\u2014A few leaves suddenly shot from off to the side toward Ming Shu, and Ming Shu moved sideways to avoid them. She raised her hand to sweep aside several pieces with the branch. But the remaining ones, after having missed the target once, circled back around in midair and continued to fly toward Ming Shu.\u201c\u2026\u201d Were they equipped with a positioning system?As Ming Shu was avoiding the leaves, the dragon-snake quickly rescued Xiao Rufeng on the ground, moving her aside.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d The dragon-snake asked in a caring tone.Xiao Rufeng took a breath. \u201cI\u2019m fine, she\u2026\u201d\u201cI will kill her for you.\u201d The dragon-snake seemed to know what Xiao Rufeng was thinking, and he also added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, her last breath, I will leave it for you to end.\u201d\u201cWell well, interesting. You haven\u2019t asked my opinion, how can you decide this on your own?\u201d Are you sure you\u2019ll have that opportunity?The dragon-snake raised his head sharply. Ming Shu was holding the branch as if holding a big knife, and she stepped on the raised stones. Her red robe clung to her legs, and the posture made her look slightly unrestrained.The dragon-snake put his hand out, waving it in the air, and clenched his fingers into claws. The leaves around him began to twitch wildly. In the next moment, countless leaves detached from branches and flooded toward Ming Shu.Each leaf was infused with strength, sharp as a knife.Ming Shu immediately used the branch to knock down a cloud of leaves, seemingly very easily. But it was not so easy in actuality, she just put on a very relaxed expression.She had seen her health bar decreasing.Her heart was aching\u2026The dragon-snake controlled the leaves into forming a long dragon to surround Ming Shu. Once Ming Shu knocked down one part, new leaves would join.And the Windy Mountain Range of Demons was filled with leaves.The leaf dragon\u2019s tail was sweeping toward Ming Shu, pushing her toward a cliff. Ming Shu stepped on a rock and leaped up. But unfortunately, another leaf dragon was coming down from above to block her way. Every direction had been blocked off; Ming Shu seemed to have nowhere to escape to now.Damn it! Is he planning to kill me so that he can inherit my snacks?Ming Shu struggled to clear a path with the branch and rushed out of the encirclement. The dragon-snake was a bit surprised. Still, he directed the two dragons to catch up with Ming Shu, meaning to put her to death.Ming Shu was entangled with one dragon, and the other dragon was attacking from behind.She glanced back and, just as she prepared to escape, a pair of cold hands suddenly touched her waist. She was removed from the dangerous position in a spiraling leap, her attacker lightly landing on a tree.Qing Chen, stepping on a few leaves, was as steady as a plane.In addition to fighting, as well as his being unable to practice powerful and overbearing methods, he was very powerful in other aspects.\u201c\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d She was just about to fight with the two dragons. This idiot suddenly pulled her out of the battle! Was he serious?I can\u2019t believe this\u2026 Who the hell is going to detoxify me if you\u2019re dead?!Qing Chen roared inside with unspoken criticism. But he could only speak out: \u201cWe are now on the same side, how can I let Miss Zhi Po fight alone.\u201dMing Shu smiled. \u201cIt\u2019ll be thankful if you don\u2019t add to the trouble. Let go of me!\u201d\u201cWell, fine, as you said.\u201d Qing Chen suddenly let go. Ming Shu didn\u2019t expect this and was abruptly weightless, falling from above.Fuck, is he a fool? It\u2019s 100% correct that a powerful opponent is less frightening than a weak teammate.Qing Chen is the weak teammate.Ming Shu quickly stabilized her body in midair. She leaped up again after touching down on the nearest trunk, and then rushed toward Qing Chen with the branch.\u201cMiss Zhi Po, it\u2019s coming.\u201d Qing Chen floated back a distance and pointed behind Ming Shu, pasting on a scared face.The two dragons were approaching Ming Shu one after another.Ming Shu\u2019s smile widened. She waved the branch, hitting the dragons\u2019 heads. Then, grasping the opportunity provided by the dragons\u2019 evasions, she turned over and stepped directly on the back of one of them. With two hands gripping the branch, Ming Shu stabbed it into the middle of the dragon\u2019s back at full tilt.The dragon twisted about for a while, then the structure of leaves collapsed, scattering and raining down the sky.Ming Shu efficiently dealt with the second dragon and landed on the ground.She exhaled a breath. Fortunately the Host worked hard to cultivate, and her strength was enough for her to fight. Otherwise, if the Host was a weak chicken, she must have been killed here in minutes.Good software must be equipped with excellent hardware to take effect.\u201cI underestimated you.\u201d The dragon-snake stood among the green leaves of the sky, continuing, \u201cBut, pitifully\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will die here today\u2026 Am I right?\u201d Ming Shu continued the dragon-snake\u2019s sentence.The dragon-snake was a little surprised, but then he sneered, \u201cIt\u2019s good you know it.\u201dMing Shu revealed a bright smile. \u201cIf I die, you will regret and wish you had never come to this world.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t regretted anything yet.\u201d\u201cThen I will make you regret once.\u201d Ming Shu unexpectedly threw away the branch and pointed to a point on her chest. \u201cCome, stab here.\u201dLet me help you kill me.The dragon-snake: \u201c\u2026\u201dQing Chen: \u201c\u2026\u201dWTF? What are you doing, you crazy woman? Are you killing yourself?!Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She exposed herself to the enemy so thoroughly!Qing Chen couldn\u2019t understand what she was thinking. But now he understood why she left Hui Xue and Liu Feng down below\u2014so that no one would stop her from going crazy.Ming Shu\u2019s smile was getting stranger and stranger. She lifted her foot elegantly and moved toward the dragon-snake. \u201cWhat, you\u2019re afraid now? Didn\u2019t you say that you haven\u2019t regretted anything? Now you start regretting?\u201d\u201cWhat are you thinking?!\u201d Qing Chen rushed to Ming Shu, blocking her forward pace, and frowned.I still need you to cure my illness!You have to cure me first, then you can do whatever you want, including ask for death.But Ming Shu only glanced at him for a second, then ignored him and continued to approach the dragon-snake. \u201cYou have only one chance. If you miss this opportunity, you will not experience what is regrettable. Don\u2019t miss it when it passes you by. Come on, past this village, there will be no such store.\u201dThe dragon-snake was forced to retreat a few steps by Ming Shu. He clenched his fist secretly and asked, \u201cDo you really think I can\u2019t kill you?\u201d\u201cCome on, you can.\u201dMing Shu was wearing a smile and continued to provoke the dragon-snake.The little beastie was holding its colorful egg and rested on a stone not far away. His black gemlike eyes were half-closed, seemingly uninterested in the situation at this time. Just when Ming Shu provoked the dragon-snake and asked him to stab her, the little beastie moved its hairy paw a little.But because the colorful egg was going to roll down, it took the claw back again to catch it.Then it casually flicked its eyes on the direction of Ming Shu.\u201cZhi Po!\u201dBefore the dragon-snake could take any action, Xiao Rufeng rushed out. She was holding a sharp weapon that came from nowhere and stabbed at Ming Shu with a loud cry.Ming Shu really didn\u2019t move. She calmly stood in place, staring at Xiao Rufeng rushing over.The little beastie suddenly stood up. But Ming Shu gave it a serious look, so the little beastie had to lie down again after letting out an unhappy grunt.Almost at the same time, Xiao Rufeng\u2019s weapon pierced Ming Shu\u2019s chest.Xiao Rufeng was shocked by her own success.Qing Chen originally thought Ming Shu was just joking with them. Although he stopped her just now, to be honest, he didn\u2019t expect she would let herself be hurt.But now, when Ming Shu was actually struck by Xiao Rufeng, he was completely stunned.By the time he figured out Ming Shu really wasn\u2019t defending herself, Xiao Rufeng\u2019s weapon was already a millimeter away from Ming Shu\u2019s chest. He responded quickly, but only grabbed the middle of the weapon, failing in stopping the blade from piercing into Ming Shu\u2019s body.Qing Chen threw Xiao Rufeng away with a palm full of Qi, then turned around to hold Ming Shu in arms. He almost lost his ability to speak. \u201cYou, you\u2026 are you okay?\u201dIs this woman really crazy?Why didn\u2019t she avoid the attack?Ming Shu\u2019s face gradually lost color, but the corner of her mouth tilted up and she raised her hand to hold the weapon. She moved Qing Chen\u2019s hand away with her other hand and looked directly at Xiao Rufeng. \u201cI said to let your owner kill me, not you, okay?\u201dXiao Rufeng watched Ming Shu pull the weapon out of her body.Jingle.The bloody weapon fell to the ground, and blood rushed forth in its absence, splashing onto the grass. The white coat covering Ming Shu\u2019s chest was soaked in blood, turning to dark red.Ming Shu stared at the weapon and smiled lightly. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, the result is the same anyway.\u201dThe air was filled with the smell of blood as well as other strange things.Xiao Rufeng had a very bad feeling now, which drove her subconsciously to move closer to the dragon-snake. When she thrust the weapon into Ming Shu\u2019s chest, she felt the other woman had changed into another person. Boundless darkness and blood rushed over her. The light on the horizon was seemingly disappearing.But she knew that there was no change in the environment, it was something deep inside her\u2026 Fear.Ming Shu revealed a bright smile and blinked her clear eyes. Then, with her red lips slightly parted, she said to Qing Chen, \u201cStand a little further from me, I\u2019m not responsible for any accidental injuries.\u201dIn fact, this sentence was not responsible at all. Because as soon she finished this sentence, she already took action. Qing Chen was swept away by a strong Qi gathering around Ming Shu, hitting the tree near the little beastie, and he fell before it, looking right into its big eyes.The little beastie still held the colorful egg, rolling it in the grass, only staring.Qing Chen sat up with a dizzy head.The surrounding Qi went into a very unstable state. Measureless Qi was forming in a whirlwind in the air and rushing at Ming Shu, then quickly drilling into her body.An invisible pressure came from all directions. Qing Chen was almost pressed down to the ground. At this moment, the world was captured in silence.Fortunately, the pressure soon disappeared.Qing Chen covered his chest, his eyes wide open to stare at the red figure in the distance. Inside, he was feeling tides and currents again.\u201cDamn!\u201dWhat\u2019s this operation?Suddenly cheating in the game?WTF? No one told him that there was such a hidden BOSS here!On the opposite battlefield:Ming Shu continued to fight against Xiao Rufeng and the dragon-snake with her bare hands. Within a short time, Xiao Rufeng was beaten fiercely and unable to fight back, then she was thrown onto a big tree, hanging there like a creepy dead body.Then, in no time, the dragon-snake fell from the air as well.Peng! He hit on the ground heavily, stirring the dust, and a pit was instantly formed.All of this happened in only a few seconds.Ming Shu seemed to be stepping on air and walked down steadily. Her red skirt fluttered behind her gracefully. In addition to the darkness and bloodiness of the before, she was covered in a layer of soft, gentle, and harmless color.She went to the dragon-snake and pressed on his chest with her foot to prevent him from getting up.\u201cDo you regret now?\u201dThe hat on the dragon-snake\u2019s head fell, revealing a pretty face.But at this time, the face was very pale, and there was still blood at the corner of his mouth. His pupils radiated a kind of horrified emotion.He recalled the moment just past, the horror of which could only be felt by someone who experienced it, and he was totally shocked now.The dragon=snake shook his head. \u201cYou are not human.\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m not a person, are you?\u201d Ming Shu touched the blood on her chest, then reached out to the dragon-snake. \u201cCheck this clearly, is this human blood? Do not mistake my species, okay?\u201dThe blood of human beings is different from that of other species. It\u2019s easy to distinguish for people like them.What flowed in Ming Shu\u2019s body was absolutely authentic human blood.But\u2026\u201cNo\u2026 impossible.\u201d How could she raise her strength to this level in an instant? He hated to admit it, but he felt that just now she was able to kill him in just one move.He was the powerful dragon\u2026The dragon family should be the most powerful!Even if it was now restrained into a golden snake\u2019s body, there should only be a handful of people on the continent who can beat him.\u201cYou are definitely not human!\u201d Humans would never have that powerful strength. The dragon-snake shouted disbelievingly, \u201cWhat the hell are you?! Don\u2019t pretend to be mysterious!\u201d\u201cConsider me a divine god.\u201dThe dragon-snake\u2019s pupils contracted sharply, and he refuted, \u201cThe divine family has long disappeared from this world. How could you be a divine god?\u201dHey! This little goblin wants to cause trouble here.I told you I\u2019m a human and you didn\u2019t believe it, now I say I\u2019m a god and you still don\u2019t believe it. What, you wanna fight?In the end, the unconvinced dragon-snake was again beaten for a little while by Ming Shu. During the process he found that, amazingly, Ming Shu\u2019s fighting ability recovered to a normal level, despite the deep wound on her chest. The dragon-snake tried to fight back. But when he intended to gather strength, he felt that the vessels in his body seemed to be blocked by something. The pain almost bent his back, leaving no additional space for him to fight back.Ming Shu crossed her arms over her chest and stared at the dragon-snake commandingly. \u201cSo, just so you know, the strength you absorbed into your body before has a side effect. You may not be able to use your Qi in the future. Well, you can choose to use it if you can endure the pain\u2026\u201dI said that I\u2019d make you regret coming to this world.

The dragon-snake, suspended in the air, looked down. The bottom was full of lush trees and upraised sharp rocks.\u201cDo you think throwing me down\u2026 That in this way, I will die?\u201d I am a dragon, okay? Am I that easy to kill?Ming Shu patted the dragon-snake\u2019s shoulders and smiled. \u201cYou really think too much. When did I say I would kill you? Farewell, friend!\u201dMing Shu loosened her grip.The dragon-snake lost his balance and dropped back, quickly falling down. Occasionally, one could hear the sound of some heavy object hitting rock.Ming Shu leaned over the stone to peer downward.I will not kill anyone easily.But that doesn\u2019t mean I will allow a little goblin who has dangerous intentions toward me to jump around.This dragon=snake\u2026 it barely counts as human.\u201cYou just pushed him down?\u201d Qing Chen stood a miniscule distance behind Ming Shu and looked down at the cliff. His eyes were full of inquiries and doubts.\u201cDid you want me to keep him?\u201d For what? He can\u2019t be eaten.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid he will seek revenge against you?\u201d The dragon-snake is not a good one. It\u2019s trouble to let him go, he should be killed.\u201cI said I would let him regret coming to this world, you think that was a joke?\u201d Ming Shu turned and smiled imperiously. \u201cIf he wants to seek revenge against me, he must have the power to do it.\u201dQing Chen: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat gives you the confidence, really.Qing Chen suddenly thought of the weird pressure from before. He glanced at Ming Shu\u2019s chest and saw the blood had already begun to dry up. \u201cThe wound\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s near the heart, right?But she only reacted with a pale face in the beginning, then she just jumped up and down like nothing had happened.Ming Shu patted her chest and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dShe patted with such heavy strength, but there was no blood oozing from the wound and she didn\u2019t seem feel any pain. It could be imagined that she was fine.\u201cYou\u2026 lied to him?\u201d Qing Chen raised his voice suddenly.WTF!He was worrying about her! But she was pretending! Unbelievable\u2026 She is not only a quack, but also a liar. I believed her!Well, liars and quacks seem to be in the same family?Em\u2026 Thinking about it this way\u2026 It seems a bit of a relief. What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201cWhat was that power just now, before you \u2018broke out\u2019?\u201d That power was too horrible. He was a man who had experienced great winds and waves, but even he felt that that power was terrifyingly strong. Just imagine how scary such a thing was.\u201cWell, I am powerful, right?\u201d\u201cThe power was very strange, and it made me very uncomfortable\u2026\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 what?\u201dQing Chen was stopped in his tracks.Yes, she\u2019s right. So what?It was none of his business. He just needed her to treat his illness.Qing Chen glanced at Ming Shu and then leaned back against the trunk beside him, saying nothing more.\u2026Ming Shu took Xiao Rufeng down from the tree and tied her up.Xiao Rufeng was injured much more seriously than the dragon-snake, and she was almost unable to speak at this time.\u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t do this on purpose. I didn\u2019t know you were so fragile, really.\u201d Ming Shu smiled as she secured Xiao Rufeng to the tree.Xiao Rufeng glared at Ming Shu with bloodshot eyes, breathing heavily. She looked like was killing Ming Shu with her burning gaze.Ming Shu stepped back hurriedly as if she was frightened. \u201cDon\u2019t be so fierce, it will make you look ugly.\u201dThe scar on Xiao Rufeng\u2019s face had not been completely removed. At this time, with a pair of reddened eyes and messy hair, she indeed looked a little scary.Xiao Rufeng: \u201c\u2026\u201dAhhhh, I want to kill this mad woman!Ming Shu ignored Xiao Rufeng, who was yelling at her hysterically. She held her chin with one hand and asked the Harmony System:Still not enough Hatred Points?[Not yet.] The Harmony System answered and promtply began to suggest bad ideas to Ming Shu again. [Perhaps the Guest can send her back to the Xiao family, and tell the Xiao family that she had tamed a dragon? ]Ming Shu was speechless. Can you give me a more embarrassing idea?She didn\u2019t want to judge whether the system was \u201charmonious\u201d or not. She was beginning to believe that her system was a stupid and useless one.[Yes, I absolutely can. Do I need to tell you, Guest? ] Of course its solutions were many. It had prepared all kinds of programs for selection.Shut up, you!Ming Shu turned around and suddenly asked, Can I kill her?[\u2026 Theoretically, it is not possible. At the time you kill her, you will not collect enough of her Hatred Points at the last moment. Then all the Hatred Points you gained in this world, including the ones gained from any additional mission, will be cleared, even reduced to a negative value. It\u2019s not worthwhile. ] The Harmony System answered without pausing. [And apparently the Guest cannot kill a protagonist in this world, even if it\u2019s a fake one.]Ming Shu remained silent for a while.Fine, forget it, I don\u2019t want to kill anyone anyway.[\u2026] Then why bother!The Harmony System was also curious about why the Guest didn\u2019t kill people. When it met her, she was fighting with someone. Although the one was not trying to put her to death, his methods could be considered sinister. Even an ordinary person would kill that kind of enemy for safety\u2019s sake, if one had the ability to do so.But Ming Shu didn\u2019t kill that person. She just beat him up.Later, according to its observations, it didn\u2019t see her try to kill anyone else, either.Although, in the end, those people were either killed by others or died because of various sequelae and accidents, it\u2019s true that no one was killed by her personally.But\u2026 the Guest doesn\u2019t look like a good person at all! Not killing people\u2026 well, it doesn\u2019t match her character setting!\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me that the Guest is secretly a good person?The system felt that it was a bit whimsical. Just look at the Guest\u2019s ideological awareness and style of doing things. If she was a good person, who else in the world could be considered a good person?It can\u2019t be like this\u2026 I have to think about it carefully.\u201cZhi Po.\u201d As Ming Shu was still absorbed in how to obtain more Hatred Points, Qing Chen suddenly spoke out. \u201cCan the blood of the dragon-snake be used?\u201dThe dragon-snake also has the blood of the dragon!I was scared by this quack doctor just now and forgot to ask this.\u201cIf you really want to die immediately, you can jump down and bite him.\u201d Ming Shu didn\u2019t hesitate to point at the cliff.\u201c\u2026\u201dThis meant that the blood couldn\u2019t be used. Can\u2019t she just stay true to herself? With such a beautiful smile, yet speaking out such terrible lines, how hypocritical!\u201cDon\u2019t bother me.\u201d Ming Shu waved and gestured to Qing Chen to stay away.Qing Chen gritted his teeth and stared at Ming Shu. But soon he wore an even more hypocritical smile, which was mixed with the seductive charm of a procuress. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\u201cI was thinking about how to make her hate me more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Qing Chen looked at Xiao Rufeng, who was already dying. She must hate Ming Shu to death by now, and she still needs Xiao Rufeng to hate her more? What is she thinking all day long?\u201cWell, you\u2026\u201d\u201cHa! I know!\u201d Ming Shu clapped her hands all of a sudden and hurriedly dragged Xiao Rufeng down the mountain.Qing Chen: \u201c\u2026\u201dHoly crazy.What the hell does she want to do!Liked it?

Even her inner clothes were bright red. When they went down the mountain, Hui Xue was shocked by the scary scene and felt very worried.Later, after she confirmed that Ming Shu was not injured, the big stone pressing on her heart was slowly moved aside.Ming Shu put on the clean clothes prepared by Hui Xue ahead of time, and then she dragged Xiao Rufeng toward the group of spirit beasts, throwing her into them.Under such dangerous circumstances, Xiao Rufeng, perhaps still being protected by the aura of the protagonist, could always perfectly avoid the attack from spirit beasts, fortunately saving her own life.But unfortunately, each time she escaped from the encirclement, Ming Shu would step up to her, regardless of Xiao Rufeng\u2019s angry and resentful eyes\u2014Ming Shu changed to another spirit beast group and again threw her into them.After repeating this several times, Ming Shu finally heard the Harmony System telling her that she had enough Hatred Points.Task completed! Ming Shu happily turned around in no time, leaving Xiao Rufeng behind without any hesitation. Great, now let\u2019s take the patient to look for food.Oh, that\u2019s not right, it\u2019s look for the dragon.It was too difficult to find a dragon. Ming Shu searched almost the entirety Mountain of Dragon Bones yet found nothing related to a dragon. But she did taste everything that could be eaten around the area.Qing Chen desperately wanted to kill her and just gave up the task.\u2026Xiao Rufeng didn\u2019t die.Her inner cultivation still worked, but without knowing why, her cultivation level degraded over time, and finally she again became the loser who just passed through into this world.As to the taming between her and the dragon-snake, it disappeared out of nowhere when she became trash again.She tried to find the dragon-snake, but the Windy Mountain Range of Demons was too big and was full of spirit beasts. She had now become a completely normal person, and it was impossible for her to find anyone in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. It sounded rather contrived.Xiao Rufeng also tried all means available to leave the Windy Mountain Range of Demons, and she succeeded. But she ran into Xiao Rufei and Feng Cheng upon stepping back into the outside world.Xiao Rufei didn\u2019t seem to know what had happened in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. She insisted on taking Xiao Rufeng back to the Xiao family regardless of her rejection. Feng Cheng failed to stop Xiao Rufei because of the latter\u2019s coquetries. In the end, he sent Xiao Rufeng back to the Xiao family with a dark face.On the way, Xiao Rufeng escaped several times but was found and stopped by Xiao Rufei out of kindness.The Xiao family was safe harbor for Xiao Rufei, but it was her hell.With no strength, no defenders, no matter how strong Xiao Rufeng\u2019s will was, she would collapse in the long run. Not to mention that there was a Xiao Rufei front of everyone, appearing as the perfect model for comparison.The time it took for a powerful person to be destroyed was only a moment.At the beginning, Xiao Rufei may have spoken for her and protected her using the identity of elder sister. But later, because Xiao Rufei and Feng Cheng had more and more things to do, they didn\u2019t stay in Xiling as often. No one paid attention to Xiao Rufeng or cared about her.Xiao Rufeng was married off to someone as a concubine by the Xiao family, playing the role of a marriage tool.When Xiao Rufei was told about the marriage, Xiao Rufeng had already moved out of the Xiao family. She went to see her, but at that time, Xiao Rufeng had begun to behave abnormally. She almost injured Xiao Rufei.Feng Cheng was very furious. If it wasn\u2019t for Xiao Rufei\u2019s pleading, Xiao Rufeng would already have been executed by Feng Cheng.Since that night, Xiao Rufeng was locked away.On the day of Xiao Rufei and Feng Cheng\u2019s wedding, Xiao Rufeng somehow managed to run out and made a scene at the wedding. But because it\u2019s an ill omen to kill at weddings, Xiao Rufeng saved her life one more time. Yet after that, she could only be locked in a small room, accompanied by a chain for the rest of her life.Hualala\u2014The unkempt woman looked at the ground. She was biting her finger and smirked from time to time.\u201cIt\u2019s mine. Mine\u2026 Hehe, mine, it\u2019s all mine, all mine, hahahahahaha\u2026\u201dA maid passing by heard the sounds coming from inside and hurried to leave.As for the Bai family, because they chose the wrong side and the wrong person, finally they were broken up by Feng Cheng. Bai Ruran was living a life even worse than Xiao Rufeng, and she was sent to the borderlands.\u2026Ming Shu and Qing Chen continued to fight in jest or for fun. They never seemed to tire of teasing and tricking each other. On the whole, their lives could be considered as happy and lively.In the beginning, they were not pleasing to each other. But gradually, when Qing Chen was in a good mood, he would take the initiative to find food for Ming Shu. Although they still argued with each other from time to time, Ming Shu obviously didn\u2019t contradict him like before.Ming Shu and Qing Chen stayed in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons for a long time, and the place was almost entirely scoured by them\u2014mainly for food.During this period, Ming Shu met the dragon-snake again. But just as she said, just when the dragon-snake intended to use his power, there would be a situation of broken meridians. And if he couldn\u2019t use Qi, he would be no different from ordinary people.But here in this world, if you couldn\u2019t use Qi to protect yourself, you would only be bullied. The dragon-snake was no longer the former powerful dragon-snake.\u201cMiss, there may be no dragon in this world. It\u2019s probable we will never find a dragon if we search the mountain like this.\u201d Hui Xue tried to persuade Ming Shu to give up. She tossed a glance at the flowery butterfly sitting not far and continued, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we let master Qing Chen find the dragon himself. And when he finds it, you will treat him at that time, what do you say?\u201dMing Shu took another bite of the grilled fish. \u201cCould the dragons speak?\u201d\u201cYes, the dragons were born to speak human language and could transform into human shape.\u201d Wasn\u2019t this common sense? Why did Miss suddenly ask this?\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d I wonder what dragon meat might taste like.Hui Xue\u2019s mouth twitched.As long as Miss said it was a pity, she knew what Miss was thinking.Was Miss\u2019s courage really made of gold? Why was she so brave, to have the idea of eating a dragon?The little beastie may have bee aware of Ming Shu\u2019s thoughts, for its eyes glared with flashing lights. It pulled on Ming Shu\u2019s sleeves excitedly with furry claws.I wanna eat it, I wanna eat.\u201cShut up, walk away.\u201d Ming Shu threw it aside along with the colorful egg.Hui Xue: \u201c\u2026\u201d That cute little animal. Miss is so ruthless! I really want to pick it back up.\u201cZhi Po, let\u2019s go take a look.\u201d Qing Chen pointed to a mountain not far away. Right then, they were situated at the core area of the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. Many things that they had never seen before were present here.\u201cNo, I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cThere may be better food over there.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Ming Shu hesitated for a while. Finally she went and followed Qing Chen to the mountain on the other side.The mountain was not high, but it was already very upright and steep for the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. It was also difficult to climb due to cragginess.\u201cZhi Po, let\u2019s see who will reach the summit first?\u201d Qing Chen got a little excited.\u201cWhy? What\u2019s the stupid race for?\u201d Ming Shu was not very interested. Her eyes constantly searched around, obviously looking for something to eat.\u201cIt\u2019s boring anyway, let\u2019s do it.\u201d Qing Chen winked at Ming Shu. \u201cOr, you\u2019re frightened? Are you afraid to lose?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s useless to provoke me.\u201d Am I the kind of person who will be motivated so easily?\u201cIf you win, I will pick the rootless fruits for you.\u201d\u201cDeal.\u201dMing Shu flew up and grabbed the vines on the cliff. Within the blink of an eye she had moved up a dozen meters.WTF?!Got excited when food\u2019s on the table? This woman!Did she starve to death in her previous life?Qing Chen was totally speechless. He had to catch up with Ming Shu quickly.On the top of the mountain, in addition to trees and stones, there was nothing else around.Ming Shu almost kicked Qing Chen down.\u201cDon\u2019t be so rude, look, the scenery here is quite brilliant!\u201d Qing Chen pointed at the mountain range in the distance. Viewing the Windy Mountain Range of Demons from this height really presented a beautiful picture.\u201cWell, perhaps you\u2019d like to settle down here?\u201d Ming Shu chuckled as she crossed her arms over her chest.\u201c\u2026\u201d Settle down in this wilderness? I knew she was a nut. \u201cMiss Zhi Po, if you want to be with me, it might be not bad to settle here. Miss Zhi Po, what do you think\u2026 Hey, wait! Miss Zhi Po\u2026\u201dLiked it?

He floated to Ming Shu and his mood was a bit low. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to Xiling city.\u201d\u201cYou give up?\u201d Ming Shu was surprised.Qing Chen shook his head. \u201cHui Xue is right. In this world, there may have been no dragons\u2026\u201dHui Xue didn\u2019t think that her previous words were heard by Qing Chen. It was a bit embarrassing. She found an excuse to leave.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like you, why so passive?\u201d Ming Shu seemed to be in a good mood, and she casually asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201dQing Chen lifted his clothes and sat down. He stared at the fire, where some fish was being roasted.\u201cIt\u2019ll be my birthday in three months.\u201d Qing Chen paused.\u201d Twenty-six years old.\u201dHe felt the changes in his body in recent days.\u201cSo fast?\u201dQing Chen rolled his eyes at Ming Shu. She only knew how to eat all day and didn\u2019t notice how much time had passed at all.Plus they were in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons. It\u2019s a place where people would ignore time.\u201cSo, go back for what\u2014to wait to die?\u201d Since they didn\u2019t find the dragon, and there was no other way to cure this poison, he truly could only wait for death.Qing Chen leaned toward Ming Shu, closer. An enchanting smile formed on his face and he asked, \u201cWhat, you can\u2019t bear to part with me?\u201dIf you are reluctant to let me die, just think of a way to cure me! Come on!\u201cI won\u2019t go back with you.\u201d Ming Shu stepped away from Qing Chen. Her dream was to eat the entire Windy Mountain Range of Demons. She hadn\u2019t finished yet.\u201cHey.\u201d Qing Chen patted Ming Shu\u2019s shoulder, and his strength pushed Ming Shu backward; they were accidentally facing each other now. Qing Chen, unprepared, looked into the depths of Ming Shu\u2019s eyes. He fell into a feeling of softness. He seemed to see countless golden lights there, flashing and attracting him so deeply.Ming Shu blinked; the lights disappeared as the mirror flower, as the water moon. Qing Chen moved his eyes away a bit unnaturally. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve gotten along for so long, won\u2019t you return with me?\u201dMing Shu smiled and got rid of his hand. \u201cSave it, no, you go back yourself.\u201dQing Chen didn\u2019t give up. \u201cYou promised to cure me. So this is it? No, no way, you have to come with me.\u201d\u201cI told you the treatment. You can\u2019t find the medicine yourself. What\u2019s the relation with me?\u201d Something like a dragon, she was not the protagonist, how could she know where to find it!\u201cLooking for medicine is your duty as a doctor, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Qing Chen argued unreasonably.\u201cWhat? Are you serious?\u201d\u201cOf course. I\u2019m serious, and I\u2019m going to rely on you,\u201d Qing Chen answered in a provoking manner while playing with his own flowery clothes.\u201cWow, you really are shameless.\u201d This idiot was getting bolder and bolder. It seemed that he hadn\u2019t been given an ideological education class for a long time.Qing Chen shook out his hair. \u201cYeah, you are so kind to me. I mean, you almost spoiled me.\u201dHe had been with Ming Shu for some time. Although her temperament was not clear, it was also not that hard to understand.Ming Shu stared at him and didn\u2019t speak.\u201cI mean it. Come back with me.\u201d Qing Chen coughed and avoided Ming Shu\u2019s stare. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find the dragon. It seems I really have to go back and wait for death. Could you see me off for my last trip?\u201dWTF? Am I crazy? Am I really inviting this madwoman to come back for my last trip?Screw the last journey!Qing Chen was almost moved by his own tears, why could he act so well.However, Ming Shu obviously didn\u2019t seem to buy this. \u201cYou have so many disciples at your Drunken Flower Pavilion, they will accompany you during your final moments, don\u2019t expect me.\u201d\u201cHow can they be compared with you?\u201d When you get crazy, the whole Drunken Flower Pavilion wouldn\u2019t be enough to calm you down. \u201cYou are the master of Death Valley. If you\u2019re there with me when I\u2019m dying, it would also be a proud thing for me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the master anymore.\u201d Not long ago, news arrived that Hong Yan brought people with him to Death Valley, and he claimed Ming Shu had died. All of Death Valley was now headed by Hong Yan.Qing Chen obviously remembered this matter as well. \u201cYou come back with me, and I will help you get back Death Valley.\u201dMing Shu gave him a look of contempt. \u201cEven if I want your help, do I need it?\u201dDeath Valley developed like this because she completely ignored it. If she wanted to take back Death Valley, it would cost no more than eating more food.Qing Chen: \u201c\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t be so arrogant and show off your power!In the end, Qing Chen didn\u2019t persuade Ming Shu. Before the two separated, they had a big fight. The reason was that Qing Chen took away a bunch of fruits that Ming Shu picked the night before.\u201cZhi Po, do you even have a heart?\u201dQing Chen threw the bunch of fruit in front of Ming Shu and left, not looking back even once.Ming Shu stared at the bright red fruit on the ground. She stood in place for a long time. Then she bent down and picked up the fruit, dusting the surface. She whispered softly to herself: \u201cI didn\u2019t have this before.\u201dHey!The little beastie patted Ming Shu\u2019s legs.Ming Shu looked at it.The little beastie patted its own small chest again. Its black jewel-like eyes were full of seriousness, but it appeared very funny.One person and one beast silently looked at each other. No one knew what they had exchanged. In the end, Ming Shu chuckled and bent down to pick up the little beastie with the egg. \u201cYou eat less next time, I will be very happy.\u201dLittle beastie grunted.We are family, mine is yours and yours is mine\u2026\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d Hui Xue approached Ming Shu slowly. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m very fine. I can eat an entire cow now.\u201d Ming Shu threw away the little beastie.The little beastie held its egg and rolled down the hillside. If you don\u2019t know what heartache is, just imagine the little beastie\u2019s expression now. It was like someone had just received a love confession from his crush, as a result, and she told him that it was actually for a game of Truth or Dare, and she chose the Dare.\u2026Autumn leaves fell in the cold wind.A tall, thin man stood in the courtyard, looking at a dead tree with his hand behind him.Cough \u2026 He placed his hand on his lips, and when he took it away, his palm was full of blood.\u201cMaster, the weather is getting colder, you should wear more clothes.\u201d The guard put a cloak on Qing Chen as he spoke.\u201cHow\u2019s the matter of Death Valley?\u201d Qing Chen took out a handkerchief to wipe the blood on his palm. Then he went toward the room, wearing the cloak.\u201cAll solved, Miss Zhi Po\u2026 will still be the master of Death Valley when she comes back,\u201d the guard answered. \u201cMaster, I don\u2019t understand. You didn\u2019t seem to like Miss Zhi Po, so why are you\u2026\u201dHelping eliminate the traitors in Death Valley for her?Qing Chen shook his head. Perhaps he was crazy?His mission had failed, but it really was not her fault. Just view it\u2026 as him compensating her, for he had bothered her a lot previously.Qing Chen\u2019s birthday was getting closer and closer, and his state was getting worse and worse. He could hardly get up from the bed now.This year\u2019s first snow came very early. Qing Chen looked at the falling snow outside the window, and his thoughts drifted far away.\u201cMaster.\u201d The door was suddenly pushed open, and cold wind blew straight into the room, causing Qing Chen to shiver a little.\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d Qing Chen leaned against the bed with half of his face hidden in the dark. His expression couldn\u2019t be seen.The guard stepped forward. \u201cMaster, Miss Hui Xue\u2026 she wants to see you.\u201dLiked it?

She and that psychopath were inseparable. How could she come find him?\u201cWhy is she here? Where is she?\u201d\u201cMiss Hui Xue seems to have been injured. I placed her in the west wing of the house. And I tried to treat her first, but she insisted on seeing you.\u201dQing Chen moved away his quilt and got his feet on the ground \u201d Cough \u2026 Let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cMaster, you\u2026\u201d The guard swallowed his following words. He put the clothes on Qing Chen and escorted him out.Hui Xue was lying in bed, with her face covered in blood, rendering her almost unrecognizable.Qing Chen walked to the bed and was a little shocked. \u201cHow is it\u2026\u201d What\u2019s wrong?Was that psychopath okay?Hui Xue tried hard to see clearly who was standing in front of her. Then she searched through her clothes to take out a little porcelain bottle, passing it toward Qing Chen while saying in a faint voice, \u201cMiss told me to give you this. Miss said, she has done what she promised you, and you don\u2019t owe each other anything now.\u201dThe porcelain bottle was translucent; inside a red liquid gleamed weakly in the light. Qing Chen stared at the porcelain bottle for a few seconds. \u201cWhere is she?\u201dHui Xue shook her head and got up, holding onto her weak body, and said heavily, \u201cMaster Qing Chen, take care of yourself.\u201d\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Qing Chen pressed Hui Xue back; there was a bit of imperceptible uneasiness in his tone. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dThat psychopath was so powerful, she couldn\u2019t be hurt.But why do I have a bed feeling\u2026Hui Xue had used up her strength, letting herself be stopped by Qing Chen.Her eyes were getting red. \u201cMiss\u2026\u201dAfter Qing Chen left, Ming Shu seemed to search for food aimlessly in the Windy Mountain Range of Demons, but actually she was getting closer to where the dragons lay. Hui Xue only remembered the weather was beautiful when Ming Shu passed through the border. She smiled as she told her and Liu Feng to roast the meat and wait for her return.But\u2026They only got a bottle of dragon blood and a letter written in blood, sent by the little beastie.Later even the little beastie disappeared.Ming Shu asked Hui Xue to send the dragon blood to Qing Chen, and that sentence\u2026She also said she was leaving and would not come back. Ming Shu asked them not to look for her. They should go back to Death Valley, and someone would contact them, help them clear the traitors, retake Death Valley.Hui Xue couldn\u2019t accept it. She broke into the dragons\u2019 lair alone.However, the dragon lair was not that kind. The injuries on her body were from that time. Later, she chose to send the dragon blood to Qing Chen first, because her time was not enough, and she couldn\u2019t let Miss down, couldn\u2019t waste the Miss\u2019s kind feelings.Liu Feng was still back there. She had to go back and find the Miss.She believed that Miss must be fine.Overtaxed, Hui Xue fainted. Qing Chen held the porcelain bottle and said to the guard after pondering for a long time, \u201cTreat Miss Hui Xue and don\u2019t let her leave.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dQing Chen left the room. Outside, it was snowing heavily, with the ground being covered in a thick layer of white carpet. The snow fell on his face, his nose tip, his lips\u2026 He felt so cold, to the bones.\u201cMadwoman.\u201d[Lord Nine, your mission will be completed after drinking the dragon\u2019s blood. The mission this time is very strange. There must be something wrong. But fortunately, the mission is to be completed, and we can leave.]Qing Chen tipped his head down to look at the dragon blood in his hand. That woman risked her life to send him the bottle of dragon blood, but she was doing it because of her promise, nothing else.He should be happy since he got the dragon blood and could finish the mission.But why\u2026 did he always feel a little uncomfortable in his heart?[Lord Nine, don\u2019t hesitate, she\u2019s no more than an object in the mission.] The voice in his mind was still shouting.\u201cDon\u2019t you think she is a little different?\u201d Qing Chen stood in the snow. His clear and melodious voice passed through the falling snow, and became as cold as that same snow.[Yes\u2026 she\u2019s indeed a little different. But the world itself has some faults, and it is not surprising that the characters inside have changed.]Not surprising?That woman was so strange.I always feel that something was wrong.Maybe\u2026 he really was thinking too much.This is just a task.After a long time, Qing Chen opened the porcelain bottle, gazing in the direction of the Windy Mountain Range of Demons, and finally drank the blood inside.A drop of dragon blood dripped from his mouth, slipping over his chin, and fell onto the white snow. It was like a blooming red plum, spreading brightly over the white.\u2026Ming Shu returned to the Cloud Room of the Harmony System, still entirely dumbfounded. How dare those stupid dragons harm me?!She managed to get the dragon blood, which meant that she could win against them. But again, just like in the previous world, at the last key moment she was pulled back.Always at a critical moment!Damn!Last time the miserable car accident\u2026 Fine, forget it, and this time\u2026Okay, forget it all, the scene was too ferocious, I\u2019d better keep silent to save my arrogant image.I really look forward to how I will die next time.[Easy, Guest, the life of the Host is up. No matter how powerful you are, there is no way to continue to stay in that world.] The Harmony comforted Ming Shu quickly. [But after the Guest opens the System store, you can use the props to exchange life.]Thinking about the long way to go until those one million Hatred Points, Ming Shu felt it\u2019d be faster to die.Anyway, almost everything in this world has been tasted, and it\u2019s time to eat the next one.[\u2026] It really thinks too much, the Guest only cared about food, and not whether she would die or not.\u201cRight, how is Qing Chen, the fool?\u201d The dragon blood was obtained at the cost of my life! A total lose-lose situation!The clouds in the room surged and condensed into a screen.A panoramic view of the Xuanyuan Continent appeared on the screen, continuously zooming in, and finally stopped at a scene of a yard.In the snow-covered yard, a man was wearing a beautiful fox-fur robe. His eyes and brows were so perfect, and his thin lips were slightly closed in a beautiful arc. He just stood in the snow, with a worried but steady expression. This scene was like the first time they met.\u201cMove.\u201dQing Chen pulled the curtain and sat in the carriage.The time seemed to speed by, and the picture turned to the Windy Mountain Range of Demons.Qing Chen had taken off the robe and was now wearing gorgeous clothes, slowly marching through the forest. He was the most eye-catching splash of color in the green ocean.Finally, Qing Chen stopped at the place where Ming Shu entered the dragons\u2019 lair. Hui Xue and Liu Feng were still in the same place. They seemed to have been staying here for a long time.\u201cMaster Qing Chen, you\u2026?\u201d Hui Xue came back here after her wounds were healed. She and Liu Feng tried every method to find the entrance, but they didn\u2019t make any progress.\u201cShe got in through here?\u201d Qing Chen asked.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Hui Xue nodded, while Liu Feng looked at Qing Chen expressionlessly.Qing Chen circled around the place for a while. \u201cYou didn\u2019t find a way to get in?\u201dHui Xue shook her head helplessly. \u201cThe passage was opened by Miss. But we don\u2019t know how the Miss opened it\u2026\u201dThey knew that the passage was in front of them, but they just couldn\u2019t open it.They tried to break through it forcibly, but only got heavily injured by the self-defense shielding of the passage.Qing Chen didn\u2019t know what to do in the beginning either. He stayed outside for a long time. In order to save time, the screen flashed again, directly to the scene where Qing Chen managed to open the passage.Hui Xue and Liu Feng intended to follow him in, but he refused.Qing Chen stepped into the passage.The screen was suddenly swallowed by darkness. Then, after a while, it cleared with a magnificent scene of mountains and rivers. In the high sky, there were all kinds of dragons.Ming Shu held her chin and looked at the scene for a while. Her eyes went gloomy for a few seconds. Then she waved her hand. \u201cOkay, turn it off.\u201dThe Harmony System directly shut down the screen without asking any questions. Then the information about Ming Shu showed up in the air.Name: Ming ShuHatred Points: 14000Additional Task: CompletedThis world earned me only six thousand hatred points! I knew it! To open the System store is nothing but a daydream.Fine, go go go, let\u2019s go to the next restaurant!Liked it?

Outside the window, screams and sounds of fighting were piercing through the rainy night. The smell of blood spread, with bright red rainwater streaming everywhere.\u201cPrincess, Princess\u2026\u201d The faint voice sounded in Ming Shu\u2019s ears.Ming Shu\u2019s consciousness was erratic, and it took a while to settle.\u201cPrincess, are you okay?\u201d The voice trembled, mixed with a bit of despair in the noisy rain.Ming Shu felt soreness all over. She tried to sit up, but before she could sit properly, an abrupt imbalance made her pitch forward and onto the cold wood.It hurts!Are you serious? This world doesn\u2019t have to give such a big greeting gift, okay?\u201cPrincess!\u201d The exclamation of the little girl rang.Then Ming Shu was supported with a pair of trembling hands, the palms covered in cold sweat, showing that the owner of the hands was very scared at this time. Ming Shu looked up but only saw a thin and weak silhouette.Ming Shu touched the skin that had collided with the wood just now. She sat still by holding onto the wall and leaned over to listen outside.In addition to the sound of rain, there were cluttered footsteps and the sound of weapons colliding.The minute I got here I encountered a fight. What an exciting thing.\u201cTake the princess away, quickly.\u201dAn unknown voice suddenly screamed outside, then the carriage abruptly jostled, shaking Ming Shu to the back. This wild running in the rain was definitely more eventful than riding a bouncy car.Ming Shu\u2019s whole body was almost shattered. She grabbed onto every object that could be used as a support, barely stabilizing her body.Sh*t. Damn it.What kind of road killer is driving this carriage? Your license will be revoked, do you know that!The carriage progressed bumpily for a long time, and other than the sound of rain, there was no fighting. Then the bumps gradually smoothed out, and they seemed to have reached the high road. The carriage stopped after running for a long time again.There was only the roar of rain from outside. No one opened the door, and no one spoke.The little girl with Ming Shu had long fainted, and it was impossible to count on her. Ming Shu had to try to push the door open by herself. She was weak and pale now, and almost had no strength.It took her quite a long time to push the door open. Upon opening the door, the rain poured in, and half of her body was soaked. Ming Shu reached out to block the strong wind and rain, pushing open the jammed carriage door and bent over to get out.Her entire person was soaked in the heavy rain. The wet, heavy clothes molded to her body, making her uncomfortable.Surrounded by boundless darkness, vision blocked by curtains of rain, Ming Shu could see nothing but the shadows of some trees and the outlines of the mountains. It was impossible to tell where she was.So tired\u2026 and hungry\u2014I need to find something to eat first.Ming Shu turned around and prepared to go back to the carriage. Suddenly a sword, gleaming coldly, appeared in the darkness and blocked her way. A voice dripping with sarcasm penetrated the rain. \u201cYour Highness, where do you want to go?\u201d\u201cGo back to sleep, do you believe that?\u201d MingShu didn\u2019t look back, answering the question with a light tone.The owner of the voice kept silent for a few seconds. After a moment, the sword flashed to Ming Shu\u2019s front, completely blocking her way back to the carriage. \u201cYour Highness, why don\u2019t you come with me to sleep somewhere else? I\u2019m sure that no one will bother Your Highness there.\u201d\u201cYou want to kill me?\u201d Ming Shu calmly turned around. She was standing high on the carriage, taller than the other, and condescended to lower her sight to the man in black. The latter was entirely wrapped in cloth, leaving only his eyes visible. The corner of Ming Shu\u2019s lips lifted. \u201cWho gave you the order?\u201dThe man in black sneered. \u201cYour Highness, blame yourself for not living at a good time. You blocked the way.\u201dBlocked the way?Of whom?For god\u2019s sake, couldn\u2019t he give me some time to learn the plot? We can discuss this later after I eat something\u2026Obviously, the opposite party didn\u2019t agree.The man jumped up in a single bound. Mixed with the wind and rain, the sharp blade cut the air with imposing momentum, directly attacking Ming Shu.Damn, I\u2019m over.I\u2019m so hungry and have no strength to fight.The key was that this body had no martial arts skill at all. Such a delicate body couldn\u2019t even be expected to possess the simplest knowledge of Kong Fu. She highly suspected that a little fierce action would be enough to destroy the body.I\u2019m going to die, I\u2019m done\u2026Rumble\u2014A column of purple light dropped down from the sky, seeming to tear the air, and the earth trembled with fear.The blade pierced into her flesh\u2014 Puchi \u2014and time was frozen.The sword successfully penetrated Ming Shu\u2019s chest, blood gushing. Yet the woman didn\u2019t seem to have noticed the pain. The lightning flashed and the man saw a weird smile on the woman\u2019s face.She slowly reached out and gripped the blade\u2026In the next moment, the man seemed to glimpse something horrible. His pupils gradually filled with horror and fear.Hualala\u2014The rain was getting heavier.\u2026\u201d Cough, cough \u2026\u201d Ming Shu was choked by the rain. She pushed the man aside with her legs; he was still breathing but couldn\u2019t move.The man\u2019s eyes were wide open, chest heaving.She glanced at him, then reached out to touch her own wet chest. She wondered whether it was blood or rain that dampened it.Ming Shu didn\u2019t get up immediately. She stared at the rain, her eyes filled with silence and darkness past the curtain of rain.For a long time, she only sighed, then wrapped her clothes tighter around her and climbed up from the ground. Then she crawled into the carriage on her hands and knees.So hungry!Only snacks can comfort my injured heart now.Don\u2019t ask her how she killed the man in black. She will say that it\u2019s her suicide that killed him, believe it or not.[\u2026 Guest, your life-saving skill is very special. ] The Harmony System wanted to say this earlier in the last world, but the Guest seemed to be a bit perfunctory and arrogant when it came to this topic.No wonder she was fearless and unafraid of death.At first, the System only felt that the Guest was very powerful and capable of causing and dealing with troubles. This was in line with its recruitment guidelines.But after getting along with her these days, the Harmony System noticed more and more questionable (shining) points about the Guest.\u201cMaybe a little\u2026 It\u2019s a passive skill.\u201d Ming Shu sounded slightly pitiful. \u201cWho will commit suicide for nothing?!\u201d\u2026 Although she had done it before, now she was no longer a naive fool.[\u2026] Didn\u2019t you commit suicide before? [A passive skill? How many times can you use it?]This was almost equivalent to getting an infinite resurrection buff in a game. Committing suicide was the key to starting a powerful slaughter, causing the level of violence to rise sharply. It would be very easy to pass all missions.\u201cWhy should I tell you, shut up, you.\u201d In addition to giving bad ideas, what else can you do? Useless system.Ming Shu didn\u2019t answer the Harmony System. Mainly because speaking consumed too much energy, and also because she was too hungry.[\u2026]Ming Shu covered her chest, leaning against the window and gasping. She searched for a moment in the carriage and touched a paper bag that appeared to hold food. Ming Shu opened it and took a sniff. Great, it was indeed food. She decided to eat it, ignoring whether it was delicious or poisonous.But the snack she found was not even enough for Ming Shu to sate her hunger. The last of her strength had been used to kill the man in black. She only wanted to find a place to eat quietly now.Let me die with my snacks.Don\u2019t stop me.Ming Shu was too hungry to even receive the plot, but the plot had begun to pour into her brain uncontrollably.This was the setting of an ancient romance.Cheng Jinyun, the fake female protagonist, was reluctant to marry a silly prince because she loved someone else. At the time before she was reborn, she planned to make her younger sister Cheng Jinxiu, the righteous female protagonist, marry for her. The two shared the same father but had different mothers.As a result, the man Cheng Jinyun loved was total scum who only took a fancy to the authority of the Cheng family. With the help of the Cheng family, the scum achieved his goal of gaining an identity and status. He began to indulge in depraved pastimes, and his original vows and promises became a joke.At this time, the situation in the Imperial Court suddenly changed, and it turned out the silly prince would become emperor. The news shocked the whole world. No one imagined that the grand winner would be him.Liked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: The Royal Princess (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsCheng Jinxiu had never left the silly prince and they experienced a lot together. Finally, the silly prince accepted Cheng Jinxiu and regarded her as the most precious gift.The silly prince was naturally the lead male protagonist this world.And Cheng Jinyun, the fake female protagonist, was affected by the Cheng family when they chose the wrong side. When the family was punished, the scum man immediately disowned the Cheng family.As the kind female protagonist, Cheng Jinxiu pleaded for her family with the silly prince, and thus Cheng family thus wasn\u2019t sentenced to death. But it was still degraded to the status of ordinary people, and since then the Cheng family had been on the decline.The Cheng family blamed all of this on Cheng Jinyun. Every family member thought it was because Cheng Jinyun didn\u2019t marry the silly prince, which had put the whole family into that condition. Cheng Jinyun was treated harshly by the Cheng family, and she transferred her hatred to Cheng Jinxiu, thinking that it was she who had taken everything away from her.But she could do nothing about it. She couldn\u2019t even feed herself.Finally, Cheng Jinyun found she was pregnant. Driven to desperation, she went to that scum. And finally, she got herself and her unborn baby killed by that man\u2019s new lover. Cheng Jinxiu buried her in the end.After that, Cheng Jinyun was reborn full of hatred.She was reborn at the time the \u201cformer\u201d her was going to ask Cheng Jinxiu to marry the silly prince for her. Although it was Cheng Jinxiu who buried her, she didn\u2019t feel any gratitude because of it. Instead, her hatred for Cheng Jinxiu got stronger and stronger. She thought it was all Cheng Jinxiu\u2019s fault, and her kindness was totally an act.This time she didn\u2019t let Cheng Jinxiu marry for her, and she herself married the silly prince. Step by step, she carried out her scheming revenge against the scum man, tortured Cheng Jinxiu, and finally killed the silly prince, controlling the country\u2019s affairs with her child still young. Ultimately, she simply began to rule the country using her own name and became an empress in history.What an amazing plot reversal.Aside from the story prior to the rebirth, it was an inspirational drama about a true queen.If you pissed off a woman, well, prepare to sacrifice the whole world to save yourself.The Host was called Shen Ci.These events were happening in the time of the Wushang Dynasty. The Heavenly Temple was created by the Wushang Dynasty\u2019s first emperor, who was especially interested in recruiting the world\u2019s most extraordinary talents for special abilities for the royal family.It could be said that the Wushang Dynasty had lasted for hundreds of years in prosperity, to which the Heavenly Temple made indispensable contributions.And in the Heavenly Temple, there was one kind of person who was especially respected by the masses; even the master of the temple had to treat him with courtesy.That was the Prophet.The Host was a Prophet.She was the youngest of the Heavenly Temple, but her status was the noblest. However, the life of the Host was not easy, for she had to learn as much knowledge as she could, whether it was about verses, ditties, odes and songs (the four forms of poetry), or astronomy and geography.Without knowing why, the Host was capable of almost anything except martial arts. She was like a canary kept in a cage, delicate and fragile, and others could only be allowed a distant appreciation but no close violation.Not only her, but every Prophet was good at everything except martial arts. This meant that it required countless people to protect them.It was not because the emperor feared being challenged and so prevented prophets from learning martial arts, it was that their physical condition didn\u2019t allow them to practice martial arts.Prophets could predict the future, and they may change the destiny of others, at the cost of life. In such a case, how could they not be vulnerable?In order to appreciate the contributions of Prophets to the Wushang Dynasty, generations of emperors ennobled female Prophets as royal princesses and the male ones as royal kings, their status only below that of the emperor.But of course, they had no real power.The relationship between the Host and the silly prince was good.The Host was a kind girl. When she saw someone in the palace bullying the silly prince, she often stood up for him. Gradually, the silly prince grew closer to the Host and often stayed in the Heavenly Temple. The Host welcomed him as well. Sometimes they would just sit for an entire afternoon. The Host was learning while the silly prince was entranced.Cheng Jinyun found out that the silly prince seemed to like the Host. Since her plan was to become the most distinguished member of the Wushang Dynasty, she wouldn\u2019t allow any accident to change that. Therefore, she schemed many different ways to weaken the Host more and more.The last straw that drove Cheng Jinyun to kill the Host came from the latter\u2019s prediction, which was that Cheng Jinyun would bring bad luck to the Wushang Dynasty and destroy it.Upon Cheng Jinyun learning of this prediction, she went to the Host earlier than anyone else, trying to persuade her to close her mouth. The Host refused. Then, during their dispute, Cheng Jinyun killed the Host by accident.Cheng Jinyun might not have meant to kill the Host at that time, but since it had happened, she later managed to dispose of the Host\u2019s body calmly. She imitated the Host\u2019s handwriting and left a letter, saying that the Host had left the Heavenly Temple according to her own will.Since then the Host had disappeared. The Heavenly Temple searched the entire city and nothing was found. No one had seen her since.Right now should be around the time the Host traveled with the emperor to the Guining Temple to pray for the country\u2019s future. On the way back, she was attacked by these assassins.At this time, Cheng Jinyun was just reborn, and the marriage date for her and the silly prince should be after this praying event. In this incident, Cheng Jinyun would save the silly prince once, which was going to lay the basis for his future acceptance of her.It seemed these assassins were all targeting the Host. Although she was safe, the accident did frighten her a lot, and she had fallen ill after going back.As to what the assassin had meant when he said the Host was blocking the way, Ming Shu couldn\u2019t figure out from the plot.\u2026Suddenly, all kinds of unspeakable pictures flashed across Ming Shu\u2019s mind. That heavy breathing and erotic groaning made Ming Shu\u2019s face turn red.Ming Shu turned over, head aching, but those images were still there.She thought she was dreaming at first, but the scenes changed swiftly, revealing it was not a dream at all.\u201cHarmony System, have you collapsed?\u201d Ming Shu sat up in a rush. She slammed into the wall of the carriage, making herself dizzy, but the unspeakable pictures were still showing up in her brain. Her mouth twitched. \u201cJust stop!\u201dThe Harmony System seemed to press the pause button, and the image was fixed in Ming Shu\u2019s mind.Ming Shu covered on head and grinned unhappily. \u201cWhat are you doing this early in the morning?\u201dHas anyone met such a system that will play this kind of fighting video for the Guest?The Harmony System!It has nothing to do with harmony!Why wasn\u2019t it harmonized itself!The Harmony System explained, [I was trying to wake you up.]\u201cWake me up\u2026 your morning call service is really special.\u201d The smile on Ming Shu\u2019s face became scarier and scarier. Am I that kind of lazy person? \u201cWhy the hell did you cover the scenes with mosaics!\u201dMosaics equals dirty.[\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll try to get rid of them next time.] The Harmony System sincerely accepted the complaint from Ming Shu.Ming Shu was suddenly tempered.She\u2019d better keep herself away from this abnormal system.Ming Shu comforted herself inside. It was hard to meet this kind of system, one that offered advice and played videos. If it could offer food like a magician\u2026 that would be perfect.[As long as the Guest strives to earn Hatred Points, the System store has free snacks of all worlds to offer. Come on.] The Harmony System started advertising spontaneously.Snacks.Free!And as many as I need!Ming Shu suddenly came alive. Those one million Hatred Points didn\u2019t seem so high.Work work work.But Ming Shu, who was full of passion just now, withered all of a sudden in the next second. \u201cCan I overdraw some snacks first?\u201d[Food is outside.] Why else would I work hard to wake her up? the Harmony System thought.Outside?Ming Shu blinked her eyes open, then she reached out to push the half-covered door. The carriage had stopped on grass, and at this time outside the carriage was\u2014All these damn wolves?The horse pulling the carriage had disappeared. The assassin who\u2019d been left alive last night was being eaten by several wolves. The scene was extremely bloody.Ming Shu was so hungry at this time, she really wanted to eat herself, but she couldn\u2019t take any interest in eating something that consumed human flesh.And, she really wouldn\u2019t eat people.Liked it?

The wolves might have seen her, as they were advancing in her direction. Several pairs of creepy green eyes stared at Ming Shu, which was very scary.\u201cPrincess\u2026 Princess.\u201dThe little girl woke up and got up with sore arms. She nervously looked at Ming Shu, who was leaning against the window right then. \u201cYour Highness, are you\u2026\u201d\u201cShush.\u201d Ming Shu put a finger to her lips.The little girl closed her mouth all at once. She followed Ming Shu\u2019s line of sight. The scene outside immediately caused her face to pale, and all she could remember was to scream aloud. But fortunately, she thought of Ming Shu\u2019s \u201cShush,\u201d so she timely reached out to cover her mouth, preventing herself from making any sound.Wolves\u2026 there are so many wolves.How is this happening?The little girl moved closer to Ming Shu, clutching Ming Shu\u2019s arm tightly, and her voice trembled: \u201cPrincess, what should we do?\u201dSurrounded by so many wolves, how can we escape?\u201cWait for a hero to save the beauty.\u201dThis was a common story. But considering she was not the protagonist, it was unknown whether there would be someone to save her.\u201cAh?\u201d What hero will come to save the beauty? Shouldn\u2019t the princess be too scared?The little girl gritted her teeth with tearful eyes. \u201cYour Highness, let me go lead the wolves away, you take the opportunity to run and don\u2019t look back. His Majesty will send guards to find you, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dNow she could only think of this way to save the royal princess.Ming Shu stopped the little girl. \u201cNo, no, that won\u2019t work.\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d The little girl\u2019s tears fell even more fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault, I didn\u2019t protect you well\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you have any food?\u201d I need to gain some physical strength!\u201cAh?\u201d The little girl was still coming up with words, and upon hearing this sudden question from Ming Shu, she was stunned for a while. Then she began nodding her head hesitantly. \u201cY-yes.\u201d\u201cGive it to me.\u201dThe little girl opened a box behind her quickly and took a few parcels from inside. There were some easy-to-carry dry food in the parcels.Ming Shu became even more excited than upon seeing her loved ones.After eating more than half of the dry food, Ming Shu was still hungry, but not so hungry as to die.\u201d Aowuuu \u2014\u201dThe wolves outside were howling with deep voices. Then, all of a sudden, the carriage rocked heavily, and some wolves jumped up onto the cover of the carriage. The little girl was frightened into screaming aloud, which made the wolves outside become even more excited. They started to jump onto the carriage one after another.But Ming Shu was as calm as a log. She stared at the door while shoving the dry food into her mouth. Then she picked up the sword used by the assassin last night, quite conveniently. \u201cRemember, later you run from the back, and run as far as you can.\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026\u201d The little girl shivered.Ming Shu curled her lips into a smile. \u201cDo as I say, or you will be eaten by the wolves.\u201dMing Shu ate up all the dry food; meanwhile the wolves outside were about to break open the door. She pushed the little girl aside, then opened the door. The wolves suddenly became excited and began to roar.Then the door was closed quickly again, and the little girl only got the chance to see a flash of cold light from Ming Shu\u2019s sword.Then, stepping to the tempo of the wolves\u2019 howls, she stumblingly ran far away.\u2026Somewhere near the bottom of a mountain\u2026A young girl was struggling to hold onto a tree trunk and pick up the green fruit hanging on the branch. She failed several times because of her height. After resting for a while, she continued to reach for the green fruit.Her fingertips were getting closer and closer to the fruit, closer and closer\u2026Then, with a quick forward movement, she successfully grasped the green fruit, but then she slipped and her whole body crashed to the ground.\u201cOuch.\u201dThe ground was covered with grass, so actually it didn\u2019t hurt that much. Ming Shu patted her butt and then sat up, rubbing the fruit clean and stuffing it into her mouth.Ming Shu looked up at the other green fruits, mouth watering, but she couldn\u2019t reach them.So angry!Wait a minute\u2026 What was the ability of the Host?Prophecy!That\u2019s right!Ming Shu excitedly put her hands together, murmuring, \u201cThe fruit on the tree will all fall at the same time.\u201dThen she looked up at the fruit with wide open, anticipatory eyes, praying,Come on, come on, I will catch you.A minute passed. The fruits were still smiling at her from the branches.Three minutes passed and the fruits still remained unbothered.Ten minutes passed and the fruits still didn\u2019t fall down.One hour passed\u2026Why?! This skill is not useful at all.[Are you serious? Guest\u2026.] That powerful skill\u2026 you just tried to use it to pick fruit? How is this\u2026Hualalala!Pengpeng\u2014Before the Harmony System finished its complaint, all the fruit on the tree suddenly began to fall down, leaving an empty tree standing before Ming Shu all at once.Not! One! Single! Fruit! Was! Left![\u2026] I maybe once thought highly of this skill.Come on.It\u2019s prophecy, not speaking in tongues, okay?!Ming Shu covered her head which had been pebbled fiercely by the falling fruit. \u201cCome on! Couldn\u2019t you tell me when you were about to fall down? That hurts.\u201dMing Shu picked up a few fruits and stuffed them into her mouth.You dare to hit me, I\u2019m going to eat you!\u2026On a shaded path not far away\u2026A man riding on a horse with a small group of people was taking a temporary rest there. He looked through the leaves and stared at the girl eating fruits on the grass.\u201cLord, it seems to be the royal princess.\u201d The guard behind him took several steps forward and reported respectfully, \u201cThe news said the emperor\u2019s team was attacked while travelling a few days ago, and the royal princess was lost. His Majesty is now sending people out to find her. Should I bring her over?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d The man looked over with a blank expression.\u201cLord, if we take the royal princess back safe and sound right now, it may save us many troubles. It\u2019s good for us.\u201d The royal princess was a great trump card.\u201cNo need.\u201dThe lord said this in a cold voice and prepared to leave.\u201cUncle, can you give me a ride?\u201d Free ride, lucky me! I don\u2019t want to run around in the wild for food, this weak body is so frustrating!A melodic voice rang from behind him, and the little girl who was just now sitting under the tree now stood not far away with a few fruits in her arms, looking at him with a smile.The man frowned slightly. How come she\u2019s so fast?\u201cYou\u2019re speaking to the wrong person.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d The wrong person? Impossible. The sign of King Huai\u2019s house was so striking, and she was not blind.But Ming Shu didn\u2019t argue with him. She held the fruit and turned around, leaving.No free ride, she had to accept the trials and hardships and walk back.\u201cLord, we will meet again when we enter the city. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for you to say that,\u201d the guard whispered into the man\u2019s ear. \u201cYou haven\u2019t returned home for many years, but the royal princess could still recognize you, she is not stupid. Lord, we have to be careful not to get caught on the wrong side. And it is not good to offend her.\u201dShe was the beloved \u201cbaby\u201d of the Heavenly Temple.If they didn\u2019t run into each other, it might make sense. But now the royal princess was aware of them. And she greeted them. If they ignored her, and something bad happened to her in the end, then lots of people would take the chance to pour dirty water on the lord.The man seemed to be impatient and said with a black face, \u201cYou send her back.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201dThe guard breathed a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that the lord would disagree.The lord jumped onto his horse, patting it; then the horse rushed out. Ming Shu was walking on the side of the road, and the horse passed by with a gust of wind. She only saw the man\u2019s figure disappearing after a very short time.\u201c\u2026\u201d Such an arrogant lord. Does your elder brother know about that?Who was his elder brother?Well, his elder brother was the country\u2019s emperor.Therefore, the Host called him Uncle in respect.Liked it?

The lord recently stayed up late into the night, hurrying the journey, which has made him physically and mentally exhausted, so perhaps his mood is not very good. If there was any offense, I beg you not to blame him.\u201dMing Shu waved her hand indifferently. \u201cThank you for sending me back.\u201dShe didn\u2019t care about the so-called \u201coffense.\u201d It was up to him whether or not to give her a ride.Ye Cong, the guard, was a little surprised. He thought she would be angry at the lord\u2019s attitude.Even if she wasn\u2019t very angry, she might say a few words about it.At least, all the princesses and misses he had encountered were like that.But she didn\u2019t seem to care about it at all. And she even expressed a polite thank you. This was not like a princess, not to mention her identity was much nobler than the usual princess.She was the royal princess from the Heavenly Temple\u2026Ye Cong came back to himself and said hurriedly, \u201cThis is as it should be, but Your Highness, may I beg for your understanding: we can\u2019t find a carriage nearby. Your Highness has to ride on horseback by herself.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201dYe Cong ordered a subordinate to lead a horse over in a hurry and helped Ming Shu to get on its back. \u201cThere is still a distance to the capital, Your Highness. I have sent people to inform His Majesty. Someone should come to pick up Your Highness soon.\u201dMing Shu smiled slightly. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go.\u201dHurry back to eat.I\u2019m too hungry!\u2026Ming Shu thought that based on her powerful skill, horse-riding must not a problem at all. But she didn\u2019t expect her weak body to be so vulnerable, and the feeling of suffocation just made her very helpless. Ming Shu had to slow down.If Ming Shu went slow, then Ye Cong could only slow down as well.Clip-clop\u2026The clatters of rapid hoof beats came from ahead, causing Ye Cong to become alert immediately. But soon figures appeared: it was their own people. Ye Cong greeted them with a sigh of relief.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cGuard Ye, the front road was blocked due to debris, the lord is going to take another road.\u201d\u201cDebris?\u201d\u201cThere was a heavy rain a few days ago, it should have happened at that time.\u201dAs they were speaking, King Huai and several others also appeared riding on horses.King Huai squinted at Ming Shu coldly, who was biting into a fruit calmly on her horse, and he rode straight past her without any hesitation.\u201cLord\u2026\u201d Wouldn\u2019t you wait for your subordinate?Ming Shu continued chewing on the fruit as if nothing had happened.The debris blocked the way so they had to change course with King Huai. But this alternate route would take more time. They could have been in the city before dark, but now it looked like they had to stay overnight in the suburbs.King Huai and Ming Shu each kept to one side, not bothering each other.Their resting place was close to a river. Ye Cong was trying to catch some fish while Ming Shu squatted by the river, holding her chin and watching. It seemed that the fish here was smarter, for Ye Cong caught nothing for a long time.\u201cCan you catch the fish?\u201d I\u2019m starving to death.Ye Cong was a little awkward. \u201cYour Highness, maybe we should go hunt some animals for you.\u201dMing Shu nodded, so Ye Cong took his people away to go hunting. He thought it was easy to catch fish. Who knew that the fish here was so difficult to catch.The patrols were scattered. After Ye Cong left, the entire camp became empty.King Huai leaned against the trunk, gazing across the river from time to time.The girl lifted the hem of her dress and waded into the water. After a while, she returned to shore, staring at the river with her head tilted to one side. The moonlight shone on the river, making the water sparkle, and the girl\u2019s hands clasped together.King Huai calmly watched a school of fish rush toward shore.Just like the previous incident of the fruit falling down from the tree.This was a bit different from the prophesying he knew about.A prophecy\u2026 is an event that will surely happen in the future. Prophets only tell of what will happen in the future ahead of time, rather than changing what will happen in the future through prophecy.Ming Shu carried a few fish back to the fire. After all the internal organs had been cleaned up, she skillfully put the fish onto the fire, roasting them.Ming Shu looked at King Huai with a smile and said, \u201cUncle, why are you staring at me like this?\u201dAre you planning to grab my fish?King Huai frowned and looked away. He said in a cold voice, \u201cDress properly.\u201dMing Shu had just cleaned the dirt on her clothes and was still dripping. She had walked into the river just now without shoes. Now her small feet were exposed to the air, looking crystal clear in the firelight.In ancient times, society was relatively conservative. Women\u2019s feet were not allowed to be seen by others.Ming Shu took her shoes and put them on, adjusted her clothes as well\u2014then continued to grill the fish.The two didn\u2019t talk anymore.Ye Cong came back to see that Ming Shu had already begun eating, while his lord leaned against a tree and stared at him coldly, eyes penetrating. Ye Cong swallowed and hurriedly ordered the servants to prepare food.\u201cYour Highness, do you need more food?\u201d He couldn\u2019t catch the fish, so how could she?And isn\u2019t this skill of grilling fish a bit inconsistent with her identity? Has anyone witnessed a royal princess roast fish?Ming Shu spit out a fishbone with a smile and shook her head.Ye Cong then gave King Huai the best food they got, and the rest of the food was distributed to the others. But for them, it seemed eating was only to fill the stomach, rather than savoring the meal. They ate the food as if they were completing some kind of mission, fast and efficient.In comparison, King Huai displayed more pleasing manners. He chewed the food slowly, posture elegant and clearly of noble temperament.Ming Shu poked the fire with one hand and held her chin with the other.Since the accession of the present emperor, his brothers had either been killed or degraded to lower positions. The only one who still owned the title of Lord was this King Huai.King Huai was the youngest son of the former emperor. When the present emperor ascended the throne, King Huai was still a child. If the emperor hadn\u2019t shown mercy to a child, he would have been labeled as inhumane.After the emperor ascended the throne, King Huai, who was still a child then, voluntarily asked to leave the capital and go to the frontier for practice.He asked for no feats and rewards.However, when he became an adult, the emperor gave the title and land to him anyway.The only time the Host saw King Huai was at the state banquet. That year was the centennial state banquet of the Wushang Dynasty. King Huai had to return to the capital. At that time, he was young, honestly looking no different from today\u2019s King Huai. They both shared a cold appearance, preventing others from approaching him.The Host was impressed by the sign of King Huai\u2019s house.This was why Ming Shu recognized him at a glance.People of the Heavenly Temple said that because King Huai had become more and more famous in the borderland in the past years, the emperor was somewhat uncomfortable. This time, King Huai returned to the capital upon the emperor\u2019s order.The Host was able to learn more insider information, but she was not very interested in these matters. Most of the information was unintentionally kept in mind through the discussions of other people in the Heavenly Temple.King Huai\u2026Well, as long as he wouldn\u2019t disturb her eating and gaining Hatred Points, everything was negotiable.Ming Shu picked a comfortable place to lie down.A quiet night.Early in the morning of the next day\u2026Ming Shu was awakened by the sound of a horse moving.She opened her eyes to see King Huai had left on his horse, leaving only Ye Cong and some others waiting for her off to one side.Ming Shu pulled her hair and yawned, walking toward the river.Ye Cong thought she was going to wash, so he didn\u2019t ask much. But after a moment, he saw Ming Shu leisurely carrying a few fish back.Ye Cong was speechless.\u201cYour Highness, perhaps we should hurry up and go back?\u201d The capital city is getting nearer, and there is no need to delay.In fact, he was a little worried that the Lord had gone back first on his own.\u201cOkay, just let me have breakfast.\u201d Ming Shu began to roast the fish.It\u2019s torturing to travel in hunger.I will never move until I\u2019m full.\u201c\u2026\u201dLiked it?

The people of the Heavenly Temple and the emperor were all waiting for her. Upon her arrival, she was sent back to the Heavenly Temple, escorted by big crowds.The Heavenly Temple was located in the northernmost part of the palace. It included a complex of extremely exquisite palaces, which were dotted with bridges, flowing streams, and winding paths, looking like a hidden but beautiful getaway spot. The temple was surrounded by green bamboos, and within their circle was the area under the control of the Heavenly Temple.\u201cLittle Ci, you\u2019re back, is everything okay?\u201d As soon as Ming Shu entered the Heavenly Temple, an old man wearing a benign expression came up and asked.\u201cYes, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Ming Shu nodded her head.This old man was the current Master of the Heavenly Temple. It could be said that the Host was raised by him, and he was like a real father to her.However, because of the noble identity of the Host, the old man did not dare to be her \u201cfather.\u201d\u201cGood, that\u2019s good.\u201d The old man patted Ming Shu on the shoulder and led her into the Heavenly Temple. \u201cHis Majesty will investigate this incident, so it will have an explanation, and those assassins will pay for what they\u2019ve done.\u201dMing Shu curled her lips in a slight smile and said softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Master, you must\u2019ve been worried about me.\u201dThe old man sighed. \u201cEveryone was worried about you. Right, I heard that King Huai sent you back?\u201d\u201cWell, it seems like that.\u201d\u201cHow did you meet King Huai?\u201d The old man frowned.\u201cI met him halfway.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this matter, I will find a way to thank him for you. But don\u2019t get close to King Huai in the future, do you understand?\u201d the old man warned Ming Shu in a serious tone.At present, the emperor was suspicious of King Huai. It was not appropriate for Little Ci to be connected to him. If he was a child of His Majesty, it would be easier to handle. But he was actually His Majesty\u2019s brother. If something unpredictable happened, a relationship with him would cause a lot of trouble.More importantly, that King Huai, how did he happen to meet Little Ci?Just a conspiracy theory. But it\u2019s better to keep Little Ci far away from King Huai.The old man escorted Ming Shu for a little longer before ordering people to send her back to her room to rest.When passing through a hall, Ming Shu saw the little girl from before kneeling in the middle of the hall. Ming Shu asked the person next to her, \u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d\u201cYour Highness, Zhi Qi is being punished.\u201dZhi Qi left her owner to escape. Although it was ordered by Ming Shu, this was not in accordance with the rules of this era. Accepting the punishment was a lighter result.Ming Shu nodded and didn\u2019t speak for Zhi Qi right away. But after she returned to the room, she said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m a little hungry. You tell Zhi Qi to prepare some food for me.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The maid hesitated for a moment. \u201cYes, Your Highness, I will tell her now.\u201dShe sighed in her heart, thinking that Zhi Qi was lucky enough. Her owner was so kind and tried to stop her from being punished in this way.Just as Ming Shu had put on clean clothes, the emperor\u2019s imperial edict arrived.Being the royal princess, Ming Shu wouldn\u2019t have to follow all those sophisticated manners for accepting the edict. So all she needed to do was to listen to the eunuch with her head down.The imperial edict mainly aimed to comfort her emotions, and the emperor gave all kinds of precious treasures to her as pacifying gifts.\u201cYour Highness, there will be a banquet in the palace of His Majesty the next night. His Majesty would be very glad to see you come.\u201d After announcing the edict, the eunuch conveyed a verbal message from the emperor.Banquet equals food.Food!Ming Shu immediately smiled and said, \u201cI will go.\u201d\u201cExcellent. I will not disturb your rest, Your Highness. I\u2019ll return to the palace now.\u201d The eunuch then said a few superficial words and bowed as he left.Ming Shu let servants send him out. She wandered around among the big boxes, and opened one of them casually. Gold and silver jewels, as well as silk satins, were piled orderly inside, nothing more.The things in the last box were a bit different though. There were a few calligraphy scrolls and paintings.Zhi Qi was in low spirits with red eyes at the time, but when she saw the calligraphy scrolls and paintings in the box, her back suddenly straightened.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s Mo Baisheng\u2019s work.\u201d Zhi Qi carefully unfolded the painting. \u201cHis majesty gave this \u2018World Peace\u2019 to you.\u201dMo Baisheng?It seemed the Host liked these calligraphy scrolls and paintings very much. Mo Baisheng was a painter that the Host liked very much. He\u2019d lived in the dawn of the Wushang Dynasty, which was hundreds of years past. He left countless paintings and calligraphy scrolls to the later generations, which were praised and coveted by scholars and writers.\u201cWorld Peace\u201d was one of Mo Baisheng\u2019s most representative paintings and had been collected by the royal family when possible.Now the emperor sent the painting to Ming Shu. The sincerity was true and touching.\u201cHang them up.\u201d It looks pretty good, but unfortunately it\u2019s not edible.\u201cYes, Your Highness\u201dZhi Qi asked others to hang the painting. \u201cYour Highness, these things\u2026\u201d\u201cKeep some, and send the rest to the master.\u201d I have to keep some money for buying food, or what would I do when I\u2019m about to starve to death someday?The boxes were moved out and the room looked more spacious. Ming Shu lay on the beautiful couch and ate freshly baked desserts.\u201cYour Highness.\u201dZhi Qi suddenly knelt to the ground, tears dripping.\u201cWhat are you doing, I\u2019m still living, why are you crying?\u201d Ming Shu waved her hands. \u201cI know what you are going to say. I ordered you to leave then, so it was none of your business.\u201dThinking of those wolves, Ming Shu was a bit angry. In order to get rid of them, she had expended great effort.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d How could she leave her owner to escape by herself?\u201cIf you want to cry, go back and kneel in the hall.\u201dZhi Qi was truly self-condemning in her heart, and she really went back to kneel in the hall, though she didn\u2019t cry. Even if the princess had forgiven her, she couldn\u2019t forgive herself.\u201c\u2026\u201d What a silly girl.\u2026The banquet was held in a special palace.Ming Shu leisurely arrived at the palace just before the start of the feast. Zhi Qi had a cold as she was kneeling a long time last night, so Ming Shu didn\u2019t have a personal maid to accompany her. The rest of the servants were not allowed to go in, so Ming Shu went in alone.\u201cPrincess, Princess, slow down and be careful.\u201d\u201cUncle is back, where is he?\u201d A petite girl ran in joyfully, while a maid followed behind and reminded her in worried voice.Then the maid saw Ming Shu standing in front of her. She sped up the pace to stop her owner, reminding again, \u201cYour Highness, the royal princess is here.\u201dThis girl was Princess Rong Hua. Because the Host was named the royal princess, a title a little higher than her own, this Princess Rong Hua had always disliked the Host.\u201cSo what? Do I need to salute her?\u201d Princess Rong Hua was very disdainful as she looked at Ming Shu. \u201cIs she not from the Heavenly Temple? If it weren\u2019t for the Heavenly Temple, she would be nobody.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you die outside.\u201d Princess Rong Hua murmured in a low voice.Ming Shu put on a small smile and said, \u201cSince Princess Rong Hua is still not dead, how can I die.\u201dPrincess Rong Hua was startled, she said it so quietly\u2026Her bit on her lower lip lightly, and after a few seconds she snorted and ran away from Ming Shu.I\u2019ll not come for you today.The maid nervously gave Ming Shu a salute, then chased after Princess Rong Hua to the palace.Snap!Suddenly a crisp sound came from the palace gates.It was followed by the sharp roar of Princess Rong Hua: \u201cYou dare to hit me! Guard, take him!\u201dAn eye-catching figure in bright yellow then stumbled out of the gates.He was soon surrounded by Rong Hua\u2019s people. Rong Hua ran out, lifting her the hem of her dress, and pointed at the man with impetuousness. She seemed to want to scold him, but with a glance around she saw too many people were with them, so she immediately changed her tone. \u201cBrother, did you take your medicine today? Let Rong Hua send you back to take medicine, all right?\u201d\u201cNo, no, no.\u201d The prince was frightened and waved his hand. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it, I didn\u2019t mean it.\u201dThis was the male protagonist\u2014Prince Mu Ze.Liked it?

    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: The Royal Princess (6)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations\u201cYour Highness, perhaps allow me to send His Highness back to the palace?\u201dJust as Princess Rong Hua\u2019s people were going to take Mu Ze away, a brisk female voice suddenly rang out. Then a bright figure appeared next to Mu Ze.\u201cCheng Jinyun, it\u2019s none of your business!\u201d Princess Rong Hua tried hard to hold in her anger.This fool, why should he occupy the position of the prince.\u201cYour Highness, I\u2019m afraid not. I\u2019m the future wife of His Highness. How is it none of my business?\u201d Cheng Jinyun said humbly but loudly; she didn\u2019t show any fear at all.Cheng Jinyun was wearing a suit of simple clothe, but she had a beautiful face, which would always attract everyone\u2019s attention. Gorgeous costumes seemed unnecessary for her.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Miss of the Cheng family to be so shameless. She is still an outsider, but she\u2019s taking herself seriously now.\u201d Princess Rong Hua talked back without any politeness, ironically.\u201cSticking up for my fianc\u00e9, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\u201d Cheng Jinyun raised her chin; her tone was firm.Everyone knew the prince was a fool. For Cheng Jinyun to stand up for the prince like this, even onlookers with an unclear standpoint in the game of succession would think Cheng Jinyun was a woman of affection and faith.As for Princess Rong Hua\u2026She was spoiled to be arrogant. If it were not for her noble identity, probably no one in the palace would pay attention to her.Ming Shu walked up the steps while lifting her skirt.The person standing at the outer circle was a little surprised. He bowed in salutation and said, \u201cYour Highness.\u201dThese words were undoubtedly like a stone thrown into a calm lake, sending out ripples. Everyone gave way to leave a passage wide enough to pass through, bowing and greeting the royal princess humbly.\u201cWhat are you doing here at the palace gates?\u201d Ming Shu walked through calmly, and her smiling eyes fell on the middle of the crowd. \u201cPrincess Rong Hua, are you welcoming someone\u2019s death?\u201dPrincess Rong Hua changed her face immediately. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. What are you talking about?\u201dThe idiot at the front was after all the orthodox prince of the country. Even if she couldn\u2019t wait for him to die, she couldn\u2019t say it in front of so many people.\u201cNo? Then why are you blocking the way of so many people?\u201d You blocked the way, don\u2019t you know that, little girl?Princess Rong Hua moved her lips but didn\u2019t say anything.After a while, she grunted and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThis fool is lucky. He should be the friend of Shen Ci! She always speaks for him.This is not over, humph.The rest of the people looked to each other with a bit of confusion. This Royal princess\u2026Did she become a little aggressive today?Cheng Jinyun secretly measured Ming Shu with her eyes. This was the royal princess. She only saw her a few times in her previous life, because she was always surrounded by people when she appeared. Her face was hardly seen at that time.This was her first time seeing the royal princess at such a close distance, and she looked so little\u2026Was she the same age as her?Ming Shu wore a smile on her face while walking past Cheng Jinyun. Then she was escorted by the ministers to the main gate of the great hall.Mu Ze secretly glanced at Ming Shu. As he was about to follow her, Cheng Jinyun suddenly moved forward and stopped him. \u201cYour Highness, allow me to take you back first and change into other clothes?\u201dMu Ze frowned, but he could only nod his head with a dull look in his eyes.\u2026Ming Shu was assigned to sit on the first seat on the right hand side of the emperor. There were many delicate desserts displayed on the table, and a tea-like fragrance was flowing around.Ming Shu was eating carelessly as if there was no one else present.Cheng Jinyun and the prince came in together when the banquet was beginning.The seat for the prince was at the opposite side of Ming Shu, while Cheng Jinyun\u2019s seat was much farther from him. Under all kinds of contemptuous and disdainful gazes, she carefully escorted the prince and then slowly walked back to her own seat.Cheng Jinyun sneered in the bottom of her heart. What do you idiots know? The biggest winner here is this fool you\u2019re seeing.Immediately after Cheng Jinyun sat down, a loud voice rang from outside.\u201cKing Huai arrives\u2014\u201dThe entire hall suddenly went silent, as if someone had pressed the pause button.A man in the black royal suit came in. He had a cold face, with eyes firmly pointed forward. He walked slowly and calmly.The temperature of the entire hall fell several degrees with his arrival.By the time King Huai had entered the hall, the ministers came back to themselves and remembered to salute him.\u201cRise.\u201d The voice was just as cold as the person, without any warmth. He seemed unwilling to say anymore.He went straight to Ming Shu. As he walked in front of Ming Shu\u2019s seat, King Huai looked down on her, with no warmth in his eyes. The latter couldn\u2019t help shivering.Ming Shu took the tray containing the deserts and moved backward.What do you want, to grab my snacks?The hall became so quiet that the falling of a needle would be heard. Everyone was holding their breath.It was said that the royal princess was sent back by King Huai. What happened between these two people?One word from the royal princess could save a dead man.This phrase was well known in the Wushang Dynasty.As everyone was making all kinds of guesses, King Huai took his eyes away. He walked to the side of Ming Shu and sat down liberally.On the left and right side, the first seats were respectively taken by the prince and Ming Shu. So King Huai could only take the second seat on one side, which was exactly facing Princess Rong Hua.Princess Rong Hua showed a little fear, but she was also very happy. However, after King Huai sat down, he never looked up to look at anyone present at the banquet. He drank the good wine on the table alone all the time, which made Princess Rong Hua very much upset.And after King Huai arrived, almost no one dared to speak loudly. The atmosphere was rather depressed.Finally the emperor arrived.\u201cAll lords, we won\u2019t talk about state affairs today. It\u2019s a casual party to please the royal princess. So just enjoy it.\u201d As soon as the emperor came in, he laughed and let everyone eat and drink to the fullest.But hearing this, everyone became a little scared.Wasn\u2019t it a welcome banquet\u2026 for King Huai?Mu Ze held a teacup, looking like he was drinking the tea carefully, which precisely blocked the expression on his face.King Huai was still sipping wine without any reaction. As if he didn\u2019t hear any words from the emperor, and nothing had any relation with him.Ming Shu tilted her body to one side, holding a plate of desserts in her hand, her sparkling eyes filled with amusement. She said in a cheerful voice, \u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201dThe old fox dared to use me. Don\u2019t you want your empire stable and prosperous during the second half of the year?It stood to reason that this dinner banquet should be a welcoming feast for King Huai, but the emperor said on purpose that it was for pleasing her. Wasn\u2019t he trying to start a war between her and King Huai?\u201cThe royal princess was frightened, and I really didn\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d The emperor continued his playing, and he didn\u2019t pay attention to the disrespectful gesture of Ming Shu at all. \u201cIf the royal princess has any requests, just tell me, and I will meet them.\u201dI\u2019m afraid you will be scared to death if I tell you, Ming Shu thought in her heart.Then Ming Shu smiled. \u201cYour Majesty, may I ask for more of these desserts?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Such a good opportunity\u2026 she only asked for some desserts? Is she a fool?Well, okay, the Heavenly Temple had provided her with everything, she really had nothing to ask for.\u201cHahaha, great, great, help yourself and eat whatever you want! I will order the chef to cook anything you like.\u201d The emperor nodded with laughter.Ming Shu smiled slightly. If she really helped herself, she could eat the national treasury into a deficit.Ming Shu perceived a gaze resting on her. She looked aside. The neighboring man was drinking a glass of wine empty, gaze lowered. He wasn\u2019t looking at anyone.Was it my perception?Ming Shu then slowly turned her eyes to the prince.Mu Ze\u2019s eyes instantly ran into hers. He grinned, and his eyes were pure to their depths, like a newborn baby.What an excellent actor!The emperor lifted his palm slightly, then the music gradually rang out, and the performers began dancing\u2026 The scene seemed to be lively, but in fact, the undercurrent was raging and every one of the people at the banquet was making their own schemes.Liked it?
