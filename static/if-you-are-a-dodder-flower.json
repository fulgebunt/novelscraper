Still, the house manages to remain how it originally looks like. Compared to other newly built modern houses, the masonry constructions of the building, the huge arc of glass panes on top and the heavy thick curtains made it looked like it was soaked under the sunlight, solemn yet elegant.Currently, inside the dining room, except for the fourth son who have not returned yet from studying abroad, the chief commander from the east warzone, Cao Xiong, sat down by the dining table with his eldest, second and third son, having a quiet dinner.Four men dining together is usually quiet, sitting up straight although their posture is relaxing. Even though after they have come home and changed their uniform to casual clothes, it is not hard to notice that they were trained from the army.Even for the second son, Cao Bin who did not enter the army but chose for political career, was strictly trained by his father since young, he was not inferior at all compared to three other men who wears uniform.The dining atmosphere is somber and heavy, only the sound of chopsticks slightly touched the side of the dishes and the chewing sound can be heard.However, this is not because their father-child relationship is bad, nor because there is nothing to say between themselves, but because the eldest person here, Cao Xiong, looked overcast with his gloomy face.Three of his sons made eye contact with each other hoping that their brother could take the initiative to comfort their father. However, nobody had any idea on how to start.Cao Xiong as their father is depressing because his lover passed away, as his sons, what could they say to give comfort?Thus, they had no choice but to continue eating on their own.The first one to speak up, was Cao Xiong himself.Without any notice, suddenly he announced a made decision: \u201cYour Aunt Cheng is no longer here, but her daughter is still small, I have told Butler Zhou to take her over in these two days, she will be living with us until she turns into an adult.\u201dThe eldest son, Cao Yang and the second son, Cao Bin made eye contact with each other.The third son directly asked: \u201cDoes she not have any other relatives?\u201d\u201cNo. She was the only child and her grandparents have already passed away. They had no contact with any other relatives. These few years, she\u2026\u2026\u201d Cao Xiong stopped a while, then said: \u201cOnly me. I have promised to take care of her daughter, so she could rest assure.\u201dThe first sentence was still talking about the girl that she had no other family, but after that the conversation switched back to that woman again.The second son, Cao Bin and the third son Cao Xing both looked at their eldest brother, Cao Yang.Cao Yang has a broad shoulder with a tight waist, his body is tall and solid, exactly looks like Cao Xiong when he was at a younger age. He sat over there and did not move away his eye from his father and said: \u201cFine, let her live in our house. It\u2019s only the matter of increasing an extra pair of chopstick, since these few years Aunt Cheng has always stayed by your side, at least we did not disappoint her.\u201dCao Xiong seems like his mood is a little better, but it also seems like he felt more depressing, it\u2019s hard for the sons to grasp their father\u2019s mind.At last, he sighed and put down the chopsticks: \u201cContinue with your meal without me.\u201d\u201cYou should eat more\u2026\u2026\u201d The second son, Cao Bin tried to advise him.Cao Xiong shook his head, then stood up and left.The sons couldn\u2019t do anything but look at their father leaving.Outsiders would think that this man with the age of over 50 is still strong and firm. But only his sons know that their father has gotten much weaker within these few days.The sons couldn\u2019t help but feel sad.The outsiders would have thought that, the sons that live in this kind of prestigious family would definitely hate their father for finding a lover. Usually this would involve the family with many issues in between such as causing the family inharmonious, and the conflicting interest of the sons.However, in Cao\u2019s family, there wasn\u2019t.The sons of the Cao\u2019s family knew that their father has already did his best.Fifteen years ago, when their mother passed away, their father was only 39 years old. Especially when he was popular in the army, there are so many people who wanted to set up marriage with him, and these families usually comes with prestigious status.Cao Xiong at his prime of life looked at his four sons, Cao Yang was 14 years old, Cao Bin was 12 years old, Cao Xing was 10 years old, and Cao An was 8 years old. Each of them has an age interval of 2 years. Cao Xiong has considered for a long time, thinking that his sons might not get along with their stepmother, and they might have conflicting of interest if he had another child with his new wife\u2026\u2026 In the end, he chose to stay alone.A man like him, surely there are many women around him. But no matter if it was just an act, or just a trade, he would never let these women affect his sons.Since the sons were still young at that time, they would never imagine that a strong man like his father, besides taking care of his physiological needs, would also need someone to stay aside with him.Hence, Cao Xiong was alone for seven years, right until eight years ago he met a woman called Cheng Wan.That was a rainy night, a pregnant woman suddenly ran across the road, purposely looking for death. Luckily, Cao Xiong\u2019s driver was specially trained before, he drifted the car and dodged the girl at the crucial timing. Although the car did not hit Cheng Wan, but still she fell down on the floor. Blood flows down along her leg till the road, then become shallow after mixing with the rain water.Cao Xiong came out from his car and without any hesitation, he carried the woman back to his car: \u201cGo to the hospital!\u201d\u201cSir!\u201d The bodyguard called.Cao Xiong followed the bodyguard\u2019s gaze and noticed there\u2019s a small little girl crying by the roadside. The little girl got wet in the rain standing right there and didn\u2019t know what to do but to feel panicked and scared.Exactly just like her mom.Outside of the emergency room, the bodyguard went to the convenience store and bought a big towel for the little girl to dry her clothes and wipe out the water from her hair, then he wrapped her up like a mantle.Cao Xiong and the little girl was speechless.Cao Xiong had four sons, four of them were trained accordingly just like new armies even when they\u2019re at home. To treat such a gentle little girl, all he could say is he had zero experience at all, even when he speaks, he mustn\u2019t raise his voice too loud or else he would frighten the little girl.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing in front of this kind of little girl, no matter how cold a man could be, he would subconsciously become gentler. Thus he tried to pick up a conversation with her.\u201cHow old are you?\u201cSeven.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with her?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my mom.\u201d\u201cWhat about your dad? Do you know his phone number? How about we make a phone call to your dad?\u201dThe little girl had tears flowing inside her eye: \u201cMy dad has left, with an aunt. My mom said he won\u2019t be coming back anymore!\u201dCao Xiong paused awhile, but he still managed to ask her mother\u2019s name and her father\u2019s phone number. Then, he made a call to her father.But that man was irritated: \u201cI have already divorce with that woman! She\u2019s already a grown up, can\u2019t she just take care of herself? Tell her not to look for me anymore!\u201dWtf! Cao Xiong stared at the phone after it got hanged up, this is a bullshit! If this man appears in front of him, he swore he would bring him down in one punch!The doctor told him the child couldn\u2019t be saved, and he requires the patient\u2019s family to sign the consent letter, Cao Xiong then signed for Cheng Wan.The little girl fell asleep on his laps. When Cheng Wan was pushed out from the operation room, she\u2019s still asleep from the effect of anesthesia. Cheng Wan was then pushed into a single patient room that was arranged by Cao Xiong earlier, he had also arranged nurses to take care of her.When Cao Xiong carried the little girl to another bed, the little girl was roused up from sleep.\u201cUncle, are you leaving?\u201d She asked. A seven years old girl is already able to interpret in clear language.\u201cYes, I have something to do.\u201d Cao Xiong replied.The girl burst in tears and asked: \u201cWhat about my mom? Is she still alive?\u201d Since she witnessed her mother fell down right in front of her, especially when the car wheel almost ran over on her mother\u2019s body in just a few centimeters, and she also witnessed her mother bled a lot.Cao Xiong felt helpless, he pointed at the bed beside her: \u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s asleep now so don\u2019t wake her up, she\u2019ll be better tomorrow.\u201dWhen he pointed at Cheng Wan, he finally had a chance to clearly take a look at her face. He couldn\u2019t say that Cheng Wan is pretty, but she does have a delicate facial features. Now both of her eyes are closed, her face is pale with an obvious sign of sickness.Losing a man, to this weak and soft woman, meaning there would be no hope for her on continuing to live.Cao Xiong entrusted the little girl to the nurses, then he left the hospital.This is why he prefers to marry to a woman that is like his late wife, when he is busy, or even when he was pushed to the frontline, only woman like his late wife would be able to support the family, and act as a guardian for their kids. Cao Xiong had numerous thoughts when he was walking on the road.Cao Xiong finally had the time on the day after to visit Cheng Wan at the hospital. Although his car did not hit her, but considering the tragic circumstances she had gone through, he still prepared some money as compensation.On the road, he listens to his bodyguard talking about Cheng Wan, and that was when he knew that woman\u2019s situation was worse than he thought.Her former husband sold their house and only gave her twenty thousand as an alimony for their daughter. That house was the man\u2019s property before they got married, thus the woman had no other choices. When the new owner came to overtake the house, the owner rushed them to move away quickly. The woman got dumped by her husband, and she even lost her only shelter, which is why she is in despair to seek for death.\u201cWhat are you planning to do onwards?\u201d Cao Xiong ignored the \u201cDo not smoke\u201d sign in the hospital, he grabbed a cigarette and started smoking.Cheng Wan was unsure of her future. Her parents have passed away; she doesn\u2019t have any other relatives either. Her husband was supposedly to be her only closest family, but he dumped her when she was pregnant and dated with another woman. Cao Xiong asked her what to do, but she got completely lost on what to do next.She mumbled but didn\u2019t know what to say. To confront with this awe-inspiring army man, she only felt uneasy and lowered her head, both of her hands unconsciously held tightly on the thin blanket. Maybe she used too much strength that her slim fingers started to turn pale.Her long hair was loosely tight into braids, hanging at one side of her shoulder. The sunlight penetrated through the glass window, casted on the side of her face which was seemingly translucent.Cao Xiong looked at this woman, he took a whiff of the cigarette.Ever since he was young, he never liked this type of woman with no capabilities and woman without her own assertive, but at this moment, he actually felt a stung on his heart for her softness, what a bizarre.Cao Xiong was always a decisive person, from the moment he was tempted to this woman, it only taken him a whiff of time to decide.\u201cI have an old house still vacant, I can lend it to you to move in. You should rest for two more days and I will arrange someone to pick you over.\u201d He said.\u201cBut\u2026\u2026\u201d Cheng Wan was dazed by his sudden offer, her first instinct was to reject, as she felt this is too much to accept.Yet, Cao Xiong wasn\u2019t the kind of man who gets rejected easily. \u201cIf not, where are you going to live? What about your child?\u201d He pushed aggressively: \u201cAt least you should have a place to stay, even if you want to find a new house, you should take care of your health first!\u201dCheng Wan had just gone through an abortion, supposedly she should be under post-natal care. Just as he said, even if she wants to look for houses, she will need to wait for her body to recover. Cheng Wan couldn\u2019t even say anything to reject him. Moreover, this man is so dominant that he has already planned her whereabouts. At times like this when she got suffocated by the cruel reality following one and another, suddenly she felt that she could breathe again.In the end, she lowered her neck and softly said: \u201cThen\u2026\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u2026\u201dHer neck was long and white as snow, it was a beautiful curve when she lowered her neck, at the same time it also symbolizes her humble obedience.This action of hers has made Cao Xiong felt satisfying.Cheng Wan still didn\u2019t know, when she approached to Cao Xiong, this man is a kind who take dominance of everything, the moment when she couldn\u2019t reject him, it already means she has belonged to him, like a caged bird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thankfully, the furniture is still there and usable. Cao Xiong have already get someone to tidy up the house and prepared new mattress and blankets, even the electronics have changed to a new one. When Cheng Wan comes, she can move in immediately.Cao Xiong even hired the nurses from the hospital to take care of her. He went to visit her two or three times before, every time he would sit down for a while and remind her to rest well, after he finishes a cup of tea he would leave.Even so, Cheng Wan was able to grasp his taste in short time, Cao Xiong doesn\u2019t like to drink green tea but he loves black tea. When he comes again, the tea she made suits his favor.At the same time, Cao Xiong understood what Cheng Wan\u2019s ex-husband meant in their phone conversation. Cheng Wan\u2026\u2026 really couldn\u2019t take care of herself properly.She\u2019s not clever, sometimes blurry, the worse is she doesn\u2019t really pay attention, when anything happens, she doesn\u2019t have any idea on what to do. She only knows to be gentle and obedient.Her ex-husband was only a middle class white collar, to that man, all of these characteristics were Cheng Wan\u2019s biggest shortcoming. Especially when she approached to her thirties, slowly she has lost her youth and turned older, her husband started to give her a cold-shoulder.However, these characteristics were not considered as shortcomings to Cao Xiong, in precise, it was what he caught interested on her instead. A soft woman who is weak and helpless, it was a brand new experience for Cao Xiong.As the number of times he visits Cheng Wan gradually increases, many times she wanted to talk but hesitated, then felt anxious. Cao Xiong pretended as if he didn\u2019t know.When he visits her again, she has recovered to a healthy state, with a rosy cheek on her face. She looked much prettier now compared to when she was in the hospital.\u201cI have told the nurses not to come anymore.\u201d She served the tea and bitten her lips while she speaks.\u201cYour body have recovered?\u201d The man asked. He sat on the sofa, took of his hat and simply unbuttoned a few from his black uniform, postured as if he was the owner.Well, the owner of this house was originally his anyway.Cheng Wan was always bewildered when she confronts Cao Xiong. When she heard his question, immediately she replied: \u201cIt\u2019s fine now.\u201dActually she had something to ask Cao Xiong while he\u2019s here now, such as, how long will she able to live in this house, but she\u2019s afraid that he would ask her to move out. To think that she needs to find a new place which she\u2019s unfamiliar to, and live along with her child, she couldn\u2019t help but to feel anxious.Cao Xiong did not drink the tea but lighten up his cigarette. Obviously he knew what she was worried about.He stood up and walked around the living room, then asked: \u201cWhere\u2019s the child?\u201dCheng Wan softly replied: \u201cShe went to school.\u201dIn the end she still couldn\u2019t look through his eyes. This man, his aura is too dominant, sometimes it makes her feel scared.What she afraid the most was\u2026\u2026 his unfounded kindness towards her.This old house doesn\u2019t have a French window, Cao Xiong leaned against the windowsill and started smoking, he squinted his eyes trying to take a good look on this woman.So soft, and lost, yet nobody to rely on.He didn\u2019t say a word; the room was pin drop silence. This man\u2019s scent is all over the place.Cheng Wan had nowhere to escape, she slightly looked down, her nose started to secrete tiny sweat due to nervousness, unconsciously fidgeting her fingers.Cao Xiong\u2019s sight is boldly looking at this woman\u2019s slim and curvy body, especially when he noticed she was fidgeting her fingers, the corners of his lips lifted.Nobody in this world would be kind to someone without a reason.Cheng Wan is not a naive little girl anymore, she\u2019s already 30 years old. Things between a man and a woman, she should\u2019ve known better. She\u2019s just scared, doesn\u2019t have the courage to confront, not even dare to resist.As long as she understands, then it\u2019s fine. Cao Xiong pressed the cigarette on the window to extinguish the fire, then he stepped forward and pinched on Cheng Wan\u2019s chin.Cheng Wan was forced to raised her head, her sight was blurry, frightened and uneasy. Just like a little puppy waiting to be eaten.This look of her is exactly what Cao Xiong liked the most.He lowered his head and kissed her\u2026\u2026When he released his hands, Cheng Wan panicked while staggered a few steps behind, as if this was her last chance to struggle, or escape. She and her former husband was already a couple since high school, they were married immediately after their university graduation. Until now, she has lived for 30 years, she never had other man before. The aggression came from the man in front made her scared.She moved back a few steps, took a gasp for breath, her back leaned in front of the bedroom\u2019s door.Cao Xiong took a few steps forward and held her tight, one of his hands fixed her head so she couldn\u2019t struggle anywhere from his lips. He felt the stiff body of this woman in his arms slowly turned soft, he kicked the bedroom door and carried her in\u2026\u2026\u201cBang\u201d The door was immediately shut\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After that, Cao Xiong clearly told Cheng Wan that he does not plan for remarriage.His eldest son, Cao Yang was already 21 years old, and he\u2019s only 9 years old younger than Cheng Wan. Even the second son has turned into an adult. He had no intention of finding a stepmother for them, it would disturb the peace of their family they have now.But he touched her cheeks and promised her: \u201cIf you willing to follow me, I will take care of you.\u201dWhat returned from her was a miserable look, his heart couldn\u2019t help but soften a bit, paused a while, he added: \u201cI can guarantee not to leave you alone anymore\u2026\u2026\u201dThis sentence has made Cheng Wan felt relieved.She was dumped by her husband; she knew that marriage actually could not give her any promises. Instead, this man with a strong chest, his promises were more convincing that she does not want to let go.She really doesn\u2019t know where else could she go if she leaves this place, or even if she brought her child alone, with the little amount of money left from her former husband, how could she even survive?Under the huge pressure and fear, Cao Xiong was like a floating log to her survival, which she is trying to hold tightly.Since then, Cheng Wan became Cao Xiong\u2019s lover, and relied on him.Not any longer, she brought her daughter and left the old house where they stayed temporarily, they moved into a new apartment which was prepared by Cao Xiong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the past, she was a burden to the family, which is one of the main reason why her husband disliked her. However, the same thing happened was not a big deal to Cao Xiong.Although Cao Xiong could not give her a proper title, but she was able to live well.His sons have also met Cheng Wan before during unofficial occasions, they even had dinner together.Ever since Cao Xiong had Cheng Wan beside him, supposedly this man should be slowly facing his declining years, but his looks were rejuvenated with youth instead. His sons have only noticed the fact that, even their cold and strong father, also\u2026\u2026would also needed someone to accompany him.Cao Yang and Cao Bin have also observed Cheng Wan before, until they confirmed that she was just a gentle and well-behaved woman, who has not much of excessive desire on materials, nor any wild ambition to pursuit.She alone brought her daughter up, the only wish she wanted was to have a peaceful life.Cao Xiong has even discussed with Cao Yang in secret that, he did not have any intention of increasing a family member for them, he has already gone to the hospital for ligation operation, so that they could be at ease.Their father has sacrificed too much for them, that made the few brothers of the Cao family felt guilty towards him.There may be a lot of woman who can settle his physical desire, but there wasn\u2019t any woman who would truly accompany Cao Xiong. Thus, when Cheng Wan managed to bring happiness to their father, they would also pay their respect to her. Sometimes when they met her, they would politely call her \u201cAunt Cheng\u201d.This woman is soft and obedient, she is just like a plant of dodder flower raised in Cao Xiong\u2019s room, can only be used for relaxing and decorate the scenery to be more pleasing. Even Cao Xiong himself thought the same looking at Cheng Wan.Only that, this plant of dodder flower, particularly gained his favour.Cao Xiong was 16 years older than Cheng Wan, everyone thinks that Cheng Wan would be accompanying Cao Xiong through the rest of his life. No one would have known that the one who passed away first, would be Cheng Wan.More unexpectedly, after this plant of dodder flower has withered, a strong mountain like Cao Xiong, would suddenly looked like half of his life has been sucked away.Cao Xiong thought, it must be because he has gotten old.Because he\u2019s old, so his heart has gotten softer. As time flies, Cheng Wan has deeply rooted inside his heart.He closed his eyes, and recalled what Cheng Wan entrusted him, then gave out a long sigh.The second son, Cao Bin also sighed: \u201cAnnoying, it\u2019s a person!\u201d Not a cat nor a dog, but a woman.The third son Cao Xing had a buff body, his muscles looked like it\u2019ll burst the shirt soon. He looked at his brothers, tried to ask: \u201cWhat about\u2026\u2026 find her something like a boarding school?\u201dThe eldest son in Cao family remained silence and smoked, then said: \u201cNevermind.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen that child, how old was she? Fourteen? Fifteen?\u201d he flicked the ash off the cigarette, \u201cShe lost her mom at this young age\u2026\u2026\u201dCao Bin and Cao Xing didn\u2019t talk anymore.Last time when their mother passed away, one was 12 years old, and another was 10 years old. Even the oldest son, Cao Yang was only 14 years old. They already have intelligence.The fear and sadness they have faced when their mother suddenly passed away, although the memory has faded, but it\u2019s always been there.Especially the situation is different with them, this time it was a girl. Letting her alone outside, what if something bad happens\u2026\u2026\u201cFather will definitely kill us.\u201d Cao Bin put his palm on his forehead.In the end, this matter was decided by the eldest son, Cao Yang.\u201cJust raise her in our house, its not a big deal.\u201d Cao Yang said, \u201cRaise until she finishes her university, in the future if she wants to get married, then prepare her some dowry.\u201dSimple as that, he has already planned out everything for that little girl who he hasn\u2019t met for a long time.He tried to recall and asked: \u201cWhat was the name of that child again?\u201dThis question has trapped his two little brothers. A few years back they had seen this child before, that time she was around ten, or eleven? She was a pretty little girl, but her character was a bit introverted. After she politely greeted everyone then she will hide behind her mother and not talk anymore, she looks very shy. In their impression, she was just like her mother.As for her name\u2026\u2026 Translated by The Novelst\u201cI think it was\u2026\u2026 Xiao Hou? (*It means little monkey in Chinese)\u201d Cao Bin was unsure.Cao Xing immediately burst in laughter.\u201cHow come I also remember her name was called Xiao Hou?\u201d Cao Yang was also uncertain.Cao Xing thumped on the table: \u201cWhat kind of weird name is that?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s true.\u201d Cao Bin said.Nobody knew whether it\u2019s true or not. They have not given any interest to Cheng Wan, what\u2019s more this is only a little girl.Cao Yang asked his second little brother: \u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d\u201cI was thinking of leaving tomorrow.\u201d Cao Bin replied, \u201cBut I\u2019ll just take a look of that little girl first before I leave.\u201dTwo days after, Cao Yang came home during the evening, Butler Zhou called him: \u201cThat child has been here for a while, commander had something came up suddenly, he couldn\u2019t make it. Do you want to have a look?\u201d\u201cHow pitiful of her\u2026\u2026\u201d Butler Zhou added. She had no other relatives, after her mother passed away, she became an orphan.Cao Yang took his army hat and wore back on his head: \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\u201cLiving room.\u201dCao Yang walked passed the conference room, when he arrived to the living room, the sunlight in a summer season is still bright although it\u2019s already evening, it shines into the living room through the window from the west, illuminated the young girl quietly sitting on the sofa.That little girl sat on the soft sofa, but her posture was straight, if only her shoulders were not that small and thin, and her waist was not that slim, she would have a little demeanor of an army.Cao Yang\u2019s footstep stopped, he squinted his eyes as he looks towards the sunlight, that little girl slightly lowered her neck.Slim, that was his first thought. With the strength he has, a simple garrote would break her neck immediately.Snow white, that was his second thought. Under the exposure of the golden sunlight, that neckline of hers was particularly beautiful.Obedient, that was his third thought. That attitude, within her softness there was a sense of obeisance that would satisfy a man.Cao Yang suddenly remembered, that child\u2019s name was not Xiao Hou.Her name was Xiao Rou.Followed by her father\u2019s surname, Xia.She\u2019s called Xia Rou.Xia from the word of summer, and Rou from the word of gentle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After that, the coffee table was changed to another one, same design, but the color seemed to be darker a bit. Probably is because the wood material is different.She wanted to stretch out her hand to feel the texture, whether that wood material really has a moist texture, but at this moment she heard a sonorous footstep getting closer.Deep and steady, every step was at its own pace.Every sound of it, has knocked into her heart, she couldn\u2019t help but her heartbeat fastened, as if it was trying to jump out from her chest.\u201cXia Rou?\u201d Translated by The NovelstThat familiar voice of his, was deep like a cello, calling out her name.Xia Rou\u2019s slim white hand suddenly gripped tightly into a fist. She had a deep breath, then only had the courage to stand up, and turn around\u2026\u2026The man in black uniform is standing just right under the sunlight of the sunset. The sides of that dark uniform was reflected with a layer of gold.Even his facial features were covered with golden light.His stature was tall, standing at a near distance, calmly staring at her.Xia Rou also stared at him, and she couldn\u2019t even\u2026\u2026 let her eyes off.As she was infatuatedly staring at him, she noticed Cao Yang\u2019s sharp gaze has turned gentler, slowly he walked towards her and said in a low voice: \u201cMy condolences.\u201dXia Rou finally realized that her tears had burst out in a line. Immediately she lowered her head and softly wiped out the tears on her face.Just now, Cao Yang has seen her properly, Xia Rou wasn\u2019t the \u201ckid\u201d in his blurry memory anymore. Although her height was only up till his shoulders, but she has already grown up as a maiden.Short hair is cut neatly to the length of her face, surrounded on her sharp little chins. A pair of thin lips were light pink color, lacking some redness. Her lips were tightly closed as if she\u2019s afraid that she\u2019ll say something wrong. She\u2019s wearing a piece of black long sleeved dress, giving more prominence to her snowy white skin.Only that pair of large somber eyes, the moment she put her sight was on him, countless of complex emotion was revealed, as if endless words have been told in her eyes. Those endless words tumbled in her eyes, then fell off on her cheeks, but she herself hasn\u2019t noticed yet.Cao Yang remembered that year when his mother just passed away, those days were so difficult to him. His heart gradually become softer to these memories, a word of \u201ccondolences\u201d doesn\u2019t only show his courtesy, but also a kind of consolation.Now the girl in front of him is bending her head down, looking at her pitch-black hair from top, the more he thinks that she\u2019s just a little kid. She\u2019s completely different from his little brothers, and also the women he made contact before.She\u2019s just a small little girl, who lost her belonging, weak and nobody to rely on.\u201cMy name is Cao Yang.\u201d He said.Big brother\u2026\u2026Xia Rou raised her head, tears can still be seen on her cheeks, she moved her lips, but she voice out to address him.15 years old of Xia Rou was supposed to be unfamiliar with Cao Yang, so she wasn\u2019t qualified to address him as \u201cBig Brother\u201d yet.In the end she lowered back her head and called softly: \u201cBrother Cao Yang.\u201dWhen she lowers her head down, the line of her neck is beautiful, which reminds him of Cheng Wan. Cheng Wan had beautiful temperament that shows her gentleness which is much obvious compared to Xia Rou, probably, this is the reason why father favors her a lot.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d He said.Xia Rou replied with \u201cMm\u201d, then she rubbed off her tears with the back of her hand.Different to what Cao Yang thought, her sadness wasn\u2019t because her mother passed away.Her mother passing away was already 10 years long ago, and she had already walked out from that depressing times. Her tears couldn\u2019t stop was because, she had never thought to have a second chance to meet Cao Yang again.Clearly she remembers, when she fell off from the tall building, the last person who remained in her heart, was big brother Cao Yang\u2019s face.At that time, regrets have filled up her whole chest, so much that it\u2019s trying to puncture her stomach out, just like a sharp knife inside giving her unbearable pain.When she lay on the floor, slowly the blood stained everywhere, her life was slowly fading away.Before the last darkness fully covered her eyesight, she thought, if there is an afterlife\u2026\u2026If there is an afterlife\u2026\u2026I will listen to big brother\u2019s words\u2026\u2026I will not make him mad again\u2026\u2026Thinking back the last time she saw him was when he was in a rage of her, so furious that she didn\u2019t looked at his face properly.When she thought of that, she felt so regretful\u2026\u2026Bringing along the regrets in her heart, she died.However, she had never thought that, when she opened up her eyes, there really is an afterlife!The 25 years old of Xia Rou had died, but reincarnated back to when she was 15 years old.Noticing that her gaze was looking straight, the face she wiped has started to cover with tears again, Cao Yang remained silence. He himself had gone through the pain of losing his mother, of course he would know the sadness of the loved ones leaving him cannot be simply comforted by anyone.He gave her some time to wrap up her emotions, then only lowered his head and told her: \u201cSit down.\u201d\u201cI suppose you have already know right.\u201d He sat opposite to her, \u201cMy father wants you to live in our house.\u201d\u201cYou are still young, we can\u2019t be rest assured letting you alone outside. From now onwards, think of this place as your home.\u201d He said.After he finished, he paused a while and looked at Xia Rou.Xia Rou put her snowy white hands on her laps, slowly she opened her eyes wider, looking at Cao Yang and softly replied: \u201cThank you\u2026\u2026\u201dThank all of you, for giving me a place to stay when I had nobody to rely on.Thank all of you, for tolerating me to stay under this roof, raising me up in such a peaceful environment under your protection.Thank you.I\u2019m sorry. Translated by The NovelstThis is what Xia Rou owed to the Cao Family, the two sentences that she owed to Cao Yang.When she sat in this living room, those memories that was locked up long ago slowly appeared to her mind. Now she remembered, the first day when she stepped into Cao Family, she was completely drowned in sadness and trepidation, she was so miserable that time. Even when the Cao Family decided to take her in, she didn\u2019t even say a \u201cthank you\u201d to them.Moreover, in the future 10 years, she was clutched by her pride and self-inferiority, torturing the family and herself, being hypocritical and pitiful. Don\u2019t even think of showing her gratitude to them.Now, she wanted to thank god from the bottom of her heart, not because she could live again, but because she finally had the chance to tell the Cao Family, \u201cThank you\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although his gaze was already sharp, but compared to ten years after, his razor blade may be sharp enough but still slightly missing a little of momentum.He was fourteen years older than her, at this time\u2026\u2026 he should be only at the age of 29.Her sight stopped on the epaulet on his uniform. A major, he\u2019s already a major at the age of 29, compared to other people in the same age, he was way much faster.But only she would know that he will still walk faster. Around the beginning of next year, he will be gone for half year, and when he comes back, he would already have obtained a first-class merit, and his epaulet would\u2019ve change into lieutenant colonel by then.But what\u2019s more carved in her memory was, the scary gunshot mark right at his lower jaw.If the bullet was shot at lower position, that would be the critical spot of a human body. She can\u2019t help but to be filled with apprehension every time she sees it.Even though that scar doesn\u2019t impair his handsomeness, and it even gave him a sense of mighty.But now, Xia Rou just wanted to have a proper look at Cao Yang\u2019s face, before this piece of white paper covered with scar, she wanted to carve his face deep in her heart.The moment when her eyesight bumped with Cao Yang\u2019s sharp examining gaze, she stopped breathing for a while, then she only realized her inappropriateness.Thus, she looked down again and lowered her neck, as if she was soft and shy like a real young girl at her age of 15.Cao Yang is examining her. Translated by The NovelstJust now when this girl looked at him and said \u201cthank you\u201d, not sure if he mistaken or not, but her gaze was so serious as if she was devoting on him. Especially when she sees him, that pair of somber eyes have flowed out a lot of complicated emotions that he couldn\u2019t understand, he could even feel a faint of infatuation. He found it subtle as a young girl at her age shouldn\u2019t have this kind of emotion.But this does not prevent him from interpreting the meaning of \u201cwanted to get close with him\u201d from her eyes. She didn\u2019t deliberately get close to him just because of the benefits she could get from him, but because she felt relief the moment she saw him that made her feel a sense of secure. Knowing this is especially hard for him to not being nice on her.Maybe it was because girls usually mature earlier, he thought. At the age of fifteen, most of the boys are still running on the field, but girls have already known everything.This early mature happened to be on a girl who had lost both of her parents, even for a man like Cao Yang couldn\u2019t help but naturally feel pity on her.\u201cUnfortunately for today, everyone had something to do.\u201d He said, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be only both of us having dinner together tonight. You may take some rest first, and I\u2019ll call you for dinner later.\u201d\u201cYour room\u2026\u2026 Since it was all a sudden, so the room just started to renovate two days ago, you will need to wait a few days longer before you can move in. My fourth younger brother will be coming back soon, so his study room is under renovation too. The whole second floor is now a mess, nobody can enter yet, you can temporary stay in the side building for now. When everything is done, you can move into the second floor.\u201d He continued.Oh right, fourth brother only came back right after she moved into Cao Family\u2026\u2026Thinking back when she was the closest to this person in the Cao Family, Xia Rou\u2019s felt a little warmer in her heart. She had no objection towards the arrangement of her room at the side building given by Cao Yang, she nodded her head sweetly: \u201cAlright.\u201dThen she quietly followed Butler Zhou to the side building.Cao Yang is very satisfied.As what Cao Bin said, this is not simply raising a pet dog or cat, but a living human. To them, this is inevitably a big burden.Before he met her, he already had some thoughts in mind. If she is obedient, then they will take her as their little sister, accommodate her to study on a university, and help her choose a great husband in the future, and we\u2019ll act as her maiden home. But, if she is a troublemaker, then he will let her live comfortably until she turns into an adult, and give her some money to do whatever she wants. Anyhow, he must help his father to fulfill his promise with Cheng Wan, also to repay back her sturdy feelings towards him for all these years.Fortunately, Xia Rou looked like an obedient child. He hoped that she would behave like her mother and not make any troubles to the family.Bringing Cheng Wan out to his mind, Cao Yang slightly sighed.He recalled back to that year, when his father was infected with acute appendicitis, he had an operation and rested at home. Although there will be professional nurses at home 24 hours taking care of him, Cheng Wan still came for a visit and accompanied him for two days.As the elder son whom is closest to his father, he clearly noticed the sign of happiness written on his father\u2019s eyebrow in those two days. And the reason was only because of that woman who accompanied beside him, reading out the books for him and peeling the apples for him.However, Cheng Wan only stayed for two days before she rushed back home. She still has a child to take care at home, since it\u2019s bad to let her child stay with the babysitter for a long time.This time he can clearly feel the upset from his father.\u201cWhy not ask Aunt Cheng to move into our house?\u201d He asked.But his father closed his eyes and rejected: \u201cNot necessary.\u201dThat time he naively thought that, although his father loved Cheng Wan very much, but not to an extent where he must stay beside her day and night. So he never mentioned about it again.Until now Cheng Wan passed away, his father suddenly looked like he gotten older in just a few days, that was when he was finally got enlightened.His father\u2026\u2026 has been trying to protect this house carefully. He protected them since they were young and maintained the peace of the family. Even after they had grown up, he doesn\u2019t let anybody to separate him and his sons.Every young man out there usually has a wife to accompany him when he got old, in order to protect this house, his father had sacrificed himself, and the price of this was being alone when he got old.Third and fourth brother was still young, they couldn\u2019t understand it yet.But he and his second brother, Cao Bin, had always felt sad for their father.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She will be taking care of everything in the household. You may seek her for assistance if you need anything.\u201dIt was true that she has served the Cao Family for many years, especially in a house without a mistress, the position of this housekeeper lady was like the hostess of the family.Xia Rou hid her thoughts carefully. After living for ten years in the Cao Family, no matter how foolish she had been in the past, she should show some improvements by now.\u201cMiss Xia.\u201d The lady addressed her with a serious face.After Butler Zhou left, Lady Fang lead the way to Xia Rou\u2019s room. She took a look at the few pieces of luggage on the floor and said: \u201cYou can take out a few clothes for the season, the renovation on the main building will be finished in another half month. It\u2019ll be more convenient to tidy up after you move in.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Xia Rou nodded her head. Translated by The NovelstLooking at how well she behaved, Lady Fang\u2019s expression became gentler, at least this girl who was now living under someone else\u2019s roof didn\u2019t get on a her high horse. Lady Fang stared at her black dress and asked: \u201cHas your mother\u2019s first seventh* passed yet?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Xia Rou replied, \u201cToday is the seventh day\u2026\u2026\u201dWhat an ill-fated child, Lady Fang thought, but she still wanted to remind her: \u201cAfter today, it\u2019s better not to wear black again. After all, this is someone else\u2019s house, it\u2019s not proper.\u201dBlack is the symbol of death; what Xia Rou wearing was actually mourning apparel.Xia Rou stared at Lady Fang as she spaced out for a moment.Thanks to her mother, she was able to be under the care of Cao Family. However, it was not suitable for her to continue wearing mourning apparel, as it might bring bad luck to their family. With all the life experience she had, Xia Rou understood that Lady Fang\u2019s reminder was truly out of kindness.When she finally came back to her senses, she nodded: \u201cI understand.\u201dAfter a pause, she hesitated, but she still managed to speak out in a soft voice: \u201cThank you\u2026\u2026\u201dSeeing the child obediently listening to her advice, Lady Fang\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t as serious. Although she didn\u2019t like the child\u2019s status, she still pitied her for becoming an orphan; her eyes when she looked at her were friendlier now.\u201cWash your face.\u201d Lady Fang pointed at her eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t use warm water, your eyes will get swollen. Use cold water instead, to recover faster.\u201dUntil Lady Fang left Xia Rou\u2019s room, Xia Rou was still touching her swollen eyes while blanking out.This\u2026\u2026 What was this situation?She could obviously feel the kindness coming from Lady Fang, but\u2026\u2026 Lady Fang\u2019s attitude was so different now. In her memory, this woman always had a gentle smile when she faced the Cao Family\u2019s four brothers; when she faced her, she would have a stern face like a stepmother.This reality was such a huge contrast to Xia Rou\u2019s memory that she felt confused.She shook her head, opened up one of her luggage bags and took out the clothes she needed for the season. One by one she hung her clothes in the closet, and her other colorful shirts were kept in other boxes. As for now, only the plain colored shirts were suitable for her to wear.As she hung up one of her black dresses in the closet, she was suddenly thought of a memory.That\u2019s right, 10 years ago in her past life, Lady Fang had also given her the same advice, reminding her not to wear mourning apparel in the house.Guess what? Did she listen?Nope, not at all! Translated by The NovelstShe at the age of 15 still couldn\u2019t understand how the people of the world respected each other. In fact, she was distorted with rage. Her mother had just passed away, so why couldn\u2019t she wear mourning apparel for her?Not only she did she not listen to Lady Fang\u2019s advice, she even persisted to wear all kinds of black outfits in the next few months. What was even more ridiculous was that she felt so righteous and justified in her actions.Xia Rou stared at that black dress with her mouth open. She couldn\u2019t even imagine what the Cao Family had thought of her!How immature of her back when she was 15\u2026\u2026But\u2026\u2026 in her memories, the Cao Family\u2026 \u00a0hadn\u2019t even said a word about it\u2026\u2026 the only person to show her displeasure was Lady Fang. Was that why Lady Fang had always been so cold to her?This was something that Xia Rou had never thought about. Before this she had always thought Lady Fang despised her simply because she was the child of a mistress. The words Lady Fang said, and the suggestions she gave, were all considered by Xia Rou to be unreasonable demands in her book.Xia Rou sat beside the bed, both of her hands covering her face, a sense of helpless fully occupying her heart.A big family has a lot of members, and the same went for trouble. Those troubles\u2026\u2026 You can\u2019t handle it. Big brother Cao Yang had sat in front of his desk and explained to her.She still remembers how tightly he furrowed his eyebrows.She had sat right across from him, her face hot, and only felt that her existence had been denied. She couldn\u2019t tell him how sad she was, so she stubbornly decided to be more persistent on her own.How helpless had her big brother felt for her during that time?He leaned on the desk and smoked for a long time, staring at her without moving an inch. She doesn\u2019t have the courage to meet his eyes, all she could do was lower her head and bite her lips, but persistently refuse to change her statement. In the end, he pinched off the cigarette butt on the ashtray, and took a long sigh.Fine, if you want to think of it that way, then let it be so. He stretched out his hand to rub her hair, and spoke softly\u2026\u2026 As long as big brother is here, I should be able to protect you\u2026\u2026In the end, she died just like that, at a place he couldn\u2019t reach!*Notes: First seventh: According to Chinese beliefs, the first seven days are believed to be when the spirit of the decease will be granted leave to visit their home.Proofread by: HannahSo glad that I found an editor and I would like to welcome her abroad ^^Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those people, those matters, she couldn\u2019t even handle it!And now, she had reincarnated back to her fifteen-year-old self, as a person who died once before. Xia Rou had to go through all the things she had experienced in the past. But today was only the third day of her new life, and the first day she stepped into Cao Family, and also the day where she first made contact with a few of the people in Cao Family! And that just made her realize, everything wasn\u2019t the same as she remembered in her past memories.Not even bringing up the other families and stuff, even with just the Cao Family, she actually had never understood them before.She smiled bitterly. Translated by The NovelstOnce again, she realized a new recognition in herself.She rubbed her face, and glanced around the room. At least the room was the same as she remembered. Although the room wasn\u2019t as gorgeous as those in the main building, it was clean and tidy.Because fourth brother was coming back soon, in order to fulfill his request, his study room at the main building was being renovated. Before the renovation could finish, Cheng Wan passed away, and Cao Xiong decided to take Xia Rou in. Hence, they might as well refurbish the room at the other side of the second floor while they were at it to make her a bedroom. In the meantime, she was arranged to stay at the side building during construction.Now that she thought of it, everything did make sense.Why did she have such a huge grievance in the past? Why did she feel she was being looked down upon, deliberately ignored by everyone? Just because the others who lived in the side building were aunty, the housekeeper, the driver and the chef?So she thought that letting her stay in the side building was mainly because they despised her status as the child of the mistress?Bringing along the rage, she never listened to Lady Fang\u2019s advice and always acted contrarily\u2026 Such unfavorable actions on her part, but Xia Rou had always put the fault on other people, thinking that they were looking down on her.Given another chance at life, she re-examined herself and finally realized that all the person who had continuously looked down on her, was herself.Her inferiority has been torturing her like that, never letting her off.And her excessive self-esteem was two sides of a coin when combined with her inferiority. Such as opposed to Lady Fang, such as not listening to big brother\u2019s advice, stubbornly getting engaged with someone\u2026\u2026Her only thoughts were to be able to raise her head in front of the Cao Family, to show them how well she lived, and how she had a decent life, however\u2026\u2026 she always found herself in a fix.Those days she was putting the blame on others, but now that she thought of it, she shouldn\u2019t have any complaints.If she hadn\u2019t insist, and simply had not thrown tantrums, with the personality of her big brother that had always shielded her shortcomings and made arrangements for her, she could definitely have lived a smooth life.In response to his words, why did she refuse to listen?Xia Rou also\u2026\u2026 couldn\u2019t understand herself\u2026\u2026She soaked the towel in cold water and rubbed her eyes.She raised her head, the reflection from the mirror was a pale white face, sharp chin and light brows. She looked very cold when she wasn\u2019t smiling, as though she was trying to keep people a thousand miles away.This was how she looked at the age of fifteen.Xia Rou subconsciously touched her face\u2026\u2026Why did she reincarnate? What virtues did she have to get another chance at life?Dinner was only the two of them, Cao Yang and Xia Rou.When Xia Rou came down to the dining room, Cao Yang was already there waiting for her.\u201cAt first we thought to gather around for dinner to welcome you, but in the end something came up for everyone.\u201d Cao Yang said.His tone wasn\u2019t very sincere. As for them, welcoming her was just giving her face. Even if they didn\u2019t welcome her, she could also say nothing.Xia Rou thought, maybe this is how it works. Translated by The NovelstShe was not a princess, she was just an orphan who lived under someone else\u2019s roof and was in debt to their kindness. To the men of Cao Family, any work-related business or social activities were way more important than her. They won\u2019t specially rush back just for her since they were busy, and it was natural to be that way, especially to someone like her. But that didn\u2019t mean they looked down on her.She couldn\u2019t understand why she would care about these little things in the past. Holding on to her grudges, she didn\u2019t come down for breakfast the next morning, using the excuse that she was \u201cnot feeling well.\u201dThe dining room was very quiet.Cao Yang grabbed the food, and took a glance at the girl.Great, this girl is very quiet. If she could be this quiet forever, that would be best.To give her food, clothes and shelter, and then let her study in a university. The way she looked now, she didn\u2019t seem to be troublesome.At least until now, he was satisfied with Xia Rou\u2019s performance.After dinner, Xia Rou put down her chopsticks and asked: \u201cDo I need to wait for Uncle Cao?\u201dShe had been living the same way as the Cao Family for ten years, and she adopted the habit of straightening her back.Cao Yang looked at her posture, he felt it was pleasing. He glanced the clock on the wall and replied: \u201cNo need, you can take a rest for now.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u2026\u201d Xia Rou hesitated. She recalled her discourtesies in the past and didn\u2019t want to repeat her clumsy actions. Since she had the chance to reset everything, she wanted to do things she hadn\u2019t managed to last time.Cao Yang liked her politeness, even his eyebrows were gentler than before: \u201cIt\u2019s the same if you see him tomorrow.\u201dThe somber eyes of Xia Rou stared at him for a while, then she obediently said okay and added: \u201cThen I\u2019ll be going back first.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Cao Yang nodded.His sight followed the back of her slim body until she left the building, he rubbed his chin.The feeling was really different when there was a girl in the house. Moreover, she was completely different to the women he knew, didn\u2019t act coquettish nor did she cling on someone easily. She was also different to the boys in the army, the voice when she spoke was soft and tiny.It was quite comfortable to listen to her voice.It was just that pair of somber eyes, he felt that there was something hiding in within those eyes, something that didn\u2019t belong to a 15 year old lady.He found it weird.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moment she opened her eyes, she thought she was dreaming a dream that took her back in time to where she and her mother lived in a duplex apartment. Even though when she had moved back to the apartment and had it renovated entirely, it wasn\u2019t the same apartment anymore.She felt like she was sleepwalking and wandered around the apartment, staring at those familiar details that she had already forgotten a long time ago. Walking down the stairs she could see a portrait of Cheng Wan hanging in the living room, and she was questioning herself: Why did she dream back to the time when her mother had just passed away? Maybe this wasn\u2019t a dream after all; had she died and had her soul returned back to this place?In the end she was awakened by the sound of the doorbell. It was Butler Zhou accompanying the lawyer to come over and have her sign the contract.Including this apartment, there were two more shop lots that was under her mother\u2019s name and both had inestimable value. The rent price alone could already afford her a better life compared to normal people.And of course, all of these were given to her mother by Cao Xiong.Cao Xiong had promised to take care of her, and he would definitely have fulfilled his promise.These properties were inherited by Xia Rou after Cheng Wan passed away.Xia Rou felt muddleheaded. She robotically followed the lawyer\u2019s instructions and signed her name on a few of the documents. She started to feel as though something was off.The details of this dream were too accurate to be true!A real dream should be blurry, constantly leaping over the time and disjointed. But this dream! Even the door number of the properties were noted down clearly on the contract.Xia Rou had always been bad at memorizing things. Since she didn\u2019t need to worry about the shop lots, so she roughly knew the location of the shops, but she couldn\u2019t remember the exact shop number. She stared at the address and numbers that were written out clearly in the contract, clutched the pen, and finally raised her head.\u201cButler Zhou\u2026\u2026 I, I\u2019m not dreaming right now, right?\u201d She was uncertain.The young girl who just lost her only family had a pale face, and she even asked a weird question out of nowhere. Butler Zhou looked at her and felt pity in his heart.Butler Zhou was Cao Xiong\u2019s driver. For someone like Cao Xiong, no matter where he goes, there would be driver and bodyguards following around him, whether for official work or even\u2026\u2026 private affairs. That\u2019s why, Butler Zhou has known Xia Rou for a long time. He could even say he watched Xia Rou grow up.He let out a sigh, and comforted her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the commander is still here, he won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201dThe lawyer was also one of their people, he did not avoid the conversation but went straight to the point: \u201cI was going to tell you later, but the commander has arranged for you to live in his house, so he can take care of you. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t have to worry about a thing.\u201dXia Rou was still holding the pen and blankly staring at him.In their perspective, this girl had too many shocks within these two days, so she couldn\u2019t digest the information any further. They tried to coax her into finish signing the documents until finally they felt relieved to accomplish their mission.Before Butler Zhou left, he urged her again and again: \u201cYou should have some rest, tomorrow I\u2019ll be coming over to help on packing up your stuffs. You can start packing up the important things first, as for the others\u2026\u2026 You can deal with it slowly afterwards.\u201dAfter Butler Zhou left, Xia Rou was standing in front of the door staring outside the gate for some time, then she turned around and went to the kitchen. She searched around and found a fruit knife. Staring at her pale left hand, slowly\u2026\u2026 she sliced on her palm!Ouch! Translated by The NovelstShe only had a small cut on her palm, but there\u2019s already blood dripping out, she could clearly feel the pain.The fruit knife fell out from her hand and clattered on the floor, Xia Rou was still staring at her palm, confirmed that she wasn\u2019t dreaming at all.She had reincarnated.Xia Rou fell back and laid on the soft bed, then stared blankly at the ceiling.Why, why would a foolish person like her\u2026\u2026 be able to obtain blessings from the god, and get another chance to reset her life?She thought deeply for a long time, but couldn\u2019t find an answer. She felt her brain was all jumbled up.She sighed and crawled up from her bed and took out the paper money she had bought on the way to meet the Cao Family. Today was Cheng Wan\u2019s seventh day, so she should offer some money to her.On the way back, it was Butler Zhou who had reminded her: \u201cToday is your mother\u2019s seventh day right?\u201dThat was how she remembered. Thus, she asked Butler Zhou to stop the car in front of a shop, then went out of the car to buy some candles and paper money.She couldn\u2019t recall whether Butler Zhou had reminded her about this matter in the past, but now that she thought of it, at that time she was deep in grief by the shock of her mother\u2019s death, and she never even thought of offering some paper money to her mother on the seventh day.She rummaged through her bag before realizing she didn\u2019t buy a lighter from the shop. She thought it over again, then went out and knocked on Lady Fang\u2019s door.Lady Fang understood what she\u2019s trying to do, she took a glimpse at her then led her to the kitchen to find a lighter for her. Then she went to the other side to find her a washbowl.\u201cBurn it in this washbowl, it\u2019ll be easier to clean.\u201d Lady Fang said.Then she was brought to a corner of the courtyard. Lady Fang snapped off a branch and taught her to draw circles on the floor: \u201cThe circle must be round and connected, so the things you\u2019ve burn will be sent to the hands of your family.\u201dXia Rou had already known all these sorts of things, but she can sense the kindness from Lady Fang, so she still said, \u201cThank you,\u201d from her heart.Under the yellowish lighting shining on the courtyard, there was a slim girl kneeled on the ground burning some paper money for her deceased mother\u2026\u2026 The picture was quite upsetting.Lady Fang did not leave, and instead sighed and kneeled down to help Xia Rou out. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou was able to see Lady Fang in the darkness of the night and noticed her expression looking gentler than usual, not as cold as she recalled from her memories.She lowered her eyelids, staring at the orange fire dancing in the bowl. In her heart, she thought why? Why did Lady Fang treat her differently than before?Was it because she had changed? Because she didn\u2019t hold a grudge nor try to be pitiful on her own, and was also not putting up thorns all over her body, is that why people treated her better this time?\u201cYou have always lived with your mother right? Is it because your father passed away?\u201d Lady Fang asked while she was burning the paper money.\u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d Xia Rou\u2019s face was reflected by the fire light, so she didn\u2019t look as pale, at least she her face had some warmth now. \u201cBoth of my parents had divorced, my father walked away with another woman.\u201dLady Fang was silent for a moment and asked: \u201cDo you still have contact with him?\u201dXia Rou shook her head: \u201cNot anymore. He left when I was only seven, I\u2019ve never seen him after that.\u201dProofread by: HannahComments: Thanks for all the support, your comments have given me a boost! \ud83d\ude09Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He always keeps his words, just like that time\u2026\u2026 he said he won\u2019t get married again, and he never had a wife again.\u201dLady Fang shook her head as she spoke about Cao Xiong.The reason why she was slightly unhappy with Xia Rou\u2019s status was indeed because she was a child of a mistress. In the past she had owed some favors to Madam Cao, so naturally she would be slightly against the existence of Xia Rou and Cheng Wan. But once she really thought about iit, Madam Cao had already passed away for about 7 or 8 years by the time Cheng Wan and Cao Xiong met. Although Cheng Wan wasn\u2019t given a title, but she was not someone who barged into someone else\u2019s marriage either.Lady Fang put her gaze back on Xia Rou\u2019s quiet and delicate appearance, and that slight conflict in her mind disappeared. All that was left in her heart was her uncontrollable pity for this child who lost both her father and her mother.When Lady Fang raised her eyes, she was slightly stunned.That child was fixedly looking right at her, with that pair of pitch-black eyes reflecting the orange flame burning crisply in front of them.Those eyes of hers, was so deep that it didn\u2019t seem to match with her age at all.That\u2019s what Lady Fang thought in her mind, then she heard Xia Rou reply: \u201cOkay, I understand.\u201dXia Rou understood very well the fact that the men in Cao Family tend to keep their promises.Neither of them said anything until the paper money was finished burning. When the fire was extinguished, Lady Fang opened a bottle of mineral water and poured over the tiny sparks left in the bowl.\u201cDon\u2019t move it yet, it\u2019s still hot. Wait till it cools down before cleaning up.\u201d As Lady Fang was speaking, she tried to get up, but her body wobbled.Xia Rou immediately supported her with one hand.Lady Fang massaged her back and sighed: \u201cI\u2019m old enough already, my back isn\u2019t functioning well anymore. Sigh, time flies in just a blink of an eye\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou may take a rest first.\u201d Xia Rou said, \u201cYou can leave the rest to me, I know where to throw these away\u2026\u2026\u201dLady Fang looked at the bowl to confirm the fire was extinguished completely, then answered: \u201cAlright, be careful not to burn yourself.\u201d Afterwards, she went back while pounding at her waist.Xia Rou sat on the floor rubbing her numb legs as she waited for the bowl to cool.She subconsciously raised her head to look at the main building. There was a shadow right in front of the window on the third floor, and she could see an orange spot flickering around.It must be big brother standing by the window to take a smoke, she thought.Because that room was supposed to be Cao Yang\u2019s bedroom, while her bedroom was right on top his.He stood at the windowside, as if he had been staring at her the whole time, but she couldn\u2019t confirm that. The courtyard was quite dark although it illuminated by a gentle light, he would only be able to see a blurry shadow from that distance, would he able to recognize her?She squinted her eyes while looking in his direction. No matter how hard she looked it remained to her black shadow, so she withdrew her gaze.This courtyard wasn\u2019t very different in her memories, only that the trees here should be taller and thicker. The trees would look particularly like a gigantic green umbrella when it became summer. The sunlight would shine through the small gaps between the leaves, and she would sit under the tree to read her favorite books. It was much more comfortable than staying inside an air-conditioned room.Now when she remembered the days when she was still a student, she didn\u2019t really need to worry about anything. Her life could have been as carefree as now.But again, she had always been troubled by her status in the house.\u201cThe mistress\u2019 daughter\u201d seemed like a curse to her, just like a huge net tightly wrapped around her\u2026\u2026Cao Yang was having a smoke by the window, he saw that Xia Rou went out to burn some paper money. It was only then that he remembered, today was Cheng Wan\u2019s seventh day.What a tactful child, he thought. At least she knows to burn paper money for her mother. If it was some other child at her age put into the same situation, he would bet the child wouldn\u2019t even know what to do without the advice of their elders.Lady Fang had gone back, yet that child was sitting right under the tree spacing out, and he didn\u2019t know what she could be thinking about. He kept staring at her the whole time, until she seemed to lift herself out of a fog. She rubbed her knees and stood up, took the bowl and walked away.Just then he finished smoking the cigarette, turning around to pinch the fiery end off into the ashtray.Later that night, he caught a glimpse of car light flashing by the window, so he went down. The living room on the first floor was dark, only a dim red light flickered from the outside.The first one to come home was Cao Xiong.\u201cFather.\u201d He walked to him.His voice pulled out Cao Xiong from his memories back to reality, as if the sound tore the darkness apart.\u201cHaven\u2019t gone to sleep yet?\u201d Cao Xiong asked.\u201cIt\u2019s still early.\u201d Cao Yang replied, he switching on a table lamp beside the sofa.Although the light was gentle, Cao Xiong couldn\u2019t adapt to the sudden light and slightly squinted his eyes.\u201cHas she arrived?\u201d He asked.Cao Yang knew that he was asking about Xia Rou, so he replied: \u201cShe arrived at night and had dinner with me.\u201d\u201cIs she okay?\u201d\u201cShe looks fine. She cried for a bit so she\u2019s probably still upset. Just give her some comfort. She even burnt some paper money for Aunt Cheng just now.\u201d He thought of it and added: \u201cQuite sensible, and quiet.\u201dCao Xiong didn\u2019t speak anymore, he smoked silently.After a while, he seemed to tire and pinched the end off the cigarette.\u201cI\u2019ll entrust her to you.\u201d He said, \u201cTake good care of her; take her as your little sister.\u201dHis wife had passed away early and his eldest son had already learned to be independent. Not only he could he take care of himself, he was also able to look after his little brothers very well. So, Cao Xiong was very assured in entrusting Xia Rou to him.She was the daughter of Cheng Wan, the last person that Cheng Wan worried about, so he was determined to be nice to her.But that child didn\u2019t really like to get close to him, and at times she even avoided him him.He couldn\u2019t do anything about it.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After lunch, she took some pills and went to bed. When she woke up to look out the window to see the sky turning dark, snowflakes swirling in the air, she couldn\u2019t tell the time.She was thirsty and her throat was dry, so she went down barefoot to grab a drink.She didn\u2019t need to put on shoes or even socks in the winter, since the apartment\u2019s marble-covered floor was very warm. Her footsteps were very quiet when she walked through the apartment, like a little cat\u2019s.As she passed through the living room, she noticed Cheng Wan\u2019s sweater was on the floor, so naturally she went over to pick it up. Raising her head, she saw another article of clothing \u2013 a black uniform that seemed to belong to Cao Xiong that was crumpled right in front of the door to Cheng Wan\u2019s bedroom.Xia Rou, blanking out for a moment, subconsciously went over and picked it up. She then heard a strange sound coming from the direction of the unlatched door\u2026The silly ten year old opened the door up a crack\u2026.The two shirts fell again to the floor, while Xia Rou ran skittering away using both her hands and legs to climb back up the stairs.After a while, Cheng Wan went upstairs to take a look at her, noticing Xia Rou lying inside the blankets with a red face and a higher temperature than usual. Cheng Wan thought she was seriously ill, not realizing that the adult interactions between herself and Cao Xiong had been exposed to her daughter.Ever since that time, Xia Rou had been troubled by the scene burned into her mind \u2013 a strong man, moving rhythmically while a woman with slim hands clutched the man\u2019s shoulder like a vine. She finally understood why her mother had insisted on using the downstairs bedroom when there were still many empty rooms upstairs.From that day onwards, whenever Cao Xiong would come to their house and stay overnight, Xia Rou would hide in her room and not budge at all.Cheng Wan was very annoyed by this and complained about the matter several times to Cao Xiong, saying that she didn\u2019t know why her daughter had suddenly become so introverted.The thing was that Cheng Wan didn\u2019t realize, but Cao Xiong was well aware of it all.He had sharp ears, especially at that time, whe heard a slight noise from outside the room. When he left, he saw their clothing in a pile on the floor. When he asked Cheng Wan who was home, he realized that it was Xia Rou, out sick from school.To think that a little girl saw him doing that sort of thing, even Cao Xiong felt awkward, so he didn\u2019t say anything to Cheng Wan.But after that incident, the child who would always hide behind Cheng Wan every time he saw her would lower her head and remain silent. He couldn\u2019t do anything about it.Xiao Rou didn\u2019t actually hate Cao Xiong. Translated by The NovelstStarting from the age of seven, she had already started to remember things. How her father cruelly left them, seeing her weak mother attempting to commit suicide, all of these were carved into her heart.It was Cao Xiong who appeared at a crucial point in time and saved her mother. It was also he who had arranged them a safe place to live.She could vaguely understand that the only reason she and her mother had such a peaceful life was all thanks to this man. The only thing she never understood was why exactly he would do such things for them, and never thought deeper on the subject.Once, she\u2019d even hoped that Cao Xiong could be her father. He was reliable and gave her a feeling of security, even sometimes staying overnight at their house.Seeing him seated in the living room, contentedly staring at her mother making him tea gave Xia Rou a sense of peace she had never had before in her short life.But after that incident, all these idyllic scenes seemed to have been unmasked. The adult world was forcefully revealed to her.At she was able to understand the relationship between Cao Xiong and her mother, the source of the peace in their lives.Xia Rou\u2019s disappointment was inevitable. But the real impact that shook her worldview was due to the housekeeping aunt; the derision she received was a fatal blow.In the courtyard, Xia Rou had coincidentally heard the housekeeping aunt at her house gossiping with the neighbors.\u201cOur house owner is actually a mistress of someone else\u2019s husband.\u201d\u201cThat man is a high-ranking official.\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, she\u2019s already in her thirties. She\u2019s good considering her age isn\u2019t young anymore.\u201d\u201cThat child of hers, I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s an illegitimate child. But looking at her, she doesn\u2019t really resemble the official.\u201d\u201cHahaha, then she must be the mistress\u2019 daughter!\u201d Translated by The NovelstAt that moment, Xiao Rou was still so young that although she heard it all, she didn\u2019t have the courage to argue with them. She could only swallow her shame and run away.Afterwards, Xia Rou begged her mother to fire the housekeeping aunt, but never told her the reason behind her sudden request. Cheng Wan had been helpless, and had listened to her words and fired her at the insistence of her daughter.Cheng Wan\u2019s personality had always been as such. When someone exerted force, she would choose to simply be obedient. It was really luck that had brought her to Cao Xiong after she had been dumped by her former husband.Slowly, Xia Rou learned that her mother was just like a dodder flower. Even if you provided her sunlight and soil, she couldn\u2019t live unless you gave her a tree she could climb on.No matter how she looked at herself, she felt like she was no different than her mother. So when she had finally started puberty, she felt a growing, enormous fear that she would ultimately become a woman like Cheng Wan.A dodder flower that could not live without having someone at her side\u2026Xia Rou, going through puberty, had fallen into paranoia, trying as hard as she could to deviate her path from her mother\u2019s. This paranoia pushed her into a stubborn little girl who didn\u2019t like to take other people\u2019s advice, often covering herself with thorns to keep them away.Obviously, she didn\u2019t have the ability to back it up, but she\u2019d spent her life trying to act strong.Every time she struggled to grasp her pride in front of Cao Yang, she would always fall like a drowned mouse, having no choice but to rely on him to clean up her mess\u2026Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her first thought was of how stupid she had been.Not everyone could be as smart, strong and decisive as the brothers of the Cao Family. In this world, there was an existence as foolish as herself, what could she do?No matter how hard she tried, no matter how fast she tried to keep pace, she always fell behind. Soon, she found herself becoming more and more inferior to even their shadows.The more inferior she felt, the more she cared about her pride, turning into a vicious cycle.The arrangements made by Cao Xiong, the advice he had given her \u2013 now that she was trying to recall, weren\u2019t they all for her own good? In this world, excluding the Cao Family, even her blood-related father wouldn\u2019t be as good to her.Other people saw through her and tried to take advantage of her relationship to the Cao Family to try and gain benefits for themselves.The people who had actually cared for her and protected her were the brothers of the Cao Family!Big brother\u2026.I\u2019m sorry\u2026I\u2019m so sorry!Her big brother saw her as his real sister while raising her, and imagining the news of her death reaching him, how angry would he have been? And how sad he would have been.He definitely would have sought revenge for her, right? Translated by The NovelstAlthough Xia Rou wasn\u2019t able to see it with her own eyes, she knew that Cao Yang definitely would have helped her seek vengeance.Xia Rou covered her face, but the tears still flowed out from beneath her fingers, gleaming in the dawn light, soaking her pillow through.Sorry\u2026So sorry!I truly feel regret\u2026 for not listening to your words\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In this life, on the second day of her move, Xia Rou did not act as she had in the past, holding grudges and feeling looked down upon; falsely claiming that she was sick, refusing to go into the main building for breakfast.She got up early, using some cold water to reduce the appearance of her red, swollen eyes. Looking at her appearance made her slightly depressed.Opening up her closet, she put all her black dresses to the side, choosing a plain-colored one piece. When she heard the knock on her door, she fixed her bangs at the mirror and then went to open the door.Just like in her past, it was Lady Fang who knocked on the door, but her attitude was much better compared to back then. Lady Fang stared at Xia Rou\u2019s dress, satisfied that the child had listened to her advice. The pity she felt toward her slowly turned into fondness.In the eyes of an elder, an obedient child was usually lovely.\u201cBreakfast is held in the main building, let\u2019s go and not let them wait for you too long,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know where the dining room is, or do you need me to accompany you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I was there yesterday,\u201d said Xia Rou in a well-behaved manner. \u201cYou can continue your work, I can find it myself.\u201dBy the time she arrived to the dining room, the three men she wasn\u2019t able to meet last night had already appeared.\u201cXia Rou, come and sit over here.\u201d Cao Yang greeted immediately when he saw her. The men at the table all turned their gazes to her.Xia Rou was stunned when she took her first look at Cao Xiong. She couldn\u2019t believe how young he appeared for his age.In her memories, Cao Xiong was already a man with a head full of white hair in his declining years. But the Cao Xiong in front of her was maintained very well despite being over the age of 50. Only a few white hairs could be seen on his head, giving his overall appearance the look of an energetic middle-aged man.Why, then, in her memory had he aged so quickly after only 10 years?It was the first time Cao Xiong laid eyes on Xia Rou since Cheng Wan was buried. Although only a few days had passed, his keen observation was able to tell that the young lady in front of him was somehow different to the little girl who had passed out at the funeral.Even the way she looked at him, her gaze wasn\u2019t as usual, trying to avoid his line of sight lowering her head, attempting to avoid talking with him.It had been a few years since she had looked him straight in the eye, so long that he had already forgotten that her eyes resembled those of Cheng Wan greatly.He seemed to lose himself for a moment, picturing that gentle and beautiful woman again in his mind\u2019s eye. But as he inspected her closer, he noticed that Xia Rou\u2019s eyes were much deeper than those of Cheng Wan, but her gentleness and charm fell short of Cheng Wan\u2019s.He felt a sense of disappointment in his heart.\u201cXia Rou.\u201d He forcefully interrupted his emotions and greeted her, \u201cCome and eat.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Xia Rou lowered her head and replied gently. \u201cUncle.\u201dAll of the men saw a teardrop twinkle through the air and drop onto the girl\u2019s shoe. The dining room all stood still for a moment.The one to break the silence first was Cao Xiong\u2019s second son, Cao Bin.\u201cYou\u2019re a grown lady now.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you still remember me?\u201dHow could she forget?Xia Rou sat right beside Cao Yang, and looked at Cao Bin.Second brother.\u201cCao Bin brother.\u201d She addressed him softly.Then she turned her head to the opposite side toward Cao Xing.Third brother. Translated by The Novelst\u201cCao Xing brother.\u201d She greeted him as well.Including Cao Xiong and the fourth brother who was still abroad, the people at this table were those who really cared about her and treated her well.They gave her a peaceful life and tolerated all of her childish, stubborn behavior. Regardless of their opposition, she had insisted on her engagement. No matter how helpless they had felt on her behalf, they still came out and acted on behalf of her maiden name.But she\u2026 she let them down.Xia Rou pinched her palms to bring herself out of it, she didn\u2019t want to affect the atmosphere and bring it down any longer.All the men saw her struggling to control her own emotions and sighed secretly in relief. They had experience handling adult women, but they were completely lost on how to treat a young girl life Xia Rou.Even Cao Xiong didn\u2019t really know what to do. His sons were trained in the ways of a soldier, but those sorts of methods didn\u2019t seem suitable to be used on a little girl who had such thin shoulders, slim arms and skinny face.They looked at each other, all thinking the same thing.Their house suddenly had an extra child, how in the world\u2026 would they raise this child?Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But today was an exception, as they had all waited for Xia Rou without touching the food.In the past, Xia Rou thought that she was being disrespected because nobody rushed back to have dinner with her, so she held onto that grudge and didn\u2019t go to eat breakfast together the next day. But she hadn\u2019t known that\u2026 everyone had actually been waiting for her.That\u2019s right, all the people of this household were actually very busy. Something came up all of a sudden and they were all called in, wasn\u2019t it normal that they couldn\u2019t rush back? In fact, nobody had ever looked down on her. All this time she had been looking to calculate in every detail to validate her existence, but the person who had been looking down on Xia Rou the most was always herself!\u201cXia Rou\u2019s seated posture\u2026\u2026\u201d Cao Bin took a few glances at Xia Rou and smiled, \u201cShe looks just like someone from our family, people might even think she\u2019s participated in army training before.\u201dThe men turned their eyes toward Xia Rou. Her back was straight as a ruler and her shoulders pushed back. If her body had not been so slim, her posture indeed looked like she was personally trained by the Cao Family.Cao Xiong didn\u2019t remember whether Xia Rou had always been like this, since she had always avoided him. But he had been enlisted in the army for so many years that even his sons were trained up in the military way. He felt comfortable when looking at her upright posture. He nodded his head to agree with his son.\u201cWhat year are you in now?\u201d Cao Bin asked.Xia Rou put down her chopsticks on the bowl: \u201cNinth grade, I just finished my junior exams.\u201d\u201cEh, doesn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re going to be a senior soon?\u201d Cao Bin continued to ask. Translated by The NovelstCao Xiong glanced at Xia Rou and asked: \u201cWhich high school are you planning to go to?\u201dAt that time, the junior exams had just ended, so she hadn\u2019t yet received any acceptance letters from the high school yet. But the reincarnated Xia Rou already knew what was going to happen, and so she hesitated: \u201cI haven\u2019t received an acceptance letter yet, but my results are out\u2026 I think I should be going to Seventeen High School.\u201dAs she spoke about her results, her cheeks flushed: \u201cI\u2019m quite stupid, so my grades aren\u2019t so great either\u2026\u201dIf it had been the past, she would definitely have felt extremely embarrassed at having to admit her stupidity and mediocrity in front of the Cao Family. However, after her first death, she felt as though her heart had become more transparent.Trying to hide her true self in front of all these exceptional people\u2026 In their eyes, they must have thought she was the most foolish person of all.People didn\u2019t judge others for being stupid, but rather preferred that to someone who didn\u2019t even have self-awareness. Worst of all in her case, not only did she refuse to acknowledge her limits, but she even tried to act full of herself. Those sorts of people were the most troublesome.This young lady should, as she entered adolescence, be at that age where girls were usually concerned about their pride. But she calmly admitted her own weaknesses and did so with a firm gaze. Even the men in the Cao Family couldn\u2019t withstand her charm and started to have a favorable impression of her.\u201cSeventeen High School, huh\u2026\u201d Cao Bin\u2019s gaze was sincere as he rubbed at his chin and mumbled a response.Cao Xiong interrupted him abruptly: \u201cLook for your uncle and ask him to transfer her to a better school.\u201d He paused in thought, then continued, \u201cJust pick Nan Hua for her.\u201dNan Hua High School was one of the most popular schools in the city. Although it was a public school, it was titled as a \u201cprestigious school\u201d because most of the students were studied there were usually from rich families.In her past life, this matter was only brought up at least half a month later than this moment, when Butler Zhou accompanied her to the apartment and helped her to collect the rest of her belongings and brought the acceptance letter along as well. That was how the Cao Family had her education issues brought to their attention.Even then, Cao Xiong had said the same thing. He asked Cao Yang to look for his uncle who worked in the educational institute, and requested that she be transferred to Nan Hua.In the end, his proposal was strongly rejected by Xia Rou.At that time\u2026 Why had she acted that way?It was a great opportunity for her to be able to go to a better school, especially one as popular and well-known as Nan Hua High School. Even if others begged they weren\u2019t able to get enrolled!What had she been thinking?She thought that one of the reasons for her foolishness was her young age. It was her first time experiencing the use of power to take someone else\u2019s place. She also felt that it was a burning sort of ridicule coming from the Cao Family for her poor results and lack of ability that landed her in a weaker school like Seventeen High School.At that time, the one responsible for her matter was Cao Yang rather than Cao Bin.Xia Rou pinched her chopsticks tightly, recalling back to when Cao Yang had furrowed his eyebrows. He already had acted as a big brother for the entire family since he had three monkey-like younger brothers to take care of. His patience was already vast, even when he needed to confront the stubborn Xia Rou. To the end, he did not get angry at her.But the matter of sending Xia Rou to Nan Hua had been thrown aside; in the end, Xia Rou still attended Seventeen High School. No matter how it appeared, it was still an ordinary school with an average studying atmosphere but with a worse environment. Xia Rou had held her breath and studied as hard as she could, but still only managed to become third in her class.She was too embarrassed to mention her school when she met with the elites from other powerful families that were connected to the Cao Family.\u201c\u2026 All of us graduated from Nan Hua\u2026. it\u2019ll be really nice\u2026 Xia Rou, Xia Rou?\u201dXia Rou came back to her senses and heard Cao Bin addressing her: \u201cWhat do you think? Or do you have any other schools that you have your heart set on?\u201dCompared to Cao Xiong\u2019s commanding method of speech, Cao Bin\u2019s words seemed to be more gentle, knowing at least to ask for Xia Rou\u2019s thoughts.Xia Rou had done a lot of thinking over the past few days, and she had realized that countless choices of hers were so stupid. This time, she promised herself she wouldn\u2019t repeat the same mistakes over again.\u201cNan Hua\u2026 I heard it\u2019s a very strict school?\u201d She bit her lips and softly continued: \u201cI\u2019m scared that I\u2019m too far behind already to catch up\u2026\u201dThe little girl had a lily-white face, a pointy chin and her lips were on the paler side. The way she bit her lips actually made her lips more red.Cao Bin\u2019s voice turned even gentler and he smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s alright, the summer holiday has just started. You can study before school starts. So Nan Hua is fine? You don\u2019t want to attend anywhere else?\u201d\u201cMm!\u201d Xia Rou nodded her head. \u201cI will study really hard!\u201d and try not to embarrass the Cao Family. Translated by The NovelstCompared to her adult self, her teenage self had a more tender voice. The 15-year-old nodded her head solemnly, apparently taking the matter very seriously. Her appearance\u2026 was so cute!Even Cao Xiong glanced once more at her.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cao Yang found his gaze weird, and thinking that he might frighten Xia Rou, coughed loudly and squinted his eyes toward him: \u201cEat your rice!\u201dCao Xing could only retract his gaze and quietly drink his porridge to that.Xia Rou wasn\u2019t frightened by Cao Xing, she knew very clearly how he was, what happened to him.The third brother\u2026After thinking about Cao Xing, Xia Rou couldn\u2019t help but to chuckle with her lips covered, her somber eyes curving upwards.The Cao Family only thought of this as an expression of her happiness since she was able to attend Nan Hua. A little girl was after all so young, so simple-minded that she couldn\u2019t even hide her thoughts properly.In the last few days, the atmosphere of the Cao Family had been gloomy because of Cao Xiong\u2019s depressed state, and caused them to feel so pressured when eating together. But because of a simple smile from this little girl, they suddenly felt the gloomy atmosphere coming from their father weaken greatly. Looking at this smile, everyone at the table suddenly had a better appetite, enough to fit another roll of steamed roll!It was quite fulfilling!Xia Rou didn\u2019t remember where she packed her junior textbooks, or if she had even brought it along to the house. She even looked for them during the day, but her search was fruitless. She then thought she might have left it at the apartment, so she could only wait for Butler Zhou\u2019s schedule to free up to bring her back to tidy her things and bring back her study materials.Cao Xiong wasn\u2019t there for dinner, so Xia Rou ate alone with the three brothers.Cao Bin told her: \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow, if you have anything you need don\u2019t be shy and ask them.\u201d As he was speaking, he raised his chin to point at Cao Yang and Cao Xing.\u201cMm, okay.\u201d Xia Rou asked, \u201cAre you going back to work?\u201d\u201cYep, I\u2019m currently working for the government of Hu City, and usually I live there. These last two days\u2026 I came back to visit my father.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention that due to Cheng Wan\u2019s passing, Cao Xiong\u2019s condition had deteriorated, which was why he was so worried and especially came back to see him.\u201cNo worries, I\u2019ll still be here when he leaves.\u201d Cao Xiong smiled widely as he continued the conversation. \u201cJust tell me if you need anything.\u201d Xia Rou could feel his mood was exceptionally great today.\u201cMm mm.\u201d She nodded her head to indicate she understood.Cao Yang didn\u2019t say much, but glared at his little brothers.This little girl was kind of cute, making it very hard for people to hate her. She could be considered talented, seeing as how she managed to make these two little punks hand over their hearts, was what he was thinking.Xia Rou went back to her room and tidied up her clothing, and that was when she realized she didn\u2019t have enough clothing.No matter what, she was still a 15-year-old teenage girl, so all her clothes were usually bright and colorful. She only had a few plain clothes. After her mother\u2019s passing, these colorful dresses didn\u2019t seem suitable.She took out her laptop and connected to the side building\u2019s wifi, navigating quickly to a shopping site. Then, recalling her previous life, she realized she had done the exact same thing \u2013 sat down right in this room, navigated to the same website. But at that time she had angrily ordered a whole pile of black dresses instead.Her hands paused for a while, and she skipped all the colorful clothes as well as the black ones, scrolling past to choose a few plain colored clothes.Finally, as she placed her order, someone knocked at her door.\u201cWho is it?\u201d she asked.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d The person outside replied, \u201cCao Xing.\u201dXia Rou: \u201c\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming! And this time even earlier than in the past!When she went to open the door, the first thing to come into sight was an enormous teddy bear, as large as half a person!I knew it would come! This teddy bear!Cao Xing widened his mouth so his white teeth gleamed, and smiled: \u201cI had something to do yesterday so I couldn\u2019t make it. So I\u2019ll make it up to you today with a welcome present!\u201dOh really?Xia Rou stayed put and said: \u201cThank you.\u201dThen she stretched her hands to take it, but she couldn\u2019t.Xia Rou: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe used a bit more of her strength and finally managed to grab the teddy bear from Cao Xing. Cao Xing looked at his empty hands, subconsciously grabbing at the air a few times and felt disappointed.Xia Rou found it amusing. She hugged the bear and tilted her head: \u201cIt\u2019s so cute, I like it very much. Thank you Cao Xing brother!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t like she was trying to act cute, but that teddy bear was almost as big as a person, so it didn\u2019t seem so large when Cao Xing was holding it. However, since Xia Rou\u2019s height only reached Cao Xing\u2019s shoulder, she couldn\u2019t even be seen behind it when she hugged it if she didn\u2019t tilt her head.A little girl hugging a huge teddy bear with her head tilted, even using a young tender voice to say thank you and addressing him as brother\u2026Cao Xing didn\u2019t feel like leaving anymore.He coughed, with a poker face hiding his innermost thoughts: \u201cGlad you like it.\u201dBut his sight was moving between Xia Rou and the teddy bear\u2026\u201cMm, I like it.\u201d Xia Rou said.She really did like it!In the last few days of her reincarnation, different memories had come back to her, and most of them made her depressed and feel regretful. Only the moment she opened this door, this huge teddy bear awoke within her some wonderful and precious memories.Once again in this life she had this teddy bear to accompany her. Xia Rou liked it very much.When she raised her head to look at Cao Xing, he was petrified like an iron tower. She couldn\u2019t help but curve her eyes into a crescent shape.Eh! This look of hers was way cuter than when she had brimmed her eyes with tears!Cao Xing eventually couldn\u2019t hold back and stretched out his bear-like palms, rubbing on Xia Rou\u2019s hair. At that instant, he worried that she might find it rude, but when he snuck a peek at Xia Rou, he noticed she had closed her eyes and seemed to be enjoying it.Eh! This was so good!\u201cNice to hear that you like it, I\u2019ll buy lots of these for you next time!\u201d Cao Xing started to make promises.\u201cReally?\u201d Xia Rou peered at him closely. Was it really for her?Cao Xing didn\u2019t have a clue that his ideas were already exposed. He vowed: \u201cOf course!\u201dThen he craned his neck to look around the room and saw a few boxes open, so he said: \u201cAlright, you should continue to tidy up your things. I\u2019ll leave now.\u201dWhile he was saying this, he patted Xia Rou\u2019s head again.Before leaving, he still couldn\u2019t hold back and acted carelessly and rubbed\u2026 the teddy bear!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter what shirt he wore, it would always stretch taut on his body, like his muscles were trying to burst out of the shirt.He was in one of the special armies, and he won the title of an army king twice before. The rumors said that he even scared a child and made the child cry with just one glare!An iron-like man like him, nobody would ever imagine that he.. he\u2026 he was a plush-con!Ever since he was young, he was always into all sorts of soft, fuzzy plush toys and all things that looked cute to him!It was too bad he was born into an army family like the Cao Family. A man like Cao Xiong was unable to tolerate his son acting like a girl obsessed with all plush dolls!In the end, when he told Xia Rou about his youth, the days when his father secretly threw all his dolls away and used a leather belt to hit him, he was wailing like a ghost and grieved for those plush dolls.Previously he even raised a poodle and treasured it a lot. But Cao Xiong was able to see right through him and in no time it was taken away with the reason of \u201conly girls would keep this kind of dog.\u201d Cao Xiong brought back a huge wolf dog for him instead!Cao Xing loved dogs, but his only condition was that it must be furry and must look cute. A wolf dog wasn\u2019t cute at all!This poor man with the heart of a young woman couldn\u2019t do anything but suppress his nature. Until the day of Xia Rou\u2019s arrival. He was finally saved. In the name of gifting them to Xia Rou, he bought so many plush toys and dolls back home for Xia Rou that her room was totally filled up with them!Now that Xia Rou recalled it again, she didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry.She carried the teddy bear and rolled onto her bed. Suddenly all the dim, wonderful memories were flashing through her mind. The gloomy mood that had settled around her finally cracked and her brighter self peeked through.Compared to her reckless stubbornness in the past, when she felt like a lost sheep with nowhere to go, now Xia Rou felt her heart was very clear and bright.It turned out that admitting her shortcomings and that she was not as outstanding as the others was not a big deal at all.She only took one step back, and so many things had already changed compared to her past.Maybe this wasn\u2019t so bad\u2026 Translated by The NovelstAnother day passed, and Butler Zhou finally found the time to accompany Xia Rou back to her apartment and continue to clean up the things there.As expected, her junior textbooks were all left in the apartment. Xia Rou carefully put the books and notes into a box.Her brain didn\u2019t function as well as others, her grades were subpar, and she was just an average student in Seventeen Middle School. In this life, she followed the Cao Family\u2019s arrangements and got into Nan Hua High School. She had to put in double the effort to study in high school and university once again.She got all her stuff packed away into boxes and into the car. As for her mother\u2019s belongings, they were sealed into boxes and kept in the apartment.The white sheets covered all the furniture and concealed the tracks of the person who had lived there before\u2026Xia Rou stood paused at the entrance, and couldn\u2019t help herself. She turned around and took another look around.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Xiao Rou.\u201d Butler Zhou advised her, thinking she felt sad again.Xia Rou looked at the white hallway, murmuring softly a \u201cmm\u201d and turning away.The gate was closed, and then it was locked up.The sunlight gradually turned from the hot white of the afternoon to a faint yellow, the shadows of the furniture lengthening until the night came.The sun was replaced by the moon, and the dark night reigned over the bright day.Time never stopped moving, out with the old and in with the new.At the road, Butler Zhou asked Xia Rou how she wanted the apartment.\u201cJust leave it\u2026\u201d Xia Rou didn\u2019t really care. \u201cJust lock it up.\u201dOriginally, Butler Zhou was going to advise her to rent out the room, so she could get some passive income. But before he opened his mouth, he realized that surely she would have no financial worries since the commander took her into his house.Although she was living at the side building for now, it would just be a matter of time until she would move into the main building.The two rooms of the second floor in the main building were still under construction, and even the hallways were messy, so Xia Rou couldn\u2019t get into the study room. So she stayed in her room to slowly begin revising her junior year\u2019s work.It had been a long time since she had retained the little knowledge she learned at school. But she knew that studying could not be rushed, so she planned to study a few topics each day, slowly so that she could remember the information. She wasn\u2019t rushing nor feeling frustrated.Her heart was at peace. Translated by The NovelstOne\u2019s appearance was influenced by one\u2019s emotion. A girl with such a peaceful and quiet heart would project the hazy appearance of someone clean and gentle, looking very beautiful in other people\u2019s eyes.Even Lady Fang felt comfortable looking at this child.When Cao Yang came home and asked about Xia Rou\u2019s recent situation, Lady Fang told him of her actions within the last few days, her words subconsciously revealing her feelings about the child.As they had dinner together, Cao Yang asked Xia Rou: \u201cWhy do you stay inside your room?\u201dXia Rou told him the truth: \u201cI\u2019m revising my studies.\u201dCao Yang laughed, feeling this girl was a little simple-minded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you have the whole summer holiday to revise, and your holiday has just started.\u201dActually, many schools had just started their breaks. Xia Rou started earlier because she was taking her entrance examination. However, due to Cheng Wan\u2019s passing, she didn\u2019t get to participate in the activities like the graduation ceremony.Xia Rou replied, \u201cI\u2019m a little slow.

There\u2019s a gym on the third floor and a swimming pool underground.\u201dAs the eldest, Cao Xiong sounded like he was lecturing whenever he opened his mouth. Cao Yang looked at Xia Rou, worried that she couldn\u2019t adapt to it.Xia Rou lowered her head to reply: \u201cOkay.\u201dVery well behaved and obedient. Translated by The NovelstThis attitude of hers looked to the eyes of Cao Xiong and Cao Yang who were used to giving orders very pleasing.Although Cao Xing told Xia Rou that she could find him when Cao Bin was not around, in reality Cao Xing had only taken a few days leave to come back. He only stayed a few days longer than Cao Bin.Within these few days, he tried to promote himself and bought 4-5 plush dolls for Xia Rou. If it wasn\u2019t for Xia Rou helplessly telling him the room was too small to fit them all, she bet that Cao Xing couldn\u2019t stop himself from buying more.\u201cThen\u2026 let\u2019s wait until you move into the main building. I\u2019ll buy more for you! The rooms in the main building are usually spacious, it\u2019ll definitely fit!\u201d he said.He felt that this little sister was destined for him. The women he met were usually of two types: the first were women who were usually scared of him, and the others took the initiative to get close to him. But with Xia Rou, he felt they were naturally close already and were already familiar with each other. That familiarity wasn\u2019t the deliberate kind, instead she seemed like she really understood him.After getting close to her in these few days, he didn\u2019t hide his plush-con nature any longer.\u201cJust wait, the day I come back I\u2019ll buy a bigger sized one! I already have my eye on one!\u201dAlready found one? Xia Rou raised her palms to cover her forehead.After that, Cao Xing rubbed the teddy bear a lot, then reluctantly parted to return to his station.Then there was only Cao Xiong, Cao Yang and Xia Rou, three people dining together in the large estate.Before Xia Rou\u2019s arrival, Cao Yang had worried that the little girl who recently had her mother pass away might dampen the atmosphere of their house, and that it might worsen Cao Xiong\u2019s depression.He remembered the first day she came to sit in the small living room, still wearing the black mourning apparel, the atmosphere filling up with sadness. He was glad she was able to tidy up her emotions well.She was quiet, less talkative, and kept all the sorrow within her heart. What she showed others was only her peaceful and quiet breathing.Cao Yang had sharply come to the realization that his father\u2019s emotions were affected by her. Though it was slow, his depression started to fade.His father was still his strict father as he always had been, as though that short pause of weakness had never existed.Cao Yang could finally relax.In the evening, Cao Yang was leaning on the living room door, having a smoke while looking at the courtyard. He noticed Xia Rou was running out from the side building.\u201cXia Rou!\u201d He called her, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dXia Rou heard and ran towards him, politely addressing him: \u201cCao Yang Brother.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t Uncle tell me to exercise a little two days ago? I plan to job a little, now that the weather is quite refreshing.\u201dActually, Cao Xiong\u2019s words had reminded her. She lived with the Cao Family and was influenced by the brothers, and slowly had come to enjoy exercising. But now her 15-year-old self was obviously weaker than her past self.So she made herself an exercise plan.Cao Yang asked: \u201cWhy not run inside the gym?\u201dXia Rou shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll get dizzy if I run under the air conditioning. I prefer to run outdoors instead.\u201dCao Yang stared at her. Gym bag, phone, headset, water bottle\u2026 Heh, she was quite well-equipped. He raised his head to look at the sky, where the daylight seemed to be extended for the summer. It was still quite bright at this time.\u201cWait a second.\u201d He pinched off the cigarette and went upstairs.In no time, he came back down outfitted in exercise gear.\u201cI\u2019ll lead the way, it\u2019ll be easier for you to remember the way or you can\u2019t find your way back in the dark.\u201d Cao Yang explained.This was exactly what Cao Yang had said to her in the past, not even a word out of place!Cao Yang ran a few steps and noticed Xia Rou wasn\u2019t following him, so he turned back around.Under the setting sun, her face was calm, her eyes somber but seeming to have a deep sea behind them.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Cao Yang said.\u201cComing!\u201d Xia Rou came back to her senses and followed him.The huge Cao Family estate was located in an old town. It wasn\u2019t old and shoddy, but rather a town with over half a century of history that usually attracted prestigious families. The available land in the town became more rare, and as the buildings condensed, the price of the estates in the city rose. Luckily, the area they were in was still a little open.Each of the buildings nearby was a luxurious mansion. There weren\u2019t many cars on the road, usually the only people to pass through here were the people that lived nearby.20 years ago there had been a garden nearby that was turned into an ecological park, many trees were planted and they even built an artificial lake. Now, the environment of this area was surprisingly quiet when compared to the noisy town.Cao Yang brought Xia Rou along the street in the direction of the ecological park, where the vehicles were sparser. He pointed out directions to her while they ran, and continued to emphasize the route to her.Actually, Xia Rou already knew the route, as she ran here for many years.But she liked to listen to Cao Yang\u2019s deep, toned voice like it was a cello playing its musical notes under the sunset, flying gracefully into her ears.Later in her life, as their relationship got more and more fraught, he started to become busier with work and slowly he couldn\u2019t accompany her to run.Later, he had a girlfriend, who then became a wife\u2026 the person who accompanied him to run in the morning\u2026 was no longer her.Xia Rou could still remember the day he asked her to run together for the last time, his wife standing right behind him, icily staring daggers at her.So she had no choice but to stagger her exercise times to avoid them.After that, regardless of his opposition, she moved back to the apartment and lived alone.Later on, he got divorced.

The shadows flickering on the track were all people running along, carefully following the same direction and trying not to bump into one another.The back outlined in front of her was steadily jogging up and down, rhythm set by his footsteps.His shoulders were very broad, the short sleeved exercising vest tight on his body, showcasing the beautiful curves of his muscles. From his broad shoulders to his slim waist, the muscle throbbed to the beat of every step he took, silently hinting at the bursting energy contained within his body.Xia Rou couldn\u2019t match his pace any longer.When she was 25, this speed and distance didn\u2019t really mean much to her, it was just that this time she had overestimated the physique of her 15-year-old body.Her lungs were burning, but she stubbornly kept powering on, wanting to follow that shadow in the dark, unwilling to fall behind.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Cao Yang turned his head to ask, his breath still steady, not even a pant to be heard.Xia Rou noticed his gaze filled with concern.But the concern was shallow, probably because the time they spent together was negligible and their feelings were not deep.Xia Rou suddenly recalled her past \u2013 every time she reached her limit and couldn\u2019t run any further, he would pass her a water bottle with a smile and tease her: \u201cLittle girl, tired already?\u201dAt that time, they were so close\u2026 Translated by The NovelstIn the last few days, because of the changes she made, many things seemed to have gone in a different direction.

Xia Rou raised her gaze to look at the figure standing two steps ahead of her. Cao Yang was turning his head to look straight into her eyes\u2026She clenched her teeth and readied herself for a sudden final sprint, and then ran crazily like a bolt of lightning.Cao Yang was happy to see her continue running, so he upped his pace and followed behind her, wanting to see how much further she could get.In the end\u2026Huff! Huff! Huff!Xia Rou bent down with her hands on her knees, painfully gasping in large breaths. She felt like her chest was going to explode!That was only a few meters of sprinting! Cao Yang was rendered speechless.Her physique was really weak compared to the kids in the army! But, he reminded himself, he mustn\u2019t compare her to the male soldiers in the army, or even the female soldiers.Look at that skinny and weak physique of hers!Even her arms were slim!Look at her legs\u2026 hmm, quite straight.Anyways, this child was too flimsy. Even for a girl, being too weak was not a good thing.Cao Yang didn\u2019t like the trend nowadays where women kept themselves as skinny as skeletons. He grew up in an army so he saw a lot of masculine beauty. He likes women with small waists, but she had to be healthy. He felt only fit women could match his taste.No matter how she would be raised in their house, there was still time. It would be fine for him to train her to be fit in the future, Cao Yang thought.Looking at Xia Rou repeating, \u201cI\u2019m going to die,\u201d he felt it was so funny that he couldn\u2019t help but to tease her: \u201cLittle girl, tired already?\u201dThe little girl who was still breathing hard immediately raised her head. In the dark, there were tears brimming in her eyes.Cao Yang was stunned.Xia Rou started to cough so fiercely that her tears almost fell.Cao Yang put his palm on his forehead and brought out her bottle from her bag to give to her. \u201cTake it easy, drink some water.\u201d\u201cDrink slowly!\u201d\u2026\u2026The next day, they were again awake early, the three of them sitting together to have breakfast.\u201cAre you getting comfortable here?\u201d It was rare for Cao Xiong to ask something like this.\u201cQuite fine.\u201d Xia Rou replied, \u201cYesterday I went for a run at the ecological park.\u201dCao Yang smiled and asked: \u201cAre you going again today?\u201d Yesterday her face clearly had expressed: \u201cI\u2019m going to die.\u201d\u201cMn, after dinner.\u201d Xia Rou seemed to enjoy running at night.\u201cWake up early, running in the morning is much more effective.\u201d Cao Xiong said.Xia Rou explained seriously: \u201cI\u2019m scared to tan in the morning sun.\u201dCao Xiong: \u201c\u2026.\u201d He can\u2019t really refute her!It was rare for his father to have no response. The corner of Cao Yang\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but to tilt upwards.Cao Xiong shot him a glare and chided him within his heart.But their house was too masculine and he didn\u2019t have any experience raising a girl. Cao Xiong suddenly started to wish for the good old days of hitting his sons with a leather belt, telling them to work out under the hot sun until their shirts were drenched in sweat\u2026.On Lady Fang\u2019s walk from the main building to the side building, she saw Xia Rou sitting on a wooden chair under the big tree in the center of the courtyard. She was reading a book.Such a quiet child. Translated by The NovelstEven after her arrival to the house, there weren\u2019t many changes to the family. Lady Fang\u2019s previous worries were all for nothing. This girl was very sensible and didn\u2019t cause any trouble, very easygoing.\u201cXia Rou, reading books again?\u201d Lady Fang greeted her.Xia Rou put down her book: \u201cLady Fang.\u201d\u201cThere is a library on the second floor, when the renovation is done you can stay inside to read your books.\u201d Lady Fang kindly explained to her. \u201cThe second floor is too messy right now. They put all the construction materials in the corridor, so don\u2019t go up now or you might injure yourself.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you Lady Fang.\u201d Xia Rou replied.The change of Lady Fang\u2019s attitude towards her was the biggest achievement in her new life.Since no matter how she acted, the Cao Family always took care of her and was nice to her, the same went for this life. However, Lady Fang had shown dislike towards her in the past, but her gaze now became gentler.This gave Xia Rou confidence. She thought if she could avoid all the stupid actions she made in the past, maybe she could really fix their relationship.This, could this be the reason for her reincarnation?Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Translated by The NovelstHearing Xia Rou mention her daughter, Lady Fang was so happy from her heart. The corners of her eyes revealed her crow\u2019s feet wrinkles.That sort of happiness Xia Rou had always seen on in Cheng Wan\u2019s eyes as well.Lady Fang and Cheng Wan were both the same in the way that they both needed to bring along their daughters while they made a living. It was also different, Xia Rou thought.Lady Fang\u2019s husband passed away and she only had one daughter. The grandparents in her husband\u2019s family treated women as inferior to men. Because the youngest uncle had two sons, they planned to take over Lady Fang\u2019s home.That property was an old house from before they got married, originally under the name of the grandparents. In the beginning, they thought to give one property each to their two sons, and in those few years Lady Fang and her husband did not consider transferring ownership. But now, the grandparents had the intention to transfer the elder son\u2019s house to the children of the younger son.Thus Lady Fang was kicked out by her husband\u2019s family. Her mother-in-law even wanted to kept her daughter since she would get married sooner or later, and as a girl she wouldn\u2019t be able to steal the property from her grandsons. But Lady Fang didn\u2019t want to give up her daughter.Compared to her granddaughter, being able to keep the properties for her grandsons was more important, so her grandmother did not pursue the matter any further and let her daughter follow Lady Fang to leave the house.Lady Fang and her husband used to run a small grocery store in that house. Half the house was for the shop and the other half was a residence. After getting kicked out, her only income had also been snapped off.She brought her child along to find a job, but because she had a child, she always ran up against a stone wall. After that, she went to a housekeeping company and the company recommended her a few houses, but the owners were unwilling to hire her when they heard that she needed to bring her child along during work.Luckily, she was recommended to the Cao Family afterwards.It was back when Cao Yang\u2019s mother first fell sick, and her body wasn\u2019t in good condition. So she was trying to find a housekeeper experienced in taking care of children to look after the four brothers. The salary was generous, and they even provided food and lodging.After Cao Yang\u2019s mother heard of Lady Fang\u2019s situation, she took pity on her and at the same time she admired how Lady Fang did not give up on her daughter, so she hired her.Finally, Lady Fang had found a foothold in her life.One year later, Madam Cao passed away.Lady Fang indeed did not disappoint Madam Cao; she did a great job in taking care of the brothers\u2019 living situations.By the time she arrived at Cao Family, Cao Yang was only 13 years old. But he and Cao Bin had already matured quickly, they were very independent. Cao Xing and Cao An were only 9 years old and 7 years old respectively. Even they were trained in the same daily routine as a soldier by their father, they were still kids. They were still weak in heart, hoping for someone to care about them, so both of them were closer to Lady Fang compared to their older brothers.Time passed quickly, in just the blink of an eye Lady Fang has already been working under the Cao Family for over ten years. Although she was originally just a housekeeping aunt, she was more like the main butler of the family. Not only did she manage the two house cleaners and gardener, even the house chef also respected her. All of them have looked upon her as their leader.Way back then, Xia Rou especially had hated her, because she was never nice to her.Xia Rou thought that Lady Fang must have felt she was half an owner of this family, that\u2019s why she had hostility towards Xia Rou, the counterfeit princess who lived under someone else\u2019s roof.She may have been indebted to the Cao Family, but in her heart, she had always thought of herself as living in the same circle as the Cao Family. Thus, the attitude of Lady Fang towards her made her feel embarrassed as if her identity of a counterfeit had been exposed.She actually thought, of the both of them, neither had proper titles in the family. So neither of them were considered as the hostess of the family.Ever since Madam Cao passed away, even before Cao Yang got married, this house did not have a real hostess.But within these few days, Xia Rou realized there were a lot of misunderstandings on her part toward Lady Fang.Thoughts like \u201cthinking herself as half a hostess in the family,\u201d was probably because she judged Lady Fang just by her looks, and that\u2019s how she started to imagine all sorts of thoughts. But the reality was actually different, at least now that she looks at Lady Fang, she realized Lady Fang was actually scrupulously abiding to her own duties.She couldn\u2019t help but to compare Lady Fang and Cheng Wan. She tried to imagine whether Cheng Wan could do the same as Lady Fang, bringing her child along to find a living.But she was disappointedly aware that, Cheng Wan\u2026\u2026 couldn\u2019t have made it.Even her married life with her blood-related father, Cheng Wan always lived elegantly as if she was held captive. She lived gracefully, exquisitely, and gently.She had always been an exquisite, gentle and weak woman that needed a man to take care of her to continue living.Once she lost her protection, she would feel no confidence to live alone, and she could only weakly seek death. Fortunately, she was able to meet Cao Xiong.Cheng Wan, she was really a dodder flower being carefully taken care of inside expensive porcelain.In these two lives, Xia Rou was hurt by her own realizations.In her past life, she was desperately trying to flaunt herself so as to not become a woman like Cheng Wan.In this life, along with the wishes of in her past, she also hoped that she wouldn\u2019t end up as the same woman from her last life.She loved Cheng Wan, but she disliked her. Translated by The NovelstHowever, she herself lived a life that was incomparable to Cheng Wan\u2019s, and even worse.With this once in a lifetime chance, what was she actually seeking?Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Haiz, her company tries to squeeze interns for free labor, always asking them to stay late for work and the don\u2019t dare say no. At least the internship is ending now, she\u2019s coming back soon.\u201d\u201cWait till she\u2019s back, then you can have someone to accompany you. I\u2019ll ask her to play with you,\u201d Lady Fang continued. \u201cThis house is filled with masculine energy, it should have a girl to balance it out.\u201dXia Rou smiled gently, she was looking forward to it too.In her past life she didn\u2019t spend too much time with Lady Fang\u2019s daughter, but she remembered her as a passionate big sister. When she was all alone in the Cao Family and nobody looked upon her well, only He Lili was kind to her.Although she didn\u2019t get along with Lady Fang, she was very close to He Lili.Not long after, Lady Fang had suddenly resigned from her job and left the house. Then she never met He Lili after that. Although she hated Lady Fang a lot, she would still sometimes miss that big sister.The temperature was getting warmer day by day in the summer. Time flew as cicadas filled the air with their singing.He Lili came back on a weekend. Translated by The NovelstShe had just graduated from university, so she was very young in her early twenties. But her chest was already bulging, unlike Xia Rou at 15 who was always seen as a child. He Lili had already started to ripen and become mature.Her attitude toward Xia Rou was the same passion as in her memories.\u201cAre you Xia Rou? Oh my, you\u2019re really a little sister.\u201d He Lili smiled radiantly. \u201cYour timing is so unfortunate. The second floor is still being renovated. Have you looked around the rooms yet? I can take you around so you can get used to the house.\u201dIn the past, Xia Rou had always been sensitive to other people\u2019s piercing gazes, so she would always lock herself inside her room and refuse to budge. It was also He Lili who had come back in her past and brought her around to look at the house.In this life, Xia Rou had already been living in this house for almost ten years, so she was already familiar with the house. So even when she moved into the Cao Family, she didn\u2019t explore just like in her past.Lady Fang felt that Xia Rou was a quiet and honest girl, so she told He Lili to bring her to walk around the house, since Xia Rou would still need to move into the main building once the second floor was finished.Xia Rou knew that many of her past actions must be repeated once more. So she did not reject He Lili\u2019s kindness and followed her to the main building.There were four floors in the main building. In the renovation, although they retained the original style of the building, they added a passenger lift and a worker lift for convenience. They first took a passenger lift to the fourth floor.\u201cI\u2019m telling you this now, don\u2019t go to the fourth floor because that\u2019s where Commander and Madam Cao\u2019s bedrooms and study rooms are. Madam Cao also used to have a guest room here. You shouldn\u2019t simply enter this floor, especially because Madam Cao\u2019s room is here.\u201dEven as He Lili warned Xia Rou, she herself familiarly led the way and pushed open the wooden door to Madam Cao\u2019s room. \u201cLook, this used to be Madam Cao\u2019s room.\u201dThis room was probably the most unfamiliar to Xia Rou in this building. Even in the past when He Lili brought her to take a look, she had stood at the entrance to only peek in, and hadn\u2019t gone in.In this life, she stopped in front of the door, same as before, and determinedly looked at He Lili.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say not to simply go in?\u201dHe Lili grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s fine for me because I grew up here. Nobody can say anything to me, just don\u2019t touch anything. Come in, look at the bed. I\u2019m telling you, this is an antique!\u201d As she was saying this, she unceremoniously plopped on the bed.This was a bed given by Cao Xiong to Madam Cao. He had poured a lot of effort in to obtain the bed. It was elegantly made in a western, classical style, and there were complicated patterns carved into the bedpost. He Lili traced the exquisite patterns, her gaze filled with passion.However, Xia Rou stood in front of the door, her heart turning cold.Was this the enthusiastic big sister of her memories?That was right. Now that she remembered, He Lili warned her in the past not to step into Madam Cao\u2019s room, but her actions clearly spelled out the message, \u201cactually it\u2019s fine to come in.\u201dMadam Cao had passed away over ten years ago, but her master bedroom and guest room had still remained the same as when she was alive after all these years. Simply from that, Xia Rou could imagine how deeply Cao Xiong loved his wife, and also her importance as the mother to the four brothers of the Cao Family. It was common sense to everybody in the house that Madam Cao\u2019s room was forbidden to enter.He Lili could enter not because nobody dared to say a word to her, but because the men of the Cao Family were not at home during the day, so they weren\u2019t aware. Also because she was the daughter of the person in charge of the house, she had a higher position when compared to others. Nobody dared to gab and make trouble for He Lili.But\u2026 What if she had listened to He Lili\u2019s words and entered Madam Cao\u2019s room. What if she had carelessly touched the things left behind by Madam Cao? Once the men of the Cao Family knew, what would happen then?Xia Rou didn\u2019t want to imagine any further.

No matter how luxurious and attractive the rooms in the uppermost floor of the house, she never wanted to take even a peek.He Lili turned to look at Xia Rou still standing in front of the door in silence.She called Xia Rou twice, but Xia Rou still stood at the entrance and didn\u2019t budge. He Lili pouted. Translated by The NovelstThen, she said: \u201cI\u2019ll bring you to look around the small guest room.\u201dThat room was also very pretty. Every vase and other ornament in the room were all exquisitely made, especially the tea set that Madam Cao most favored. Made of pure silver, it was dazzlingly beautiful.It was in every girl\u2019s nature that they would like crystal and twinkling things. When He Lili was young, she couldn\u2019t bear the temptation and made off with one of the exquisite silver rose keys in secret.Afterwards, her theft was found out by her mother and she was badly punished. She had no choice but to put the small silver key back in its place in secret.That was why He Lili thought it was impossible for a young lady like Xia Rou to not like these kinds of things. It would be best if she liked it and could do something to it, then it would be great.However, Xia Rou shook her head and said, \u201cNo thanks, it\u2019s better not to carelessly enter Madam Cao\u2019s room. I\u2019ve seen the rooms on the fourth floor now. Let\u2019s go downstairs.\u201dFor some reason, when this girl looked at her, He Lili felt that her serious dark eyes made her feel uneasy, as though they were unearthing those dark thoughts she kept hidden in her heart. But she thought that it was impossible because she was only fifteen, barely out of childhood.But this youth already knew how to speak tactfully, so she couldn\u2019t find a better excuse to bring her to the room. He Lili gave up and brought Xia Rou down to the third floor.\u201cBrother Cao Yang and Brother Cao Bin live on the third floor. Except for their bedrooms, they even have their own study rooms to do their work in. You can\u2019t carelessly enter these rooms, especially their study room, understand?\u201d This time, He Lili\u2019s warning was accompanied by a more serious expression than she had on the fourth floor.Thus Xia Rou understood that He Lili really didn\u2019t want her to enter Cao Yang and Cao Bin\u2019s room.\u201cThat room over there is the gym. The room at the end is the reading room, and it\u2019s connected to the second floor and can only be accessed from the second floor. There\u2019s no door to it in the third floor.\u201dHe Lili rushed Xia Rou around the third floor, then led Xia Rou back to the lift.\u201cThe second floor is still under construction. It\u2019s too messy now, you can take a look later. Brother Cao Xiong and Brother Cao An live on the second floor. Beside the video room there\u2019s a guest room, which is probably where you\u2019ll be living.\u201dHe Lili didn\u2019t mention that the guest room was being renovated too. After the renovation, it would no longer be a guest room but a bedroom made specially for Xia Rou.Xia Rou turned her head and took a glance at He Lili in the lift, then turned silently back. Looking at their reflections in the mirror of the lift, she noticed that although He Lili was only a few years older than her, her makeup was very heavy.Xia Rou lowered her eyes, hiding her disappointment deep in her heart.Her expression was being watched by He Lili. He Lili thought that Xia Rou was hurt by the daggers hidden in her speech, and her red-painted lips couldn\u2019t help but to pull up into a smile.The door opened silently. He Lili \u201cpassionately\u201d pulled Xia Rou to the basement: \u201cCome, I\u2019ll bring you to the swimming pool.\u201dThis was an underground swimming pool build after the renovation. Although the building itself was made in a classical style, the facilities inside were actually pretty modern.\u201cThere are the men\u2019s and women\u2019s changing rooms.\u201d He Lili felt a little proud of herself: \u201cI also come to swim; I usually use that pool by myself.\u201dShe acted generous: \u201cIf you want to come for a swim, you can use my changing room and shower room.\u201dShe looked triumphantly at Xia Rou, waiting for this Cinderella who stayed under another\u2019s roof to shyly say \u201cthank you\u201d to her. However, Xia Rou only nodded her head and said softly, \u201cOh\u2026\u201d and fell silent.He Lili felt her pleasure was spoiled. This girl was a blockhead. She even worried over whether or not Xia Rou could really understand the hints inside her words.But looking at Xia Rou\u2019s blank stare, she suddenly lost interest in speaking with her. So she simply brought her to walk around the basement, let her know the way to the shower and sauna rooms, and then they went back to the side building.\u201cWhat the hell, she\u2019s just a blockhead. Don\u2019t tell me she\u2019s stupid.\u201d He Lili complained to Lady Fang.\u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201d Lady Fang said, \u201cXia Rou is a good child, she\u2019s obedient and quiet. Her mother has just passed, so she must be feeling depressed. It\u2019ll be better with time, you should be more considerate.\u201dA thought struck Lady Fang. \u201cDid you tell her not to carelessly enter the rooms on the fourth floor?\u201d\u201cYes yes, I didn\u2019t even open the guest room door, she might have touched the things there.\u201dLady Fang paused while folding clothes, then scolded strictly: \u201cSo you opened the door to Madam\u2019s room? Why did you open it? You went in again?\u201dHe Lili accidentally spilled the beans. She explained with difficulty: \u201cI just let her take a glance\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat glance! How many times have I told you, don\u2019t enter Madam\u2019s room! He Lili!\u201d Lady Fang glared hotly at her. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019ve grown so much that I can\u2019t beat you!\u201d\u201cAiya, she was very curious so I just opened it up a crack for her to peek inside.\u201d He Lili immediately clung to her mother\u2019s arm, acting affectionate and floundering for an explanation.Lady Fang found it doubtful. He Lili immediately added: \u201cReally!\u201dLady Fang let out a \u201chmph,\u201d and went silent.He Lili felt sulky, taking an apple and chomping a huge bite.\u201cXia Rou is a nice child. She even said since it\u2019s the first day meeting you, she\u2019s going to come over and have dinner with us. The commander and Cao Yang will not be home today anyways.\u201d Lady Fang sighed, \u201cShe\u2019s so tactful at such a young age. Only you are around her age in this house. You should treat her well and take good care of her, understand?\u201d\u201cGot it,\u201d He Lili replied in annoyance. Translated by The NovelstShe was nothing but a mistress\u2019 child, on what basis could she sit at the dining table in the main building, eating dinner at the same table as Cao Yang and Cao Bin!Why in the world could He Lili only stay in the side building, having dinner in the employee dining room, at the same table with the housecleaner and the chef!He Lili brutally tore off a bite of her apple, feeling a weight on her heart making her uncomfortable.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was nothing but a young lady. All those words she had said were actually very shallow. Xia Rou at age 15 just couldn\u2019t understand because she was still young. If Xia Rou at age 25 still was unable to see through He Lili\u2019s intentions, then she wasn\u2019t just stupid, but an idiot. Translated by The NovelstAll those memories hidden inside her weren\u2019t forgotten, they were just temporarily sealed and neglected. Once a key point was triggered, these memories would once again pour out in a wave.In reality, Xia Rou was struck once again by how unreliable her memories were, and how foolish\u2026 she had been in the past\u2026She only remembered He Lili\u2019s smiling, passionate face, but she never saw through her evil intentions hidden behind that smile.He Lili had acted like an owner in the family, bringing her to look around the building, instructing her on which areas she could go and which areas she could not. But she had opened up the forbidden door, trying to use the luxurious things inside to lure Xia Rou in.She knew the guest room was being renovated especially for Xia Rou\u2019s stay, but she didn\u2019t say a word about it, instead trying to emphasize that the room was merely \u201ca guest room.\u201dIn the past, Xia Rou had never managed to see through He Lili and had been really feeling attacked by the barbs in her words. The Cao Family even had only men in the house, and their taste was different than a woman\u2019s. When she finally moved into the main building, she noticed the wallpaper was light blue in color instead of the usual girly pink or purple. This had make her think that this room was truly just \u201ca guest room.\u201dActually, on top of that light blue wallpaper, there had been a shallow rose pattern. No matter which Cao Family member had chosen it for her, to them, it had already reached the limit.Even imagining it now, Xia Rou couldn\u2019t picture Cao Yang, Cao Bin or Cao Xing selecting a pink wallpaper for her.As for Cao Xiong\u2026 No, she didn\u2019t even want to try to imagine it.Obviously it was a simple matter in the beginning, but the malicious seeds planted by He Lili sprouted and took root in her heart. It was so childish of her, to feel self-conscious with such excessive pride.And this He Lili\u2026 Now that Xia Rou thought back to what she said earlier, she was speechless.She was nothing but an orphan staying under somebody else\u2019s roof, what obstacle did she pose to He Lili? Was there even a need to go out of her way to do such things?The words she said at the swimming pool were also really funny. Her personal changing room? Xia Rou didn\u2019t know what expression she should have when facing He Lili in the future.Her behavior in using the swimming pool in the first place had already overstepped her boundaries. The truth is that employees hired to care for the family, such as Lady Fang, didn\u2019t have the authority to use the facilities in the house. But because she had grown up in the Cao Family since she was young, they at least had affection for her. Especially since she was a young lady, the men of the Cao Family didn\u2019t expend any energy on that kind of small matter, which was why nobody had said anything to her.It was totally different to what she had been trying to hint to Xia Rou earlier, as if she was especially privileged.Behind that smile, He Lili\u2019s tricks were childish and poorly executed. Unfortunately, Xia Rou still had the wool pulled over her eyes at the age of 15.Luckily, inside this 15-year-old body was now Xia Rou\u2019s age 25 soul. In her 25 years, Xia Rou lived under the care of the Cao Family for over ten of them. She had seen so much in that time that He Lili\u2019s poor tricks couldn\u2019t compare.It was just that now her mood had taken a downwards swing, that excited feeling of looking forward to reuniting with He Lili had disappeared without a trace. Once again, she was hurt by her own realizations.Even still, she went to the employee dining hall to have dinner.Cao Xiong and Cao Yang were away for the weekend, and had let her know that she would be dining alone. So it was her idea to join the employees for dinner.In the beginning, she really thought it would be a celebration of her reunion with He Lili. She was no longer in the mood, but she still went.She thought to at least get along with the people who worked under the Cao Family.It was obvious that these people held no importance to the Cao Family, even those employees who had worked there for over ten years. Even someone as important as Lady Fang, who handled the majority of the household affairs, had left her position in a future not so far from then.This was one of the mistakes that Xia Rou wanted to fix.In the past, the people who had worked in the house, with Lady Fang as their leader, had never liked her.She even once heard the housecleaner and the gardener whispering in the courtyard, ridiculing her for being an orphan who relied on others for a living but acted up like she was a big shot.The ridicule directed at her from behind her back spurred her resentment, shame and grievances. She felt they were all such snobs, bullying her just because she was an orphan without a background.But in this life, after experiencing the change in Lady Fang\u2019s attitude, she started to reflect on herself.She remembered that in her past, even though there were times that the Cao Family was absent, she would still sit in the main building\u2019s dining room all by herself, having dinner alone under the chandelier. She never went to the employee dining hall even once.Thinking back to He Lili\u2019s performance that day, she came to the ridiculous realization that she and He Lili\u2026 were actually similar to each other.Actually, while He Lili was simple-minded, Xia Rou was suffering her own self-inferiority.No matter how freely He Lili acted in the house, she couldn\u2019t change the fact that she was \u201cjust a housekeeper\u2019s child,\u201d the same way that Xia Rou was a \u201cmistress\u2019 child.\u201dBecause Lady Fang was a senior member of the staff in the Cao Family, He Lili dared to act up toward Xia Rou in places that were out of sight to the men of the Cao Family.Just like the times Xia Rou would sit alone under the luxurious chandelier, eating exquisite dishes prepared by the chef.Now that she thought on it, Xia Rou could understand He Lili\u2019s attitude.She was just jealous.

Inside that luxurious house, she would have her own room, specially renovated for her use, and she would be able to establish her own area in the house.As for He Lili, she would have to rent a room elsewhere. Even if she came back to the Cao Family residence, she could only share a room with Lady Fang. She didn\u2019t even have a room that belonged solely to her in the side building.Xia Rou sighed, her resentment toward He Lili shrinking. She knew that if Xia Rou had been in He Lili\u2019s shoes, her actions might not even have compared to He Lili\u2019s, or might even have been worse.Self-inferiority and pride were two sides of the same coin. The person in the middle, the suffering and torment that came with being torn between the two sides, nobody knew better than her.\u201cXia Rou, it\u2019s time to eat dinner.\u201d He Lili came to knock on her door that evening.Xia Rou followed her out. Translated by The Novelst\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to eat in the main building, why would you want to come over to the employee dining hall instead?\u201d He Lili was salty, having dinner in the main building was special treatment she could never receive no matter how hard she hoped.Xia Rou replied softly: \u201cIt\u2019s only me by myself so there\u2019s no need to go through such trouble, it\u2019s much simpler to eat with everyone together.\u201dHe Lili glanced sidelong at her, jealousy and disdain coursing through her as she thought: \u201cThis child is stupid.\u201dXia Rou didn\u2019t take it to heart.Because He Lili\u2026 couldn\u2019t stay much longer in the Cao Family.Just as Xia Rou thought, nobody had ever deliberately gone against her. How others treated her was a reflection of her treatment of others.In the past, she was unschooled in the ways of the world, always scared that others would look down on her, so she would sometimes deliberately act up. Such as when the Cao Family would not be coming back to dine, she would still insist on eating alone in the main building.However, in the eyes of the others, she looked like she was trying to show off.And now, because Xia Rou had suggested having dinner together with the employees, everyone treated her fairly well.\u201cMiss Xia, our food here isn\u2019t as exquisitely cooked, can you get used to it?\u201d The chef, Old Zheng, asked with a grin.\u201cUncle Zheng,\u201d Xia Rou addressed him, smiling: \u201cYou can just call me Xia Rou.\u201d\u201cAh? This\u2026\u201d Old Zheng wanted to decline.\u201cI\u2019m just someone without a family, so I\u2019m lodging here. If you keep calling me Miss Xia, Miss Xia, it\u2019s quite weird for me.\u201d Xia Rou said with a smile.As she pointed out her identity frankly, the atmosphere at the table became more relaxed. Although everyone was already being nice to her, once she spoke those words, they obviously felt more comfortable.That was how relationships worked. When you gave a little more to people, they would also give you a little bit more as well, was what Xia Rou thought.\u201cUncle Zheng, I say if Uncle Cao and the others are absent again in the future, I\u2019ll just come over to eat with all of you. So you don\u2019t have to cook for me alone.\u201dNow that she opened her heart, she could put away any intentions she had of acting up like she had in the past.He Lili\u2019s face reflected her shock.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She asked in surprise. \u201cYou could\u2019ve eaten in the main building; why do you want to come over here?\u201d\u201cEating alone, I feel like I\u2019ll be too much trouble\u2026\u201dBefore Xia Rou could finish her sentence, she was interrupted by He Lili\u2019s sharp tone: \u201cAre you stupid, how can the side building compare to the main building!\u201dThe dining hall quieted all of a sudden.Xia Rou blinked, asking slowly: \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201dWhat\u2019s the difference? One side was for the upper class, the other for the lower class!He Lili was riled up by Xia Rou\u2019s words just then. The treatment she had hoped for for so many years, Xia Rou had given up without a thought. She couldn\u2019t hold back for those few moments and blurted that sentence out.And now the people gathered at the table were staring at her. She immediately realized she had misspoken. Although everyone clearly understood what she was trying to imply, speaking out so frankly and straightforwardly was like a slap to the face to the people at the table.Among those gathered was also her mother.Lady Fang glared at He Lili, then turning around to Xia Rou and gently saying: \u201cI know you are trying to be considerate, but in this matter we have no say. Why don\u2019t you inform the main building first, or else Old Zheng and I are the ones who will be scolded.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.\u201d Old Zheng promptly nodded his head.Seeing that she had put them in a difficult position, Xia Rou didn\u2019t insist any further.Having dinner with a table full of people was actually much better than eating alone.Back when Xia Rou ate alone, she couldn\u2019t eat much at all. However, having dinner together, Xia Rou was able to eat more than usual while they were all bursting with laughter.Once the sky darkened, she went for a walk in the courtyard. She walked from the center to the front of the courtyard.In her heart, she had many thoughts.Listening to the crickets chirping in the grass, she paced slowly back and forth. Suddenly a light flickered in her direction. Xia Rou turned around while shading her eyes.It was a black Hummer driving in from the gate. After the headlight blinded Xia Rou, the driver quickly turned it off. The courtyard had lamps for lighting, so although it was darker than the headlights, the road was still visible.In this house full of men, the only person who could possibly be so considerate must be Cao Yang who had taken care of his younger brothers.Xia Rou couldn\u2019t keep the corner of her mouth from tilting upwards.As she expected, as the car slowly rolled to a stop at her side, the window rolled down to reveal Cao Yang\u2019s handsome face.\u201cXiao Rou, what are you doing?\u201d He asked. Translated by The Novelst\u201cBrother Cao Yang.\u201d Xia Rou felt shy, \u201cI ate too much, I\u2019m trying to digest my food.\u201dCao Yang couldn\u2019t help himself and threw his head back in laughter.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cao Yang always liked to see her when he returned home.Whenever he saw her, she would always be spaced out or deep in thought. The moment her eyes first saw him when she raised her head, those somber eyes would immediately reveal her happiness.Cao Yang was already in his thirties, and he had met countless people throughout his life. He could easily tell from the look in this young girl\u2019s eyes the joy and closeness he could see was really from her heart.It wasn\u2019t fake. Translated by The NovelstNo matter who it was, if they saw a pretty, quiet girl sincerely feeling close to them, nobody could really resist liking her.\u201cWhat delicious food did Old Zheng cook that had you eat so much?\u201d Cao Yang teased her. He disliked that Xia Rou ate very little, her body was too skinny.Xia Rou pursed her lips, then smiled.\u201cNone of you were around tonight, it wasn\u2019t any fun for me to eat alone. I had dinner at the side building with everyone else. It\u2019s much more lively with more people, so I accidentally ate too much.\u201d Getting into the topic, she took the opportunity and asked: \u201cBrother Cao Yang, I think if nobody is around next time, I want to go and eat in the side building. Lady Fang and Uncle Zheng told me that they can\u2019t decide this, so what do you think?\u201dShe thought with Cao Yang\u2019s temper, he would definitely agree. But she didn\u2019t expect to see Cao Yang remain silent for a long moment before rejecting her suggestion.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good,\u201d he said. \u201cNevermind this.\u201dXia Rou was surprised.Cao Yang saw her expression, but didn\u2019t give any explanation, only saying: \u201cI\u2019m tired today, I\u2019ll explain to you next time. Let me park the car first.\u201dXia Rou took a step back. Cao Yang changed the gears and drove out a meter, before stopping the car again.\u201cXia Rou.\u201d He stretched out his head from the window.Xia Rou walked to him.\u201cWake up early tomorrow. I\u2019ll bring you for a morning run. We\u2019ll leave early when the sun isn\u2019t out so you won\u2019t get tan.\u201d Cao Yang smiled, releasing the brakes and driving the car into the garage.Xia Rou continued to walk slowly to promote her digestion.However, in the distance she barely managed to see a figure with a curvy body rush out from the side building, ultimately failing to catch up. Cao Yang had already entered the main building.That figure stood there for a while, then turned back to the side building with disappointment.Xia Rou stood from her far-off distance, and hear heart seemed to be enlightened.As though she could see through a layer of a web.She looked back at the main building, seeing the light blink on in Cao Yang\u2019s room.Looking through the huge window pane, she could only see a thick curtain, the color deep and elegant.Thinking back to why Cao Yang had rejected her suggestion, it didn\u2019t seem hard to understand.Cao Yang of course knew how to respect other people, but it didn\u2019t erase the fact that he was born to a powerful family, standing above many people since he was young. He and the people who shared that class with him had a strong class consciousness compared to normal people.Deep in his heart, he didn\u2019t see the people who served the Cao Family as the same as him.Actually, that sort of class consciousness wasn\u2019t needed on her part, Xia Rou thought.Because Xia Rou wasn\u2019t part of the Cao Family after all. He didn\u2019t really need to put her into his circle.In the past, in an effort to not leave that very circle, she insisted on something that she shouldn\u2019t have, which was why she ended up being killed.In this life, she would put down all these thoughts.She had reincarnated, there was no need for her to rush to obtain anything.Because she was so rushed in the past, she fell so hard and missed out on so much; there were too many things that she wanted.In this life, she hoped her life could go slower, at a pace like the one she used to walk in the courtyard. Slowly, but in this sort of night breeze, cozy and comfortable.She thought that she shouldn\u2019t disappoint those who treated her well any longer.She raised her head and saw a figure standing at Cao Yang\u2019s bedroom window. It seemed he was having a smoke.She smiled and continued her walk.Although Xia Rou was correct about Cao Yang\u2019s thoughts, she didn\u2019t know that Cao Yang and Cao Xiong hadn\u2019t yet really given thought to how to raise her.Keeping her in comfort, not letting her worry about food and money, and even preparing a dowry for her future. All of these things weren\u2019t difficult to them, but how far did the Cao Family want to take responsibility for her life?Xia Rou\u2019s suggestion was innocuous, but it triggered the question: how do we raise her?If he took her as someone who had lost her family, then Cao Yang could easily promise to raise her. And this would be good for her too, at least she could come to understand her own identity and be able to adapt to life even without the Cao Family.But when Cao Yang gripped the steering wheel and looked at that young girl with her clean face and pitch black eyes standing in the darkness of the night, he became indecisive.It was easy to let Xia Rou mix with the employees, but if he was to separate her from them after the fact, it would be awkward and embarrassing.That was why Cao Yang rejected her suggestion. Translated by The NovelstHe thought it would be better to maintain the situation as it was now before his father could make a decision.Toward Xia Rou, he would just\u2026 keep it this way for now.Xia Rou didn\u2019t know that Cao Yang would be thinking about her when he stood in front of the window, smoking a cigarette.She thought that he must be thinking of something serious. He was an excellent man born to such a powerful family, he must surely be destined to become a major figure.As for herself, she thought of herself as only a small matter that coincidentally appeared in his life. Because he was a kind person and a good brother, he was willing to extend an arm and care for her.This tiny portion that he shared was already enough to warm her.She strolled around the courtyard, listening to the chirps of the insects and looking at the starry sky. She wanted to cherish every minute she lived in the Cao Family.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The black car slowly rolled to a stop, Cao Xiong\u2019s face appearing as the window slid down the back seat.\u201cXia Rou, what are you doing?\u201d he asked.Even the way they questioned her was the same, the only difference was that Cao Xiong\u2019s tone was deeper and stricter. Xia Rou felt like laughing.Thus, she laughed. Translated by The NovelstThis man was the master of the house, the person who changed her life, saving her from a life of homelessness.Although his tone might sound majestic and most people might find him scary, Xia Rou knew that he was already trying to be as gentle as possible. She knew this because she had already seen the real terrifying aspect of Cao Xiong, ten years into the future.He held a powerful position and took control of the four provinces in the east. Just a word from him would make people shiver.At the end of the day, his attitude toward Xia Rou couldn\u2019t be seen as close, but he was a little cold to her.Xia Rou knew that in actuality, he treated her nicely. That time, their relationship \u2013 they both had the same shortcomings. They didn\u2019t know how to correctly deliver their feelings toward each other.Xia Rou looked at Cao Xiong inside the car, a sudden thought striking her. She should treat him better.In the past, she wasn\u2019t able to show her gratitude toward the Cao Family. That was her deepest regret before she died. Since she had now rebirthed, she\u2026 should do better.At least, she should let Cao Xiong know that she wasn\u2019t a white eyed wolf*. Deep in her heart, she was still thankful to him.Hence, she felt like laughing, and she did, from the bottom of her heart.Because when she looked at Cao Xiong again, she ignored the golden stars shining on his epaulet and didn\u2019t think about the power he wielded. She put away all those useless thoughts. After a proper look at Cao Xiong\u2026 She realized that he was just a kind elder who had fallen in love with her mother. That was why he was trying to be nice to her.There was actually nothing much to fear when facing this kind elder.Her face was very beautiful as she chuckled with her lips closed, closely resembling Cheng Wan. Cao Xiong was stunned by the sight.\u201cJust now brother Cao Yang asked me the same question.\u201d Xia Rou explained between giggles. \u201cEven his tone was the same as yours.\u201dCao Xiong also laughed.Of all his sons, Cao Yang resembled him the most. His looks, his personality, his temper\u2026 he even exceeded his predecessors, his most accomplished son. That was why Cao Xiong liked to hear it when people said that Cao Yang resembled him.Butler Zhou was surprised to see Xia Rou make Cao Xiong relax through the rearview mirror. It had been a long time since Cao Xiong had laughed like that, ever since Cheng Wan passed away.He couldn\u2019t help but think that Xia Rou had an extraordinary ability. Or could it be that both mother and daughter were destined to be with the Cao Family?\u201cTonight I had dinner with everyone else and accidentally ate too much, so I came out to digest my food.\u201d Xia Rou said, touching her flat stomach.Cao Xiong didn\u2019t find it odd: \u201cYour appetite is too small, you should eat more.\u201d\u201cSleep early, it\u2019s late now.\u201d He continued.Xia Rou nodded her head, her eyes curving: \u201cOkay, you should rest early too. You drank too much.\u201d She rubbed at her nose, trying to disperse the smell of alcohol emanating from the car.Cao Xiong took a glance at her, having the car drive away.Ever since the child moved into their house, her attitude toward him had changed. She didn\u2019t fear him nor did she avoid him any longer.She could even reveal a smile like that in front of him.Cao Xiong didn\u2019t know why, but she indeed could lift his mood.Of course, he could ensure that she would eat her fill and wear warm clothes. That was the least he could do to fulfill his promise to Cheng Wan. But Cao Xiong knew that Cheng Wan wanted him to take good care of Xia Rou, further than just providing food and clothing.Reminiscing about Cheng Wan, the joyful mood he had just then dispersed into the night breeze. As he walked out of the car to the main building, the sound of his leather shoes against the floor echoed throughout the courtyard.Xia Rou had almost finished digesting, so she slowly walked back to the side building.Nobody had turned in for the night yet. They were playing cards inside the public restroom.\u201cUncle Zheng.\u201d Xia Rou tried to remind him. \u201cUncle Cao just got back, he seemed to have had a lot to drink.\u201d\u201cAiyo! He\u2019s back?\u201d Uncle Zheng threw his cards down, rushing toward the kitchen.Every time Cao Xiong had to engage in social activities and returned late, there would always be hot soup prepared in the kitchen. It was an old rule held for many years. The recipe to that soup was even brought by Madam Cao from her maiden family.\u201cXia Rou, do you know how to play cards?\u201d one of the house cleaners asked.There were two house cleaners in the house. One was only in her twenties, and another was almost thirty. Both were married.Xia Rou picked up Old Zheng\u2019s cards to continue playing. She had only played two cards when she heard He Lili\u2019s voice. \u201cUncle Zheng, you can leave this to me. I can deliver it for you and you can continue to play.\u201dEveryone raised their heads from the pile of cards.\u201cNo need, no need! That\u2019s inconvenient.\u201d Old Zheng grinned, then shouted at the top of his lungs: \u201cXiao Yang! Xiao Yang! Where did you go?!\u201dImmediately, Xiao Yang appeared out of nowhere: \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m here! I was watching TV.\u201dXiao Yang was used to doing all sorts of chores in the house, he could do anything. Wherever they were busy, he would go to lend a hand. Everyone heard his mumbling drift into the wind as he got further.There was another sound. The stomping of high heels up the stairs disappeared into the second floor.Both house cleaners exchanged glances of silent understanding, their gazes a little mocking.Xia Rou lowered her eyes, acting like she didn\u2019t know.But she was sighing in her heart. Translated by The NovelstShe always thought that when the Cao Family was away, Lady Fang could cover the sky with one hand. But it looked like she was wrong.Now she understood, even Lady Fang was having a hard time.As for He Lili\u2026 She raised her head to look at the ceiling. She could imagine He Lili\u2019s ugly expression right now.Xia Rou actually didn\u2019t disdain her like the house cleaners did, because she could understand.Because of her greed, she insisted on things that didn\u2019t match her ability and identity.Girls especially would become ugly that way.She clenched the cards in her hands tightly, regretting that she had shown Cao Yang her ugly side in the past. IT had even become his last image of her.Once Old Zheng returned, she immediately passed the cards over like she had been burned. She then rushed back to her room.On her bed, she used a towel to cover her face, crying in shame.Note:*White eyed wolf: an ungrateful person.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She set the alarm before she went to bed, so she woke up way before the sky brightened up.Actually it was quite wonderful to take in the sight of the early, early morning. She didn\u2019t need to use her eyes to see, she knew just by listening with her ears.At first, the atmosphere was tranquil. Then a bird woke up in a tree, chirped twice, waking up a second one, then a third\u2026 Very soon, chirping was echoing all throughout the trees.Some were melodious, some were mild. The chirping sound made it seem like the birds were greeting each other.It made people who woke up early experience a blissful start to their day.Xia Rou listened to the noises for a while before getting up. After brushing her teeth and changing her clothes, she went downstairs.Just as she expected, Cao Yang was already stretching in the courtyard.\u201cI was just thinking that if you weren\u2019t coming down soon I would give you a call,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy are your eyes swollen?\u201dActually Xia Rou had already used a cold towel to rub at her eyes, but they were still slightly swollen. It wasn\u2019t hard to notice.\u201cEdema,\u201d she said. \u201cUncle Zheng made some syrup yesterday, I drank too much before I slept.\u201dIt was obvious that her eyes were swollen because she had cried, but Cao Yang didn\u2019t unearth her lies.Her mother had just passed away. It was normal for a young girl to think about her mother while hiding herself inside the blanket to cry. He felt pity just thinking about it.\u201cStretch your muscles.\u201d He changed the topic, giving her some advice. \u201cMorning runs shouldn\u2019t be as slow as night runs, let\u2019s up the speed this time.\u201dXia Rou was happy to see that he changed the topic, following the movements he taught her. Actually, she had learned this from him in the past, so naturally she could easily follow the movements up to his standards.The last time she turned her waist, she saw a window open in the side building. He Lili had pushed the window open and looked in surprise at the two of them.She seemed to be shouting something, but the distance was quite far, so Xia Rou was unable to hear clearly. When she tried again to listen carefully, Cao Yang called her with a \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d and started running. Xia Rou had no choice but to keep up with him.She didn\u2019t turn back, but she could be sure that He Lili was staring at them from the window\u2026Their running speed was much faster. It was Cao Yang\u2019s intention to help her speed up, so she could improve her physique.Xia Rou was so exhausted by his training, she almost just laid on the floor and faked dead. She tried to take in big gasps, the air bursting in to her lungs seeming to be almost too much, burning with pain as she tried to expand her lung capacity.Xia Rou could feel that her efforts put in during her nightly runs weren\u2019t in vain. Her physique was at least much stronger than before.\u201cYou okay?\u201d Cao Yang asked. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou didn\u2019t have the energy to reply to him. She bent down to her knees with one hand out, waving at him in the universal: \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me.\u201dCao Yang laughed, he opened the water bottle and reminded her: \u201cDrink slowly.\u201dActually Cao Yang wasn\u2019t usually so free, so this was probably the fourth time he accompanied her on a run. She usually ran on her own.This young lady looked so fragile, he was worried whether she could sustain the amount of exercise. The results were a surprise; he could see that she persisted in running the last few days, and she was serious about it. Her physique was obviously much improved when compared to before.A disciplined and persistent child was usually likeable, especially when she was a beautiful lady.Cao Yang stared at Xia Rou drinking water with her head tilted upwards, revealing a snowy white neck. Her usually pale face seemed like it was brushed with a blossom-pink color.It was quite pleasing to see a lady in the house, Cao Yang thought.They went back after another round of stretching. When they neared the house, Xia Rou remembered He Lili.She hesitated, then decided to give Cao Yang a reminder: \u201cBrother Cao Yang.\u201d\u201cMm?\u201d\u201cThe fourth floor had two rooms that belonged to aunty,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were quite a few things inside. If you don\u2019t want anyone to touch them, I think it\u2019s better to lock it up.\u201dCao Yang turned his head suddenly to stare at her with a sharp look.Excluding the courtesy of him being nice and having compassion for her, he seemed like the big brother she was familiar with. The man who she was afraid of, but he was\u2026 reliable.Cao Yang nodded. \u201cOkay, I got it.\u201d He didn\u2019t say anything else.When they returned home, Cao Xiong was already seated at the table reading a newspaper. Noticing their entrance, he folded the paper and threw it aside, telling the kitchen to serve the meal.This time, Xia Rou was able to eat more than usual.Cao Xiong looked at her and felt satisfied, saying, \u201cRunning in the morning is much better, it increases your appetite. Eat more so your body can get stronger.\u201dAs a male elder of no blood relation, he could only show his concern with the words \u201ceat more,\u201d and \u201cput on more weight,\u201d for Xia Rou.\u2026\u2026That morning, she didn\u2019t know what Cao Yang told Lady Fang, but when Xia Rou was reading in her room, she could hear a faint argument coming from the room next door. After that, she heard the sound of a door slamming.The room was actually Lady Fang\u2019s room.Usually, Lady Fang would personally go and tidy the rooms on the fourth floor. But from that day onwards, the room was locked.Xia Rou didn\u2019t have any intentions of reporting He Lili\u2019s actions when she told Cao Yang about it. He Lili and Cao Yang, comparing the two she didn\u2019t even need to think and knew who was much closer to Madam Cao. Because of that, she didn\u2019t want to see He Lili rely on Lady Fang\u2019s position and carelessly touch the items in the room, not showing any respect to Cao Yang\u2019s mother.It was just that Cao Yang didn\u2019t know about it, and would obviously be unhappy if he knew.She knew He Lili would probably hold a grudge toward her because of this. But He Lili\u2019s grudge wouldn\u2019t cause much harm to her anyways.Most of all, she felt pity for Lady Fang.

She realized that Lady Fang was a hard worker, was kind and treated others with sincerity. That was probably why she had a foothold in the Cao Family, and her colleagues also turned a blind eye toward He Lili\u2019s actions.She was actually a pretty good person, but she was brought down by her daughter.Xia Rou remembered that Lady Fang was suddenly dismissed in the past.She didn\u2019t like Lady Fang then, so she felt a little happy when she learned Lady Fang was leaving and didn\u2019t think too deeply on the reason. Now that she was thinking back, it was fishy.Although she was just an aunt who was employed by the family, Madam Cao had very high expectations of her. Even when Madam Cao fell ill, she was entrusted with taking care of the two younger sons.That was why Cao Xing and Cao An were close to her. Cao Xiong and the two elder sons would also respect her.He Lili might have thought her mother was very valuable to the Cao Family, but she didn\u2019t know that the Cao Family was willing to give Lady Fang only a little bit of favor.This was because the Cao Family members weren\u2019t people to let others step over them.\u2026\u2026Cao Xiong left during the day again. Translated by The NovelstWhen it was lunchtime, Xia Rou went to the main building dining room by herself. When she walked to the door, she saw Cao Yang already in his seat. He Lili was standing in front of him, her head lowered, her fingers uneasily crossed over each other.Xia Rou\u2019s footsteps immediately came to a stop.But Cao Yang had already noticed her, even greeting her: \u201cXia Rou, come eat.\u201dXia Rou slowly moved to the table.Then she heard him say to He Lili: \u201cI understand, let\u2019s speak later. You can go back first.\u201dAfter he finished the sentence, he didn\u2019t say anything else to He Lili.Couldn\u2019t he just tell her, \u201cIt\u2019s already time for lunch, let\u2019s eat together\u201d?He Lili glanced at the dining table, bitterness filling her heart as she watched Xia Rou slowly walking to the table. But she knew that if she continued to stand there, she would be embarrassed because she was the only one standing, and that tattletale would also get a change to watch her get humiliated.Most of what she had said to Xia Rou like \u201cgrowing up with the Cao Family brothers from a young age,\u201d was all actually made up by He Lili.When she had arrived to the Cao Family, Cao An as the youngest was already eight years old, at just the age that boys were usually playful like monkeys. Who would actually be patient enough to play with a girl?Even when they became older, with the protection Cao Xiong arranged for his sons, how would it be possible that he would let a mere aunt\u2019s daughter to become close to them?To put it bluntly, the relationship between herself and the brothers was nothing but acquaintances, just knowing each other and sometimes greeting each other when they met. And the privileges given to her were all due to the slight affection they had for her mother. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be able to speak out even a word in the Cao Family.Looking at Xia Rou coming nearer, she answered with a \u201cMn\u201d and turned to walk out.No matter how slowly Xia Rou walked, the distance between the door to the dining table was too short. She stood beside the table, waiting for He Lili to turn around so she wouldn\u2019t feel embarrassed.She always felt that she could see a shadow of her past self in He Lili, so making He Lili embarrassed felt like she was embarrassing herself.It was impossible for Cao Yang to not notice her slow movements. He thought on it a bit and immediately understood her intentions, and couldn\u2019t help but to take a few more looks at Xia Rou.But he didn\u2019t say anything about it. The pair had lunch together.Xia Rou held the rice bowl, recalling her past where she would always lower her head when listening to Cao Yang\u2019s lessons.But most of the time, she would sit in front of him. As for Cao Yang, he would either sit behind the study table and stare at her, or lean on the table in front of her while silently taking a drag. He would also sometimes walk around back and forth while he smoked.She wouldn\u2019t dare to even raise her head, only staring at his black leather shoes pacing in front of her. Only then would she know that she had caused a lot of trouble for him and put him in a difficult position.But no matter what it was, he would always manage to fulfill her requests. Even the last time they had met, he lost his temper and smoked several cigarettes, but in the end he still promised to help her resolve that matter.In order to protect her value. Translated by The NovelstBecause as Xia Rou, the only valuable thing she had was the relationship between herself and the Cao Family.If she couldn\u2019t beg the Cao Family to resolve her troubles, then to someone\u2019s perspective she was nothing but a useless woman.Anyhow, Xia Rou already had a faint understanding of it in the past, but she just didn\u2019t want to face the reality.And big brother must have known it all along. Probably because of this, he would try his best to fulfill all her requests.Slowly, she started to think that he was omnipotent. As long as he was there, except for her fear of him, there was nothing else she had to be afraid of.Until the moment she fell from that tall building, when she had finally realized the truth.Cao Yang ah\u2026 he wasn\u2019t really that almighty!He did so much for her, but in the end he still couldn\u2019t protect her life.But she didn\u2019t blame him at all. The one who should be blamed was her own self.The moment she fell, she could even see that face getting further and further away. It was a frightening face.She knew it wasn\u2019t intentional. It was just an accident.Because he wasn\u2019t brave enough to murder her deliberately.Because both he and she knew, if she died at the scene, her so called big brother Cao Yang would definitely\u2026 take revenge for her!Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At least, looking from the perspective of controlling her emotions, she was much better at it now.She couldn\u2019t help but raise her eyes to look at Cao Yang.Cao Yang was curious: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d She chuckled.To be able to sit in front of big brother and smile leisurely, that was something that she didn\u2019t even dare to imagine before her death.Be satisfied, Xia Rou. Translated by The NovelstDon\u2019t make him angry again, don\u2019t cause trouble for him this time. If you listen to his words, he will definitely help you life a peaceful life.Don\u2019t be greedy about those things that don\u2019t belong to you anymore. Just like what he said in the past, all those complicated people and things she\u2026 couldn\u2019t handle it.Look, wasn\u2019t her ending the best proof for her already?Xia Rou let out a long sigh, then took another glance at Cao Yang. While staring at his handsome profile, she brutally downed a spoonful of rice.Cao Yang raised his eyebrow.Just now she was spacing out while eating her rice, then she teared up. As he thought she was going to cry, in the end she raised her eyes and stared at him before laughing by herself.The laugh came out of nowhere, it was as if his existence could cheer her up.Although it was baffling\u2026 at least it was better than crying at the dining table. A lady would of course look prettier when she smiled.This little girl looked very elegant when she smiled with her lips closed and the corner of her mouth tilted upwards. It reminded him of a milky white cat he saw at someone else\u2019s house.Snowy white, soft, and obedient.Cao Yang felt that Xia Rou\u2019s existence wasn\u2019t a bother, but was also super troublesome.Cao Yang, as a man, clearly knew how adult women thought, and could easily handle them.However, toward an adolescent like Xia Rou, he couldn\u2019t take her as an adult woman, nor could he use a man\u2019s perspective to look at her. As an elder of the opposite sex, he really couldn\u2019t understand what she was thinking inside.A 15-year-old girl\u2019s worldview was probably in a different dimension to a 29-year-old man\u2019s.Nevermind, who cared about what she was thinking as long as she was happy. That would be enough.Looking at the smile on this pretty lady, he suddenly felt like his meal was much tastier.He hadn\u2019t really thought of it, but ever since Xia Rou\u2019s arrival to the house, he realized that before the house had always been\u2026 a little too cold.\u201cBrother Cao Yang.\u201d Xia Rou suddenly spoke up. \u201cWhen will the renovation be over?\u201d\u201cProbably before school starts you can move in. After the renovation, you should let it rest for a bit, it\u2019s not good to move in immediately,\u201d Cao Yang replied. \u201cWhy?\u201dXia Rou took some vegetables from a dish, and said: \u201cYesterday Brother Cao Xing had a huge plush rabbit delivered to me, it\u2019s super duper big. My room has no more space already.\u201dCao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dCao Yang also felt helpless. \u201cYou noticed? He\u2019s had this hobby since he was young. Don\u2019t tell my father, if he knows Cao Xing will get beaten up again.\u201dXia Rou then said, her small face very serious: \u201cWhy would I? All those were for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 We all know who they\u2019re really for.\u201d Cao Yang was speechless, even this little girl was defending Cao Xing.Xia Rou sighed: \u201cBrother Cao Xing is quite pitiful, that\u2019s his only hobby.\u201d\u201cThis hobby is kind of shameful.\u201d Cao Yang hmmphed. Actually he thought along the same lines as Cao Xiong, he couldn\u2019t really tolerate Cao Xing being obsessed with those furry, soft plushies.It was so shameful!Xia Rou sighed inside, she felt a little sad.Third brother only had this sort of hobby. Even though it was a little odd, it wasn\u2019t really a big deal at all.Wait until fourth brother came back, that would be the big deal.In the past ten years, she had to cover for Cao An. Even after her death, the Cao Family father and sons didn\u2019t have a hint about Cao An.Thinking of Cao An, she remembered the room on the second floor. Xia Rou suddenly remembered a question that she had hidden in her heart for a long time, but never had the chance to ask.\u201cBrother Cao Yang, yesterday I went to look at the room. Who chose the blue wallpaper?\u201d She finally managed to ask.\u201cMe,\u201d Cao Yang replied without any hesitation. \u201cActually the wallpaper I wanted to choose was the same as the one in my room, but I felt like it might be too manly. So I chose that one with the flower pattern. Do you like it?\u201dReally!As she expected.This question had always bothered her in the past, but the truth was really what she\u2019s guessed.The aesthetic judgment of a man and a woman was totally different. In the eyes of Cao Yang, that light blue wallpaper with dark rose patterns on it was probably already very \u201cgirly\u201d to him.Xia Rou blinked her eyes, then suddenly burst into laughter.There was a part of her heart that became much more relaxed. That self-pity in the past, those worries were like dust being eliminated in the sun in front of her.Cao Yang was baffled by her laughter. Translated by The NovelstHe really couldn\u2019t understand why this young lady, sometimes she teared up and sometimes she laughed so happily.Although it was really confusing, it\u2026 indeed lifted his mood.The corner of Cao Yang\u2019s mouth also tilted up.\u2026\u2026The summer was peaceful and full of leisure. Xia Rou read books, revised her studies and exercised every day to spend her time.Ever since that day she ran into He Lili in the dining room, He Lili never sought her out again. That enthusiasm she had at their first meeting seemed to be gone. Sometimes when they ran into each other, she would just nod her head at her.Surprisingly He Lili didn\u2019t lose her temper at her because Xia Rou had informed Cao Yang about that matter. Instead, Lady Fang\u2019s goodwill toward Xia Rou had faded, she didn\u2019t seem to like her as much as before.It looked like the fates couldn\u2019t be forced.In the past, she and Lady Fang hadn\u2019t liked each other, but she had liked He Lili. In this life, she had tried to make a good impression on Lady Fang, but because of He Lili, their feelings faded. A person\u2019s heart is usually biased. No matter how much Lady Fang liked her, of course it would never surpass her love for her own daughter.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was somehow annoying.Xia Rou had been reading a book for the entire afternoon and started to feel sleepy. She wasn\u2019t aware of when, but the book fell to the floor and she fell to sleep while curling up on the bed.By the time she woke the sky had already begun turning dark. She yawned and opened the window, stretching her hand out to test the temperature outside. It was still boiling hot. She lowered her head and saw two people standing under a tree in the courtyard.The person facing her direction was Cao Yang, and the person with her back to her was\u2026 He Lili?Cao Yang had both his hands in his pockets. She couldn\u2019t see his expression very clearly, but his stance was relaxed. He Lili had both hands held in front of her, her head slightly lowered.Xia Rou took a few glances and wanted to pull her head back in \u2013 being outside the window was too hot!But Cao Yang had already seen her and even waved at her. So she had no choice but to wave back at him and then withdraw from her position at the window.This sauna-like weather made her fretful. But because her body ran cold and she was on her period, she didn\u2019t dare turn on the air-con too cold, scared that her stomach might cramp.Closing the window, she leaned on the table for a while. Then she couldn\u2019t resist stretching out her neck again and taking another look.It was just when they had finished their conversation. He Lili turned around and walked away toward Xia Rou\u2019s direction. She raised her head on her way and glanced at Xia Rou\u2019s window.Obviously, He Lili noticed her. Translated by The NovelstIt was like she was spying on them. Xia Rou felt a little wronged.She took another look, and this time Cao Yang was raising his head and staring in her direction. He even took out his phone. Her own phone, thrown carelessly on the bed, began to ring, so she ran to her bed and answered the call.\u201cIt\u2019s time to eat.\u201d Cao Yang said.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like eating.\u201d Xia Rou collapsed onto the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t have any appetite.\u201d\u201cHurry and come down!\u201d Cao Yang ignored her complaints and ordered her, \u201cYou\u2019re so skinny already and you still don\u2019t want to eat!\u201dXia Rou, crestfallen, emerged from her room.She ran into He Lili in the corridor. Her face didn\u2019t look too good; she brushed against Xia Rou\u2019s shoulder and left without greeting her.Xia Rou also didn\u2019t bother to greet her, obediently heading down the stairs like a tamed wife. After leaving the building, she felt like she was pushed into a hot steamer.Cao Yang was still waiting for her under that tree. She didn\u2019t pay attention to him and instead trotted right to the main building. She turned around and shouted at him on her way: \u201cWhy are you still standing there! It\u2019s so hot! Come faster!\u201dCao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d You little girl!Cao Yang followed her with big steps to the dining room and said: \u201cThis hot and you\u2019re still wearing long sleeves?\u201d\u201cMy body is averse to the cold.\u201d Xia Rou said weakly.Cao Yang remembered that Xia Rou\u2019s face was always pale, then asked: \u201cDo you have anemia?\u201d\u201cMn.\u201d Xia Rou nodded. She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite.Cao Yang saw her picking at her food and furrowed his brows. Then he placed a whole clump of spinach into her bowl. \u201cNot enough blood yet you still pick at your food! Eat the spinach!\u201dNot enough blood yet you still pick at your food! Eat the spinach!Xia Rou paused with her chopsticks in her hand.This sentence, she\u2019d heard it from big brother before, but it was now\u2026 much earlier than compared to the past.Xia Rou stared at that pile of dark green, finishing it all up at once.Just like a squirrel!Cao Yang looked at her and couldn\u2019t help his smile.\u201cThese few days have been like a sauna outside. Don\u2019t go running anymore. I\u2019ll bring you to the underground swimming pool after we finish eating,\u201d he said.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Xia Rou shook her head.\u201cDon\u2019t be lazy,\u201d Cao Yang replied.Xia Rou had no other way to explain to him, so with a deadpan face she said: \u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient for me today.\u201dCao Yang wanted to ask how swimming was inconvenient, then seemed to become enlightened. A woman\u2019s inconvenience of course was because of their period.Xia Rou\u2026 was already 15 this year, right? Don\u2019t tell him\u2026Cao Yang struggled for a long while, but thinking that there wasn\u2019t a female elder by her side, he was worried that no one had taught her about those things. In the end, he remained stoic and said with a solemn face: \u201cYou\u2026 this is not your first time right?\u201dXia Rou was shocked as if by lightning!Even in the past, Cao Yang had never asked here these things! What was the difference now?She struggled inwardly for a long time, before replying with an equally stoic and solemn face: \u201cNo, I got it last year.\u201dThen she noticed Cao Yang exhale a long, relieved sigh, touching his nose and decisively ending the awkward topic: \u201cMy fourth little brother is coming back soon.\u201d\u201cBrother Cao An?\u201d Xia Rou was happy to change the topic, and even more excited to hear news about Cao An. Because she had only met Cao An in this life when they were young, they were completely like strangers. So these last few days she resisted the urge and tried not to ask about Cao An.But she couldn\u2019t hide her joy at learning that Cao An was coming back. That happiness written in her eyes overflowed, and stunned Cao Yang.He felt it a little strange.

In a great mood, the boiling hot weather didn\u2019t seem so annoying to her any longer.When she got upstairs and passed Lady Fang\u2019s room, she heard an argument coming from the door that was cracked open.\u201cYou wanted to enter a large company, and Cao Yang arranged it for you. What are you dissatisfied for? What are you trying to do!\u201d\u201cB-but, I don\u2019t want to go to Fen City! I want to stay here!\u201d\u201cHere is the provincial capital, the headquarters of the provincial capital. Do you think you can get in so easily?\u201d\u201cI know it will be hard, but surely Cao Yang will have his ways\u2026\u201dThe room was silent for a moment, then a loud, angry voice started: \u201cWhether or not he has a way, what does that have to do with you!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a favor from the east warzone Commander\u2019s eldest son! Do you think you can simply ask for it?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t even speak to me and went to Cao Yang directly on your own! How can you be so fearless!\u201d Translated by The Novelst\u201cDo you know how many people can\u2019t even make it through the door, not even being able to lay eyes on the Cao Family!\u201d\u201cDo you see the guards at the entrance! Do you think that just anybody can get into this courtyard? Do you think that anyone can simply get a favor from the Cao Family!\u201d\u201cDo you think after you asked for this favor, and you\u2019re still not satisfied, that they would have to patch it up for you?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a look in the mirror! Who do you think you are!\u201dThe room went silent again. She could imagine how embarrassed He Lili was feeling.Outside of the room, Xia Rou also felt very embarrassed.Every sentence out of Lady Fang\u2019s mouth was a slap to He Lili\u2019s face. At the same time it was also a slap to Xia Rou\u2019s face.Suddenly she started to feel jealous of He Lili. She was jealous that He Lili had someone like Lady Fang to scold her. If there was someone in the past who had scolded her like that, maybe she would have realized her mistakes earlier.But obviously, He Lili was still unable to recognize her own mistakes.She continued to bite out: \u201cDon\u2019t they have to consider you?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Lady Fang became even angrier. \u201cWhat face do I have? I have lost all face because of you!\u201d\u201cAt least, the affection of many years\u2026\u201d\u201cYou better keep your mouth shut!\u201d Lady Fang flew into a rage.\u201cAffection? What affection! This is all in your head! I work for them and they give me a salary, what affection is there?\u201dThe consequence of becoming so enraged was upon Lady Fang. She became weak and exhausted.\u201cYou urgh\u2026 You better keep those thoughts to yourself! Those thoughts of yours\u2026 it\u2019s impossible!\u201d\u201cI.. What have I thought about!\u201d He Lili withdrew a little.\u201cYou think others are stupid? Those thoughts of yours, you think others couldn\u2019t see right through you?\u201d Lady Fang felt helpless and continued. \u201cWhy do you think I sent you to a boarding school for high school? It\u2019s because you kept following Cao Yang and Cao Bin around so much. The commander didn\u2019t like it so he gave me a warning. If I didn\u2019t send you to boarding school, I might even have lost my job\u2026\u201dObviously He Lili was shocked by this information.Lady Fang went on: \u201cYou want to stay here. Of course Cao Yang could do that. How can that be considered difficult for Cao Yang? But he insisted on placing you in Fen City. Why? Why didn\u2019t you think further?\u201d Her voice revealed how tired she was, all due to the worry about the troubles caused by her daughter who didn\u2019t recognize the immensity of heaven and earth.The room rang with silence for another moment. Then He Lili\u2019s wailing sounded from the room.\u201cWhy! Why!\u201d She cried out, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I compare to other people! I have also graduated from a second tier university! You have been working hard with your own two hands, why can\u2019t we compare to others?\u201d\u201cWhy can that mistress\u2019 child act like a princess!

Or is she not!\u201dLady Fang paused, then replied: \u201cOf course she\u2019s not. If she was indeed his child, with his personality, he definitely would have taken her in earlier instead of waiting until now.\u201dHe Lili then stubbornly persisted: \u201cThen why can she!\u201d\u201cWe have been working so hard trying to feed ourselves, but our lives can\u2019t even compare to a mistress\u2019 child! Why is she above us? She has no sense of shame!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t run your mouth like that!\u201d Lady Fang scolded. \u201cWhen did Xia Rou step above you! Everything is in your imagination!\u201d\u201cHow can you compare like that?\u201d Lady Fang shouted. \u201cEnough!\u201dEnough. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou didn\u2019t want to hear any more.Mistress\u2019 child \u2013 this word was like a curse to her in the past.Xia Rou took a deep breath and shook her head in a small motion, trying to shake off the sudden mood around her. She walked in large steps back to her own room, a bang sounding as the door shut.All of a sudden, the room beside hers also went quiet. After a while, another bang sounded.Why\u2026?In the past, Xia Rou had always asked herself that same question.Why did she have to marry an ordinary, white-collar man, and step back to the class where the ordinary people lived?Why couldn\u2019t she remain where she was?She constantly asked herself \u201cwhy\u201d like she was possessed. She stubbornly insisted on getting engaged with someone that didn\u2019t suit her.Big brother must have felt so helpless at that time.His own marriage didn\u2019t go well either.

A stumbling dream full of mistakes.You dreamed it, but now you\u2019ve woken up. You should understand that what\u2019s in front of you is reality now, and think of how to proceed to your next step.Don\u2019t ever fall again. Translated by The NovelstDon\u2019t ever disappoint those people who care about you again.\u2026\u2026He Lili didn\u2019t say goodbye to Xia Rou and left for Fen City.Lady Fang and Xia Rou had also gone back to their previous relationship where they were both polite to each other. The close atmosphere between the two in the early days couldn\u2019t be recovered.Because Xia Rou used cold water that day, her stomach started to act up in pain on the second day. She laid in bed the entire day.It was the housecleaner, Sister Yu, who noticed. She asked Xia Rou how she was, and went into the kitchen and told Old Zheng about it. Old Zheng cooked a bowl of hot soup for Xia Rou and passed it to Xiao Yang.Cao Yang didn\u2019t see Xia Rou at dinner, so he asked about her. Only then did he find out what happened from Xiao Yang.He even specially came to her room to visit her.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cSometimes my stomach hurts when I touch cold water. It\u2019s normal.\u201d\u201cYou know you\u2019ll be in pain but you still touch cold water.\u201d Cao Yang said with a stiff face.Most women Cao Yang met were usually slim but healthy. He hadn\u2019t met a girl that was as weak as Xia Rou. The little girl\u2019s face was pale and she seemed so in pain that her lips were white. She was already so skinny, but looking at her curled up in bed, it made him even more worried.But it was a womanly ailment, he couldn\u2019t help at all.Cao Yang had a sharp eye. With just a look he knew there was a change in the atmosphere between Lady Fang and Xia Rou. Then he remembered He Lili, and it wasn\u2019t hard for him to guess what happened.He skipped Lady Fang and found Sister Yu instead to ask her to take care of Xia Rou.Since it was a special request from Cao Yang, of course Xia Rou was very well taken care of. Although it was so painful she almost fainted and revived, she recovered immediately after her period ended.The weather was so hot she couldn\u2019t stand it when she went for her morning run, so Xia Rou changed to swim at the underground pool.When Cao Yang went underground, he saw Xia Rou happily cruising in the water. Snowy white skin, straight slim legs; she seemed like a little mermaid under the blue-tinted water of the pool.Noticing Cao Yang\u2019s arrival, she immediately swam to the side, took off her goggles and wiped her face. She raised her head and addressed: \u201cBrother Cao Yang.\u201dCao Yang squatted down: \u201cYour swimming isn\u2019t bad. Who did you learn from?\u201dYou.Xia Rou smiled: \u201cThere\u2019s a swimming class at school.\u201d\u201cYou, little mermaid!\u201d Someone got off of the elevator.\u201cBrother Cao Bin, you\u2019ve returned? What about Brother Cao Xing?\u201d\u201cHe had dinner plans today, probably won\u2019t be back until tomorrow.\u201d Cao Bin said, grinning. \u201cHow is it, are you still getting used to it around here?\u201dXia Rou spoke a few more words with him and went back to swimming.After a lap or two, she saw Cao Yang and Cao Bin both sitting on the wicker chairs beside the pool. She realized they might have something important to discuss, so she got out of the pool, greeted them, and left first.Before the elevator doors closed up, she looked at the pair beside the pool.Both the brothers were wearing straight-leg suits, revealing their long legs. Their abdominal muscles and the muscles in their shoulders and arms looked beautiful. The brothers resembled each other, both were handsome. Cao Yang was more masculine, while Cao Bin exuded a sense of maturity.Each had his own forte.She recalled Cao Xing and Cao An again.The four brothers of the Cao Family, also popularly known as the four golden bachelors. Even the ladies from wealthy families would go after them like a flock of ducks.All four were smart in nature. They also had a better background when compared to most. They were fated to be that stand-out phoenix out of many.They weren\u2019t people that could be desired by girls like He Lili or herself.Xia Rou thought she actually did have something in which she was stronger than He Lili. She at least knew the difference in distance between herself and the four brothers.That was why in the past, although she might have thought she could even have caught the moon, she never even thought of having one of the four brothers.Cao Bin looked at her as she boarded the elevator.\u201cShe\u2019s quite tactful. She could read the atmosphere.\u201d He turned his head to speak with Cao Yang. \u201cHow is she? Is she troublesome?\u201dCao Yang responded: \u201cVery obedient. She\u2019s a good child.\u201dCao Bin added: \u201cJust afraid that she might turn into someone like He Lili someday. That would be troublesome.\u201d\u201cShe won\u2019t.\u201d Cao Yang lit a cigarette. \u201cHe Lili doesn\u2019t have anyone to teach her, but there\u2019s still me for Xiao Rou.\u201dCao Bin made a \u201cho!\u201d sound. \u201cHow long have I been away? She\u2019s already to your liking?\u201d\u201cGet lost,\u201d said Cao Yang. \u201cIf she\u2019s taught properly, she\u2019s definitely a good girl.\u201dThen he paused, adding: \u201cFather likes her a lot. When she\u2019s around, he eats more than usual.\u201dBoth brothers remained silent for a while.\u201cFine,\u201d Cao Bin said. \u201cJust for this one reason she\u2019s worthy to raise, then.\u201dHe didn\u2019t continue asking on how the Cao Family should raise her.Although he was still someone who could make decisions outside, in this house there was still Cao Yang above him, and above Cao Yang was still Cao Xiong.So it didn\u2019t really fall in his hands.Cao Yang didn\u2019t like to hear Cao Bin talk about Xia Rou like that, like she was just a car or a dog.But he didn\u2019t say anything.

This\u2026 I bought this for you.\u201d Cao Xing felt cold sweat all over his body.He had thought of returning home early so he could send this to the side building. Who could have expected that the weather was so nice that his father told the kitchen to serve breakfast under a tree in the courtyard? And that was how he got caught red-handed.\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is what I wanted! Thank you Brother Cao Xing.\u201d Xia Rou, as an expert in covering for others, immediately came forward.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Cao Xing forced a dry laugh. \u201cY-you\u2019re welcome, as long as you like it.\u201d Translated by The NovelstCao Xiong looked at that pair with their clumsy act, coldly snorting out a \u201chmmph\u201d and didn\u2019t bother with them.Cao Bin was struck dumb, his eyes and mouth both wide open.He thought Cao Yang liked Xia Rou because their close proximity meant they would meet often in the house, so it was natural that he developed some affection toward her, especially since she was such a cute little lady.But what was up with Cao Xing picking up that plushie-collecting habit again?Cao Xing dared to play with dolls and there seemed to be something wrong with their father too, he actually didn\u2019t take out his leather belt to beat him!The most unbelievable of all was Xia Rou. This little girl actually dared to try and act out such a clumsy scene in front of their father?Wasn\u2019t she afraid of Cao Xiong at all?And what happened to their father who always took out his leather belt to beat them without allowing explanations? He actually just let it go with a \u201chmmph\u201d?Since when did their father become so easy to get along with?When!He tilted his body toward Cao Yang and spoke out of the corner of his mouth: \u201cWhat the heck happened while I was away?\u201dHe was gone for only a short while! How did the image of the house change so drastically?Cao Yang had a small smile on his face. \u201cThere\u2019s a girl in the house now, of course it\u2019s different now.\u201dHe lifted his cup and took a slip of the black tea, staring at Xia Rou whispering secretively with Cao Xing, then turning to look at Cao Xiong, the master of the house.Although his father didn\u2019t say anything, instead choosing to read the newspaper, he seemed to be in a great mood, accompanied by the soft sound of Xia Rou\u2019s murmurs to Cao Xing.\u201cHow\u2019s the renovation on the second floor going?\u201d Cao Xiong put down the newspaper to ask.\u201cEverything\u2019s tidied up and it\u2019s been sitting for several days,\u201d Cao Yang replied.\u201cGet someone to test the formaldehyde levels. If everything\u2019s fine, have Xiao Rou move. It\u2019s not a good look to keep her in the side building.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cWhen is the fourth coming back?\u201d Cao Xiong asked again.\u201cProbably in a week or two. He\u2019s traveling with his friends.\u201d\u201cHmmph.\u201dXia Rou, hearing Cao An\u2019s name, immediately stopped talking and strained to hear what was being said.She felt a gaze on her, so she turned her gaze to Cao Bin and saw him observing her.So Xia Rou pulled up a smile for him.Cao Bin was stunned by her action.Xia Rou knew why Cao Bin was observing her.Among the four brothers, Cao Bin was probably the hardest to speak with. He was also the last among the four to come to accept her.He had many thoughts he harbored deep in his mind, and had always been that way. Although he always smiled, he never actually believed in others. Because of this personality, he didn\u2019t join the army like Cao Yang and Cao Xing to follow in their father\u2019s footsteps. Instead he aimed to be involved in politics.By now, he had already moved up in the ranks of the municipal government of Hu City at the age of 27. Of course, his family background could be counted as one factor of his success, but most important was his own ability.Xia Rou had even thought of this before. After her death, her big brother Cao Yang would surely take revenge for her.And the person beside him to plan it all would be her second brother Cao Bin.And then fourth brother would try his best to stop third brother, lest he find the person responsible and punch him to death.In the early days of her new life, every time she would think of her death, she felt uncontrollably sad in her heart.But now her heart was much calmer. She could even look back at her past. Thinking back to those matters, she could even imagine such funny situations.When she turned her gaze to Cao Bin again, her gaze was friendly and affectionate.Thinking about it now, she hadn\u2019t really been close to Cao Bin at all.She thought that he didn\u2019t really like her.But after he saw Cao Yang come to dote on her, and Cao Xing and Cao An being nice to her, Cao Bin chose to accept her.Although he didn\u2019t like her, he was still willing to take her as a younger sister after accepting her.As she was remembering these details, she felt a fresh wave of gratitude toward him in her heart.Cao Bin was surprised.Because of his job, he had less time to spend at home. That day a lot of things had happened that surprised him, but the most astonishing of all was Xia Rou.She wasn\u2019t afraid of them at all.The men of the Cao Family, from Cao Xiong to Cao Xing, she wasn\u2019t afraid of any of them. Somehow she had a sense of familiarity toward each member and the intimacy seemed to be from the heart.The reason she wasn\u2019t afraid was due to this intimacy.Cao Bin thought that this girl named Xia Rou was either a shrewd, deep person, or\u2026 she was truly a simple-minded person.Cao Bin leveled another deep stare at her and decided to believe she was the latter.This was because when Xia Rou smiled at him, there was only affection in her smile, without any intention to flatter or calculate like those other women.And even more importantly, if a person was really shrewd, then her eyes wouldn\u2019t be able to look as clean as hers.He used his sharp gaze and continued to observe her, realizing she really was a pleasant girl to look at.It even lifted his mood after staring at her for so long.And just like that, Cao Bin decided to start liking Xia Rou.This happened much earlier when compared to the past when he decided to only accept Xia Rou.\u2026\u2026Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once again she stepped into the room with blue, rose-patterned wallpaper.This time she only felt that the light blue color made the room look refreshing.Cao Xing specially bought a super huge plushie for her.However, the most surprising thing of all in this life was that the plushies bought for her by Cao Xing were all enormous. In the past, he used to act like a donkey, sneaking around and trying to hide his tail, and would bring around small plushies.\u2026\u2026In the early days of August, Xia Rou received her acceptance letter from Nan Hua High School.Later in August, there weren\u2019t many days left before the first day of school. The fourth brother of the family, Cao An, who Xia Rou was constantly thinking about, finally returned home.Cao An stood out in the Cao Family. Translated by The NovelstAmong the four, he was the only one who resembled his mother more than his father. This was why he was treasured deeply by Madam Cao ever since he was young. And after that, because he looked so much like his mother, Cao Xiong always treated him with leniency. Later, Cao Xiong took issue with Cao An\u2019s personality, but by then it was too late for Cao Xiong to teach him strictly. Cao An\u2019s personality had already settled and it was hard to correct.He was the only son to not involve himself in the army or in politics. He studied abroad, majoring in fashion design.He loved fashion; after he returned to the country he wanted to put on a great show in the fashion industry.But Xia Rou knew that later he would come to surrender to his father after all and get started in the real estate industry.Within this house, even one word from Cao Xiong was a heavy weight. Nobody could defy him in the end.Just as Xia Rou remembered, Cao An didn\u2019t return alone. He brought along another person to stay with the Cao Family.\u201cThis is my classmate, He Chengzhe. We\u2019re planning to cooperate and build a studio,\u201d he said.He Chengzhe had a tall stature, with long legs and a handsome face. The pair were so fashionable that they looked like models. They were both young, just past their twenties, and could be called two big boys.Xia Rou was also familiar with He Chengzhe. In her past, she had witnessed their on-again, off-again relationship. No matter how they tried to separate, they never could. And with that, they were stuck together for ten years.He Chengzhe went to greet Cao Xiong and Cao Yang. As he went off, it was impossible for Cao An not to notice Xia Rou, who stood beside Cao Yang.\u201cXia Rou, right?\u201d He had friendly eyes that hinted at romance, making him look like a playboy. \u201cI\u2019m Cao An. We met when we were young.\u201dXia Rou greeted him tactfully. \u201cBrother Cao An.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up to be a young lady already,\u201d Cao An exclaimed.Xia Rou chuckled. Her somber eyes curved into crescents with happiness, and her snowy white face gave out a sense of refinement. While the men talked, she quietly sat aside.Cao An had a good first impression of her.\u201cChengzhe hasn\u2019t found a room yet so he\u2019s going to be staying here temporarily. Don\u2019t worry about it, there\u2019s no need to arrange a guest room. He can just stay in my room. We\u2019re roommates anyways, we\u2019ve already been living together for a few years.\u201dThus, He Chengzhe came to stay with the Cao Family.When they returned to their room, He Chengzhe asked: \u201cWho was that girl?\u201dCao An had a cigarette between his lips. He sat down on the bed to take off his shoes. \u201cMy father used to have a woman and she just passed away a little while ago due to sickness. Xia Rou is her child.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me she\u2019s your biological younger sister?\u201d He Chengzhe jokingly asked.\u201cNope,\u201d Cao An was pretty certain of this. \u201cWhen my father met her mother, she was already seven or eight. Her biological father\u2019s surname is Xia, but he ran off with another woman.\u201d\u201cWhy does her background sound so dramatic?\u201d He Chengzhe was surprised. \u201cShe\u2019s a cute little lady, though.\u201d\u201cWhy, do you like that kind of girl?\u201d Cao An glared at him from his side.\u201cShe\u2019s quite young. Wait a couple more years and when she\u2019s an adult, I guess it\u2019d be possible.\u201d He Chengzhe snatched the cigarette from Cao An\u2019s mouth and put it between his own lips, intentionally teasing.Cao An immediately gave him a kick. He Chengzhe laughed as he jumped off the bed.The two played around for some time before they stopped.\u201cYour family\u2019s quite kind. Your father and brothers seem to be nice to her and it looks like they\u2019re getting along well.\u201dA child like Xia Rou who was staying in someone else\u2019s house \u2013 no matter how she tried to hide it, it would still be evident if she was unhappy living with them. But seeing that little girl get along with Cao Xiong and Cao Yang without even a hint of falseness meant that the men in the Cao Family really did treat her well.\u201cHer mother followed my father for eight years,\u201d Cao An explained. \u201cMy father liked that woman.\u201d\u201cIf he liked her, why didn\u2019t he marry her?\u201d He Chengzhe asked.Cao An shot him a calm look. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason he couldn\u2019t get married.\u201d\u201cRight, everyone has their own difficulties.\u201d He Chengzhe blew out smoke and seemed to be ironically ridiculing himself.Cao An said unhappily, \u201cDidn\u2019t we agree not to talk about this?\u201dHe Chengzhe stared at him for a while, then turned around to enter the bathroom.Cao An lit up another cigarette in annoyance.He was deep in thought. His father must have really liked Cheng Wan, or else big brother wouldn\u2019t have specifically reminded him not to bring her up during their conversation on the phone, in order to avoid their father falling into depression again.Cao Yang also told him to be nice to Xia Rou.Father likes her, he said. Ever since her arrival to their house, their father seemed to be in better spirits.She\u2019s a good child, was what he said. Translated by The NovelstThis time that Cao An returned, he realized that his father really was getting old just like big brother had said.He remembered the last time he came back on holiday, his father didn\u2019t seem to have aged so much then. But after Cheng Wan\u2019s passing, it was like she took a part of him with her.That Xia Rou seemed to be nice at least. He didn\u2019t hate her.But Cao An was still surprised that she had even managed to earn the praise \u201ca good child\u201d from Cao Yang.In their family, Cao Yang was the second coming of Cao Xiong. He seemed to almost be an identical copy of Cao Xiong. He was strict to his little brothers and didn\u2019t lose to his father.That little girl, able to appear so leisurely in front of the two and naturally accept their family, might just be capable.Cao An thought that she probably just hadn\u2019t seen how the father and son really were when they were outside the house.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That was why Xia Rou wanted to get close to Cao An, but this kind of thing couldn\u2019t be forced.She thought that her existence was probably still just like a stranger\u2019s to Cao An, so it would be odd if she suddenly acted close. She could only push down her feelings.Cao An and He Chengzhe, living out of the same room, mostly stayed together and appeared at the same times. She heard that the two were building their own studio and that Cao An was helping He Chengzhe house-hunt, so they were usually out until late. Although Xia Rou lived on the same floor, her chances to meet Cao An were very limited.After having dinner with Cao Xiong, she rested a while before changing into her running gear.The hottest season had passed so she finally returned to running. Although swimming was a good option, she still preferred to exercise outdoors.That year, Cao Yang had disliked seeing her body so weak so he forced her to run. That was when she began to enjoy exercising outside.She put on her headphones and listening to some cheery music, greeted the guards at the gate and ran out of the Cao Family\u2019s residence.She followed the main road and crossed two intersections before making a turn toward the ecological park. She hadn\u2019t yet run even a few steps before she started to slow down.Under the dusky yellow light, there was a familiar car stopped by the road. The car was in the shadow of a large building. Through the windshield, she could faintly see two figures intertwined.Look at the place they chose! So bold, Xia Rou thought.She hesitated for a while before deciding to continue and walk toward them.The sound of knocking on the glass immediately shocked the two handsome men out of kissing in their interlocked embrace. After taking a good look at the person outside the window their expressions became complicated.She had her headphones on still blasting the beat of the cheerful music she liked, and she greeted them while Cao An wiped at his mouth and tidied up a little then rolled down the passenger window. Leaning over He Chengzhe to speak, he smiled and asked: \u201cOh, it\u2019s Xia Rou. Why are you out here?\u201d\u201cI came out for a run.\u201d Xia Rou replied. Translated by The NovelstThen, her face became more serious and she warned Cao An: \u201cBrother Cao Yang and I sometimes run together and we walk from here to the park.\u201d That was why the two friends had better be more careful!The expressions on both of the men\u2019s faces were sheepish.Xia Rou was very calm, acting like she didn\u2019t notice. \u201cI just wanted to let you know, nothing more. Alright, I\u2019m off to run. Bye bye!\u201dCao An clenched his teeth while smiling and waving his hands at her.Xia Rou found it very amusing.Wasn\u2019t it just a gay relationship? She had already covered for him for ten years, what was so shocking about it?The high school girl ran off calmly, looking like a porcelain doll in the light of the setting sun.The two men in the car couldn\u2019t remain calm.After a long stretch of silence, He Chengzhe burst out into laughter with a snort.\u201cThis little girl, she\u2019s a little interesting!\u201dAs he turned around to look at Cao An\u2019s expression, the smile on his face slowly faded away.He lit a cigarette and took a few puffs, stretching out of the car window to flick the ashes off. He comforted him: \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. Since she was kind enough to give you a heads up, she probably won\u2019t tell your father about it.\u201dBefore, the car was filled with a sweet, romantic air, but now all their desire had vanished into the smoke.Cao An took a glance at He Chengzhe and wordlessly started the car to drive home.Back to the Cao Family.Xia Rou had just taken a bath, nestling into the sofa with a good book with her hair half-dried when a knock sounded from her door.She opened the door to Cao An leaning on her door frame.\u201cHave you slept?\u201d he asked.\u201cI\u2019m reading a book,\u201d she replied, getting out of the doorway.Her movements were so natural that Cao An was surprised into silence as he was preparing himself to ask her if he could go in to have a talk with her.\u201cAre you not coming in?\u201d Xia Rou wondered aloud. If he wasn\u2019t going to, why did he knock on her door?Cao An was speechless as he walked into the room.Xia Rou closed the door.\u201cXiao Rou ah\u2026\u201d Cao An sat on the sofa, his first strategy was try to sweeten her up.\u201cAbout that thing you saw earlier\u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t finish his sentence, looking at Xia Rou with a smile.Xia Rou knew that he must have come for this.Looking at his attitude, his ingratiating behavior, it was exactly the same as in her memories.He didn\u2019t have great fortitude like Cao Yang, nor was he as flexible as Cao Bin, and he wasn\u2019t even as honest as Cao Xing. Sometimes he would be enigmatic, throwing tantrums and refusing to give face to others. Really! He was great at making others angry.But Cao An also knew his own bad habits and didn\u2019t care about them.\u201cMy oldest brother and second brother are there to support the family, and even third brother isn\u2019t bad. They\u2019re enough to make father proud. But me? I\u2019m just the youngest son, so I don\u2019t have any large responsibilities. My mother is likely pleased in heaven to see me living happily.\u201dThat was what Cao An had said to her, a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, looking exactly like a playboy.But for all those years, was he really happy?Xia Rou couldn\u2019t help letting out a sigh.The little girl in front of him suddenly let out a sigh like she had aged into an old lady; somehow Cao An found it strange while looking at her.Then he heard her say: \u201cFine, I won\u2019t tell anyone about it.\u201dCao An: \u201c\u2026\u201d So sensible? Translated by The NovelstXia Rou paused for a few moments, then continued: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to let anyone else know about it, you should be more careful.\u201dUgh, he was being taught a lesson by a little girl.

But no matter what, she still felt close to him in her heart, especially looking at him putting on such an act, she became a little angry.\u201cYour relationship, when are you planning to tell uncle?\u201d she asked deliberately.Cao An\u2019s smile immediately dropped. Translated by The Novelst\u201cThat isn\u2019t something that a child like you should concern yourself with.\u201d He was a little irritated.Xia Rou pouted.Actually, Cao An\u2019s personality had always been immature. Compared to Cao Yang, Cao Bin and Cao Xing, he didn\u2019t seem to resemble his parents at all.But because of that, he and Xia Rou had managed to become close to each other.Having a little girl look down at him, that was so annoying!Cao An gritted his teeth, saying in a deadpan tone: \u201cYou\u2019re still young so you don\u2019t understand. Sometimes you can\u2019t just do what you want! Anyways, it\u2019s late now. You should get some sleep. Thanks for keeping my secret.\u201dHe stood up and prepared to leave.Xia Rou looked up at him. He was so tall, but\u2026 he didn\u2019t have the courage that his stature seemed to imply\u2026Xia Rou always felt that, after her rebirth, the way she looked at others had changed from the past.Actually, in her past, she was well aware in her heart what kind of person Cao An was. But because she was the closest to him, she subconsciously made excuses for him. Now, after her rebirth, she seemed to be able to disentangle herself from situations. Looking again at the people and things she had experienced, she could see more clearly now than in the past.This fourth brother ah, he wasn\u2019t able to become a responsible man like big brother.She looked at him, feeling disappointment in her heart.She stood up to walk him to the door, but couldn\u2019t help saying to him: \u201cIf you\u2019re like this, isn\u2019t it\u2026 a little unfair towards Brother Chengzhe?\u201dAlthough before he had said to her that he just wanted to live happily, Xia Rou felt that he was unable to obtain that happiness he wanted in the ten years they knew each other.An all of his unhappiness, in the end, was rooted in the fact that he didn\u2019t dare speak the truth to Cao Xiong. In other words, he was a wimp! A scaredy-cat!Every time He Chengzhe came around, they could only hang out in secret, not daring to be open about it. So even within those years, He Chengzhe was also very unhappy. The two kept breaking up and getting back together.He Chengzhe was like Xia Rou; he was born to an ordinary family. There were many times he wanted to leave Cao An, but\u2026 if the most headstrong fourth master of the Cao Family didn\u2019t agree to it, He Chengzhe couldn\u2019t leave even if he wanted to.After that, Cao Xiong realized that Cao An wasn\u2019t young anymore. Using his connections, he was able to obtain plans for the future from the upper class. So he started to learn about the future prospects in the area, finding huge benefits. And so he arranged for Cao An to work in real estate.At first, Cao An had resisted, but Cao Xiong used He Chengzhe and his fashion company to threaten him.The Cao Family had many contacts in all sorts of industries, both bright and dark. The fashion company was a hobby to Cao An, but to He Chengzhe, it was years of effort.Luckily, in the end, Cao An capitulated and Cao Xiong let them off the hook.But this was a fatal blow to their relationship. Cao An and He Chengzhe had their most serious breakup then.If the two had ended there, then maybe their parting would have left them with a feeling of relief.However, Cao An didn\u2019t want to let go.In actuality, both men were bi. After that breakup, they both dated around, having boyfriends and girlfriends. Cao An himself wasn\u2019t serious about any of the partners he met. But if he learned that He Chengzhe was serious about any relationship, no matter the gender, Cao An would definitely think of a way to destroy them.He Chengzhe had even moved the company to Yu City in order to avoid Cao An.After that, he met a nice woman, and even though she knew of his past, she still accepted and loved him. In the end, he decided to get married to her.Even Xia Rou felt that this was a good marriage.It was too bad that it was destroyed by Cao An. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou received a call from He Chengzhe and drove all the way to Yu City to pick up Cao An, who was already dead drunk.Before she left, He Chengzhe had woodenly said to her: \u201cAsk him for me if he can\u2019t even bear to see me happy?\u201dBecause of Cao An\u2019s dark history, even though Xia Rou was very close with Cao An, she found herself too ashamed to answer.In the end, He Chengzhe ended up not getting married to that woman. He and Cao An, until Xia Rou\u2019s death, were entangled together and their relationship remained unclear.By that time, Xia Rou had ignored Cao Yang\u2019s opposition and moved out of the Cao Family house into the apartment that she had lived with Cheng Wan. In the state Cao An was in, Xia Rou was afraid that Cao Xiong might notice his condition if she sent him back home, which would mean Cao An would be soundly beaten with a belt. So instead, she brought him back to her apartment.The morning after, Cao Yang suddenly came by and knocked on her door.She thought he was looking for Cao An. But she was wrong; he told her he had something to discuss with her.Before he could say anything, a hungover Cao An came down the stairs, his hair wet and his body covered only with a towel, shouting for Xia Rou to ask if she had any food.Xia Rou had never seen Cao Yang\u2019s face go so white and ghastly.Cao Yang didn\u2019t say anything and left immediately, leaving Xia Rou and Cao An to gaze at each other uncomprehendingly.In the end, Xia Rou didn\u2019t get to hear what Cao Yang came to tell her on that day.After the next half month, though, she learned that on that day, Cao Yang had officially gotten divorced.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was just a little girl!The fourth master of the Cao Family couldn\u2019t help but feel irritated. He wanted to scold the young lady who only came up to his shoulder with her soft and watery appearance, but it would only make him look like a cad.He almost choked in restraining his anger.He contained his annoyance for some time, then only replied: \u201cWhat do you know about anything, you don\u2019t know how adults work. Just my father\u2026\u201dHe felt he would expose his timid nature if he continued, so he immediately corrected himself: \u201cAnyway, don\u2019t say anything to anyone carelessly. No matter who \u2013 my father, my brother; ANY of my brothers!\u201d\u201cYou little kid, you should focus on your studies! School\u2019s starting soon, right? Have you prepared for your placement test? Sleep early!\u201dAfter stabbing back at Xia Rou, Coa An finally took big steps to the door.Then he heard Xia Rou mumble something.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d He turned around and questioned her.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Xia Rou didn\u2019t admit anything.\u201cDo you think I can\u2019t hear?\u201d Cao An was irritated. \u201cI\u2019m eight years older than you! Eight years!\u201dHow dare she ask who the real kid was here!Xia Rou rolled her eyes. Translated by The NovelstCao An snorted and slammed the door shut on his way out.Xia Rou was so mad and got up, wanting to lock the door, but the door was pushed open with another creak and almost pushed her to the floor.\u201cAnd also, kid!\u201d Cao An used his elbow to lean on the doorframe, \u201cI\u2019m only going to say this once. You\u2019re a lady, don\u2019t let any men into your room, understand? It\u2019s fine even if you don\u2019t understand now! Remember my words! You\u2019ll understand when you grow up!\u201dAfter saying that, he slammed the door shut again.Xia Rou was pissed off!Of course she knew.But this was the Cao Family, and he was Cao An!If it was another man, of course she wouldn\u2019t let him in her room!In the past, even after she got engaged, she didn\u2019t even let her fianc\u00e9 enter her apartment!What Cao An had just said made her look like a person who didn\u2019t know how to cherish herself!What kind of person was that! So immature!Xia Rou angrily locked her door.The next morning at the dining table, Cao Yang noticed that the two people would only roll their eyes at one another when they met.What had happened?Cao Yang\u2019s biased thoughts were that it must have been Cao An who did something annoying and made Xia Rou angry. Looking at the tactful and obedient Xia Rou, it definitely couldn\u2019t be her fault!It had to be Cao An\u2019s fault!\u201cAre you starting school the day after tomorrow?\u201d Cao Yang asked in concern.\u201cYes.\u201d Xia Rou nodded.Cao An became excited. He kindly asked: \u201cWhich class do you think you can enter?\u201d Nan Hua had a placement test before school started, and students were arranged into classes based on their results.Argh! This guy was so annoying!Xia Rou had never expected that after her rebirth, almost everyone was much friendlier to her compared to her past. Only Cao An, who was supposed to be the closest to her, had instead become so hard to deal with.What was wrong with this life!She bit her lip and said: \u201cMy grades aren\u2019t that good, most probably it\u2019ll be a low class.\u201dAfter finishing her sentence, she ate her rice in a depressed manner.Actually, Xia Rou hadn\u2019t abandoned her studies during the summer holiday. She would take at least half the day to revise her studies, reviewing all the information from her past years. Moreover, she felt that she could understand more than just what she had learned in the past.But she had never had confidence towards her own abilities, especially since Nan Hua\u2019s reputation was \u201crich families and elite education.\u201d She was really scared she would be placed at the bottom.She used the Cao Family as a backdoor to get into Nan Hua. If her results were very low, she felt that she would make the Cao Family lose face.Cao Yang had already realized that Xia Rou was lacking in confidence.She was a beautiful lady who was obedient enough to stay home every day to read her books seriously rather than go outside and play during the entire summer holiday. But she was still so lacking in confidence that it made his heart ache just looking at her.He glared at Cao An, turning to comfort Xia Rou: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the teachers at Nan Hua are all excellent. No matter which class you get into, as long as you study hard, surely you won\u2019t have a problem getting a degree.\u201dBig brother was surely the best! Fourth brother was so annoying!Xia Rou looked at Cao Yang, her nose souring.A snowy white face, pink lips, and large, somber eyes that seemed to water. She looked grateful yet grieved.It seemed like she was happy but she also looked as though she was going to cry.Cao Yang\u2019s heart was going to melt!He realized that a little sister and a little brother were two completely different species! A woman at her age could actually be so cute!She definitely wouldn\u2019t be so naughty as to climb up on the roof to rip the tiles, nor would she look for a needle in the sea! So tactful, so obedient, and she listened to whatever he said.She made everyone want to spoil her \u2013 even knowing this, he still wanted to spoil her!Cao An was still had something to say, but at Cao Yang\u2019s glare, he immediately swallowed his words. Looking back at them, even He Chengzhe rolled his eyes.He turned around huffily and tried to regain his footing. Cao An turned back to scan Xia Rou, just then realizing that she was still very young, so much so that she was still flat-chested.Underneath her sharp words, she was really still just a young lady. Getting worked up to go against a young lady seemed\u2026 really crass.Cao An finally recovered his senses and found himself a little embarrassed.He immediately tried to make it up to her: \u201cXiao Rou ah, have you bought all your stationery? Do you want me to take you to get some?\u201dI don\u2019t need you hmmph! Translated by The Novelst hmmph!Xia Rou ignored him, speaking directly to Cao Yang: \u201cBrother Cao Xing said he\u2019s coming back tonight and that he\u2019ll take me to shop tomorrow.\u201d\u201cCao Xing?\u201d Cao Yang wondered aloud. \u201cIsn\u2019t he still on duty tomorrow?\u201dHe was suspicious. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me he especially took a holiday to take you shopping?\u201d It was very possible.Xia Rou was sweating furiously. When Cao Xing called her, she hadn\u2019t thought too much about it. Fortunately, today Cao Xiong had matters to attend to, so he had left early!Cao Yang gave a sullen \u201chmmph.\u201dXia Rou lowered her head and didn\u2019t dare to speak.Every time that Cao Yang assumed a stern face, he looked exactly like Cao Xiong. And each time Cao Xing and Cao An saw their big brother in that kind of state, they immediately turned into cowards. Only Cao Bin remained unafraid of him when he was like this.Of course, Cao Bin was much more reliable when compared to the other two.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They both took on the responsibilities of the elder brother early on. However, Cao Xing and Cao An were the little brothers who were always being taken care of.This was the main reason why the four brothers were so different in conduct and personalities.Xia Rou finished eating lunch and returned to her room. Once again, she started to review her materials. She was stupid \u2013 and because of that, she had to revise a few more times.She got a call from Cao Yang in the evening. \u201cAre you still at home?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. Translated by The Novelst\u201cI\u2019ll be home soon, just sit tight. I\u2019ll take you out to shop.\u201dXia Rou was like, \u201chuh?\u201dBut Cao Yang had clicked off as soon as he\u2019d finished his sentence.Xia Rou looked at the clock. It was only four, why was big brother coming back so early? Moreover, what should she do about Brother Cao Xing?She usually wore lounge-wear at home, so she changed into a dress and combed her hair.Cao Yang was probably nearly home when he called. He arrived in just a few minutes. He saw her waiting on the first floor, and said, \u201cWait just a second.\u201d Then he went upstairs.Not long after, he came back down in casual clothing.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said. \u201cCao Xing? Don\u2019t worry about him. I already told him not to come home unless he misses my father\u2019s leather belt.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Xia Rou was silent.The city had developed rapidly in the next ten years in Xia Rou\u2019s memory. So many of the old shops had closed, and new shops would open continuously.Xia Rou didn\u2019t remember which shops were good for stationery at this time.Cao Yang brought her to a shopping mall, and to the fourth floor where there was a boutique stationery store.Xia Rou was surprised: \u201cHow did you know there was such a store here?\u201d\u201cI asked the leaders who had children,\u201d Cao Yang replied.Soon they had bought all the things she needed. Xia Rou felt the bag she used in middle school was old, so she bought a new, pretty bag.Cao Yang swiped his card and paid for it all.Stationery wasn\u2019t normally very expensive, but since it was a boutique store, it was a different story. The things sold in this store were all imported.Xia Rou\u2019s bag alone was already a few thousand yuan.Cao Yang was thinking that if Xia Rou was going to whine about money, then he would have to sit her down for a talk. However, Xia Rou didn\u2019t say a word, just carrying the pile of things and quietly waiting for him to pay at the counter.Cao Yang felt slightly weird.Was it because she was so young that she had no concept of money?But he didn\u2019t think so. She was at least 15, she would have had pocket money and bought food to eat with her friends, right? At her age, he thought she should have some concept of price already.Each of the items had its price clearly stated on the price tag. Whether it was expensive, cheap, or anywhere in between, she would have clearly seen the price and known it well in her heart as long as she wasn\u2019t blind.The phrases \u2018I\u2019ll pay,\u2019 or \u2018It\u2019s too expensive, let\u2019s not buy it,\u2019 she didn\u2019t even try to speak out. She naturally picked what she needed, didn\u2019t mind the price even though she\u2019d seen it, and naturally accepted that Cao Yang would pay for her.At least she didn\u2019t overreact, which was nice, Cao Yang thought. If she made a ruckus about it, he would definitely find it annoying.To Cao Yang, this amount was just a little bit of money. Since Xia Rou had entered the Cao Family, then she must become accustomed to this level of consumption. If she acted petty, then he might have felt irritated.He remembered the first few days after she had arrived. In just a few words they decided to let her study at Nan Hua, and she accepted it naturally. Now that he thought back to it, it wasn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t understand; on the contrary, she seemed to\u2026 understand the principles behind it.At such a young age, she already knew these kinds of things?Cao Yang looked at her and couldn\u2019t help but ponder.\u201cBrother Cao Yang?\u201d Xia Rou turned back to call him.\u201cMn.\u201d Cao Yang returned to his senses. In big strides he caught up to her. \u201cCome, let\u2019s go eat.\u201dOr was it because her mother had passed away, so she had matured early? But she didn\u2019t seem to have confidence, and even repeated that she was stupid. But when he looked at her now, he felt that she was a clever child.In a family like theirs, a stupid person wasn\u2019t scary at all, but a silly person was.Xia Rou knew inside her heart that she wasn\u2019t a silly person, that was good. This kind of child could be taught.He brought her to the restaurant on the fifth floor to eat. Just as they arrived, Cao Yang ran into someone he knew.\u201cCao Yang? What a coincidence,\u201d his acquaintance greeted.Both men spoke a few words, before the man turned his gaze toward Xia Rou: \u201cThis is?\u201dCao Yang paused a little: \u201cThis is Xiao Rou. Xiao Rou, call him Brother Liu.\u201dThis introduction concealed both Xia Rou\u2019s surname and Brother Liu\u2019s full name, leaving it ambiguous and vague.Xia Rou lowered her eyes, obediently greeting: \u201cBrother Liu.\u201dThe man\u2019s gaze turned curious. Translated by The NovelstThis girl seemed quite young. He wondered if she\u2019d turned into an adult yet, but she seemed like a pretty girl.Cao Yang had always liked women with curves with slightly wild personalities. When did he start to like these kinds of young chicks?Hm\u2026 Maybe he wanted to change up his taste?\u201cYou have good taste.\u201d He smiled at Cao Yang.Both Cao Yang and Xia Rou knew that he had misunderstood, but neither made a move to explain.After they left the man, they looked for a corner seat to avoid meeting anyone else. This was a popular restaurant, and there was no knowing if another acquaintance would appear.Cao Yang ordered his dish and put down the menu. He looked at Xia Rou who remained silent, her eyes lowered, which made him feel more strange.Just now he had thought she was a clever girl. But now, he felt that Xia Rou, as a child, knew a little too much!He could read from her face that she could actually understand the dubious misunderstanding at the entrance just now!Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To someone at Xia Rou\u2019s age, she was only supposed to have a vague idea of what they were talking about, possibly not understanding at all.But he had never imagined that Xia Rou would be able to understand it all entirely.He couldn\u2019t help but find it confusing.Xia Rou wasn\u2019t a very smart child; then who had taught all of this to her?Was it her mother? Translated by The NovelstNo. Cao Yang had met Cheng Wan a few times before. She was a person who could be seen through with ease. That woman didn\u2019t have the ability to teach her daughter to understand how the adult world worked so well.Maybe it was\u2026 his father?When Cheng Wan was still around, Cao xiong had always stayed in Cheng Wan\u2019s apartment.It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if Cao Xiong had met Xia Rou several times. Maybe he unconsciously instilled something in her?Considering the relationship between Cao Xiong and Cheng Wan, Xia Rou might have been influenced by them since she was young\u2026 That seemed to make much more sense.Cao Yang would never even have guessed that within the most important ten years of Xia Rou\u2019s life, the person who taught her so intimately was Cao Yang himself.But it was a fact that she understood. Her reaction after comprehending everything was another matter, one which was related to her own personality.Girls at that young age should have a very thin face. Even if she understood, she should have shown at least a hint of shyness, or had an angry reaction.But Xia Rou didn\u2019t. She sat right opposite him, without shyness nor anger. Her quietness seemed to indicate her disinterest, even though she already knew of it all.Cao Yang suddenly felt a little regretful for introducing that kind of person to her.But he wasn\u2019t the one who could decide Xia Rou\u2019s future. Although his father had entrusted her to him, ultimately he had only been tasked to take care of her living situation.In the end, when it came to decide Xia Rou\u2019s identity, the person with the final say was still Cao Xiong.However, Cao Xiong hadn\u2019t been clear with it yet.His father had always been a decisive person. Looking at how the matter was being dragged on probably meant that his father was still thinking about it.Thus, he could only give a vague description of Xia Rou\u2019s identity to others.Xia Rou understood Cao Yang\u2019s thoughts very well.She had already lived in the Cao Family for ten years and had been taught by Cao Yang for ten years. She already had a grasp of the rules and behavior patterns of the people in this class.\u2018Identity.\u2019 It was like a bruise to her, a mishap that made her awkward in her past life.In the end, Cao Xiong didn\u2019t agree to give her an identity. His final decision was only to raise her up then provide her with a generous dowry when she married. That way, he fulfilled his promise to Cheng Wan.Then, as an adult, she should fend for herself.After that, the only person she could rely on was actually Cao Yang.Because only Cao Yang was willing to allow her, admit that she was indeed related to the Cao Family, and acquiesced to her using their relationship to keep a foothold in that circle.That was how she had the qualifications to become engaged with a son of the Liang Family.This decision of hers made Cao Yang very angry.He almost wanted to scold, \u201cwho do the Liang Family think they are,\u201d in front of her.Even if he didn\u2019t say it out loud, Xia Rou also understood very well in her heart. She was very embarrassed. But she also knew that because the Liang Family couldn\u2019t meet Cao Yang\u2019s standards, that was exactly the reason they were interested in her.Because the families who did meet Cao Yang\u2019s standards didn\u2019t have any interest in her!In the end, she was just a fox, assuming the majesty of a tiger.Cao Yang would rather that she choose the colleague who had pursued her for two years.He had his background checked out; his character and ability weren\u2019t bad. His father was a lecturer at a university, and it could be said that he was born into a scholarly family. He himself was a graduate of a famous university, and he had managed to get into a big company with his own ability.Unlike Xia Rou herself, who was arranged into the company by Cao Yang to dawdle.Most importantly, Cao Yang said he liked the fact that this fellow truly loved Xia Rou from the bottom of his heart.As for the Liang Family\u2026He didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but Xia Rou had already understood what he was trying to say. The Liang Family had deeper intentions, and the only reason for their interest was her relationship with the Cao Family.But so what? Translated by The NovelstCao Yang wanted her to marry an excellent white-collar worker.This would be a great option to an ordinary lady, but Xia Rou lived in the Cao Family for ten years. She had seen too much in the elite circle and thus she knew the difference between the classes.Humans would always strive for the best. Xia Rou had even wanted to use something to prove herself, to prove that she was different than Cheng Wan.Cao Yang told her to step back and marry an ordinary white-collar worker, and return back to the lower class where she belonged. To her, it was like a ruthless denial.It was a denial that made her suffer.So she insisted on getting her own way, trying to marry into the Liang Family no matter what.In the end, Cao Yang had indulged her.He said: Never mind\u2026 As long as big brother is here, I should be able to protect you\u2026That was his promise to her, but it was more like a jinx.And finally, out of nowhere, a mysterious power had made it so that she was able to once again sit in front of him.Xia Rou sighed softly then raised her head with a faint smile: \u201cYou ordered bean curd with crab roe? You also like to eat this dish? Our taste is the same.\u201dShe fiddled with her hair and tucked it behind her ears. From her delicate face, to her little ears, to her slim neck, her skin was snowy white all over.She was a tender young girl that looked like flower petals.Cao Yang\u2019s eyes darkened.She tidied up her emotions so quickly?It wasn\u2019t true that she didn\u2019t feel shy, or mad, or embarrassed.Instead, she just kept those emotions tamped down in her heart, or maybe\u2026 she used something else, something softer to melt away those emotions.The gentleness in Xia Rou came from the bottom of her bones, and it was intermixed with tenacity. It turned her weak personality into such flexibility that it allowed her to climb for growth.It was an extremely beneficial, valuable ability that he found in Xia Rou.But that tender part of her somehow made Cao Yang pity her slightly.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the past, the last time she had seen Cao Yang before her death was also in this room.The feeling that arose in her heart when she stepped into the room was too complex to describe.Sitting at the leather chair in front of the desk, she naturally put both her hands on top of her knees and slightly lowered her head.Within the ten years of her previous life, she had sat in this posture countless times while receiving a lecture from Cao Yang.Cao Yang opened up his drawer, taking out a document file. When he lifted his head, he saw Xia Rou\u2019s expression and posture and was stunned.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He smiled and asked, \u201cWhy do you look so dejected?\u201d It was as if she was getting scolded.Xia Rou came back to her senses.

Even if you don\u2019t do well this time, you can just do better the next time you take it.\u201dHe put the document file on the desk. \u201cToday I\u2019m going to explain to you your current financial situation.\u201d\u201cThere were three properties under your mother\u2019s name, which are now transferred to you.\u201d He showed her certificates to the three properties.Xia Rou replied with an \u201cOh,\u201d nodding her head.Cao Yang took out a card and showed it to her. \u201cThe money in your mother\u2019s account has been transferred into this card for you. Do you know how much was in it?\u201dXia Rou nodded. Translated by The Novelst\u201cThen good,\u201d Cao Yang continued. \u201cIt\u2019s only a hundred-something, not worth the trouble. I just bought you a long-term financial plan for three years, so just leave it like that for the moment.\u201dThen he tucked the card away.\u201cIn the future, rental money will be transferred directly to this card. I will keep this safe for you for now, and I\u2019ll give it back to you once you turn eighteen.\u201dXia Rou had no objections and continually nodded her head.Cao Yang took out two cards and pushed them toward her: \u201cThis is a cash card; in the future I\u2019ll transfer pocket money to you every month. If you need cash, just take it from this card. This one is a credit card; if you need to buy something use this card. I can take care of the bill, you don\u2019t need to mind that.\u201dHe paused a while, adding, \u201cIf there\u2019s anything big you want to buy or you don\u2019t have enough money, just tell me. Okay?\u201dConsidering that she was just a high school student, and added to the fact that she wasn\u2019t truly from the Cao Family, the credit limits to the cards he handed to her weren\u2019t very high.Xia Rou still nodded her head.She had a sharp, pointy chin, and she had been non-stop nodding her head ever since she sat down, just like a little chick pecking for rice.Cao Yang found it somewhat funny.He laughed out of nowhere.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d She touched her face. Was there rice stuck on her face?Cao Yang leaned back in his chair and lit up a cigarette. He said with humor, \u201cWhy are you so obedient?\u201dXia Rou glared at him. \u201cIs it bad to be obedient?\u201dWhat was wrong with being obedient?Because she was so obedient, the way Cao Yang treated her was much closer than in the past.In the past, she had a thorny exterior and a rebellious heart, which was why they drifted slowly apart in the end.Ever since he had divorced, she noticed that there was a transparent wall that she couldn\u2019t pass between them. She didn\u2019t know why, but because she was afraid of him, she never took the initiative to contact him.Obviously, their relationship became strained that year. The longest time they went without meeting was three months.In the end, when she wanted to get engaged, she bit the bullet and called him. She could already hear the pressure in his voice through the phone, his voice sounding so deep that she was already regretting calling him. If she knew earlier, she would have just gotten engaged in secret.However, she didn\u2019t dare to decide her own marriage without Cao Yang\u2019s approval. And without his agreement, she might not even be able to get engaged successfully. Cao Yang told her to go home and see him; although she was afraid of him, she still braced herself and returned.She sat right in this study room as he passed over a file. Inside the file was the information of that colleague who had pursued her.That was when she realized that the gap, the estrangement, it was all her misconception. Even if she moved out of the Cao Family and hadn\u2019t even given him a call in those three months, her big brother had always been protecting her.It wasn\u2019t true that she wasn\u2019t touched, but because of his kindness toward her, she had a better reason to continue on in her willfulness.He wanted her to get married to an ordinary white-collar worker, become a well-off middle class person. She\u2026 couldn\u2019t accept it.Because of her disobedience, she had shot herself in the foot.After her rebirth, she was once again sitting right in front of him.Those rebellious thorns of hers seemed like a joke to her now.She lived a short life, trying as hard as she could to prove that she was different than Cheng Wan, that she was much better than her mother. But funnily enough, Xia Rou realized that she couldn\u2019t even compare to Cheng Wan.Actually, she didn\u2019t even have the right to look down on Cheng Wan.At least Cheng Wan had managed to capture a man\u2019s heart.Within those eight years, although she was just a lover with no title, she had basked in the love of Cao Xiong, living a happy life.As for herself, she busied herself for her entire life. In the end, it was just flowers in a mirror and the moon\u2019s reflection on the water. She even ended up dead in her shoes.She had looked down on Cheng Wan before, but when Xia Rou finally came to terms with the fact that she was in actuality mediocre and incompetent, she started to become envious of Cheng Wan.Every time Cheng Wan faced Cao Xiong, she showed him obedience.If that was the way to live a peaceful, happy life, then Xia Rou was willing to become an obedient lady in front of Cao Yang as well.Yo, she had her hackles raised. Translated by The NovelstEver since she arrived to the Cao Family, she had been very obedient. It was so cute to Cao Yang to watch her flare up, her eyes glaring at him.Cao Yang looked at her with a grin.Xia Rou let out an annoyed, \u201chmmph,\u201d and pulled at her hair.\u201cIt\u2019s longer now.\u201d Cao Yang smiled.When she arrived, her hair was so short it only reached her cheeks and barely managed to cover her ears. After a month passed, her hair reached below her jaw, and her bangs nearly covered her eyes.\u201cMn.\u201d Xia Rou blew her bangs up with a puff of air. \u201cI\u2019ll cut it short before the semester starts.\u201d\u201cJust keep it,\u201d Cao Yang took a puff. \u201cYou\u2019re a little girl, why do you want to cut it so short?\u201dCao Yang preferred women with long hair, Xia Rou knew.His tastes were similar to his father\u2019s.Cheng Wan had a head full of thick, full hair, well-kept, moisturized, and lustrous. It was often in wavy curls.No matter whether Cheng Wan tied her hair into a bun or let it settle loosely on her shoulders, Cao Xiong would still smile while looking at her.That was exactly the reason why Xia Rou insisted on cutting her hair short when Xia Rou entered adolescence.The life of a young girl was ordinary, so her rebellion and confrontation could only be shown in these small ways.She heard Cao Yang\u2019s words and hesitated: \u201cI might not look nice if I keep my hair long.\u201dCao Yang said firmly, \u201cIt\u2019ll definitely look nice.\u201dSince he said it like that, the last little conflict in Xia Rou\u2019s heart was extinguished.\u201cMn\u2026\u201d She touched her fringe. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just let it grow.\u201dProofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His manipulation wasn\u2019t so strong as to be able to control Xia Rou\u2019s hairstyle.But Xia Rou was so obedient that she exceeded his expectations. Ever since her arrival to the Cao Family, she seemed to follow each and every instruction that he gave.Cao Yang was surprised in his heart, and at the same time he was very\u2026 satisfied.He was just like his father, a man who was a little chauvinistic. They tended to give commands and liked to see people obey them.He finished smoking his cigarette and put it out on the ashtray, continuing: \u201cIn the future, Xiao Yang will be responsible for driving you to school. Just take the A8 in the garage.\u201dSince Nan Hua was known to be an elite school for the rich and powerful, naturally the scene would be glamorous. The road to the school gate had been widened twice in ten years, but the road would still be packed with all kinds of luxurious cars, especially when classes started or ended.The schools had also enrolled a few ordinary students with excellent grades, but they could be differentiated easily just by looking at their stationery and transportation. The camps were quite distinct in the school.Since they wanted to send Xia Rou to Nan Hua, they definitely wouldn\u2019t let her suffer in these ways.He didn\u2019t explain these things to her, but just as he expected, Xia Rou didn\u2019t say anything in opposition.She only remained calm and naturally accepted all his arrangements. Translated by The NovelstShe wasn\u2019t a hypocrite, nor did she act as though she was morally superior. Very well.To take care of someone like Xia Rou was a very easy, trouble-free thing to Cao Yang.The placement test didn\u2019t seem as difficult as Xia Rou expected, but this was probably because of her hard work poured out during the whole summer break.Maybe there was some things in life she couldn\u2019t change no matter how she struggled. But at least if she put some effort into studying, she could still get something in return.Coincidentally, the first of September was a Friday. Xia Rou brought her nervous heart along and went to school. After participating in the long-winded, sleepy opening ceremony, she was put in\u2026 Class 4.She was surprised by the placement.There were a total of eight classes in every grade.Class 1 and Class 2 were experimental classes, usually for the top students. Class 7 was quite weak, and Class 8 was filled with students with terrible grades who were accepted to Nan Hua on connections.The middle classes of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth classes were normal classes, arranged according to their grade averages.Xia Rou had prayed she wouldn\u2019t get placed into Class 8. She thought she might even be placed in Class 7. To think that she was actually placed in a normal class was already a surprise way out of her expectations.At least she didn\u2019t embarrass herself too much.On this day, Cao Bin and Cao Xing returned home. The four brothers were finally reunited.He Chengzhe had found a house a couple days before and had moved out already.At the dining table, everyone saw Xia Rou\u2019s relaxed expression and knew that she had probably done well on her test.\u201cWhich class are you in?\u201d Cao Xiong asked.\u201cClass 4,\u201d Xia Rou was still a little embarrassed.She was a little shy, yet she wanted to be praised a little, too.Although she was already 25 in her heart, she still had those thoughts like a little girl.It was already written all over her face.The men laughed.Somehow, with a girl in the house, the atmosphere became much more relaxed.\u201cNot bad,\u201d Cao Xiong wasn\u2019t stingy in praising her.Before Nan Hua\u2019s admissions letter had arrived, they received Seventeen High School\u2019s admissions letter. Xia Rou\u2019s High School entrance exam result straightforwardly explained what she meant by the phrase, \u201cI\u2019m quite stupid.\u201dAll of them thought that she would be swept quite soundly into Class 8. But her placement now was no doubt the result of her hard work during her summer break.At that time when she said, \u201cI will seriously study,\u201d she really did take it very seriously and studied the entire summer break.A child who was serious, hardworking, and persistent \u2013 although she might be a little stupid, the elders would appreciate this kind of child.Moreover, after two months of observation, Cao Xiong felt that Xia Rou was much better than he\u2019d expected.Her quiet demeanor when reading a book looked really, really like Cheng Wan.After dinner, Cao An knocked on her door.Xia Rou opened the door and immediately blocked the entryway.\u201cHow could you be so mannerless, not even letting your brother enter!\u201d Cao An said teasingly.\u201cI\u2019m a big girl now,\u201d Xia Rou said, solemnly. \u201cI can\u2019t let just any man enter my bedroom.\u201dTsk, do you even know what a man is!Cao An sneered: \u201cYo, look at this face, if you grow just a little taller\u2026\u201dHe made a gesture, \u201cThen I would have even thought you were my big brother in disguise. Too bad\u2026\u201dHe then patted her on the head. \u201cYou\u2019re too short, and you lack my big brother\u2019s imposing manner. Small potato!\u201dHis large hand drew away from the small potato\u2019s head as he unceremoniously walked into her room.The small potato was so mad!She wasn\u2019t short, she was only 15 years old, she was still young! When she grew and became taller she could even reach the bottom of Cao Yang\u2019s jaw, which could still be considered quite tall for a woman!As Cao An walked in, he immediately saw a few school uniforms spread out on her bed. He knew she would definitely be trying them on.\u201cEh, after so many years Nan Hua\u2019s uniforms still haven\u2019t changed?\u201dCao An grabbed the summer set and gave them to her: \u201cGo, change into this and let me take a look.\u201d\u201cCould you please not just touch a lady\u2019s shirt,\u201d Xia Rou said, dragging over her new uniform.Cao An scanned her flat chest and said derisively: \u201cWait until you\u2019re at least a C cup, and then you can call yourself a big girl, okay!\u201dXia Rou smirked coldly. \u201cFine, then I\u2019ll tell Brother Chengzhe that you like C cups and let him know to get a breast augmentation.\u201dCao An: \u201c\u2026\u201d Damn! Translated by The NovelstThe small potato knew how to bite back. She lifted her nose and gave out a \u201chmmph\u201d with triumph. Then she carried her uniform to walk into the closet with her mouth tilting upwards.Tsk!

After looking closely at the wallpaper, he could tell it was probably his big brother\u2019s work. Only big brother would choose a blue wallpaper for a girl\u2019s room.He probably didn\u2019t even know how to spell the word \u201ccute.\u201dSpeaking of white, that little kid looked really cute when she didn\u2019t show her sharp tongue. But why was she so vicious with him?Cao Xing said it was because of his cheap mouth\u2026\u2026\u2026Pui! Translated by The NovelstActually Xia Rou was not originally the type who could speak so sharply, but in the past she had become used to arguing with Cao An and they roasted each other regularly. That was why when she was in front of Cao An, there weren\u2019t any burdens on her heart. She became relaxed and the words came naturally when she opened her mouth.Cao An found it quite novel, though.Even in childhood he had a quick wit, and every time his sharp tongue got him on his brothers\u2019 bad sides, they would then handle him in one of three ways\u2014\u2014One of them would beat him up.Two of them would beat him up.Or sometimes he would be beaten up by a mix of the three.After that, when everyone was all grown up, the two elder brothers were too lazy to bother to raise an issue with it, so they usually would choose to deal with it verbally \u2013 to command Cao Xing to beat him up.But no one ever talked back to him.Interesting.Xia Rou didn\u2019t take long to change.Actually, she was very happy to be able to wear Nan Hua\u2019s uniform in this life, so she really wanted to show it off for someone. But, ehem\u2026 This kind of action was quite childish and she wasn\u2019t really a little girl\u2026 So she was kind of embarrassed about it.Luckily there was still Cao An in the house, and he could see right through her.\u201cHow does it look?\u201d She twirled in a circle. \u201cIs it pretty?\u201d\u201cThis version of Nan Hua\u2019s uniform, I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve changed it in the last ten years. It\u2019s literally the same as when we went there.\u201d The 23-year-old man lamented at the passage of time, how time flew, as if he\u2019d aged in the blink of an eye. Then he pulled here and there, looking at the details. \u201cTake it off and give it to me.\u201dThe small potato had a shocked expression: \u201cY-you also want to try?\u201dCao An: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe almost stuck out his middle finger!Xia Rou laughed as she ran back into the closet.Gosh, this small potato was playing around with him!The fourth master of the Cao Family took the uniform and left feeling stuffy.Saturday morning he returned to throw the uniform at her: \u201cTry it on.\u201dXia Rou went to the closet to change and when she came out she was delighted. \u201cIt\u2019s so pretty!\u201dCao An had narrowed the loose uniform around the waist and the plaid skirt that had reached her knees had been adjusted to be an inch shorter. The ordinary school uniform looked much different than it used to.Xia Rou was worried: \u201cWill the teachers say anything about it?\u201d\u201cThey won\u2019t,\u201d Cao An said, unworried. \u201cIt\u2019s a tradition for girls to alter their uniforms. It\u2019s been like that from when we went to Nan Hua; so long as you don\u2019t overdo it the teachers will turn a blind eye.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d breathed out Xia Rou in relief. Then, very sweetly, she said, \u201cThank you, Brother Cao An.\u201dCao An: \u201c\u2026Tsk.\u201dHe turned his head away.A smile played at the corners of her mouth and her footsteps floated like feathers as she walked back into her closet to change.In the past, both she and Cao An were like two immature children; quarreling and sulking was common for both of them. But everytime one got mad, the other would definitely become soft. As long as one reached out to try and make up, the other person would get off of the donkey*, the two then reconciling.It was already an old routine.It was now just a repeat of their past.She was finally able to rediscover the feeling of familiarity with Cao An.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d asked Cao An, seeing her change her outfit.\u201cI\u2019m going to go to the hair salon,\u201d Xia Rou touched her fringe. \u201cAre there any nearby?\u201dToo much had changed within the ten years, so she wasn\u2019t able to remember it all clearly.\u201cI\u2019ll drive you there since I\u2019m going to see Chengzhe anyway. There\u2019s a pretty nice salon by his house.\u201dCao An drove Xia Rou to the salon. \u201cTell them my phone number and look for Johnny, I made you an appointment.\u201dThen he asked, \u201cHow long will it take?\u201dXia Rou thought before speaking. \u201cOne hour and a half, or two hours maybe?\u201d\u201cSo long?\u201d Translated by The Novelst\u201cMy hair is too stiff, I want to make it softer.\u201d\u201cAlright, just wait for me here after you finish. We can go eat together.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dXia Rou tried to adjust her bangs and went into the salon.It was natural for a girl to strive to be beautiful. In the past when she was already 25, Cao An always directed her in her clothing and appearance, so by now she had developed good taste.Now that she looked at her 15-year-old self, not having straightened nor curled her short hair, she found herself quite rustic.At this time, some hairstyles and skills hadn\u2019t yet been invented. She found Johnny and taught him to use some techniques that wouldn\u2019t be developed until ten years into the future, and permed her roots and bangs.Although her hairstyle still looked like a student\u2019s, it was much more natural and gave out a sense of spiritedness.When Cao An and He Chengzhe came by to pick her up, they both whistled at her. Two handsome guys driving a nice car drew attention \u2013 even the hair-washing lady and the other female customers were staring out the window at them.However, Xia Rou\u2019s expression seemed a little ambivalent.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Aren\u2019t you glad to be prettier?\u201d Cao An teased her.Xia Rou got in the car. \u201cI sat for too long. My back hurts.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re just a kid, what do you mean your back hurts,\u201d Cao An laughed at her.Xia Rou smiled in respond.In the early days, they used to bring Xia Rou along to play, bringing her out to eat delicious food and experience interesting things.But after they\u2019d broken up a few times, the three gathered less and less.And soon enough, every time she met He Chengzhe it was never a happy occasion.Since she was really the only person who knew their story, He Chengzhe would sometimes invite her out alone to have tea.\u201cI\u2019m very jealous of you,\u201d he said once. \u201cAt least you can go around openly; you can even like someone openly if you like them.\u201d\u201cXiao Rou, do you have someone in mind? Do you know the feeling of liking someone but having to hide your feelings?\u201dXia Rou had held her teacup, trying to imagine the feeling he was describing.But she was a little lost.

Translated by The NovelstBoth had returned from overseas, so they were more open compared to others. In other countries, it was very normal to see a 15-16 year old high school student have this kind of experience.They didn\u2019t think anything of it but found it funny.After they finished their meal, Cao An sent Xia Rou back home.\u201cTell them not to expect me back today, I\u2019m not returning,\u201d he said.Xia Rou nodded her head and went back inside on her own.\u201cIt seems like she doesn\u2019t really like me,\u201d said He Chengzhe.\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cEverytime she sees me she goes quiet. She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s willing to talk to me.\u201d\u201cNah,\u201d Cao An reassured him, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t really like to speak anyway, she\u2019s very quiet in general. But her character is good.\u201dAlthough she would quarrel with him at times, she was actually a very tactful child. Cao An liked her a lot. He felt that Xia Rou\u2019s existence made the ice-cold house much more comfortable.He didn\u2019t think that Xia Rou disliked He Chengzhe. Before this, she even lectured him about his secretive actions to cover up the relationship was unfair to He Chengzhe; that was obviously her standing up for him.He Chengzhe was only 23 or 24 years old, quite young and handsome. He wasn\u2019t the first man Cao An had ever dated, but he was the person that tempted him the most. Within the colorful mess of people in the crowd, Cao An could spot He Chengzhe instantly without fail.The words Xia Rou had said annoyed him.Why did he have to think so hard about it? He was still young. He would probably get tired of He Chengzhe soon, just like he had gotten tired of others before.It wasn\u2019t worth the price for him to challenge his father\u2019s bottom line just for a relationship.Life was short. Carpe Diem was the only principle to live by.It was the weekend, but only Xia Rou remained to eat dinner. She found it especially lonely.She complained inside that the adults of the house all had their own adult activities to attend.In actuality, she didn\u2019t want to return to being an adult. On the contrary, she was looking forward to the start of her new high school life the next Monday.She could still clearly remember those few years she spent studying, especially during her high school years, when her mind was still simple. During that period was when her relationship with Cao Yang was actually the closest.When she had really begun to change was after she entered society. She started to think, and desire, and became hungry for more.Without the protection of her ivory tower, all sorts of problems, choices, greed, and abandonment found her.Thus, she became uglier and more grotesque day after day, her relationship with Cao Yang suffering and stiffening.After dinner, she went for a light job, her heart easing after she had worked up a sweat.When she ran back toward the road leading home, a black hummer stopped beside her.The window rolled down to reveal Cao Yang, who shouted for her: \u201cXiao Rou, get in.\u201d\u201cBrother Cao Yang,\u201d said Xia Rou, getting in the car. \u201cYou\u2019re back so early today?\u201d\u201cSo early?\u201d Cao Yang asked, looking at her from the side.Xia Rou immediately let out a complaint: \u201cBrother Cao An is going to stay out all night!\u201dCao Yang found it amusing. \u201cDo you know what he\u2019s doing?\u201d\u201cHmmph\u2026\u201d Xia Rou looked out the window. \u201cAdult things, meh.\u201dA little child, trying to act serious and mature like an adult. Cao Yang was dying trying to choke down the laughter in his heart.In the span of time for that two-sentence conversation, the hummer had already reached the courtyard.\u201cYou seem to understand it well?\u201d Cao Yang said.\u201cI\u2019m already fifteen,\u201d Xia Rou protested. Translated by The Novelst\u201cThere\u2019s no need to rush,\u201d Cao Yang unbuckled his seatbelt and leaned over to ruffle Xia Rou\u2019s hair. \u201cYou can take your time growing up.\u201dAs he turned off the car engine, he could see Xia Rou\u2019s surprise illuminated by the dim lights in the courtyard.Then her somber eyes curved into a crescent shape as she broke out into a smile.This was when she was prettiest, when she was smiling like this.\u201cGot it!\u201d shouted Xia Rou.She then jumped out of the car and ran away, just like that.Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt was so hard to see through this little girl\u2019s thoughts!He was only making conversation, why was she so happy?The corner of Cao Yang\u2019s mouth tilted upwards, a soft bang echoing as he shut the car door and headed to the main building.Oh right, Cao An, that little rascal!He would have to give him a beating when he returned!It seemed he didn\u2019t know how to hold his tongue, how could he carelessly speak out to a little girl.These matters of the adult world\u2026 Cao Yang didn\u2019t want them to touch Xia Rou so early.This little girl was now under the protection of the Cao Family. He hoped she could slowly, leisurely plant her roots down first.Then she could grow up slowly, and gradually bloom.\u2026\u2026One thing Xia Rou was most worried about was that she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with her classmates after entering Nan Hua.When school started, she realized that the situation was much better than she\u2019d expected. The teachers in Nan Hua were very professional, breaking down the information and structuring lessons clearly so that it was especially easy to understand.Xia Rou felt that this time she would be able to learn better than in the past.Compared to last time when she was trying to force herself to a standard but couldn\u2019t quite live up to it, her high school life was much simpler now. Studying exerted her brain but didn\u2019t exhaust her heart.Xia Rou thought that perhaps a simple-minded person with a limited IQ such as herself was suited to live this kind of simple life with no need to bother with anything so painstaking as in her past life.The members of the Cao Family could feel that Xia Rou had become much livelier and smiled much more since school had started.She had escaped the shadow of her mother\u2019s passing, starting a whole new life, which was something that they all liked to see.By the end of September, Xia Rou had her first monthly placement test \u2013 there were forty people in her class and she placed twenty-third.She was incredibly happy. Translated by The NovelstCao An was speechless: \u201cTwenty-third? What are you so happy about? You should at least aim for the top five, or at least even the top ten!\u201dProofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I am to get in the first five and got placed twenty-third instead I would probably cry to death,\u201d Xia Rou was self-aware. \u201cMy goal is to not be dropped from the class. The last five students are going to be moved next semester. My spot in the twenty-third place is safe!\u201dIt was really a matter of celebration!\u201c\u2026\u201d Cao An couldn\u2019t even bear to look at her. \u201cYou\u2019re so easily contented!\u201d\u201cContentment is not bad,\u201d Xia Rou smiled. \u201cIt suits me.\u201dCao An smiled then. Translated by The NovelstA content girl was good; she was at least much better than those with bottomless greed.Living under the same roof, they ran into each other every day. Moreover, they even lived on the same floor.Cao An was still the same as in the past. He became close with Xia Rou, who was the only person to know his secret. He liked Xia Rou, taking her as his little sister, same as before.He had the intent to tell Cao Xiong about her contentment.In response, Cao Xiong only nodded his head and said: \u201cShe\u2019s a good child.\u201d\u201cIf we had a girl in the house before our house wouldn\u2019t be so cold now,\u201d Cao An said. \u201cIf only Xiao Rou was my real sister.\u201d\u201cFather,\u201d he continued, nearing Cao Xiong, \u201cTell me the truth, is she really my little sister?\u201dCao Xiong felt that he had been too loose with this son.Ever since he\u2019d gone to study abroad, he hadn\u2019t personally beat him even once. Now, he came to the conclusion that he needed to hold a practical father and son session to remind him of the traditional way of communication in this household.Cao An quickly noticed that the situation had taken a bad turn and made his escape from the scene.As September passed, the boiling hot weather began to cool down.Cao Yang wasn\u2019t as busy these last few days, so when he returned home it was still early.However, he noticed that the A8 was in the garage. Had no one gone to pick up Xia Rou?He took out his phone to call Xiao Yang, but the one to answer was Lady Fang.\u201cCao Yang? Sorry, Xiao Yang\u2019s not available, he\u2019s vomiting and has diarrhea. I\u2019m taking him to the hospital right now\u2026 Ah? Xia Rou? I was thinking to call her and asking her to take a taxi\u2026 You\u2019re going to pick her up? Yes, I understand.\u201dCao Yang inquired about Xia Rou\u2019s school hours, returning to his car and driving to Nan Hua.Luckily, class for high school students ended quite late and he had returned early that day. The distance to Nan Hua from the house wasn\u2019t very large, and he arrived there in just twenty minutes.He parked his car on the opposite side of the road, watching the clock. Every grade let out at different times; sophomores came out the earliest while the seniors came out the latest. It looked like there were just a few minutes left before her class ended, so his timing was right on.He lit up a cigarette and stared at the school entrance.Very soon, students started to trickle out. The sky was rapidly turning dark, but Cao Yang still managed to spot Xia Rou within the crowd in just a glance.He didn\u2019t know why but he felt she was somewhat different from the other girls.She was so quiet, but somehow she was able to attract a lot of attention to herself.Xia Rou was a little anemic and scared of the cold. While the other girls were only wearing long sleeved shirts with a vest, she had an additional jacket on top of that.Her school uniform, having been tailored by Cao An, flattered her well.She wore a black top, a crimson plaid skirt, and knee-high stockings in boat shoes; her legs were slim and straight, her uniform flattering her figure.She\u2019s pleasing to the eye.She even smiled, waving to a few other girls to say goodbye. It was good, she looked like she had made friends at school already.Cao Yang pushed the door open to get off the car, planning to call out for her. By the time he\u2019d shut the car door behind him, he saw Xia Rou standing to the side of the school entrance, talking to a boy.Cao Yang squinted his eyes. That little kid was\u2026 the kid from the Hu Family?A huge bus drove in front of him, obscuring his view.He looked again, and neither Xia Rou nor the boy were by the school entrance.Cao Yang\u2019s expression turned slightly cold. He strode across the road and quickly approached the school entrance.A security guard came out to block his path. Cao Yang said, \u201cI\u2019m looking for Wang Hao.\u201d Wang Hao was the dean of the school.He was in his uniform, epaulets shining brightly. Since he was able to clearly state who he was looking for, looking righteous and imposing, the security guard took a second look at him and didn\u2019t dare stand in his way anymore, turning to let him in.This was also Cao Yang\u2019s alma mater. Although there were two new buildings, otherwise it was the same as it had always been.If Xia Rou had been taken by that kid from the Hu Family\u2026 Cao Yang took even bigger strides down the narrow lane behind the stadium.The stadium was quite far from the teaching building, so no matter what went on there, not a sound would be heard.As he\u2019d expected, he heard Xia Rou\u2019s voice as he got further down the lane.\u201cGet off of me! Don\u2019t touch me! If you don\u2019t stop I\u2019m going to scream!\u201d Xia Rou was angrily shouting.\u201cYou\u2019re quite ferocious. Quit struggling,\u201d the Hu Family kid said. \u201cDon\u2019t you know who my grandfather is? You should be my girlfriend while I\u2019m still asking nicely. Ouch, don\u2019t bite people!\u201dCao Yang\u2019s face immediately froze over. He was going to walk over to them but then he heard Xia Rou\u2019s calm voice ring out: \u201cI know your grandfather is Hu Bin, and your father is Hu Liang, and you also have a brother named Hu Chen.\u201dCao Yang\u2019s footsteps stilled for a moment. Translated by The NovelstThe kid was shocked more than Cao Yang. \u201cYou really do know quite a bit. But so what, being my girlfriend has its advantages, right?\u201d\u201cThen do you know who my big brother is?\u201d Xia Rou asked.\u201cMy big brother is Cao Yang!\u201dProofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How daring of you!\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop laughing. \u201cThen Cao Yang is my big brother too!\u201dHe continued to laugh. \u201cStop pretending, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even going so far as to use Cao Yang\u2019s name to scare me. I\u2019ve already checked. No family in this city with the surname Xia recognize you.\u201dWhen school first started, Hu Xuan had noticed this girl in the new batch of sophomores. She wasn\u2019t the prettiest of them all, but he found her unexpectedly attractive.The old man had taught him well: before he acted, he needed to check the opponent\u2019s background. Nan Hua was known as an elite school for the wealthy. There might be hidden dragons and crouching tigers, and he himself was afraid he might step on a mine. So he had asked around specifically before this.There was only one powerful family with the surname Xia, but none of the daughters of that family were currently in high school. So he already had a rough idea of her status.Who cares what family she was from, as long as he could confirm she wasn\u2019t on his level.And his level was already the top level in the city \u2013 as long as she wasn\u2019t from there, there was nothing for him to be afraid of.And he wanted to lay his hands on her, so he did.Xia Rou had never expected that despite her pulling out Cao Yang\u2019s name that Hu Xuan would actually not believe her!She was regretful. She never imagined that Hu Xuan was this kind of person. It wasn\u2019t that she lacked awareness, she was just careless. Because\u2026 she knew Hu Xuan.When they had met in her previous life while she was in the Cao Family, he was obviously well-mannered and an excellently educated young man, so much so that even Cao Xiong praised him and his brother.He was also polite toward her during all the years they knew each other, and his courteousness never faltered even once.She was totally flabbergasted to see that Hu Xuan at this age was such an arrogant pervert!She suddenly thought back to the words that Cao Yang had said to her before: those people and things, that she couldn\u2019t handle them\u2026That was right. Although she had always aimed toward it, she had never really understood those circles. Under the bright surface, the secrets and the true colors hidden underneath, she\u2019d never really touched them.And yet, she had still stupidly thought that she could make a name for herself.So stupid\u2026 Translated by The Novelst\u201cEh, don\u2019t cry,\u201d Hu Xuan said, startled by the tears forming in Xia Rou\u2019s eyes.He had both hands around Xia Rou\u2019s arms, pressing her against the wall. Their bodies were entwined closely.His taste in women was inherited from his family. He stared at her snowy white skin, her eyes teary and looking ready to spill over, and his heart began to itch.His gaze followed the motion of Xia Rou\u2019s head turning and saw the breeze blow her short hair up to reveal a slim, dainty neck\u2026Hu Xuan felt blood rush all over his body.Since there was no one around, he felt emboldened enough to kiss her.Xia Rou was shocked and shouted out, her struggles restrained by Hu Xuan. He had one arm over both her hands, while his other hand was wandering to more risky areas, when his collar suddenly tightened around his neck.A huge force dragged him backwards, the sky and earth spinning around him, and he was thrown to the ground. He landed on his back, but the force kept him spinning and he rolled further away.Hua Xuan was grimacing in pain, trying to sit up. \u201cWtf! You\u2026\u201dBefore he could get out another word, a black leather shoe stepped mercilessly on his hand.Hu Xuan immediately let out a shrill scream.He was screaming and scolding simultaneously: \u201cYou bastard, hurry up and get your foot off me! Do you know who I am? Dammit\u2026\u201dHe raised his head and looked at the person who had dared to step on him, his voice immediately cutting off and confusion setting in.\u201cWtf, Brother C-Cao Yang?\u201dCao Yang was still on his hand, leisurely taking out a cigarette and lighting up. He took a long drag and blew out the smoke. \u201cXiao Xuan, long time no see.\u201dHu Xuan\u2019s brain seemed to have disconnected. He couldn\u2019t understand why Cao Yang had suddenly appeared. Also, when had he offended this ancestor?\u201cBrother Cao Yang! W-why are you here? Arghhh! Bro! Bro! Have mercy, my hand!\u201dAfter another round of screaming, Hu Xuan was in so much pain that he had sweat pouring down his head. \u201cBro! Bro! At least give me a reason before I die!\u201dCao Yang squatted down, letting out a mouthful of smoke into Hu Xuan\u2019s face, choking Hu Xuan to tears.\u201cJust now Xia Rou told you that her big brother is Cao Yang\u2026\u201d Cao Yang let out another mouthful of smoke, narrowing his eyes at Hu Xuan. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the name Cao Yang before? Or are you looking down on me?\u201dHu Xuan could hardly open his eyes, blurrily noticing Xia Rou gripping her clothes and standing right behind Cao Yang. Suddenly he understood,.She said her big brother was Cao Yang!She was actually telling the truth!To prevent himself from accidentally stepping on a mine, he had even carefully investigated her beforehand. Who could have known he would still step on the most explosive mine!Xia Rou was just as shocked as Hu Xuan; she\u2019d never seen this side of Cao Yang before.From the day she met him, he had always been a responsible brother to her \u2013 calm, steady, and reliable.When he faced her, there was a special gentleness and tolerance in him.When she looked at Cao Yang now, he was one part cold, two parts brutal, and three parts gangster-like. She was completely unused to this side of him.Hu Xuan wanted to cry! Translated by The NovelstHe and Cao Yang could be said to be from the same generation, but their age difference was large. The year the crown prince of the Cao Family was running wild in the city, Hu Xuan was still having sweets in kindergarten.He had not personally seen this ruthless side of the crown prince before, but his father had repeatedly, over and over again, warned him and his brothers.\u201cStay sharp; no matter who you offend, do not offend the brothers of the Cao Family. Especially not Cao Yang.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t believe in his smiling face that he has now. That\u2019s because he\u2019s grown up and learned to restrain himself. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s sincerely kind.\u201d\u201cWhen he was your age, if anyone dared to offend him, you wouldn\u2019t even be able to find them any longer.\u201dCompared to officers in government, Cao Yang had a much more solid foundation.He had planted his roots deeply for over twenty years, making it all the way to the commander position in the army. The network he had weaved had its branches gnarled and roots twisted. Within the four provinces of the east, no matter whether it was a local position or if it was officers trying to get into the central office through connections, they were unable to circumvent the Cao Family.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had already discarded the frivolousness and impulsiveness of his younger self. Instead, he learned to restrain himself and changed to a more pragmatic way of living.Just as Hu Xuan\u2019s father had said, it didn\u2019t really mean he had changed as a person and would let someone walk all over him.Cao Yang stood up. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou was staring, eyes wide, at Cao Yang\u2019s black leather shoe grinding brutally on Hu Xuan\u2019s hand.Hu Xuan didn\u2019t dare make a noise, gritting his teeth and trying to endure the pain, taking quick breaths.Cao Yang revealed a hint of admiration, still smoking before putting even more strength on his foot.Hu Xuan finally gave in.\u201cBro! I really didn\u2019t know! I didn\u2019t think she was telling the truth!\u201d\u201cHer surname wasn\u2019t Cao! I thought she was just trying to scare me off!\u201d\u201cBro I\u2019m at fault! I promise I won\u2019t dare to do it again!\u201dCao Yang dropped his cigarette butt on the floor, finally releasing the pressure on Hu Xuan\u2019s hand and instead extinguishing the butt instead.Hu Xuan, his face full of tears and snot, climbed up from the ground.\u201cWhich one of your claws touched her?\u201d asked Cao Yang.Hu Xuan shivered and stretched out his right hand, but seeing as how his right hand was so badly hurt from being ground into the stones on the ground, he immediately brought it back in and changed to his left hand instead.Xia Rou saw Cao Yang grab Hu Xuan\u2019s arm, and with just a pull, Hu Xuan immediately burst into a scream. His left hand was left hanging uselessly, his face pale like gold paper.\u201cXiao Rou, come here,\u201d Cao Yang called.Xia Rou walked a little closer.\u201cThis is Xia Rou, she\u2019s from our family,\u201d Cao Yang introduced. \u201cThis is Hu Xuan. Now that you\u2019ve been introduced, just know that you can find him if you have any trouble at school.\u201dXia Rou didn\u2019t say anything.Hu Xuan was in so much pain that cold sweat had drenched his body. He endured the pain and said: \u201cBro, don\u2019t worry. I-In the future, I\u2019ll look after her, I won\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201dCao Yang was then finally satisfied. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you,\u201d he said.After he said that, he turned to Xia Rou and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cThe Hu Family has a bad habit. From his grandfather, to his father, and both him and his brother, all the men in their family are unable to think properly after seeing a woman,\u201d he explained as they walked away.\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be afraid. Now that he knows you\u2019re from our family, he won\u2019t dare lay a hand on you again.\u201dXia Rou remembered the kind grandfather from the Hu Family, the refined father, the gentleman Hu Chen and the polite, well-mannered Hu Xuan.When they met her, they had already known she was protected by the Cao Family. So what she saw of them was only the side they wanted to show her.Xia Rou felt bitter in her heart.\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was that kind of person,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought\u2026 he was a good person.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d Cao Yang nodded, warning her: \u201cNext time, don\u2019t follow just anyone to somewhere less crowded.\u201dXia Rou wanted to tell Cao Yang that she wasn\u2019t that unaware, nor was she that careless. The reason she believed Hu Xuan was because she remembered him as a well-behaved gentleman from her past.But she couldn\u2019t say this. It would just make Cao Yang misunderstand her and think she was clumsy and frivolous.Tears trickled down her cheeks. Translated by The NovelstCao Yang stopped walking, turning around to look at her.In just those few minutes, the sky had turned dark.The little girl was hanging her head, sniffling softly and her hair fluttered in the breeze.As if the one at fault was her.It was really different, thought Cao Yang.He had only taken care of brothers before, but not sisters.Since his youth, it had always been his brothers that broke other people\u2019s arms and legs, and he always had to tidy up their mess.None of them was like Xia Rou.He remembered the words she said to Hu Xuan.\u201cYou did well,\u201d he said. \u201cNext time you should do the same. If you encounter anything, just tell them you\u2019re one of the Cao Family.\u201dXia Rou replied difficultly : \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dCao Yang looked at the tear tracks on her white cheeks, unable to stop his heart from softening a little.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said.Xia Rou was one step behind him. In that dark night, she followed his back quietly.So quiet, thought Cao Yang. This was a very quiet, obedient child.But when she encountered something, she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to let them know that her big brother was Cao Yang.Cao Yang paused.\u201cXiao Rou,\u201d he turned to the side to call her. \u201cXiao Bin and them address me as big brother.\u201d\u201cIn the future, you can also call me that way,\u201d he said.He didn\u2019t turn enough to see her, so he didn\u2019t notice that her shoulder shivered.The sound of her walking pace suddenly became a little messy, then he heard her call out in a soft voice: \u201cBig brother\u2026\u201dCao Yang lowered his head to see a slim hand gripping at the sleeves of his black uniform.He took a glance at her and stretched his hand back to hold her tiny hand.Her hand was tender and soft, and she was shivering minutely.He held her hand tightly so she wouldn\u2019t shiver anymore.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u201d Xia Rou called him again, in a soft, gentle tone, hope evident in her voice.Cao Yang answered her with a \u201cmn.\u201dThe young girl suddenly took a step forward until her forehead was against his chest before breaking out into tears and sobbing loudly.He had thought she was very calm, but she was still frightened. Well, after all, she was still a girl\u2026He released her hand and instead softly patted her back.He could see the top of her head when he looked down. Her body was so soft and her shoulder so thin. When she cried softly, her shoulders were also moved up and down\u2026Within his arms, she was just a very tiny person\u2026She was different than his brothers.What she needed wasn\u2019t a strict beating, nor was it repeating lectures. She needed the opposite \u2013 she needed to be carefully protected in order to grow up peacefully.That was fine, thought Cao Yang.No matter what she needed to grow, he as a big brother could provide both.He lowered his head, softly rubbing her smooth hair, and he seemed to be able to smell a faint scent.The scent was indistinct. Translated by The NovelstHe wanted to focus on the scent, but it had already disappeared into the autumn breeze.It was gone, untraceable.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then she kept her hand there to cover that part of her neck.When they arrived home and got out of the car, Xia Rou\u2019s hand was still covering her neck.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Cao Yang.Xia Rou didn\u2019t respond. Translated by The NovelstCao Yang walked toward her and took off her hand. He pushed her hair away to get a closer look. In the dim lightning of the courtyard, he saw a red spot on Xia Rou\u2019s snowy white neck.There was a bite from the kid of the Hu Family!Cao Yang\u2019s expression turned cold. He gave out a \u201chmmph,\u201d thinking that the lesson he\u2019d taught Hu Xuan was too lenient.But at the same time, he felt that Xia Rou was overreacting a little. She seemed to be restless with anxiety and very uncomfortable.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked.\u201cI want to hurry and take a bath,\u201d said Xia Rou, dispiritedly.As if Hu Xuan was a germ.After hearing that, Cao Yang wasn\u2019t angry any longer, finding it funny instead.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d he comforted.\u201cI hate body contact,\u201d she explained softly.She had bumped into Cao Xiong and Cheng Wan doing those things when she was young. It remained as a shadow in her heart, having been planted there when she was just a little girl. The resistance to having body contact with the opposite gender became one of the first manifestations of her childhood trauma.During her adolescent phase, there was one time she was especially resistant to it. During her high school years, she wasn\u2019t willing to speak to any of the boys, and not to mention ever dating.As she grew up, she slowly came to understand that sex was a very normal thing between adults. She was also well-aware that her actions, compared to other girls her age, were abnormal. So she looked to correct herself.After that, she became engaged. Her fianc\u00e9, Liang Ziheng, was a hot-blooded man with exuberant demands. Xia Rou thought that he would surely have a need for intimacy.Although her trauma was forcefully healed bit by bit, she would still resist when it passed a certain point. She didn\u2019t let him easily into her apartment, and although she had the keys to his apartment, she didn\u2019t go there often, either. She would subconsciously avoid situations where they would end up together alone.Of course, Liang Zihen complained several times about this. But the main reason he had proposed was in order to seek connections to the Cao Family. As long as her big brother Cao Yang was protecting her, he needed to hold her in the palm of his hand and treat her like a princess.Xia Rou had actually continually comforted herself. She felt that her trauma would probably resolve itself soon after they married. Too bad that she was still a virgin when she died, and the trauma was brought along with her to this life.Cao Yang had just had body contact with her just now. He had hugged her, patted her, and even held her hand, so he couldn\u2019t help but raise his eyebrows after listening to her explanation.But then Xia Rou continued: \u201cExcept for people that I\u2019m close with.\u201dIt looked like he was included in that description\u2026 A slight feeling of pleasure bloomed in his heart.Oh no, this won\u2019t do, he thought. How was she going to get a boyfriend in the future if she was like this?But she was still young, maybe girls in adolescence were very sensitive. Thinking of it that way, he didn\u2019t feel the need to worry so much.By the time dinner came around, Xia Rou had obvious signs of a rushed shower, her hair still half-wet. It was probably that she was afraid they would wait for her that she came down before she could fully dry her hair.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cao An asked. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou touched her neck uneasily. \u201cI accidentally got a dirty stain on me.\u201dCao Yang glanced at her.After dinner, Cao Yang went to Cao Xion\u2019g study room.\u201cWhen are you leaving?\u201d Cao Xiong asked.\u201cTomorrow.\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d said his father. \u201cLive up to my reputation.\u201dThe son raised one brow.Cao Yang left the study room on the fourth floor, and after thinking for a moment, headed to the second floor and knocked on Xia Rou\u2019s door.When she opened the door, her hair was dry, the fragrant smell of her shampoo not having dispersed just yet. Before, in the dining room when the delicious smell of food had covered it, he hadn\u2019t noticed it, but now that he was here the fragrance immediately flooded his nose. It was different to what the brothers used; it was something that only women would use.It was likely because of the hair dryer that both her cheeks were flushed a delicate peach blossom pink.He always felt that she was a child, but she was actually already a big girl. So pretty that men would want to lay their hands on her.Cao Yang didn\u2019t enter her room, leaning on the door to speak with her.\u201cI\u2019m leaving for a mission. It\u2019ll probably be a few months before I can come back,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I\u2019m absent, look for Cao An if anything happens.\u201dHe paused a while before continuing: \u201cIf there\u2019s anything you want at school, look for that Hu Xuan. Now that he knows who you are, he wouldn\u2019t dare bother you.\u201dHe even reminded her, \u201cDon\u2019t be picky with your food. Eat more spinach.\u201dXia Rou was speechless. \u201cBig brother, you\u2019re such a busybody!\u201dThe hair she had just blown dry was messed up by her unscrupulous big brother into a wild mess.Looking at Cao Yang\u2019s bright smile, she muttered in protest before saying, \u201cWait a second.\u201dShe turned around and ran into her room, quickly running back to slip Cao Yang an amulet, saying, \u201cI got this from Qiyun Temple. The master blessed it for protection.\u201dCao Yang smiled. \u201cGood timing.\u201d Translated by The NovelstOf course it wasn\u2019t a coincidence. Xia Rou had a memory of Cao Yang leaving around this time, so she invited her classmates to go to the Qiyun Temple together and sought a protection amulet.Qiyun Temple was located in the center of the city, known as a royal temple in the old times. In the past, she took it as a tourist spot and had visited while traveling before. But after she was given a new life, she felt that there might be a mysterious power in the unseen world, so she had started to pay her respects to the Buddha.She sincerely went there to seek a protection amulet for Cao Yang.This was despite the fact that she already knew that his mission was supposed to be safe, and last time he\u2019d even been rewarded for rendering a meritorious service.Because she already knew all this in advance, Xia Rou wasn\u2019t worried.She quietly lived her simple high school life, peacefully without waves.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was still far from the excellent students, but Xia Rou was already satisfied with her results.Just as she said, she wasn\u2019t really that smart. The reason she managed to even get her current grades was firstly because the teaching of the teachers was so good, and secondly because she didn\u2019t become lazy due to her reincarnation. She acted like a regular high school student, putting in all her effort to study seriously.During winter break, the weather was already very cold. It started to snow and the temperature decreased every day.Xia Rou had always been afraid of the cold and disliked going out on winter days. Unless she was dragged out by Cao An to eat hotpot, she hid herself at home everyday.It was another weekend. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou ate lunch alone, and bundled in to rest after lunch. She woke up in the evening and went to the reading room.There were two floors in the reading room. The number of books in the collection of the Cao Family was quite tremendous. It was said that they were all Madam Cao\u2019s masterpiece. She could sense a hint of gentleness when looking at the arrangement of the reading room.The placement of the thick wooden table in the center, the light-colored fabric sofa to the side, the comfortable wicker chair beside the window, the pillows, and the plain cotton curtains at the windows.As long as it was left by Madam Cao, even if they might be changed to newer items, the original style remained and the look was kept as closely to the original as possible.Xia Rou had never thought that Cao Xiong would return there after lunch.He was laying on the wicker chair beside the window, his eyes closed. It wasn\u2019t certain if he was asleep. Beside his hand was a thick book laying on the rug, the bookmark slanted in one of the pages, revealing only half the page.Xia Rou rarely had the chance to be left alone with Cao Xiong. It was only sometimes when the two were eating together, but they tended to be quiet at the dining table.Cao Xiong would sometimes ask her about her studies, and sometimes praise her in a few words.Except for those few things, there was nothing else to say between the two.There was no sound when she stepped on the thick rug.Xia Rou stopped in front of Cao Xiong.The man was laying on the wicker chair, the winter sunlight shining through the windows and scattering on his body. Dust could be seen floating under the sunlight.Xia Rou was staring at her mother\u2019s man.He still looked strong, but there were deep wrinkles on his skin. Compared to the his youthful appearance when Cheng Wan was still around, he looked much older.Xia Rou could still remember how quickly he had aged in the ten years of her future, and how he had turned into a very dull, gloomy old man.Until she died, she had never said even a word of gratitude to this man.In actuality, starting that rainy night when she was only seven had her mother had been cowardly and seeking death, the person that let them not worry about food or clothing and provided them with shelter was this man.When she entered the Cao Family, the person to take care of her was Cao Yang. But if it wasn\u2019t for the kindness from Cao Xiong in the beginning when he decided to take her in, Cao Yang wouldn\u2019t give her a second glance.Her life had changed because of this man, so at the very least she wasn\u2019t wandering around, homeless, with no one to rely on.However, she had obviously let him down, which was why he didn\u2019t want to bother with her afterwards.Ever since her reincarnation, Xia Rou had thought of it countless times. She felt that she didn\u2019t had the right to complain about anyone. Recalling her own past actions, she found herself a little noxious.Only Cao Yang had never given her the cold shoulder and continued to tolerate her.Xia Rou let out a soft sigh, squatting down to pick up the dropped book, returning the bookmark to its proper place.Cao Xiong suddenly opened his eyes.\u201cCheng Wan\u2026\u201d he squinted his eyes and called her.Xia Rou raised her head, looking at him in silence.After a while, he sighed, and called her: \u201cXia Rou.\u201dShe softly replied: \u201cUncle.\u201d Translated by The NovelstCao Xiong closed his eyes again.\u201cXia Rou, read me the next paragraph of the book,\u201d he said.Xia Rou them remembered the days in the apartment when the balcony was filled with sunlight, a uniformed man sitting on a wicker chair, having black tea. His collar was opened loosely, Cheng Wan sat right beside him, using her gentle voice to read out a book to him.With a soothing tone.\u201cMn,\u201d Xia Rou replied.Both her knees pulled together and she kneeled on the rug. Under the gentle light, she slowly read out each word.At this time, her voice was much more delicate than it would be as an adult. There was still a huge difference compared to Cheng Wan\u2019s voice. But as Cao Xiong listened to her, he felt that there was a little bit of Cheng Wan\u2019s style in it.He opened his eyes slowly.He remembered that balcony full of sunlight, a wicker chair, and a gentle, sweet woman.\u201cUncle\u2026\u201d Xia Rou stared at the page, before finally asking: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you marry my mother?\u201dCao Xiong suddenly felt his heart throb painfully.Cheng Wan had followed him for eight years, didn\u2019t she want a title?No. Of course she wanted it; of course she would be eager to have an official title. However, she knew that this wasn\u2019t something that Cao Xiong could give her.That\u2019s why she had obediently followed his unspoken request and never brought up her wish.But even if she never mentioned it, it didn\u2019t mean that Cao Xiong was unaware.\u201cAs a man, my priority is to take care of my own family,\u201d explained Cao Xiong.Although this answer sounded cold and heartless, Xia Rou could actually understand the unspeakable hardships and helplessness from his voice.She remembered back to how rapidly Cao Xiong had aged, his appearance when his hair turned white all over\u2026A man who was once like a mountain also\u2026 had a weak spot.\u201cMn\u2026\u201d Xia Rou lowered her head, a teardrop disappearing into the pages of the book.\u201cShe understood,\u201d she said. \u201cShe never once spoke a word in complaint.\u201dThat, Xia Rou knew, because she had asked the same question to her mother before.Why couldn\u2019t Uncle Cao be her stepfather?Her mother had a sad expression, but smiled gently to cover it up.Because, as a father, he had to first protect his own children, she had explained.Xia Rou had longed to have this kind of father.She had desired to become his child.Under the sunlight and the dust, the man himself stretched out his hand to softly touch her head.Softly, he replied, \u201cMn.\u201d Translated by The NovelstProofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The intercity rail took only 45 minutes between the two cities, so it was actually quite convenient.She knew Xia Rou had overheard the conversation that day between her and her mother. As she was an unsophisticated person, she could no longer act as friendly as she had before Xia Rou. Translated by The NovelstWhen the two met, she would lightly nod her head.But the chances of the two crossing paths weren\u2019t high, since Xia Rou had already moved into the main building.Xia Rou would sometimes hang out with Cao An. When she noticed, Xia Rou could clearly see the jealousy in He Lili\u2019s eyes.Xia Rou had also seen He Lili take the initiative to engage in a conversation with Cao An before, but Cao An was the most capricious son of the Cao Family. He didn\u2019t have the patience to sit through that with He Lili.Although he had been close with Lady Fang when he was younger, as he grew up, Cao Xiong had the intention to separate them. The affection he had naturally faded with time.In this house, he would give a little respect to Lady Fang, but he didn\u2019t care whether or not He Lili was embarrassed.Xia Rou felt that He Lili using such an enraged gaze to look at her didn\u2019t make any sense at all.The one who embarrassed her wasn\u2019t Xia Rou. And if she hadn\u2019t acted so aggressively, or if she had gone out of her way to deliberately express her affection toward Cao An, with his temperament, he wouldn\u2019t have acted so awfully, to the point that she was embarrassed.Many times, someone being treated nicely or badly was not determined by the other party, but by herself.Hadn\u2019t she also been like that in the past?She didn\u2019t care what kind of jealous gaze He Lili directed her way, but she knew all she had to do was wait until Cao Yang returned in May. He Lili and her mother would soon leave the Cao Family.In the height of spring, in April, she turned sixteen.She grew a little taller, her breasts a little more rounded. She had a slim waist and long legs. Compared to her pure fifteen-year-old self, the differences slowly became obvious.Cao An and He Chengzhe celebrated her birthday. She didn\u2019t bother Cao Xiong with it. But when she got home, Butler Zhou delivered a present from Cao Xiong.An exquisitely made wristwatch. Translated by The NovelstThe surface was pink in color, giving off a pearly light. Diamond pieces were embedded around the watch itself. It was refined and delicately beautiful.Cao Xiong liked to gift women jewelry and accessories. It was probably one of the ways you could tell he was rich and powerful.Inside Cheng Wan\u2019s makeup box was a lot of expensive jewelry. In the end, Xia Rou kept it properly and tucked it away in the bank safety-deposit box.After she moved into the main building, her bedroom also had a safe. But she was too lazy to go here and there, so the jewelry remained at the bank.However, in the past when her 16th birthday had come and gone, she hadn\u2019t received a single thing from Cao Xiong.Xia Rou put the watch on her wrist. The pink surface and glittering diamonds suited her well, laying softly on her snowy white wrist.Everything was changing for the better, she thought. Even Cao Xiong treated her much better when compared to her past.Even if she had a second chance, she still didn\u2019t have the ability to become an outstanding winner in life. As long as everyone was well and she didn\u2019t let any of them down, she would already be satisfied with her situation.As the dates in the calendar ticked down to approach the end of May, she began to get a little worried.She didn\u2019t think her memory was wrong. Cao Yang back then had finished his mission and returned to the house in May. He came back with a scar on his lower jaw, several inches removed from the main artery of his neck. It had impressed her back then because just a few inches of difference would have meant it could have been fatal.And then, the person she had most hated, Lady Fang, had resigned, which deepened her impression of the time.The last day of May passed, and they finally entered June. The courtyard started to show signs of entering summer.The weather became warmer by the day, but Xia Rou\u2019s heart was getting colder by the day.It was already June, and Lady Fang had yet to resign. She could tell that Cao Yang\u2019s return must have been related to Lady Fang\u2019s odd and sudden resignation that year.But Xia Rou didn\u2019t really care about that matter any longer. Whether or not Lady Fang resigned, whether or not He Lili left, it wasn\u2019t important anymore.Most importantly, Cao Yang hadn\u2019t returned!Xia Rou was starting to show signs of her anxiousness. She started to feel nervous, going sleepless through the night, and her heart weighed heavy in her chest.Summer has just begun and she had lost a few pounds. Dark circles made her eyes look larger, brought along by her anxiety.Her appearance was obvious to the Cao Family, but Cao Xing and Cao An couldn\u2019t get a reason from her.In the middle of June, she was finally unable to bear it any longer. She knocked at Cao Xiong\u2019s study room and asked when Cao Yang would be returning.Her small chin was tight and her expression was solemn. But the motion of her twisting fingers showed her nervousness \u2013 this habit of hers was exactly the same as Cheng Wan\u2019s. Cao Xiong was surprised to see it.\u201cThe reason you were so restless lately was because of this?\u201d He stared at her.\u201cMn,\u201d Xia Rou lowered her head. \u201cBig brother told me he\u2019d be back by April or May, but it\u2019s already June now\u2026\u201dCao Xiong knew she got along very well with his third and fourth sons, but he didn\u2019t expect to see such concern about Cao Yang. To see that she was worried about his child, and from the bottom of her heart, pure and untainted, it made him as a father feel delighted.\u201cHe\u2019s fine, he\u2019s a little injured. It\u2019s not convenient for him to move so he\u2019s recovering there,\u201d he said to her. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably be back in a while.\u201dHe was satisfied to see her stiff shoulders relax.But she continued: \u201cHis wound\u2026\u201d Translated by The Novelst\u201cIt wasn\u2019t serious,\u201d he comforted. \u201cHe\u2019s out of immediate danger now, all he needs is rest.\u201dHe noticed there was still worry in Xia Rou\u2019s eyes, and attributed it to her worry over the wound.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though her relationship with Cao An had been head to head at the start, it was soon back on track just like in the past. However, the reality of the situation now made her realize she was wrong.In the past, Cao Yang was only hurt on his lower jaw during his mission. Although it looked impressive, the wound itself wasn\u2019t serious.But this time, Cao Xiong had clearly implied that Cao Yang\u2019s wound had put him in danger, so much so that he still needed to rest even after he was stabilized.These thoughts made her unable to rest or eat in peace.She was afraid that it might be the butterfly effect. Translated by The NovelstShe didn\u2019t do anything to change the situation \u2013 the only difference was that she\u2019d prayed for a protective amulet for him, but his condition now was much more critical when compared to the past.This made her frightened and anxious. Her previous thoughts that everything had changed for the better immediately vanished. She was afraid that her changes might bring misfortune to the Cao Family in the future.She thought hard for a few days, but still had no idea what could have changed.Down the line, Cao Yang got married, then divorced, and received his military promotion; Cao Bin\u2019s career went smoothly, and he was happy with his marriage; Cao Xing, even to her death, was still playing around and didn\u2019t meet his match; Cao An and He Chengzhe broke up and got back together again, cycling in a love and hate relationship.All of these things weren\u2019t things she could influence.After her reincarnation, she only spoke to Cao An about He Chengzhe once or twice. Cao An, his attitude the same as always, took it as a joke, not taking her words into serious consideration.She thought of it for a long time, but only ended up feeling helpless. She couldn\u2019t help but feel depressed, her emotions sinking down.Time passed quickly as they entered July. It was summer vacation and Xia Rou had already been with the Cao Family for a year.A year ago, Cao Yang had asked her to keep her hair long.Now, her hair was long enough to reach her waist. But he had yet to come back.Her classmates invited her to travel, but she politely declined, not knowing when exactly Cao Yang would return. She stayed at home quietly, waiting for him.The day Cao Yang returned, she was in the reading room.She removed a few books from the shelf, flipping a few pages in before moving to put them back in their places, the words slipping easily from her mind.Closing up the last book, she carried the thick covers of the book. She looked at the shelves full of books, the sunlight shining through the windows, and the dust floating in the air, spacing out.Cao Yang was at the door, illuminated brightly by sunlight. He saw Xia Rou\u2019s dark hair, so long it touched her waist, shining like glossy silk.He liked women with long hair, especially undyed and naturally dark. He stood there and stared at her for some time.He noticed her thin shoulders and straight legs.The young girl had turned into a woman, her body developing slowly into curves that inspired a man\u2019s imagination.It was pleasant to observe.Then he noticed she wasn\u2019t reading, but rather blanking out and staring upwards toward the books. He couldn\u2019t help but break into sudden laughter.\u201cXia Rou,\u201d he leaned on the doorframe and shouted her name. \u201cWhat are you spacing out for?\u201dXia Rou immediately turned her head.The man at the door had a tall stature, his skin much darker than she remembered, looking much more manly.The corner of his mouth was tugged up into a smile as he looked at her, especially as he noticed her spacing out. He found it more and more funny, asking, \u201cWhy, you don\u2019t recognize me anymore?\u201dHe walked toward her. Xia Rou screamed, dropping the book in her hand to hurl herself into his arms and hugging him tightly.When she ran toward him, Cao Yang had his eyebrows raised. Both his hands reacted quickly and opened up for her.Soft breasts and a slim waist. Xia Rou in his arms made Cao Yang realize that she\u2019d grown into a woman now. He recalled that faintly curvy body under the sunlight.He found himself slightly awkward, his hands releasing her waist and softly patting her back. Cao Yang noticed her back was shaking. He was surprised: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying?\u201dXia Rou had acted on her sudden impulse to hug Cao Yang. It was only when she bumped into his solid chest that she realized her actions might not be appropriate.But in these few months, she\u2019d been living under the stress of wondering whether her current actions would bring about a butterfly effect to ripple into the future. Cao Yang\u2019s return finally had burst the dam of her emotions.She released Cao Yang, but her hands were still fisted tightly in his shirt. Regardless, she wanted to cry to her heart\u2019s content.She didn\u2019t say anything and continued to cry, making Cao Yang feel helpless.If his brothers dared to cry like this, he could simply use a leather belt to give them a beating until they smiled.If a woman cried like this, he probably wouldn\u2019t have the patience to continue seeing her. Of course, none of the women he\u2019d dated before were capricious nor were they inconsiderate.It was only in front of Xia Rou that he felt very helpless.He patiently tried to coax her with a few words before realizing she wasn\u2019t listening. So he took that to mean she was probably wronged and just wanted to let it all out.He stopped asking, stretching out his hands and circling her within his arms, patting softly at her back.The moment his palm touched her cool, long hair, his heart moved. He couldn\u2019t help but insert his fingers into her black hair, moving from the root to the tip of her hair, like a waterfall.It was exactly what he loved: natural, dark, smooth, soft, and slightly cold.He lowered his head to take a good look. Translated by The NovelstThe tip of his nose was able to capture a faint scent.It was there, but untraceable.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Looking at her, with her eyes, nose, and ears all red, he found it funny and asked: \u201cDone crying?\u201dXia Rou replied, embarrassed, \u201cMn.\u201d Translated by The NovelstCao Yang patted her shoulder. \u201cCome over here.\u201dHe walked to the coffee table and pulled out two pieces of tissue for her: \u201cBlow your nose first, it\u2019s stained my clothes.\u201dXia Rou was so shy that she turned even more red. She ashamedly took the tissue from his hand, abandoning her image and blowing her nose. She had no other choice because her nose was stuffy and she couldn\u2019t breathe.She even tried to peek at Cao Yang\u2019s shirt\u2026 but he realized what she was doing and couldn\u2019t stop laughing. \u201cJust kidding, there\u2019s no stain on my shirt.\u201dHe lit a cigarette and sat at the armrest of the sofa. Both his long legs were resting on the floor.He took a puff and folded his arms to ask, \u201cWhy did you cry?\u201d\u201cNothing much\u2026\u201d Xia Rou twisted her fingers behind her back.Her head was hanging down, a portion of her black hair falling loosely on her shoulder.It looked so smooth like silk, it was impossible for Cao Yang not to notice.He couldn\u2019t help but stretch out his hand to lift a few strands of her hair, brushing them smooth with his fingers. \u201cIt grew so long already, huh?\u201d\u201cMn,\u201d Xia Rou glanced at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t cut it since then, and my hair grows fast.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to change the topic,\u201d Cao Yang said, his face returning to seriousness: \u201cTell me, why did you cry?\u201dXia Rou choked.He was obviously the one to change the topic!But Cao Yang wouldn\u2019t admit it, continuing: \u201cWho bullied you? Is it Cao An? I\u2019ll give him some beatings.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s silly,\u201d Xia Rou said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cThen why did you cry?\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t stop asking for an answer. It looked like he wouldn\u2019t give up.Xia Rou had no choice but to tell the truth: \u201cThey said you were seriously injured and your life was in danger.\u201d\u201cJust because of that?\u201d\u201cMn,\u201d Xia Rou remained silent for a moment, before slowly explaining. \u201cMy mother isn\u2019t here any longer, and I don\u2019t have any other relatives. I\u2026 I\u2019m scared that something might happen to you too.\u201dShe was wearing simple loungewear, short sleeves with shorts, and it looked clean and comfortable.Hugging herself tightly, she lowered her head slightly, looking like she\u2019d done something wrong.Cao Yang felt that at first, when he thought she finally had grown into an adult woman, he\u2019d been wrong.Indeed, she\u2019d grown, but she was still just a kid.No parents, no other relatives. To someone like him who always took care of her, she was like a nestling*.His heart softened.\u201cSilly girl.\u201dHe stretched out his hand to pat her head. He didn\u2019t want to mess up her hair, so he softly brushed downwards instead.\u201cAm I not back safe and sound now?\u201dXia Rou raised her head, taking a half step forward and moving closer, wanting to look at him closer.Cao Yang\u2019s face was still as handsome as ever, the sharp lines of his face more structured, making him look manlier. He looked much closer to the person in Xia Rou\u2019s memory.He was born in February. His birthday had passed while he was away. Now he was already thirty.Xia Rou stared at his face intently, not wanting to miss even a detail.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Cao Yang.\u201cWhere were you injured?\u201d Xia Rou asked.Not there. Under his jawline, there wasn\u2019t a scar where she remembered one.Something went differently in this life!\u201cOn my body. Don\u2019t ask more,\u201d Cao Yang shook his hand with the cigarette in his fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s already all better. Who doesn\u2019t get hurt in the army.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he smiled. \u201cMy life is hard as a rock.

Everyone\u2026 must live well\u2026Being coaxed by him, she really seemed to have turned into a little girl.Haiz, she would just turn into a little girl then.It was actually quite nice\u2026 Translated by The NovelstCao Yang continued to smile while looking at her.Like he could see right through her.It made her feel embarrassed inside, and her ears turned red.Since Cao Yang had returned, the events in her memory that had been delayed by some mysterious power seemed to start moving according to her recollection.Just as in the past, Cao Yang came back with a scar; he was also awarded the first class meritorious medal.Very soon, following her memory exactly, there was an extra star on his epaulet. He was already a lieutenant colonel at the age of thirty.Within a crowd of middle-aged men, he stood out brightly.In early August, the Cao Family held a banquet.It wasn\u2019t too many people, and very low-key. But because not many were invited, the attendees were limited, and the majority of guests were high in position.It increased the prestige of this banquet.A lot of people tried to use many methods to obtain an invitation. Those who couldn\u2019t get their hands on one could only use their connections to try and see who was invited, so they could request to be brought along.The theme of the banquet was a summer party, but everyone knew that it was actually held to celebrate the advancement in career of the Cao Family\u2019s eldest son.Like father like son: the Cao Family\u2019s prosperity would obviously continue for another few decades.Especially since Cao Xiong\u2019s age would clearly allow him to continue working for another decade or longer.The head of the dragon still remained within the Cao Family, no one could escape them.During the preparation for the banquet, Cao Xiong instructed Cao Yang: \u201cAbout the banquet, explain it to Xia Rou well. Ah, actually\u2026 Get her a teacher to give her some lessons. There\u2019s going to be more occasions like this in the future, let her learn well.\u201dWhen he spoke these words, all four brothers were gathered.Cao Bin, Cao Xiong, and Cao An all had odd expressions. Cao Yang was the only one who didn\u2019t react: \u201cAlright, leave it to me.\u201dAnd the person most surprised by this at the dining table was actually Xia Rou.Cao Xiong was clearly indicating that he was allowing Xia Rou to participate in the Cao Family banquet. This treatment was something Xia Rou hadn\u2019t received in the past.Back then, every time they held a banquet, Cao Xiong would instruct her that there were, \u201cToo many people, it\u2019s messy. You should stay inside the house and not run outside.\u201dAnd so she even turned off the lights in her room, hiding behind her curtains, trying to take peeks at the perfumed clothing and gorgeous hair, watching the joyous toasts go around. She even lay miserably on top of her pillow, tearing up and feeling wronged and unwilling.But without Cao Xiong\u2019s permission, she didn\u2019t dare nor did she have the thick skin to appear at the banquet on her own.Cao Xiong never admitted her.Note:Nestling: When a baby bird is first born, it will take the first living thing it sees as its mother.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sometimes they might participate in a large PR event for a company that were also called \u201cbanquets,\u201d but in reality there were still differences when compared to a real banquet.In those kinds of PR events, they didn\u2019t place that much importance on etiquette.But in a real high-society banquet, there were many things to be fastidious about. One mistake would shame you deeply.The teacher hired by Cao Yang to teach Xia Rou etiquette said to him, \u201cMiss Xia is very smart. She picks it up after I teach it to her just once. She\u2019s very serious in learning and won\u2019t take it lightly just because she understands quickly.\u201dThe words were full of praise. Translated by The NovelstOriginally, Cao Yang was worried that it might be difficult for Xia Rou since she hadn\u2019t been taught since she was young, like in most families in their circle. Without a solid foundation, he worried she might not be able to catch up since she wasn\u2019t very smart. But listening to the teacher now, he was surprised.\u201cYou\u2019re not so stupid,\u201d he smiled as he praised Xia Rou.Xia Rou was a little embarrassed.It wasn\u2019t because she was really so smart. It was just that Cao Yang had also hired a teacher for her in the past. This wasn\u2019t the first time she was learning these things.She felt like she was cheating.But the result of her cheating had actually obtained such praise and a smile from Cao Yang. Inside Xia Rou\u2019s heart, there was a tiny bud of happiness slowly breaking through its shell and trying to poke through the soil to grow in the direction of the sunlight.Cheating\u2026 then let\u2019s just cheat\u2026She really had despaired over her stupidity before, having struggled so much that she gave up on all her past struggles and on being \u201chardworking.\u201d But this time she had decided in her heart not to be greedy and not to seek anything else. She would just take whatever she should in her life.All that didn\u2019t belong to her, she knew she must learn to give it up.But because of that, those things she sought in the past and could never reach, she was able to obtain easily in this life, without forcing it.Again, when compared to her past, her present seemed like a funny, ridiculous dream to her.She might laugh until she woke up crying.In the past, because she wanted one, Cao Yang had hired a teacher for her. He would bring her to banquets of other families, which was how Xia Rou was introduced to everyone.But in the Cao Family\u2019s own banquets, she had never appeared even once. So everyone understood immediately that this lady had no value at all.That was right. At that time, Xia Rou thought others would measure her identity by considering her valuable or invaluable; she was just a child of Cao Xiong\u2019s lover, not his real child, and hadn\u2019t been recognized by him either.That was why she had no value.In this life, she stood in the Cao Family\u2019s wide courtyard, recipient of many observing gazes. She felt the way that these people looked at her was different than in her past.Before, they weren\u2019t even willing to look at her. Now they would raise their cups and smile in front of her, trying to engage in small talk and discern her identity.This was because she was standing right beside the four brothers in the banquet. As part of the main house, she appeared alongside them to entertain the guests.Through this method, those who had connections with the Cao Family all learned that they had added one person to their ranks.A girl named Xia Rou.She wore a light pink dress that fit her just right, her lengthy hair tied into a bun with a few light pink roses tucked into it. On her left arm was only one bracelet, the small diamonds on it glimmering.This was given to her by Cao Yang before the start of the banquet. \u201cThis is the birthday present I owe you,\u201d he said.Although it was beautiful, they were only small diamonds. There weren\u2019t any that were too large, so it wasn\u2019t too expensive. It was suitable for her age.So simply dressed, accessorized by a few diamonds and a few roses. Nothing was too expensive, but she was elegantly dressed.Cao Yang, as the guest of honor in the banquet, was surrounded by the crowd. He would sometimes take a glance at her.In those glimpses he would see her standing there gracefully, like a budding rose topped with dew.After the start of the banquet, Xia Rou was clearly in everyone\u2019s sight.The people who were interested would naturally keep an eye on her.During the banquet, some noticed that Xia Rou addressed the four brothers of the Cao Family as brothers; big brother, second brother, third brother, and fourth brother.She addressed them naturally, not even a hint of deliberateness in her tone. Even the brothers of the Cao Family responded naturally, not the slightest bit reluctant.In the beginning, it was after Cao Yang returned that Cao An noticed that Xia Rou changed her way of addressing Cao Yang. It was then that he told Xia Rou to address him as \u201cfourth brother\u201d as well.Cao Xing, not wanting to fall behind, also told Xia Rou to address him as \u201cthird brother.\u201dCao Bin was fine either way. But someone as sleek as him had acquiesced to being called 'second brother\u201d by Xia Rou in the past. In this life, Xia Rou had made a much better impression, so it wasn\u2019t a big deal at all to let her change the way she addressed him.So in this life, Xia Rou was allowed to address them in a closer manner much earlier than before.When Xia Rou was left alone, someone would come forward and try to discern where exactly she stood in terms of her identity.Of course she couldn\u2019t explicitly expose the origin of her relationship with the Cao Family, but all she told them were facts: she was an orphan who was staying under the roof of the Cao Family.Not long after, as the cups circulated, the news was spread from one set of ears to the next.Some of the elders nodded their heads in understanding.Under this situation no one knew the circumstances, this girl was able to frankly reveal her own identity. It was very rare to see someone that didn\u2019t take advantage of an unclear situation to elevate herself.It was probably because she was still so young that she hadn\u2019t been involved in conflicts of interest before.Because of her young age, she received a lot of praise when she revealed her identity, her gaze clear and her attitude upright.This girl had good self-awareness. Translated by The NovelstSelf-awareness was at times considered a very valuable quality.No one was clearer about this than Xia Rou.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guests continuously took their leave.Xia Rou felt so tired. There were quite some people who were curious about her, and they came approached to talk with her.This was the treatment she longed in the past, but when she obtained it, she didn\u2019t feel as satisfied as the way she looked forward in the past.Actually, it\u2019s just like that. Translated by The NovelstDesire, it came more from your own heart. When your heart doesn\u2019t have any greed, those strong desires in the past slowly faded.She saw Cao Yang was still drinking, she\u2019s a little worried about him. Although she knew that he\u2019s good at drinking.But today he\u2019s the main character, he had to send greetings to welcome them and send them off, moreover it was a celebration for him, surely he couldn\u2019t hide from drinking.These weren\u2019t something that she could care of. Although she did cause some attention, but in this banquet, she had always been just a side character.Different to her, Cao Yang was the main character no matter where he goes.But she wasn\u2019t jealous of him.No matter in the past or in this life, she hasn\u2019t been jealous about Cao Yang\u2019s bright radiance.Instead, in the past and this life, she had always been proud of his brilliancy.She put down her cup, and entered the main building from the side living room, she went to the toilet. She sat on the toilet while resting her legs, she felt her back aching.Since she wore a dress, of course she must match with high heels. At the same time, she must keep an eye of her own etiquette, and maintain a smile. The banquet continued for three hours, it was a huge consumption to her physical.Most importantly, after she rebirthed, she had always been wearing flat shoes. It\u2019s been a year since then, when she had to start wearing back her heels, she felt a little uncomfortable.She rested for a while, finally she felt much lighter, then she only left the washroom.She was a little worried about Cao Yang, he drank too much today. She wanted to see whether he is still fine.The guests had all left, there were only waiters at the front of the courtyard cleaning the mess. Xia Rou walked for a round, she didn\u2019t see Cao Yang, not even Cao Bin and the others.All of them had drank quite some amount, Xia Rou thought that maybe they had all went back to their room to rest.Xia Rou was tired too, she walked pass through the living hall and went to the stairs. She looked around to ensure there was no one, then she took out her heels and held it on her hand. Her barefoot stepped on the stairs carpet, suddenly she felt her legs were finally released.So comfortable that she couldn\u2019t help to let out a sigh.This pair of legs were still when she was 16. Her bones and muscle hasn\u2019t fully grown yet just like when she was an adult and has adapted wearing heels.She walked to the corner of the stairs, and couldn\u2019t help to bend down and rub on her legs and toes that were squeezed within the heel.Out of the corner, she glanced a light yellow figure flashed by at the elevator spot.Cao Yang, his body was being supported by a person, then he was led into the guest elevator.Xia Rou remembered that she saw that light yellow one piece before at the afternoon.That time, the contractor of the banquet had brought the waiters into the scene and started decorating the place. He Lili was wearing that light yellow dress wandering around. However, she was scolded by Lady Fang and was told not to cause trouble for her.He Lili unhappily returned to the side building.Cao Yang looked very drunk. Without thinking, Xia Rou put her heels back on and walked to follow them; she wanted to see what they were doing.She took just two steps forward before something nudged at her memory. She was surprised.In the past, Cao Yang wasn\u2019t hurt so badly, so he was able to return in May. Toward the end of May, the house had held the same banquet to celebrate his success.Two days after that, Lady Fang, who had been with the Cao Family for over a decade, suddenly resigned.Back then, Cao Xiong had never agreed to let her officially attend the Cao Family\u2019s banquet.He had told her to study well, and \u201cdon\u2019t let it affect your performance on your midterms.\u201d And the times after that, he didn\u2019t give her a reason. Judging by his actions, he was planning to raise her only enough to survive.At that time it was May and the weather was still cold. The banquet was held inside the first floor hall.That was her first time witnessing that kind of occasion. She hid herself at the corner of the stairs, sneaking peeks from the gaps in the railing. The mesmerizing outfits and gleaming jewelry hinted at a world she\u2019d never encountered before. It left her breathless with amazement.And then two days after that, she heard of Lady Fang\u2019s resignation. She was surprised, but not saddened.She was even happy about it.That woman had always had on a stiff face in front of her, looking like the mistress of the house \u2013 that was why Xia Rou didn\u2019t like her at all.She had tried to ask around about the reason for Lady Fang\u2019s sudden resignation, but no one ever gave her an answer.And she hadn\u2019t really been concerned about it, so she quit asking.Now, Xia Rou was standing at the top of the staircase as all the things that had happened in the past and in her current life came together. She was stunned.It was unbelievable.That was right, she had always thought she could understood He Lili.Her desire toward that kind of life, and that status. She could understand very well the things He Lili desired. Even she herself had tried to keep herself from dropping out of this circle, and the result was that she ended up engaged to a man she didn\u2019t care for.B-but\u2026 This kind of thing\u2026 Translated by The NovelstShe was agog with disbelief that He Lili didn\u2019t know where to draw the line.She took a few steps back to return to her old place in the corner and sat at the top of the stairs, staring blankly at the elevator.She waited for a long time, long enough for He Lili to have settled a drunken person, and then walked downstairs. But that elevator didn\u2019t have anyone going down\u2026Xia Rou stood up to consider if she should go up to stop them. After contemplating the matter for a while she gave up.The ability to handle all sorts of things \u2013 she knew there was a big difference between her own ability and Cao Yang\u2019s.There wasn\u2019t anything that big brother couldn\u2019t solve. Even in the past, he\u2019d never put himself at a disadvantage, so he could handle the matter on his own. If she acted hastily and intervened in the matter, she might worsen the situation.To be proofreaded\u2026 PS: editor-chan is currently busy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had been working at the house for over ten years, and no matter what they would still be soft and be sentiment toward the mother and daughter. She had overestimated her mother\u2019s position in the household.Just as Lady Fang had told her before, she worked under the Cao Family. They paid her well \u2013 much better than other places would. That so-called sentiment between Lady Fang and the Cao Family was He Lili\u2019s misconception.In exchange for the bloodstain on the bed was only Cao Yang\u2019s cold laughter and disdainful gaze.Inside Cao Yang\u2019s study, He Lili was so embarrassed to be facing her mother\u2019s unamused face.She had never thought Cao Yang\u2019s heart would be so tough.In order to make it more realistic she\u2019d even torn her own hymen. But all she got in return was a scornful disdain.\u201cIf you want I can call someone from public security to examine. The bedsheet doesn\u2019t have any trace of sperm,\u201d he said coldly without any expression. The fact that he was facing a naked young woman with a helpless expression didn\u2019t seem to affect him at all.He wasn\u2019t stupid; how could he not know whether or not he\u2019d done it? He was drunk to the point of falling down and it wasn\u2019t like he was a violent man, to make her bleed so much in that kind of state.A truly drunk man wouldn\u2019t be able to give any response. In situations with the so-called losing control after getting drunk \u2013 the man is definitely not the real person who was drunk.Not to mention that he didn\u2019t even do it with her. If he had, it was just a matter of giving her some money.Ever since Cao Xiong had sat on the position of the commander of the army, the crown prince of the Cao Family had encountered many women trying to seduce him.When it came to a woman like her who had the courage to scheme like this, he wouldn\u2019t even compensate her.But he did write a check and tried to hand it to Lady Fang. \u201cThis is to compensate your resignation. Thank you for your hard work during all these years.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t even a chance for them to redeem themselves.He placed the check on the desk and left.Lady Fang struggled internally for a long while, but in the end she still took it. She felt embarrassed but she had just lost her job, and her daughter was just getting on her feet. She had no choice but to keep her head down.She slapped He Lili across the face.\u201cIs this how you act, as my daughter?\u201d She was so angry that her lips were quivering.He Lili cried out sadly. Translated by The NovelstShe\u2019d never imagined that Cao Yang would be so cruel to her.She didn\u2019t dare hope for more. All she wanted was to follow him and be at his side. She didn\u2019t dare think about receiving a title.If she had a child by him then perhaps she could marry into wealth. But just by depending on her loss of innocence? In this day and age?She had thought if she created this kind of situation, then Cao Yang would at least be kind to her. But he hadn\u2019t \u2013 a man as forceful as Cao Yang would definitely not allow someone to pull the wool over his eyes.She discovered this when she\u2019d looked into his eyes, but it was too bad that this realization came too late.She was upset and regretful.She regretted, and resented.Cao Yang had found a position for her at a big company. Though the headquarters weren\u2019t in the city, the money was good, enough that her friend were jealous of her.That evening, she\u2019d stood in front of the window from afar, looking at the mesmerizing outfits\u2026 She realized she was too far from that world. A years\u2019 worth of her salary could probably afford only one of those dresses.Not even to mention the accessories at the necks and wrists of the attendees, diamonds and pearls gleaming brightly under the lights.Those glittering lights had blinded her eyes. Compared to them her salary was measly.Did she really have to continue living this way?And at that time she\u2019d seen Xia Rou.Xia Rou was wearing a decently pretty dress, and a gleaming light trailed her movements when her wrist moved.She was nothing but a mistress\u2019 child!But even when her position was that low, she had a much better life than any average woman.At that moment the thought she\u2019d had fleetingly in the past had returned with unprecedented strength.When all the guests had left, her feet had led her to the empty banquet, only waiters remaining to clean up the mess.She was a little disappointed as she walked into the main building. But then she\u2019d seen a waiter supporting Cao Yang toward the washroom. Her heart had skipped a beat. She quickly chased after them, but they\u2019d already entered the washroom.So she waited in the corridor patiently for them to come out. Cao Yang was truly dead drunk. If no one supported him, he couldn\u2019t even walk by himself.Her heartbeat thudded quickly and she quickly spoke out, \u201cWhy are you so drunk?\u201d She then stretched out her arms to grab him.The waiter didn\u2019t recognize her. His job was only to serve the guests at the banquet and he needed to tidy up.So he\u2019d handed over the guest of honor to the young woman who seemed to be very close to him, and promptly left.This was how He Lili got her chance. Translated by The NovelstIn order to obtain that chance, she even sacrificed her virginity, but she\u2019d underestimated the cruelness of that man.She\u2019d arrived to the Cao Family when she was young. She had no father and could only depend on her mother.She always felt that Cao Yang had some tender affection for her and her situation.In the end she finally understood. Cao Yang merely pitied her.Only Cao Yang\u2019s feelings toward Xia Rou could be seen as tender affection.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just furrowed his brows ferociously and said to her: \u201cXia Rou, don\u2019t you dare learn from her! If you dare act like that I\u2019ll beat you to death!\u201dThis was the first time Cao Yang had spoken angrily toward her.Xia Rou was very taken aback. Translated by The NovelstThen her eyes began to well up with tears.In her past life, Cao Yang never dared tell her about the circumstances surrounding Lady Fang\u2019s resignation, nor did he speak that way toward her.If only in the past he had furiously warned her, \u201cIf you dare act like that I\u2019ll beat you to death,\u201d then maybe she wouldn\u2019t\u2026 wouldn\u2019t\u2026There was no such thing as a \u201cmaybe.\u201d Because in life, there were no \u201cif's.She\u2019d already lived her past life through, and that couldn\u2019t be changed any longer.The only thing she could change was this life she was living now.Cao Yang saw her tear up, and couldn\u2019t help the softening of his heart, thinking she was frightened of him, or feeling wronged.He used a gentler tone and patted her head, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re different than her. You\u2019re our little girl. Whatever you want, anything your heart desires, all you have to do is tell the family, or come to me. Don\u2019t think too much, okay?\u201dHe thought to himself, girls were too easily swayed by wealth. Even He Lili was very simple and cute when she was young.But now, all that was left in that woman\u2019s eyes was only greed for wealth and pride.He wouldn\u2019t be able to bear seeing Xia Rou\u2019s eyes turn like that.He liked to see Xia Rou\u2019s pure gaze. Not many people around him could have this kind of clear gaze. He was born to this kind of family with a father who had power and influence; even his grandfather had deep roots in a prestigious family.He was destined to be surrounded by who weren\u2019t simple in any way.That was why he liked to be refreshed by a simple smile from Xia Rou when he came home.He liked to see her outfitted in casual loungewear, revealing slim arms and straight legs. A calm, soothing aura emanated from her being, head to toe.In the beginning, he\u2019d only felt a small bit of pity for her.He pitied her because he knew the feeling of having lost a mother just at that age, so he could understand her pain.But slowly, he could feel the little girl\u2019s soft-spokenness, obedience and simple mind grow on him. With that, slowly his pity toward her became a tender affection.His mother had actually yearned for a daughter her whole life. Before she gave birth to Cao An, he\u2019d lost count of how many times she\u2019d said she wanted to give birth to a little sister for him. Too bad it was another stinky boy. He already had two other stinky little brothers jostling for his mother\u2019s attention anyway; he didn\u2019t care if he had one more.He could still remember that when his fourth brother was still very young, his mother grew his hair out so she could tie it into braids. She also had him wear a dress. In the end, it was their father who told her that it wasn\u2019t good to do this to a boy; that was when she finally stopped dressing him up.He looked again at Xia Rou. He felt that this must have been the kind of daughter his mother wanted.He actually wouldn\u2019t mind if Xia Rou was really his blood-related little sister.When his mother was still alive, his parents got along very well. His father had never cheated; even after his mother had passed, he had rejected a few marriages that could have greatly helped his career.If his father really had another child, a younger sister, outside the house, it was actually\u2026 not that big a deal.In the beginning when his father had assigned him to her, he had only thought to raise her only until she became an adult.But his affection for her slowly grew and became deeper and deeper until he wanted to naturally treat her better.When he allowed her to address him as \u201cbig brother,\u201d like his little brothers did, he had already taken her on as a responsibility, same as he took his brothers.Well, who told him he was born to be a big brother.He patted on her head continuously, even a little upset that she wasn\u2019t his biological little sister. If she was, he could treat her even better.But even as it was now it was quite good. This time his father had spoken out and allowed Xia Rou to attend the banquet, giving her an identity to stand on.No matter whose child she was, or what surname she held, she now belonged to the Cao Family.He was afraid that she might not be able to understand this point and take the wrong path as He Lili had.But, he thought that it would probably be fine.He was looking at her right now, wasn\u2019t he?

They probably misunderstood our relationship and think that I\u2019m uncle\u2019s child.\u201dCao Yang laughed aloud. Translated by The Novelst\u201cIf you were my real little sister, that would be nice too.\u201d He grabbed the tips of her hair and wound them around his fingers. As long as she could see through the matter and wasn\u2019t deceived by appearances, all was good.\u201cShould I explain it to them?\u201d Xia Rou asked helplessly, pulling back her hair.Any human would probably have their own strange habits or weird tastes. Such as Cao Xing\u2019s love for plushies, or Cao An\u2019s ability to love male or female. Until now, the only person between the four brothers that Xia Rou hadn\u2019t found out anything about was probably only the second brother, Cao Bin.Even though in the past he had held the image of the nearly-perfect big brother in her heart, in this life she realized that Cao Yang\u2026 He was actually very fond of long hair.Why hadn\u2019t she realized before?This was probably because she had always kept her hair short in order to be as different from Cheng Wan as possible. Only when she had graduated, she felt she was more mature than she was in the past, and that there was no meaning behind her deliberate actions to keep her hair short; it was then that she started to grow out her hair.But at that time, her relationship with Cao Yang wasn\u2019t nearly as close as it was now. Every time he saw her, his face would stiffen up. As for her, she could only lower her head and listen to his lectures.She didn\u2019t know why, but there was always a nervous atmosphere between them.Even though he cared for her so.Even though she respected him so.She could still remember that the many times she\u2019d angered him once again, after being scolded, she would leave his study room dejectedly. Each time after she closed the door, she could hear a deep long sigh.Xia Rou couldn\u2019t help but turn her head to look at Cao Yang.They sat under the tree atop the long bench in the courtyard.The hair was being slowly pulled from his fingertips. He raised his brows in dissatisfaction, taking another long strand to wrap again on his fingers.When facing her, his expression was very relaxed. The shape \u201c\u5ddd\u201d didn\u2019t appear embedded in his forehead as it had been in her memory.A man in his thirties could actually look so childish in a fully relaxed state.Xia Rou was speechless.She had never thought a day would come that it wasn\u2019t Cao Yang who was speechless toward her, but rather her toward him.\u201cNo need,\u201d Cao Yang raised his brows, wrapping hair tighter around his fingers. Looking at how helplessly Xia Rou was trying to get back her own hair, he found it amusing.\u201cWhether or not your surname is Cao, you\u2019re now a child of the Cao Family,\u201d he smiled and stated clearly.Xia Rou actually understood.The things she desired in the past and the moment Cao Xiong had allowed her to attend the banquet, she had already understood.It was false to say she wasn\u2019t happy with it, it was just that\u2026 She wasn\u2019t as excited nor as satisfied as she thought she would be.To be able to obtain Cao Xiong\u2019s recognition in terms of her identity\u2026 Instead, she was more satisfied to be able to be sitting next to Cao Yang, relaxed and teasing her.Suddenly she felt her scalp tighten and her head was pulled toward Cao Yang.\u201cAlso, don\u2019t concern yourself with those people. Right now, all you have to do is study hard. If you want to get a boyfriend, wait at least until you get into university,\u201d said Cao Yang.Xia Rou glared at him and said in annoyance, \u201cLet go of my hair, it\u2019s painful.\u201dCao Yang wrapped even more layers of hair into his fingers. The more he wrapped, the shorter her hair got.He smiled and looked at her, \u201cI didn\u2019t use any strength.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why, but he really liked to tease her.She was always so soft and never expressed any anger to him before.Many times, he would actually only be able to observe her \u201chelplessness.\u201dIt was as if she was an adult looking helplessly at her lovely child being naughty but wasn\u2019t able to do anything\u2026 It was so funny to him!It made him want to tease her even more.Xia Rou, the victim, looked like a little kitten, helpless but annoyed in her efforts to pull her hair back. This scene was being watched by Cao An.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, what\u2019s going on!\u201d He walked to them and put his butt right down between the two.With one hand he grabbed his big brother\u2019s shoulder while the other wrapped around Xia Rou\u2019s waist.Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dXia Rou: \u201c\u2026\u201dBoth swerved away quickly.\u201cSo relaxed today? You actually stayed home this weekend?\u201d Cao Yang asked curiously.His fourth little brother was still young and hadn\u2019t quite stabilized yet, so he was quite painful. It was rare to see him appear in the house during the day on a weekend.Cao An gave out a hmmph. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou knew him well, so she took just a glance at him and could tell something bad must have taken place between him and He Chengzhe.She sighed in her heart and stood up. \u201cYou guys continue. I\u2019m going back to my room.\u201d\u201cEh, I\u2019ll come with you,\u201d Cao An said. Just as his butt left the chair, his big brother had already tackled him back down.That hand was like an iron band. It reminded Cao An of his childhood spent being repressed by that very hand.\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Cao Yang furrowed his brows. He hadn\u2019t noticed before, but wasn\u2019t Cao An too close to Xia Rou? \u201cXiao Rou is a lady now, you can\u2019t always run into her room.\u201dAs though the person who had pulled the lady\u2019s hair and played around wasn\u2019t him himself!Cao An only dared to keep these thoughts deep inside.Originally he had argued with He Chengzhe, which was why he had returned early. He wanted to talk to Xia Rou about it. Since he had to hide this matter from Cao Xiong, he didn\u2019t dare tell anyone else. Or else he was afraid that one day it would surely make its way to Cao Xiong\u2019s ears.Of course this meant he wouldn\u2019t dare let his big brother know about this, as the second version of his father.In the end, the person he wanted to find had run away, while he was being pushed down by his brother. He couldn\u2019t express the deep despair he felt.He was afraid that his big brother might pay attention to his concerns, so he followed his big brother\u2019s words and quickly responded: \u201cSince you also know that Xiao Rou is a big lady, why don\u2019t you keep a safe distance?\u201dCao Yang maintained his composure as he increased the pressure to his hands, looking in satisfaction at the grimace of pain on his little brother\u2019s face, looking like he didn\u2019t dare shout in pain. Only then did he release his grip.\u201cKeep your head on,\u201d he lit up a cigarette. \u201cI\u2019m fourteen years older than her. She\u2019s like a child to me.\u201dProofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was different than the lust other women had in their eyes when they looked at him. Xia Rou\u2019s gaze indicated she longed to be close to him.She seemed to desire his care, wanting to become close to him.When he smiled and patted her head, he could see an indescribable satisfaction in her eyes. When he relaxed before her and laughed aloud, her eyes could curve happily into crescents.Her attitude toward him was truly from the heart, and her eyes had always conveyed this to him clear as day.And so Cao Yang was slowly able to reveal his relaxed self before Xia Rou.This made him feel very comfortable and at peace.He liked it a lot. Translated by The Novelst\u201cAbout you, I can be rest assured,\u201d said Cao An. He angrily rubbed at his shoulder and continued, \u201cBut you still have to think from her perspective.\u201d\u201cAh, a young girl growing into puberty, who knows if she can enter spring easily. And ah, with big brother, such a charming person\u2026 Ouch ouch ouch, take it easy! Let go!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve taught you a lesson, eh? There you go, speaking nonsense again,\u201d Cao Yang held a cigarette between his lips and stared at him.Cao An rubbed the bones that had almost been crushed by his brother. He had actually missed that death stare from his big brother.No matter how bad his brother was, only his siblings could understand him the best.In the past few years, his big brother had started to act more like their father. Each year when they returned home, the brothers realized that Cao Yang liked to act strictly. That posture, that aura; if it wasn\u2019t that his face wasn\u2019t wrinkled, they would have believed their father had learned to use a shadow clone.Where did that handsome tyrant of a big brother who used to bring the three of them along to run wild and rampant through the four provinces go? Could it be that during the time the brothers were away, his father had exchanged him with an alien?Even his second brother had changed. He went around smiling every day, looking like a fake gentleman. Who didn\u2019t know he was a wily man with tricks up his sleeve!Third brother had also turned much more honest after being trained by his father; it had been a long time since Cao An heard his third brother beat someone until their bones broke.Haiz, all his brothers were turning more and more serious by the day. Wait, no, fake serious. He was the only person in the house that maintained his real personality\u2026\u201cI\u2019m being serious here!\u201d Cao An said unevenly. \u201cI know you\u2019re fine, but think of Xiao Rou. It would be so easy for a na\u00efve girl like her to fall in love with a mature man like you. You may think you\u2019re not hitting on her, but sometimes it still hits even when you\u2019re not trying. What are you going to do then? You\u2019ll be alright, but isn\u2019t Xiao Rou going to be sad?\u201dOriginally, he didn\u2019t want to let Cao Yang keep asking why he\u2019d returned so early in the weekend, so he\u2019d tried to change the topic. But as he continued to speak, he began to become serious about it.\u201cYou should be careful,\u201d he reminded his big brother.What Cao An had said made a lot of sense.But Cao Yang took a puff, thinking back to the look in Xia Rou\u2019s eyes. That child, toward him\u2026 didn\u2019t have any of the desire between a man and a woman. He could confirm that. Women had always been weaker than men when it came to emotion, and their eyes always easily showed their feelings.From the very first day Xia Rou had stepped into the Cao Family and laid eyes on him, her eyes only held respect for him.As if she took him as a biological brother.\u201cIt seems you really understand this well. Then why don\u2019t you know how to keep your distance? I\u2019ve seen you around a few times, why do you keep running into Xiao Rou\u2019s room? It\u2019s a lady\u2019s room, how can you step so carelessly in!\u201dCao Yang\u2019s iron grip closed in on Cao An\u2019s shoulder once more.Cao An felt that he should check the date again today. Today must not have been a good day to meet his family.Damn, he couldn\u2019t even explain the situation to him! Xia Rou was the person who understood him the most in the house. He couldn\u2019t say those things to other people. If he didn\u2019t speak about it with Xia Rou, he might explode!Not only was it that Xia Rou\u2019s lips were sealed, she also had a calmness and a cool personality that defied her years.Especially toward the matters between Cao An and He Chengzhe, she could sometimes pinpoint the problem in just one or two sentences, even though it made him so mad he would usually storm out. But\u2026 due to this, he\u2019d started to take Xia Rou as his confidant.\u201cAiyo, ouch, ouch, ouch!\u201d Cao An shouted. \u201cLet go! Damn! Am I even your younger brother?\u201dCao Yang smirked, \u201cTo have a little brother like you brings me shame. You can\u2019t even compare to Hu Xuan. I broke his arms but that little kid grit his teeth and bore it all without letting out even a sound, he\u2019s more like me than you are.\u201dHis fourth brother had been abroad for a few years. Without having been trained by their father, he\u2019d turned into such a weak chicken. Cao Yang was ashamed for him.\u201cHu Xuan? Hu Chen\u2019s little brother?\u201d Cao An asked curiously. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201dCao Yang had become more mature and reserved these past few years. The bad temper of this crown prince had already been restrained. He didn\u2019t get angry easily, not to mention that Hu Xuan was a little kid with such an age difference between them.\u201cThat little kid\u2019s eyes are quite sharp. He had his eyes on Xiao Rou and set his hands on her,\u201d Cao Yang said, blowing out smoke.Cao An\u2019s face darkened. Translated by The NovelstThe actions of the men of the Hu Family, they were all clear on that.And men naturally had the desire to protect women. Not only between lovers, but also between family members; from father to daughter and from brother to sister.Xia Rou was considered the Cao Family\u2019s little girl by the four brothers. To hear that she was harassed by some guy, no matter the reputation of the Cao Family, was not something that the men of the family could stand.\u201cDamn!\u201d scolded Cao An. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even beat him to death?\u201d\u201cI taught him a lesson,\u201d Cao Yang replied.Cao An then remembered that big brother had told him he\u2019d \u201cbroken his arms,\u201d viciously saying, \u201cThat\u2019s too cheap for him.\u201dProofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s doing his duty. He calls me about once a month to report to me,\u201d Cao Yang said, satisfied with this situation.\u201cHe\u2019s just like his brother. Their family has a lot of intentions,\u201d Cao An said. \u201cIn our family, the only person like that is probably only second brother.\u201d Translated by The NovelstCao Yang felt his little brother\u2019s bad habit of speaking carelessly hadn\u2019t improved at all.\u201cEh, eh, did you ask him to look after Xiao Rou? Don\u2019t let him seduce her!\u201d Cao An started to worry again. \u201cThat kid\u2026 his appearance isn\u2019t bad, either!\u201dTo be able to receive that kind of praise from Cao An meant that Hu Xuan didn\u2019t look bad at all.In reality, Hu Xuan was very good-looking. All the men of the Hu Family had good-looking features. The reason that Xia Rou of the past had a good impression of the Hu Family was definitely because of their good looks.Cao Yang remembered what Hu Xuan had told him.\u201cXia Rou is already very popular. There are a few boys crushing on her. She has some place among the girls at Nan Hua already, ever since she participated in the banquet at the Cao Family, there are a lot more people trying to get close to her.\u201d\u201cBut Xia Rou is a little wooden. It\u2019s not a bad thing. She\u2019s just\u2026 Mmm, doesn\u2019t seem to like hanging out with the boys.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s quite okay with the girls, they talk and joke around. It\u2019s just that she\u2019s a bit cold to the boys. She seems to be sexually frigid\u2026 Eh, bro, I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong!\u201d\u201cNo worries,\u201d He wasn\u2019t worried. \u201cThat little girl hasn\u2019t discovered that yet.\u201d\u201cWhat if someday she discovers it? How can you be so careless?\u201d Cao An snorted.In his heart, he didn\u2019t believe Cao Yang\u2019s words, that Xia Rou hadn\u2019t yet discovered relationships or feelings yet. That little kid could target his weak points every time she opened her mouth to speak. The matter between He Chengzhe and himself, she clearly knew everything from top to bottom.To say that she hadn\u2019t yet discovered her feelings yet seemed untrue.He felt that she probably just hadn\u2019t met anyone she liked yet.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you now, you should pay more attention to it in the future. She\u2019s our girl. Don\u2019t make her feel awkward in the future.\u201dCao Yang felt that what Cao An said was reasonable.That little girl. Who knew when she would discover such feelings.He had also seen He Lili grow up and it was at this very age that her gaze toward him became strange.\u201cAlso, our Xiao Rou ah, don\u2019t think she\u2019s still too young. She\u2019s actually quite attractive and will be an adult in just two years. You better take it easy, don\u2019t set your hands on our own girl.\u201d\u201cAlthough she\u2019s your little sister, she\u2019s not blood-related. You better hold yourself back. Sigh, it\u2019s too bad that she\u2019s not our biological sister. If she was, that would be better!\u201dIt was natural for Cao An to be unable to shut his mouth.It looked like it couldn\u2019t be helped, he needed to be taught another lesson.Cao Yang\u2019s hand drifted to his leather belt.Cao An\u2019s previous experience told him that the next step his brother would take was to grab the belt and hit him!He immediately ran away, da da da sounding behind him.\u201cI\u2019m saying the truth!\u201d He even dared to turn back and shout.Really had no fear of death at all! If you have the guts to say that then don\u2019t run!Cao Yang let out a \u201ctsk,\u201d and released his hands off his belt.He had just been trying to scare him off. All his little brothers had grown up, so he couldn\u2019t just smack them around like he had when they were young.As for Xia Rou\u2026 What a joke, since when had his taste become so na\u00efve?She was just a little girl.She hasn\u2019t even discovered feelings yet, and hadn\u2019t felt anything when he went nearer to her. She didn\u2019t put up walls, nor did she even blush a single time. She didn\u2019t look at him as a man.Similarly, he was unable to see her as a woman.Even if he wanted to see her like that, he would still have to wait at least two years.But\u2026His mind drifted unconsciously to the feeling of her hair flowing smoothly between his fingers.In two years, this child\u2026 would probably grow into just his type, he thought.Cao An hadn\u2019t even run too far when he could already see Xia Rou running toward him.It seemed like her training this entire year hadn\u2019t gone to waste. Her body seemed much healthier compared to when she had just arrived to live with them. Even her face was redder.She ran quite fast and hadn\u2019t even broken a sweat.But she had a constipated expression on her face, expressing a sort of \u201ccan\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d vibe\u2026\u201cBig brother! Big brother! Hurry and come!\u201d Xiao Rou seemed to be having a breakdown. \u201cCao Xing, he! He\u2019s going crazy!\u201dCao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dCao An: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat did Cao Xing do?He made Xia Rou progress to such a state that she called him by name rather than \u201cthird brother\u201d!\u201cHurry and come, hurry!\u201d Xia Rou ran to Cao Yang\u2019s side to pull at his arm.All Cao Yang could do was put out his cigarette to follow her back to the main building.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked curiously.\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you see it!\u201d Xia Rou helplessly replied.Such a rare sight, what could Cao Xing do?Cao An also followed them in. Translated by The NovelstWhen they arrived at the entrance of the hallway, Cao Yang and Cao An went silent.They deeply felt that Xia Rou had learned the language well.At least, the way she\u2019d described Cao Xing as \u201ccrazy\u201d was so true!Inside the living room, at the entrance to the stairs, was an enormous plushie bear on the floor, probably over 2 meters tall.Cao Xing himself was ensconced within the bear\u2019s arms, looking as if he was using it as a sofa.He took the huge bear\u2019s arms to cuddle with it, hugging it tightly to his chest, revealing in his expression how comfortable he was.When he saw Xia Rou, he shouted happily, \u201cXiao Rou, why did you run? Quick, come and try this! It\u2019s so comfortable!\u201dAlthough his mouth was obviously inviting Xia Rou to try, the big man didn\u2019t seem to want to budge.He wasn\u2019t only obviously going crazy, but he was on his way to seek death.He wasn\u2019t far from death!Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was said to be up to 2.4 meters tall.On the internet, a photo circulated, accompanied by text asking how to transport this bear back home. Although Cao Yang and Cao An hadn\u2019t shown any interest in this, they\u2019d heard of this issue before. Cao An himself had seen one of these plushies before when he was abroad.It was said that there were people from their country that ordered it online and sent it using air freight.But that sort of news never seemed to be of any relevance or relation to the Cao Family\u2026Until that very moment. It turned out a plushie-kon from their family had actually transported that huge bear from abroad back to their very home!\u201cWtf! What is this?\u201d Coincidentally, Cao Bin had just returned home, and was struck dumb when he entered the house to the sight before him.Xia Rou had already been with the Cao Family for more than a year. Whenever she saw Cao Bin, he had always been a charismatic gentleman with a courteous manner. She had never seen him use scolding words before.Wait, no, no! Even in her past life, she had never seen second brother use harsh or foul language before!To be able to make even the most sophisticated person in the Cao Family break character\u2026 Cao Xing! He was really something!\u201cI bought this for Xiao Rou. She\u2019s a girl, and should have more of these kinds of cute things!\u201d Cao Xing was still enveloped within the arms of the teddy bear, obviously reluctant to leave.We believe you\u2014\u2014 As if! Translated by The NovelstEver since Xia Rou came to be with them, Cao Xing had started to use her name to cry up wine and sell vinegar for a long time. For Xia Rou\u2019s sake, Cao Xiong had tried to turn a blind eye to this obvious edge ball*. But the brothers had never imagined his guts would expand even more to this frenzied state!He was absolutely trying to challenge their father\u2019s bottom line!Looking at this iron tower reveling in the feeling of the enormous teddy bear, the atmosphere became strangely silent.He hadn\u2019t been beaten enough when he was still young, thought Cao Yang.This guy still didn\u2019t know he was looking for death, thought Cao Bin.Although he hoped that third brother could keep his real personality, or at least not be as fake as big brother and second brother\u2026 this image here was definitely not what he had imagined, thought Cao An.Xia Rou\u2026 Xia Rou\u2019s mind was blank.\u201cJust now I was on the phone with father, he said\u2026 He would be returning for dinner.\u201dAs a father, Cao Xiong was definitely a model father. Although his sons were grown, as long as the four could gather together, Cao Xiong would push away all social obligations and rush back home to have dinner with his sons.And today was the day the Cao Family gathered.Cao Bin looked at his watch. \u201cI think we have probably another twenty minutes before he\u2019s home\u2026\u201dCao Xing was finally woken from his happy fantasy.\u201cXiao Rou, hurry and open your door, put it into your room!\u201d The big man immediately stood up, carrying the teddy bear on his back.Xia Rou woodenly went to open the door.The stairs of the Cao Family house were quite wide, and so were the corridors.Even the master bedroom had two doors, and they held both open so there was ample room for most activities.But when the teddy bear went to pass through the room, it still got stuck!In the end, Cao Xing went in to pull the bear\u2019s head while Cao An stayed outside to pus the teddy bear\u2019s butt. However, the reason Cao Xing had fallen in love with that thing was because it was\u2026 so soft.It is soft!It couldn\u2019t be forced!In the end, Cao Yang and Cao Bin couldn\u2019t bear to watch any longer, so they had no choice but to roll up their sleeves to help them out. Finally, the bear was stuffed into Xia Rou\u2019s room.It was the first time the four of them had gathered inside her room.Cao Yang had entered before, but it was Cao Bin\u2019s first time.After turning in a circle to look at the surroundings, he couldn\u2019t bear it and asked Cao Xing: \u201cHow much did you actually buy?!\u201dHer bedside, the foot of the bed, on the sides of her sofa, atop the windowsills and the cabinet\u2026 The plushies that Cao Xing bought all had one characteristic in common: they were all huge!\u201cWhere to put this? Where to put it?\u201d Cao Xing was spinning inside Xia Rou\u2019s room.Xia Rou\u2019s room was already large. Her bed was a king, and she had a sofa, a walk-in closet, and yet there was still a lot of space remaining.But once the huge bear was in the room, it felt like there wasn\u2019t enough space anymore.In the end, Cao Xing moved Xia Rou\u2019s fainting couch out of the way and placed the huge bear on the carpeted floor.\u201cSo perfect!\u201d He looked to the left, and to the right, and felt only satisfaction.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Xia Rou felt helpless. \u201cI\u2019ll get scared out of my sleep in the middle of the night!\u201dSince it was related to her ability to sleep, she didn\u2019t want to compromise. So she commanded Cao Xing, \u201cMove it over there.\u201dShe moved away the chair in front of the window and slightly moved the round table there. Then, she let Cao Xing put the bear where the chair had been.\u201cJust put it here. I can read my books here,\u201d she said.\u201cThat\u2019s right! So beautiful! Look, you can sunbathe, eat cakes and read books here!\u201d Cao Xing once again sank happily into the bear\u2019s arms.At this time, everyone heard the sound of a car entering the house.The head of the household, Cao Xiong, had returned.\u201cXiao Rou! Xiao Rou!\u201d Cao Xing stood suddenly. \u201cYou need to remember. If father finds out about this\u2026\u201d\u201cGot it\u2026\u201d replied Xia Rou weakly. \u201cI\u2019ll say I ordered it online myself\u2026\u201dBut, do you think your father would believe\u2026You think your father will believe it? Idiot! Translated by The NovelstMiraculously, the other three brothers were on the same wavelength as Xia Rou.

When the renovation had been completed, he had come in to take a look and didn\u2019t feel that anything was different.But not, looking at it again, something had already changed.It was really a girl\u2019s room. Translated by The NovelstBoudoir\u2026 Right, that was the feeling.Cao Yang suddenly thought that maybe he should have chosen a more girly wallpaper color for Xia Rou.Also, the design and the color of that sofa seemed a little old-fashioned.Xia Rou\u2019s skin was white as snow, her hair dark and silky as a waterfall. When she smiled, her eyes would crinkle into crescents.This kind of girl should be surrounded by soft, pure colors and flowers, right?Cao Yang couldn\u2019t help but feel regret for being so careless when he had instructed people to redecorate the room.It was just at that time he had no idea that he would come to like this girl so much, and neither had he expected to actually treat her as a real little sister.Ever since the banquet had been held in August, all the wealthy families in the city came to know that the Cao Family had a new female member.Although she had said herself that she was just living under their roof, their interest had been piqued. People would naturally ask around to obtain information about the relationship between her mother and Cao Xiong.And naturally, she was seen as Cao Xiong\u2019s illegitimate child.Even if she was just an illegitimate child, Cao Xiong had already brought her home and revealed her to the public, which meant that he had accepted her. This was why the wealthy families in the city took a proper look into her background.Some of the children of these very families were studying at Nan Hua, so their parents advised their children to become closer to Xia Rou.They heard back from their children that this girl was alright. Though she wasn\u2019t that smart, her grades were average but her personality was mild. She didn\u2019t become arrogant due to her change in status, nor did she cozy up to anyone; she knew not to offend people.She wasn\u2019t an ignorant child.Some of the parents had nodded their heads. In their families, they weren\u2019t afraid of their children\u2019s stupidity, but rather afraid of ignorance.She didn\u2019t have stray thoughts, and was very clear. That was good.This illegitimate child rumor spread far and wide. Cao Yang\u2019s uncle even purposely came over to visit the Cao Family.He didn\u2019t come to complain, but rather to take a look at Xia Rou. As it was their first meeting, he even gave Xia Rou a huge red envelope.It was a local tradition that elders who meet younger ones for the first time would hand over a red envelope. But usually the younger ones would be children.Xia Rou was already sixteen. She couldn\u2019t help but blush, not knowing whether to take it or not.\u201cJust take it, take it,\u201d said Cao Yang, smiling. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to thank Uncle?\u201dTo face Cao Yang\u2019s uncle, Madam Cao\u2019s younger brother, Xia Rou\u2019s identity made her a little awkward.Cao Yang used that word \u201cuncle\u201d and gave her an out, letting her address his uncle.She tactfully received the red envelope, politely thanking him, \u201cUncle.\u201d She noticed the hint in Cao Yang\u2019s gaze, immediately returning back to her room.\u201cQuite cute,\u201d said his uncle.Then he turned to ask his brother-in-law, \u201cReally not yours?\u201dHaving to face his brother-in-law, Cao Xiong was a little speechless.\u201cNo!\u201d he said, punching the bridge of his nose.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing even if she is. It\u2019s been so many years already,\u201d said Uncle.Just by her age, even if Xia Rou was really Cao Xiong\u2019s child, it was still after his sister had passed away. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem.To be honest, the way his brother-in-law had treated his sister and his nephews was already enough.That was why the relationship between the Xu Family and their son-in-law Cao Xiong was really good. In their work, the Xu and Cao Families always helped each other out.\u201cDo you have too much time on your hands?\u201d Cao Xiong was speechless before turning to ask this of his brother-in-law Xu Maosheng.Xu Maosheng tsked. \u201cWhen do you see me having free time? The education department is the most busy!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I just go to the capital for that meeting, and after that I went to each city to observe. And finally after all that I had the time to come and visit. Of course, that old man had already heard the news, so he let me come and take a look.\u201dThe Xu Family wasn\u2019t located in the same city, but rather in another province. But these families usually had branches that were knotted tightly together; they were quite well-informed of the latest information.He couldn\u2019t make it to the last Cao Family banquet to celebrate with Cao Yang because he had a meeting in the capital.But before that, when Cao Bain had asked him to help enroll Xia Rou in her new school, he\u2019d already known about her, but he hadn\u2019t put it to heart. But because the rumor had made its way to the old man, the old man had become a little curious and asked him about it.But because he was Cao Xiong\u2019s brother-in-law, nobody had brought this news to him. Although Xu Maosheng had been in the same city as the Cao Family, he was the last to hear this news.\u201cDon\u2019t think on it anymore,\u201d smiled Cao Yang, making tea for his uncle.\u201cWhen my father met Aunt Cheng, Xiao Rou was already 7 or 8 years old. Her surname is Xia; she had a father but he ran away with someone else,\u201d he explained.In reality, whether or not Xia Rou was Cao Xiong\u2019s illegitimate child, whether or not her father had run away were all small things, barely worth mentioning.Since the topic had changed to \u201crunning away,\u201d Xu Maosheng finally started in on the real reason he came.\u201cThat old man sent me to ask this: that Zhao person escaped. The position of governor is now empty. Vice Li has been handling matters temporarily, that\u2019s the situation as of right now. If Vice Li moves up, then there will be an empty position. Do you think big brother can take that position?\u201dSuddenly, the atmosphere of the room turned serious.There was a saying that prosperity and decline never last.Cao Xiong had started with nothing. That year the Xu Family\u2019s daughter had decided to marry down. In the course of his career, he had been promoted thanks to his wife\u2019s family.But now, when the political sphere had any movement, or the wind was blowing in an unknown direction, the Xu Family sought Cao Xiong\u2019s advice.Luckily, the relationship between the Xu and Cao Families were deep.Cao Xiong shook his head.Xu Maosheng couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed.\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d he asked.Cao Xiong flicked the butt of his cigarette and said with certainty, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it. Vice Li isn\u2019t going to move up. The higher-ups want to send someone in.\u201dXu Maosheng left in disappointment. Translated by The NovelstWhen his car left the gate, he saw Xia Rou in the courtyard through the window of his car.A pure, beautiful girl. She looked like she had a mild temperament.Looking at the daughter, he could imagine how her mother looked.Probably a woman that men would fall into.But to be able to raise his lover\u2019s child in his own house and claim her publicly\u2026It seemed like his brother-in-law had been very fond of this woman.But in the end, he hadn\u2019t even let her enter the house.Oh sister, your taste in men was quite excellent.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the upper echelons of the system, it wasn\u2019t rare to see someone fall from their horse. This kind of news she usually took a glance at and immediately switched the channel.In that period, society had become very quiet without any large gatherings. Until March of the second year. The dust had finally settled and the new leader had finally held his first banquet at his home.Once again, Xia Rou had a new dress. Cao An had even taken her to a jewelry shop to take a look.At her young age, any sort of cumbersome accessories not only made her look old, but also gaudy. Simplicity was the best option for her.In the end, she only bought a three-layered pearl bracelet. With its light lustre and elegant design, it suited her temperament very well.Cao An had wanted to buy her a few more, since there would be many more occasions like this in her future.But Xia Rou had politely declined. She knew her mother\u2019s accessory box was still kept at the bank in a safety deposit box.Cao Xiong had bought a lot of jewelry for Cheng Wan. Some were quite expensive, and others were simply because Cheng Wan had liked them. Cheng Wan had also preferred simple and plain accessories, like herself. She rarely attended this sort of formal occasion, so her accessories weren\u2019t cumbersome.Xia Rou could take some to use for herself. Translated by The NovelstAlthough she explained this all to Cao An, he still bought her a pearl clip to match her bracelet.\u201cThe Wang Family has just arrived to the city. It\u2019s their first time hosting a banquet, so everyone needs to be a bit more serious to give them some face,\u201d said Cao An.Wang was a very common surname. Of the prestigious families in the capital, there were a few families who shared the surname Wang.So when Cao An spoke, Xia Rou had no inclination of the fact that this Wang family was the Wang family.Until that very day in the Wang Family banquet hall, she saw Cao Yang and Wang Man talking and smiling, both raising their glasses for a toast. They looked like the perfect match, and Xia Rou finally realized that it was this time that they had gotten to know each other.Wang Man ah, her\u2026 ex-sister-in-law.\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Cao An grabbed her a non-alcoholic drink.He followed her gaze. \u201cYo! My brother\u2019s too good! Eh, no wonder he\u2019s my big brother!\u201dHe laughed merrily.\u201cThat is\u2026?\u201d Xia Rou asked deliberately, despite knowing the answer.\u201cWang Man. The daughter of the newly appointed province governor,\u201d gloated Cao An. \u201cThe Zhao Family and our family don\u2019t have girls. That Sun Miaolan from the Sun Family always flattered herself thinking of herself as the premiere lady in the capital. I guess now she can\u2019t even smile.\u201dHe continued to gossip, \u201cShe really is something. She has a masters degree from a school in the Ivy League and she only returned to the country last year. I met her a few times while abroad, since not many from our country are there, we had a gathering. She was popular, people are always after her, but she doesn\u2019t look at any of them. Her standards are quite high.\u201dXia Rou knew, of course, of Wang Man\u2019s arrogance.She also knew that Wang Man had the qualifications to be so arrogant.She was from a wealthy family and she was also very well-established in person. No matter how arrogant she was, it looked natural in the eyes of others.But this arrogant woman had no interest in anyone until she took a fancy to Cao Yang.That was because big brother was such an excellent man!Xia Rou felt inexplicably proud.Cao Yang lead Wang Man over to introduce them.\u201cThis is Cao An, my fourth brother,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019ve seen him before while I was abroad,\u201d Wang Man smiled, before turning her eyes to Xia Rou. \u201cThis is?\u201d\u201cXia Rou,\u201d Cao Yang brought his hand to pat her head out of habit, but he noticed she had her hair tied, so he patted very softly, \u201cOur girl.\u201dOur girl.This introduction was really vague.But toward that girl he seemed very close.It looked like the rumors were true, thought Wang Man. The Cao Family had an illegitimate child and Cao Xiong had claimed her. It looked like this was that girl.She smiled and said to Xia Rou, \u201cHello Xia Rou. I am Wang Man.\u201dIn the past, when Xia Rou first met her, she was already Cao Yang\u2019s official girlfriend.But from the very beginning, her attitude toward Xia Rou wasn\u2019t warm at all. It was mostly just politeness.Xia Rou also remembered that after she became her sister-in-law, when she was still living at the Cao Family, the way Wang Man looked at her was always very cold.That was why she had moved out. Translated by The NovelstShe believed that big brother\u2026 had also understood. Although he tried his best to stop her, none of them ever stated this matter aloud.Now, with this sudden kind and gentle attitude from Wang Man, Xia Rou was overwhelmed by the unexpected good feelings, but at the same time she was shocked.But soon she came to understand the reason behind Wang Man\u2019s actions.Because she smiled and said to Cao Yang, \u201cYour little sister is so cute.\u201dThat was right, she was just like the others who believed she was Cao Xiong\u2019s illegitimate child, and Cao Yang\u2019s biological little sister.In the past, Wang Man had already known upon their first meeting that she was just the child of Cao Xiong\u2019s lover who had passed. She was just staying under their roof, so she had no blood relationship with Cao Yang.Wang Man stayed to make small talk before excusing herself to go to other places. She was the host, and there were still many other guests for her to entertain. But Xia Rou could tell that Cao Yang and Wang Man had obviously just met. Both were still observing formalities.To see his own family\u2019s child being praised by others, even though that compliment was just borne of politeness, it still made him happy.Cao Yang also didn\u2019t feel that Wang Man was simply speaking out of politeness.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that she had taken it off, he saw she was wearing a light pink and blue dress. She had on a pearl bracelet to match the pearl hairpin in her hair.Cao An really lived up to his calling as a designer. He had given up on the usual pearly pink color and chosen light gray pearls for Xia Rou.If one were to look only at the pearls, it seemed much duller.However, when matched with Xia Rou\u2019s liveliness, it looked very elegant on her.Xia Rou had grown a little taller over the past year; her head almost reached Cao Yang\u2019s lower jaw.Her height was no different than that of an adult woman\u2019s.Her long hair was tied fluffily behind her head, a few strands curled to hang in front of her ears. Her dress cinched at the waist to reveal its small size.Cao Yang\u2019s gaze stopped on her for a moment.He realized she was looking down, appearing to be spacing out.This kid would sometimes be like this, suddenly spacing out.It wasn\u2019t a good habit. Translated by The Novelst\u201cXiao Rou!\u201d Cao Yang called her, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cAh? Oh\u2026\u201d Xia Rou recovered her senses. She paused a while and said, \u201cSister Wang Man graduated from an Ivy League\u2026 She\u2019s so excellent.\u201dCao Yang agreed, \u201cMm, she is.\u201dXia Rou glanced at him.Under the light reflected by the chandelier, he was wearing a suit that looked as good on him as his army uniform. He had a straight nose and thin lips.His confidence as a man was written all over his face.Xia Rou\u2019s gaze couldn\u2019t help but seek out Wang Man in the crowd, who stood out easily.She was having a conversation with some of the guests, entertaining them with ease.The confidence on her face seemed to match Cao Yang\u2019s.She studied at an Ivy League while abroad, and she graduated with her masters degree. That had no relation to her surname, nor the family she was born into. That was her ability alone.Her own ability, with her excellent family background and that beauty\u2026 At the banquet, Wang Man not only overwhelmed many of the other women, but also even some men couldn\u2019t compare.Cao Yang also followed Xia Rou\u2019s line of sight to see Wang Man.He stared at her for such a long time that Xia Rou took notice. In his gaze was frank admiration.She couldn\u2019t help but sigh softly within her heart.\u201cWasn\u2019t that Hu kid calling you?\u201d Cao An touched her.Xia Rou followed the direction Cao An jerked his chin at. Hu Xuan was indeed waving his hands at her.\u201cGo with him,\u201d Cao Yang nodded. \u201cThese people are familiar with Hu Xuan. Ask him to introduce them to you.\u201dAt this kind of gathering, people would group by age and identity; each had their own social circles.Like Cao Xiong, who had gone with Governor Wang and others of similar age and status to another hall.As for Cao Yang and Cao Bin, after they had greeted the elders, they began to chat with the other young adults.Even the half-grown children brought by their parents to show them around even had their own circles.Xia Rou walked to Hu Xuan\u2019s side.\u201cI even called you a couple times and you didn\u2019t even hear me,\u201d complained Hu Xuan.The two were quite familiar with one another now. Ever since he\u2019d been taught a lesson by Cao Yang, he knew that this girl from the Cao Family was not to be touched.This little kid had suddenly changed from a pervert to a polite guardian. At school, he took care of Xia Rou with all his heart.Xia Rou knew that he wasn\u2019t a good guy from the beginning, but she also knew that because of Cao Yang\u2019s protection, Hu Xuan could only act like a good guy in front of her.This was why she didn\u2019t fear him anymore.Hu Xuan brought her to his circle and began introductions.Within that circle, four were schoolmates that also attended Nan Hua, and one of those students was her classmate. Other than that, some she had met during the Cao Family banquet, and the others she had never met.Xia Rou greeted them politely. Translated by The NovelstShe represented the name of the Cao Family. Although they were all quite young, they had been trained since birth to know who could be offended and who they dared not offend. So their attitudes toward her were quite positive.Everyone was chatting and laughing. These half-grown children discussed light-hearted topics, all about eating, drinking, and playing around; complaining about their homework and teachers at school.If someone bounced a topic at her, Xia Rou would say a sentence or two so the conversation didn\u2019t stutter. Overall, she gave them a feeling of gentle quietness.But she was a girl, and a pretty one at that. The impression she made didn\u2019t seem so bad on her.After chatting for a while, the atmosphere slowly warmed up. Even though they\u2019d just met, they were able to act more familiarly with Xia Rou.So one of the girls from Xia Rou\u2019s school asked quickly: \u201cYou\u2019ve been with the Cao Family for so long, when are you changing your surname to Cao?\u201dThe circle of people all went silent, all turning to stare at her.In this class, even though they were all young, they all had different statuses.Xia Rou felt lucky to have rebirthed once; she had put down all her expectations and obsessions. If this was the her of the past, and she had entered this circle at this age, a question like that \u2013 one that seemed casual but was actually mixed with bad intentions \u2013 would already have been enough to bring her down.Luckily, her present self didn\u2019t have a care for those kinds of things any longer.She put down her glass and looked into the girl\u2019s eyes until the girl moved guiltily out of her sight. Xia Rou only said, \u201cMy biological father\u2019s surname is Xia. Uncle Cao kept me with the Cao Family, so I\u2019m very grateful to him, but there\u2019s no need for me to change my surname.\u201dEveryone present had different expressions on their faces.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Translated by The Novelst\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her. Her uncle is Yang Naicheng, not in the same circles as Uncle Cao. It\u2019s normal for her to have tried to start something with you,\u201d he comforted.If this guy didn\u2019t show his perverted side, then he actually seemed like quite a gentleman when trying to coax someone.Xia Rou had been blinded by his harmless, polite act in the past.Then she heard him ask again, \u201cYou\u2019re really not?\u201dXia Rou couldn\u2019t help but find him amusing. She nodded and said firmly, \u201cNope.\u201dHu Xuan was shocked for a moment, before lifting his brows, \u201cThen the Cao Family really treats you very well.\u201d Damn, even his arm had been dislocated!\u201cMn,\u201d she responded softly. \u201cThe people of the Cao Family are all very nice.\u201dUnder the lights, her brows seemed very light. When she was speaking of the Cao Family, her eyes seemed to gentle, the corner of her mouth lifting in a faint smile.Hu Xuan felt his heart beat faster all of a sudden.He pulled at his necktie and asked suddenly, \u201cXia Rou, consider being my girlfriend one more time.\u201dXia Rou was shocked by the sudden change in topic. Then she glared at him, \u201cYou want to get beaten up again?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious this time,\u201d Hu Xuan said, dead earnest.Was this a joke?So before, he was just being a playboy?Xia Rou was so infuriated she was tempted to laugh.She didn\u2019t respond but instead looked directly behind him.Hu Xuan found it odd. When he went to turn his head around, an arm suddenly came from behind to wrap lightly around his neck.\u201cAre you trying to joke with our Xiao Rou?\u201d Cao An grinned, his teeth bared. \u201cBut I just heard from your brother that you\u2019re planning to study abroad?\u201d\u201cT-T-T-That, it\u2019s still a few months from now?

Bro, release me, my suit\u2019s getting all wrinkled!\u201dCao An let out a tsk , releasing his hold on Hu Xuan. He pushed Hu Xuan\u2019s head and told Xia Rou, \u201cI had things to do and will leave first. You can find big brother when you want to leave later. I already let him know.\u201dXia Rou found it odd. \u201cIs it urgent?\u201dCao An took a glance at Hu Xuan\u2019s bitter expression before saying, \u201cOne of my friends is sick. I\u2019m going to go check up on him.\u201dXia Rou could tell that friend was obviously He Chengzhe.Cao An and He Chengzhe had been so on and off. In those brief off moments they had gone through quite a few girlfriends, but there was no one but He Chengzhe that would make him so concerned.\u201cAlright,\u201d said Xia Rou. \u201cSay hello for me.\u201dCao An nodded his head, patting Hu Xuan\u2019s head before he left.Hu Xuan grimaced in pain. \u201cWhich beauty is Brother An hooking up with this time?\u201dXia Rou was speechless. \u201cCan\u2019t you use a better word?\u201dHu Xuan responded, \u201cTsk! There are no other words. Of the Cao Family men, only Brother Cao Yang and Brother Cao Bin are serious. For Cao Xing and Cao An, I can only use the words hook up to explain.\u201dXia Rou rolled her eyes and didn\u2019t bother with him any longer.But she knew what he said was true.In this huge hall, the men dressed in western styles and with leather shoes were all from wealthy families. These kinds of men rarely had any romantic affairs.It was just that Cao Yang and Cao Bin weren\u2019t flirty playboys like Cao Xing and Cao An.In her past life, she had desired to remain in the wealthy circles and get married to that sort of man.Big brother had told her back then that those people and those things, she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle them. In the end, reality proved his words correct.That was why back then he had chosen a normal white-collar working man for her. Though he was from the normal class, he was still an excellent man.He had wanted her to have a simple, peaceful life, if she were to guess.But she hadn\u2019t wanted his good intentions back then.When the banquet came to an end, Xia Rou sat in Cao Yang\u2019s car to go back home.As for Cao Xiong and Cao Bin, she didn\u2019t know where they went, nor did she ask about it. They all had someone to entertain.If it wasn\u2019t that Cao An had thrown her to Cao Yang, Cao Yang would also probably be out being social.Xiao Yang drove the car.Cao Yang had had a few cups. He was sitting back with his eyes closed to rest.When he opened his eyes again, he could see Xia Rou\u2019s profile. The planes of her face were much more gentle. Even the pointy jaw she used to have was much more tender now.It was like she was beginning to develop the aspects of a woman.Again she was spacing out.\u201cXiao Rou,\u201d he called her.\u201cHm?\u201d Recovering her senses, she turned her head.Because she had needed to attend the banquet, she had put on some light makeup.Under the dim lights she didn\u2019t look so young any longer.Her lips were as delicate as flower petals.Such a feminine woman.It was probably because of the alcohol, but there was an instant that Cao Yang felt his heart speed up like a scampering monkey and his mind ran like a galloping horse.\u201cBig brother?\u201dThe girl\u2019s soft, gentle voice woke him from his daze. He recollected his thoughts quickly.\u201cHm?\u201d Translated by The Novelst\u201cDid you call me just now?\u201d\u201cI saw you spacing out again,\u201d he patted her head. \u201cYou\u2019re always doing that.\u201dXia Rou smiled in embarrassment before turning her head back to look out the window.She had been thinking about Wang Man ever since getting in the car.The marriage between her and Cao Yang had not ended well. In the end they had cut their ties.Xia Rou could see it all coming again and wanted to stop the marriage, but she also knew that this\u2026 wasn\u2019t something she could stand in the way of easily.The strong attraction between two outstanding people, and a strong alliance to tie two powerful families together. Standing before all that she, Xia Rou\u2026 seemed insignificant.She couldn\u2019t help but lower her head and sigh about her incompetence.Even though she had rebirthed, she was just as powerless as before.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Translated by The NovelstShe had the protection of the Cao Family. What could trouble her?No matter what, as long as he was here, there wouldn\u2019t be a problem, thought Cao Yang.He glanced at Xiao Yang driving before then and didn\u2019t bring it up, instead choosing to light a cigarette.Suddenly he remembered that all the men of the house were accustomed to smoking. They hadn\u2019t paid any mind to Xia Rou. She had never appeared to dislike that they lit up right beside her, like she had been used to it from the start.He took another look at her.Then he took a big draw from his cigarette.He felt that the sight of her long neck forming a snowy white curve when she bowed her head\u2026Was very beautiful.She hadn\u2019t yet grown up, but she had already began to turn into the kind of woman he liked. This made him feel a little strange.He really did take her as a little sister, but that didn\u2019t mean he could just turn away his manly instincts. As a man, there was a pull deep in his bones telling him to chase the woman.The combination of alcohol, a small space, and the dim lights were like a catalyst, trying to spark that instinct of his.The car stopped before the main building. They left the car from opposite sides.Xia Rou stretched her hands to push open the door, but Cao Yang was already one step ahead, stretching out his arms to open the door for her.Xia Rou then lowered her head and left under his arms.\u201cOuch,\u201d she said. Her hair was caught in his cufflink.\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Cao Yang quickly let go and left for the building.The door was closed. The lights in the house hadn\u2019t been turned on yet. Only the lamp on the wall was giving off a dim light. It was very quiet and it seemed like no one else had yet returned. It turned out that they were the first ones.Cao Yang held his lit cigarette in his mouth and moved closer to her. In the yellow light he slowly pulled each strand of hair out, one by one. Some were tangled too tightly and the lighting was so dim that it wasn\u2019t easy for him to untangle it all.The temperature was quite warm. After a while, Xia Rou\u2019s nose began to sweat, so she took off her coat.Cao Yang finally managed to get the last strand of her hair out of his cufflink. It was then that he began to detect a faint fragrance.Vague, vanishing, and appearing intermittently.Cao Yang was a little surprised.It wasn\u2019t the first time he had smelled this scent.But each time he had tried to search it out, the scent had disappeared without a trace.\u201cMy hair is all messed up,\u201d complained Xia Rou. One of her hands was holding her coat while her other hand sought the back of her head to take off a pearl clip.Slim arms. The snowy white color of her arms was the same as her long neck.This was the scent\u2026 of a maiden, huh\u2026 Cao Yang blew out a mouthful of smoke, finally enlightened.It was a scent that could only belong to a young girl as delicate as a flower petal\u2026The scampering monkey and galloping horse that had been blown away by the night wind came right back\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he said.He held the cigarette in his mouth once again and pulled her hand away from her hair.He helped her take off the pins in her hair, one by one.As the last pin was pulled out, her silky hair fell messily onto her shoulders.Cao Yang pushed his fingers into the roots of her hair, using some strength. Her hair was slowly smoothed out from its original position in a bun.The silky feeling that whispered through his fingers seemed to start a breeze in his heart, making him itch inside.Cao Yang\u2019s thumb grazed Xia Rou\u2019s ear, before he pushed his fingers once again into her hair.\u201cSo long already,\u201d he said.Time was indeed miraculous.It made her short hair grow until it reached her waist.It had also turned her from a little girl into a big lady.They had drawn quite close to one another.He knew very well that he was indulging in his drunkenness.Yet Xia Rou wasn\u2019t aware of this.\u201cI should cut it already,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too long now.\u201dJust as she finished her sentence, her scalp suddenly tightened.Cao Yang was pulling on her hair.\u201cI won\u2019t allow you to do that! You better keep it long for me!\u201d Cao Yang said with the cigarette between his lips, his eyes slanting toward her.So oppressive and gangster-like.If it was another woman, she might be awash with excitement.But Xia Rou\u2019s heart was calm as water.\u201cI need to cut it, though. I can\u2019t leave it until it reaches even my toes,\u201d she said, pulling at the tips of her hair, brows furrowing.It was too long. It was troublesome to wash and even dry.Cao Yang bit his cigarette when looking at her, not saying anything but only laughing.She was baffled. \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, blowing out smoke and continuing to laugh.Then he couldn\u2019t hold back and rubbed her head, \u201cLittle girl, ah\u2026\u201dXia Rou: \u201c\u2026?\u201d So out of nowhere! Translated by The NovelstCao Yang had confirmed it. This little girl really hadn\u2019t yet grown enough! Not because of her young age but because she was so, so clueless!He, the crown prince, had never played below his level before, ever since his early teenage years when he had begun to explore the flowers. As long as he had desired it, there wasn\u2019t a woman that he couldn\u2019t draw in.Not even considering that Xia Rou was already seventeen years old, even someone who was younger than her would go crazy for him.But when Xia Rou looked at him, she didn\u2019t have any thoughts at all of the implications between a man and a woman.But no matter what, he was not her real brother. The only explanation as to why she could ignore the signals he was giving off was probably because she \u201chadn\u2019t fully understood\u201d yet.Cao Yang felt that the night was quite funny.The him just now \u2013 he must have gone temporarily mad.He cleared his throat and asked, \u201cWhat happened today that made you unhappy?\u201dHe switched back from his manly mode to his brotherly mode.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had never developed a deep understanding toward men, those living beings.Most of all, in her heart of hearts, Cao Yang was her big brother.Not a man. Translated by The NovelstShe loved him and respected him, felt regret and guilty toward him, in both the past and present.In her eyes, Cao Yang was nearly omnipotent, almost perfect.Naturally, she ignored the word \u201calmost.\u201dIt was so natural to her that she couldn\u2019t imagine that her perfect big brother\u2026 was no different than any other man, to succumb to attraction.She was actually unhappy with her powerless self, for being unable to stop the building attraction between Cao Yang and Wang Man.If they had already met each other at this time in the past, then it was in two years, when she would be studying in her first year of college, that Wang Man would become her sister-in-law.No matter how you looked at it, they were a perfect couple. However, their relationship started to strain and collapse after only nearing four years.Xia Rou didn\u2019t know what had actually transpired between Cao Yang and Wang Man.But she knew that if it was something that neither of them were able to solve, then she probably shouldn\u2019t even try\u2026 Because it was useless for her to even try to help.Her way of conducting herself in public, her ability to handle matters \u2013 no matter if it was Cao Yang or Wang Man, either person were ten thousand miles beyond her abilities.Now that she thought of it, she felt so frustrated.\u201cYang Yuhan asked me when I will be changing my surname back to Cao,\u201d she said.The name didn\u2019t sound familiar, but Cao Yang thought hard and managed to pinpoint her origins: \u201cYang Naicheng\u2019s daughter?\u201d\u201cNiece.\u201dCao Yang paused at the foot of the stairs, sneering, \u201cDon\u2019t bother with her. That\u2019s not the first time the Yang have tried to pick on us.\u201dThen he continued, \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201dXia Rou stood two steps above him, turning around to shrug her shoulders. \u201cI said my father\u2019s surname is Xia, and that Uncle Cao allowed me to stay under his roof. Why would I change my surname?\u201d\u201cWait until school on Monday, the word will have spread,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201dCao Yang thought Xia Rou was unaware that having the status of \u201cCao Xiong\u2019s daughter,\u201d was probably the best for her to benefit from.In reality, the Cao Family brothers had already been asked quite a few times already about Xia Rou. But they all had the same thought and none revealed the answer. To outsiders, not declining outright was almost the same as admitting.Who would have thought the person to reveal the matter directly would be Xia Rou herself?But Cao Yang liked to see the open-minded side of Xia Rou.If she was someone to seek fame and fortune, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it to treat her well.The Cao Family wasn\u2019t a charity. It was due to Xia Rou\u2019s likeability that they wanted to treat her better.Xia Rou didn\u2019t know the thoughts running through Cao Yang\u2019s mind. If she did know, she would have been surprised.The winding roads of life were so unpredictable.\u201cGo to school and you\u2019ll see how their attitudes change. Then you will see what the human heart really is,\u201d said Cao Yang. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to learn this.\u201dThe human heart, huh\u2026 Xia Rou thought it was the hardest thing to grasp.\u201cI don\u2019t want to, it\u2019s too hard!\u201d She rejected the thought with confidence. \u201cI have you, anyways.\u201dShe smiled proudly and turned to run away.Cao Yang realized it was quite convenient for him to keep her hair long.For example, when he tugged her hair backwards, the wicked girl could only say, \u201couch, ouch!\u201d and stand still.\u201cLet go!\u201d huffed Xia Rou.\u201cRunning away, are you? Your feet are so fast. Keep running!\u201d Cao Yang held onto his cigarette and laughed.Xia Rou felt that Cao Yang was different than usual.Actually, she had already found him strange starting from when they had entered the house.He must have drunk too much!\u201cGo and sleep! Don\u2019t go overboard while you\u2019re drunk!\u201d She was struggling valiantly to rescue her hair from his grip.They scrambled over her hair all the way to her room.\u201cI\u2019m here now. Hurry and let go,\u201d she said, slapping softly at his hand.Cao Yang didn\u2019t let go, pulling backwards instead. Her head was pulled to the side from the force.\u201cYou and Hu Xuan are getting too close,\u201d he said.\u201cAh?\u201d Translated by The Novelst\u201cThat little brat isn\u2019t the white sheep he seems to be. Also, his family is planning to send him to study abroad. He\u2019s probably leaving in a few months. Don\u2019t be swayed.\u201dMost importantly, that bastard had a handsome face. If he acted like a gentleman, he could really sweep people off their feet. Especially women.Even if he was going overboard while he was drunk\u2026 He was still concerned about her, huh. Scared that she might be fooled\u2026Xia Rou\u2019s heart was filling with something soft.

Even the tone she spoke with was much gentler. \u201cNo worries, I won\u2019t get fooled by his appearance. You can count on that.\u201dCao Yang seemed to be dazed, so she seized her chance and pulled her hair back. \u201cHa!\u201d she said, quickly opening her room door and shutting it in his face.Bang. That was the sound of the door in his face.When Cao Yang came back to his senses he rubbed his lower jaw.He puffed on his cigarette and stared at the door before turning around to go upstairs.That was bad. That little girl had grown up way faster than he had imagined.She had always been sweet and soft, but he had never thought she could be so coquettish.It was bad timing this time. The next time\u2026 he had to have a proper talk with her.Don\u2019t ever use that coquettish look before other people! Don\u2019t use that kind of soft tone with others!She still didn\u2019t know that men were unable to stand being teased.When a girl was so pure and delicate, it became a kind of spell over a man.Cao Yang looked through the window to stare at the night sky outside. It seemed like there would be a full moon that night.It must be the moon that caused him to blur the lines between being a man and being a brother.But, just as Cao An had said, the brothers and Xia Rou should\u2026 keep a fair distance between them.Without a blood relationship, it was really troublesome.The news that Xia Rou wasn\u2019t Cao Xiong\u2019s daughter spread quickly.It had been confirmed by Xia Rou herself, so there was no need to suspect any falsehood.Cao Yang had told her to \u201ctake a good look.\u201d Even though she didn\u2019t want to, she in reality did have to take that look. The attitudes of the people around her all changed. Some drifted from her, and others drew closer. Some were jealous, and others ridiculing.The inconsistency in human affections could be seen vividly at school. And these were all half-grown kids, too.\u201cIt\u2019s just like that. The world is like this. You shouldn\u2019t think we\u2019re all bad,\u201d said Hu Xuan.Xia Rou felt that his words were wrong. Translated by The NovelstStepping down a class into the world of ordinary people was much simpler than having to consider family backgrounds and social status.At this class, the relationship between people didn\u2019t only have to take into consideration whether or not two individuals had a favorable impression of one another. It also had to look at their parents, their family, and future trends.It was too complex.Her brain wasn\u2019t enough to handle all that.She was only suitable to become a normal person.With her brain the way that it was, if she hadn\u2019t had anyone to protect her at this class, she would have been crushed into pieces, fed to the wolves.\u201cWhy are you so free?\u201d she asked Hu Xuan. \u201cAre the seniors all done with homework already?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not participating in the national exams. I\u2019m leaving soon.\u201d\u201c\u2026When are you leaving?\u201d\u201cProbably the end of April.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d\u201cHm? Huh, huh?\u201d Hu Xuan was happy. \u201cCan\u2019t bear to see me leave?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t bear to see him leave.But sometimes the relationship between people was weird.Xia Rou knew very well that if she was only \u201cXia Rou,\u201d then Hu Xuan would be a very dangerous existence to her.But since she was \u201cXia Rou from the Cao Family,\u201d afforded protection under Cao Yang\u2019s name, she could talk with Hu Xuan on equal footing. He didn\u2019t seem to be dangerous to her any longer.Over the last two years of their time in school, she and Hu Xuan had become close.After all, she had already lived twenty-five years of her life. Even if her brain wasn\u2019t quite up to par, she had already been a working adult. She wasn\u2019t really able to relate to the teenagers that surrounded her.Instead, she could converse with Hu Xuan.No matter whether or not she disliked him, she had to admit that Hu Xuan was indeed more mature than others of his age.After all, Hu Chen and Hu Xuan were brothers so excellent that even Cao Xiong had praised them before.The reason she still talked to Hu Xuan even though he had been that way before was because she knew she couldn\u2019t avoid him.As long as she remained in the Cao Family she couldn\u2019t avoid Hu Xuan.She wasn\u2019t totally clear on whether the relationship between the two families was based on interest or affection. But the Hu and Cao Families had maintained a good relationship for many years, up to her death.That level of relationship wouldn\u2019t be affected just because of her.That was why if she couldn\u2019t put the things that had happened before out of her mind, in the end it would only be her who ended up feeling awkward.\u201c\u2026Give me one reason why I wouldn\u2019t be able to bear seeing you leave,\u201d said Xia Rou.\u201cProbably because I\u2019m good-looking?\u201d Hu Xuan boasted without shame.\u201cPui!\u201d\u201cProbably because I\u2019m smart?\u201d\u201cHmmph.\u201d Translated by The NovelstXia Rou didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it, but she couldn\u2019t deny that.The first time she had seen Hu Xuan\u2019s name at the top of the grade rankings, her eyes had been blinded just looking at it.On the other hand, Hu Xuan smiled broadly.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had realized this early on.In the beginning, his feelings toward this girl was all based on his attraction.However, Hu Xuan wasn\u2019t ashamed of having inherited a strong need for the opposite sex from his paternal side. Instead, he felt that this kind of drive was the strongest motivation for a man to work hard for his future.Only when a person stood at a higher position and held power and wealth could he possess more resources for sex, right?The men in his family were all devoted to this target and worked hard toward it, and the results were brilliant.But what was so unlucky for him was that he hit a snag.As a result, he had to listen to Cao Yang\u2019s lecturing and had fallen so low as to become a babysitter\u2026 No, a bodyguard.Such a pleasant-looking girl and he could only look but not taste\u2026 But once he thought of Cao Yang, the fire in him was extinguished. That was right. Since Xia Rou had become \u201cXia Rou of the Cao Family,\u201d he could only continue being polite to her.If he continued and tried to lay his hands on her, he was seeking death.He wasn\u2019t that stupid. There were so many beautiful women in the world, he didn\u2019t want to give up the whole field for just one flower.Soon, he began to realize that Xia Rou wasn\u2019t that sharp. To be blunt, she was a little stupid, and slow to boot.This kind of girl was what he would call a flower vase. According to his brother, there were no other use for them other than to sleep with them.Moreover, this kind of girl would always cause trouble for men. Anything else aside from their presence in bed would annoy people.That was why he thought that looking after Xia Rou would be very tiresome, but in the end it turned out fine.Xia Rou was free from worry. Translated by The NovelstShe couldn\u2019t be considered smart, but she had a clear mind. She had no scheming thoughts that an adult woman might have, nor did she act unreasonably like a little girl.She was an amiable girl, thought Hu Xuan. He really couldn\u2019t find any other words to describe her. If this word had been used to describe a man, then Hu Xuan would have summarized instead with the word 'stupid.\u201d But to describe a girl, it seemed to be a pleasing quality.Slowly, Hu Xuan came to realize he liked to get along with Xia Rou. He had no worries about her; he didn\u2019t have to analyze her intentions and he could relax before her.The feeling was comfortable, especially for Hu Xuan as someone who had grown up with complicated people surrounding him.\u201cWhat are your plans for the future? Does the Cao Family have any plans for you? Have you spoken to them about it?\u201d asked Hu Xuan.Xia Rou was surprised. She was uncertain. \u201c\u2026No. I-I\u2026\u201dShe hesitated for a while before saying, \u201cI was thinking\u2026 after I get into university I can stay on the campus, then I can move out from Uncle Cao\u2019s house\u2026\u201dHu Xuan stared at her. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d\u201cAfter I graduate, I can look for a job. Then\u2026 just life my life.\u201dXia Rou thought she could find herself a job. If not, Cao Yang could use his connections to find her one, like he had in the past.Actually, she still had two shops in her name that had been given to Cheng Wan in the past by Cao Xiong. Just by collecting the rent it was already enough for her to live comfortable for the rest of her life.But she felt that since she had been given a chance to rebirth, even if she was unable to accomplish something great, she didn\u2019t want to just let life pass her by, either.Also, she had a desire in her heart to become a woman capable of taking care of herself, leaving aside anything the Cao Family could provide her with.Hu Xuan looked at this simple-minded girl, sighing slightly in his heart.He would be leaving soon for a few years. Even if he returned every year, he might not be able to meet her.He thought, no matter what, he should still leave her some advice.\u201cAh?\u201d said Xia Rou. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? If you want to say something just spit it out. Why do you want me to promise not to tell the Cao Family?\u201dHu Xuan thought \u2013 wasn\u2019t it freaking normal to promise? Normally he wouldn\u2019t even say anything that might affect him or cause him trouble.Wasn\u2019t it all for this stupid girl! Translated by The NovelstAt last, he managed to force a promise out of Xia Rou. Whatever he said to her must not be passed on to the Cao Family.He took a deep breath, looking at Xia Rou.

For the third time she had a completely lost expression on her face. \u201cWhat in the world are you saying?\u201dHu Xuan had been thinking about this for a while already.In the beginning, Cao Yang had appeared to be protecting her. At that time he hadn\u2019t been sure what the relationship between Xia Rou and the Cao Family was exactly. He had tried to probe with Xia Rou, but she was very cautious toward him so she had refused to tell him.After Cao Yang had returned, Xia Rou was displayed publicly at the Cao Family banquet, so the rumors of an illegitimate daughter had begun to circulate. He had believed \u201cthat was just how it was.\u201dIn the end, Xia Rou had personally told him that she wasn\u2019t an illegitimate child.Which meant that she and the brothers of the Cao Family had no blood relation at all?From that day on he had been thinking about this.The more he thought, the more he felt his heart burning and his lungs itching.But Xia Rou herself didn\u2019t seem to have noticed anything. It was true that she didn\u2019t normally speak with the guys anyway, but she was a blockhead! That stupid girl hadn\u2019t even realized!Hu Xuan felt that this situation between Xia Rou and him was like the saying: the emperor isn\u2019t worried, but his eunuchs are worried to death.Looking at the way Xia Rou was still unable to grasp the meaning, Hu Xuan didn\u2019t have any patience left.He looked at the sky in frustration, then lowering his head to look at her face.Stupid, absentminded. Just an idiot.But naturally she attracted men.He clenched his teeth, \u201cXia Rou, you\u2019re a beautiful girl. The Cao Family is just an entire house full of men. Men aren\u2019t good, don\u2019t trust them fully. You need to protect yourself, do you understand?\u201dXia Rou finally understood.She was so angry that her face flushed red!\u201cWhat nonsense are you on about!\u201d she started. \u201cThe people in the Cao Family aren\u2019t like you! Just because you would act that way yourself doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else would do the same!\u201dHah! He hadn\u2019t seem her talk like this normally but when she began to defend the Cao Family she had a quick tongue!Hu Xuan felt that his kind heart had been devoured by a dog.He smiled coldly, \u201cFine, make me the bad guy here. Your brothers in the Cao Family are all nothing but gentlemen.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he felt that he wasn\u2019t calm enough, so he took a deep breath to adjust his emotions. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to remind you that in the end you aren\u2019t related to them. That was why I\u2019m making the distinction between a man and a woman. You\u2019re a girl and you don\u2019t have any other relatives, so you need to be aware and protect yourself.\u201d\u201cI know you think of me as a pervert and Cao Yang as a gentleman. That\u2019s because you haven\u2019t heard of the Cao crown prince\u2019s nickname. That year, the crown prince fought with the vice governor\u2019s grandson over a woman. In the end, the grandson ended up with thirteen fractures. My brother saw this personally. I\u2019m telling you \u2013 at that time, your precious Brother Cao Yang was the same age as me \u2013 eighteen!\u201dXia Rou was shocked. Translated by The NovelstThis was something she\u2019d never heard before. From the first time she\u2019d met Cao Yang in the past, he had already become a calm, reliable big brother.Hu Xuan stared at the look on her face, finally feeling a little better in his heart. He let out a snort, \u201cThat time he was still young, so his means of going about those things were rough and simple. After growing up a little he stopped doing that kind of stuff. But I\u2019m telling you that anyone who went against Cao Yang that year, you won\u2019t be able to even find them in the city now.\u201dXia Rou knew that Cao Yang was a little ferocious, and she also knew he was quite impressive and that it made people afraid of him. But if she were to dig deeper, she wasn\u2019t actually that clear about the origins of it.Every time Liang Zihuan met Cao Yang, he would always be nervous and careful around him. This made her look down on him a little in her heart.Now, looking at how seriously Hu Xuan was explaining this to her, she felt that it might be true that Cao Yang was really a scary person.It was just that Cao Yang had never shown this fearsome side to her.\u201cNot is it only Cao Yang, but all four Cao brothers are not as good as they seem. You were protected by the Cao Family which was why the few of us can get along well. But if the ones who are protecting you get the wrong idea, then what will you do? Xia Rou, what can you do then?\u201d\u201cThose four wolves of the Cao Family, if any one of them forms bad intentions, do you think you could escape? In the end you\u2019d be eaten up completely!\u201d\u201cHey! Hey! Are you listening to me? Why are you spacing out?\u201dXia Rou returned to her senses. She pressed her lips into a flat line and said in a serious voice, \u201cNo\u2026 Nothing will happen.\u201dShe was shocked to hear about Cao Yang\u2019s past, which was why she had spaced out. But when she returned to her senses and heard Hu Xuan\u2019s shocking scenarios, she herself calmed down.Because she had already rebirthed, she had already gone through it all. What Hu Xuan was worrying about, and the scenarios he presented to her \u2013 had not happened in her past life.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The people of the Cao Family protected and valued the importance of \u2018family\u2019 more than outsiders would expect. Although her surname wasn\u2019t Cao, she had lived with them since she was fifteen. They thought of her as more than half Cao at this point.That was why none of them had any designs on her at all, and it was the same both ways.Because of this, she had never been conscious about their sexes when speaking to the brothers.She believed their relationships were as close as siblings, minus only the blood relation.Hu Xuan wanted to vomit blood. Translated by The Novelst\u201cYou! Y-You, you, you!\u201d He was so angry that he used his finger to poke Xia Rou\u2019s forehead.That poke hurt so much she had to take a deep breath and remove his finger. \u201cWhat! Speak properly!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re driving me crazy! Why can\u2019t you just believe me?\u201d Hu Xuan felt pain for his liver. \u201cXia Rou, I\u2019m warning you \u2013 ever since I was young I was taught by my grandfather that the first rule to follow is to be wise and play safe.\u201d\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t doing this for you, why would I dare say these things out loud? If Cao Yang hears about this he\u2019d probably kick me to death with just two kicks! If this isn\u2019t for you, do you think I would carelessly say these kinds of things to others?\u201d\u201cAiyo, my god, I\u2019m so pissed my heart is aching!\u201d Young master Hu began to clutch at his chest and scream in pain.Hu Xuan was a bad kid.Xia Rou knew this very clearly.But strangely, at that moment, she felt that\u2026 Hu Xuan was really worried for her.Just as he had said, these kinds of words would definitely offend Cao Yang. He was smart enough that he probably wouldn\u2019t have said it aloud.She couldn\u2019t define what she was feeling inside.\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t believe you. Hu Xuan\u2026\u201d At the end, she put both her hands into her pockets and looked him in the eye. \u201cThank you.\u201dHu Xuan finally felt the pressure on his heart ease up, before he heard Xia Rou continue, \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry. Those things that you\u2019re thinking of definitely will not happen.\u201dHu Xuan: \u201c\u2026\u201dJust let me spit out all my blood and die!Xia Rou, of course, was certain that the things Hu Xuan worried about would not come to pass. But the things that he was telling her about, she didn\u2019t just listen with one ear and let it out the other.She actually put those words to heart.She knew that Cao Yang and the others wouldn\u2019t look at her as a woman, but\u2026 what about others? People like Wang Man?She couldn\u2019t help but recall the cold gaze that her sister-in-law had leveled on her in the past.If she was to look from Wang Man\u2019s perspective, how would it seem?Then she began to think about the past chit-chat with her colleagues at work, when everyone was discussing men.\u201cI can\u2019t stand it! I definitely will never stand for it. I won\u2019t allow my boyfriend or husband to have a soulmate or childhood friend around!\u201d Some girl had spoken loudly and obtained the group\u2019s agreement.At that time she had also nodded along, since she hadn\u2019t seen herself in that situation.But if she were to place herself in that situation\u2026 what was she?From Wang Man\u2019s perspective, she was someone that lived in his house. What was worse that she troubled her husband from time to time, making him worry after her and clean up any messes she got herself into.If she was his real little sister, or even his little cousin, then it would still be alright.Of all the situations\u2026 Just as Hu Xuan had said, she was someone that had no blood relation at all with Cao Yang\u2026 A beautiful woman.Just thinking of it, she felt awful for Wang Man.How would Wang Man have felt during all that time?She was such an arrogant person, how would she have been able to stand it?Xia Rou tossed and turned all night, unable to fall asleep.Her mind kept going over and over it.What if Wang Man was unable to stand it any longer, what would she do?\u201cIf it was me, I would definitely chase that soulmate or childhood friend off!\u201d That would be her colleague\u2019s response.That was right. Everyone present had agreed that the soulmate, the unlikeable existence, must be eliminated!Then would Wang Man request that her big brother keep a distance from her? Or would she make her leave the Cao Family?And if she really asked that of him, then big brother, he\u2026Xia Rou was in pain just thinking about it. There were no \u2018ifs.\u2019 Even if Wang Man had asked him that, big brother would never have promised her!Because in the end, the result was that big brother had divorced her. He didn\u2019t push Xia Rou away, nor did he stop caring for her!So in the end, the reason that big brother and Wang Man\u2019s marriage didn\u2019t work out was because\u2026 of her?Xia Rou felt like she was choking on the realization.Cao Yang and Wang Man \u2013 they were the perfect couple.They excelled at life, had the same confidence and arrogance.They attracted each other and chose the other to be their lifelong companion \u2013 this was entirely reasonable!Looking at the entire city, she couldn\u2019t see anyone else as perfect a fit as them.Cao Yang and Wang Man should have lived a life that others envied.In the end they had parted ways, like the shrike and the shallow flying in different directions!Was it her fault?It was she who had clung to Cao Yang.It was she who had obstructed Wang Man.Before, she had looked down on Cheng Wan.But it wasn\u2019t that Cheng Wan was unable to obtain the title of being Cao Xiong\u2019s wife. The reality was that she had never intruded on a marriage.At the time she had met Cao Xiong, he had been a widow for seven or eight years then.But what about Xia Rou?What did she look like, back then?She was living in someone else\u2019s home, relying on someone else\u2019s husband.She was at ease back then, thinking it all natural.Even after she had moved out of that house, she\u2019d felt aggrieved inside.She felt that Wang Man was being unfair to her.

She glanced at Cao An.Regarding his on-and-off relationship with He Chengzhe, she had always sided with Cao An. Despite this, she would at times feel sorry for He Chengzhe because of Cao An\u2019s behavior.But now, as she tried to look at it from He Chengzhe\u2019s point of view, a chill ran down her spine.He Chengzhe \u2013 though he was excellent in person, in the end he was from an ordinary background. When compared to the fourth young master of Commander Cao\u2019s Family, the gap in their identities couldn\u2019t be overcome.Because of this gap, for ten years Cao An would go through lovers like a revolving door. Men and women, depending on his mood.He Chengzhe he could not date, nor could he marry.Everything would be destroyed by Cao An.In that ten years, disregarding gender, couldn\u2019t he have found someone that he truly loved?What about the woman he had almost married?Xia Rou changed her perspective. She could finally understand all the pain and suffering He Chengzhe had gone through, as well as\u2026 the frightening Cao An.But he was still her closest confidante, the intimate fourth brother. They had no secrets from one another.She looked at the empty chair at the dining table.Cao Xing had always been fickle. Even when she died, he still hadn\u2019t gotten married, saying he hadn\u2019t played enough.She did hear a few times that a pregnant woman came by the house to look for him. Cao Xing spoke only once to her: \u201cGive birth to the baby first, then do a DNA test. If the baby is mine, I\u2019ll raise it.\u201dHe would only raise the child. He never promised to give any status to the woman. If the mother didn\u2019t have a title, that meant the child could only be called an illegitimate child.After that, the woman disappeared. Whether she gave birth to the child or not, Xia Rou didn\u2019t know. If a woman met a man like this, she could only grind her teeth and swallow back blood.But this was the third brother that had decorated her room full of plushies, took her along to ski, and even trained with her to bring her along to extreme sports.Her sight moved to another vacant chair. Translated by The NovelstSecond brother Cao Bin\u2026 He was still alright.But of course, Xia Rou\u2019s relationship with Cao Bin was the most distant among the four brothers. He was the most unfamiliar to her. His face would always crease in a smile, making people unable to see through him.But he had a properly matched marriage and wedded a smart wife. After their nuptials, the two moved out of the old house into Cao Bin\u2019s place in the government compound.He probably had aspirations for his official career, which was why he cherished his feathers. His marriage was much more traditional compared to Cao Xing and Cao An.Finally, she couldn\u2019t help but look at Cao Yang.Cao Yang had already noticed her looking like a panda, realizing she was spacing out again early in the morning. He looked at her, his brows creased.Xia Rou\u2019s gaze turned to him. When she saw the familiar \u201c\u5ddd\u201d between his brows, she fell into a trance, seeming to have returned to her past life\u2026His face had always stiffened, his brows furrowing, when he looked at her.Whenever she looked at his expression, she would be afraid, but also continue to look, since\u2026 her heart felt much more at ease on his face.Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhy was she staring at him and spacing out?\u201cHey!\u201d He stretched out a hand and waved it before her face. \u201cWhy are you spacing out?\u201dXia Rou returned to her senses: \u201cHm, big brother?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your eyes?\u201d Cao Yang asked. \u201cYou weren\u2019t able to sleep?\u201d\u201cInsomnia hit me last night\u2026\u201dInsomnia at such a young age\u2026The three men at the table shifted their gazes.Xia Rou felt a chill on her scalp, quickly lowering her head to drink her porridge.\u201cJust now you were looking at me and spacing out. What are you thinking?\u201d Cao Yang asked once again.Xia Rou cupped her hands around her bowl and glanced at him.Just like a squirrel, Cao Yang thought.Xia Rou hesitated for a bit before asking, \u201cBig brother, do you have a girlfriend yet?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d replied Cao Yang without hesitation. \u201cWhy are you suddenly asking about this?\u201dXia Rou tore at her pancake, seeming hesitant. \u201cNo\u2026 I just thought that\u2026 You\u2019re already so old, why aren\u2019t you married yet\u2026\u201dYou\u2019re already so old\u2026Already so old\u2026So old\u2026It was like a lightning bolt had struck Cao Yang\u2019s head.Cao An made a \u201cPu!\u201d sound and spewed out a mouthful of soy milk! Then he began thumping the table, unable to stop laughing.Even the corner of Cao Xiong\u2019s mouth was twitching.Cao Yang bared his teeth in a smile: \u201cXiao Rou you \u2013 you think big brother is old already, huh?\u201dThat was nonsense! He was barely 31! As a man, his physiology and mental state was at his peak!The sudden pressure made Xia Rou start to sweat. \u201cN-Nothing, I just said\u2026\u201dIt was rare to see her be smart for once: \u201cAh! I have an English test today! I-I gotta leave first! Bye-bye Uncle! Bye-bye Fourth brother!\u201dShe didn\u2019t even have the courage to say bye to Cao Yang. She grabbed her bag and quickly ran away.Silly girl!Cao Yang hmphed. He felt so stifled he wasn\u2019t in the mood to continue his meal.\u201cBig brother!\u201d Cao An looked at him seriously. \u201cYou\u2019re so old already, why haven\u2019t you married yet oh my god pwahahahah!\u201dHe laughed, bending over the table in his mirth.Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis kid must be looking to be beat again! Translated by The Novelst\u201cLater, if your brother beats you, don\u2019t wail like a ghost,\u201d said Cao Xiong.Cao An wasn\u2019t stupid. As soon as he saw his big brother\u2019s face black as coal, he quickly adapted like Xia Rou and ran away.At the dining table, only his father and big brother remained.\u201cWhat Xiao Rou said isn\u2019t wrong,\u201d said Cao Xiong, looking at his eldest son.He was his pride and joy, the son that resembled him the most.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were no exceptions to this, even for the Cao Family.\u201cDon\u2019t listen to that silly girl. I\u2019m only thirty-one!\u201d Cao Yang was helpless.Cao Xiong made a noise of disapproval. \u201cWhen I was thirty-one, your fourth brother was already born. Where\u2019s my grandson, huh?\u201d\u201cBut times were different then,\u201d Cao Yang peeled a salted egg for his father. \u201cLook around \u2013 nowadays, not just men in their thirties but even women in their thirties haven\u2019t yet married. It\u2019s normal now.\u201d\u201cAlso, even if you want me to get married, I need to find a suitable partner first, right?\u201dCao Xiong thumped his fingers against the table gently. \u201cYour Uncle Li and Uncle Zhao\u2019s daughters were all quite fine.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d replied Cao Yang. Translated by The NovelstTheir social circle wasn\u2019t that large and there were limited families to choose from. Cao Xiong thought deeply and said, \u201cThat Wang Man \u2013 she\u2019s not bad.\u201d\u201cIndeed, she\u2019s quite excellent,\u201d Cao Yang praised her.But that was just one sentence.He didn\u2019t actually have the thought to get married and settle down just yet. And most importantly, he hadn\u2019t yet met a woman that had moved him toward marriage.\u201cDon\u2019t be so picky,\u201d said Cao Xiong, dissatisfied. \u201cWhat kind of person are you looking for? Tell me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d rejected Cao Yang.\u201cWhat kind of house do you want? You should think about it. At your age, you should already have been thinking about it,\u201d was Cao Xiong\u2019s response.What kind of house did he want?Wasn\u2019t he already in his own house?Cao Yang still didn\u2019t have any thoughts about settling down. But as Cao Xiong reminded him, his mind unconsciously conjured up an image\u2026Sunlight shimmering through a French Window, a quiet woman reading a book until she saw him return. She happily put down her book and ran into his arms. Her face wasn\u2019t clear in the bright sunlight, but she felt slim and soft in his arms\u2026This image appeared in his mind for just a moment before disappearing.After that he was reminded again that Xia Rou, that brat, didn\u2019t have any awareness of being a woman in front of him.Don\u2019t say that\u2026 was it because\u2026 in her heart, he was already an old man?Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d Translated by The NovelstThat was impossible, right?In the end that made him feel so bad he couldn\u2019t finish his breakfast.The day after that, he didn\u2019t return home, instead going to stay the night with one of his female companions. Out of nowhere, he asked, \u201cAm I old, already?\u201dThe woman traced his abs and pouted prettily. \u201cIf you\u2019re old, then what are the other men?\u201dThen she tangled with him like a water snake\u2026That reply made the crown prince feel satisfied. He enjoyed his restless night, tiring her out until she was unable to even lift her fingers.There \u2013 he really hadn\u2019t gotten old yet!Just because that little girl was young didn\u2019t mean he was old! He thought hatefully.Xia Rou was sneaking around, watching to see if Cao Yang had an official date with anyone.She didn\u2019t dare ask him directly, but she couldn\u2019t see any trace of it. The little intelligent she had compared to Cao Yang \u2013 it was better not to utilize it to dig a hole for herself.After that, she was unable to stand it any longer and asked Cao An.\u201cBig brother? I\u2019ve never heard of him dating someone seriously before,\u201d said Cao an. \u201cWell, he has women, but I\u2019ve never heard of a girlfriend.\u201dXia Rou covered her ears and refused to listen. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me those kinds of things!\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to know about Cao Yang\u2019s affairs at all.Ever since she\u2019d spoken with Hu Xuan, she realized that spanning her past to her life today, she actually\u2026 had never really understood Cao Yang fully.She had only seen what was before her eyes.Brother \u2013 that was the tag he had above his head, that defined his existence to her.Because of her respect and guilt toward him, this word had been plated with a layer of gold in her heart. It was infinitely beautified by her rose-tinted glasses.But Hu Xuan had forcefully torn off that layer of gold by painting a completely different picture \u2013 a different perspective to look at Cao Yang.This made her feel that Cao Yang was pulled from his original position on a pedestal.Before Hu Xuan left, he told her things in snippets. Each time she learned more about Cao Yang, she felt that Cao Yang moved further and further from the big brother she had remembered.She was scared.She was scared that if this continued she wouldn\u2019t be able to find her big brother from the past.That big brother had always been very serious, stiffening his expressions to frown and scold her. However, he would always have her in his heart and worry about her constantly.This made her feel that she had almost lost him, and what remained was\u2026 another Cao Yang that felt unfamiliar to her.\u201cWhat is there that can\u2019t be said?\u201d Cao An tsked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be eighteen next year, turning into an adult now! There are things that you need to start learning now or you\u2019ll be deceived by men in the future.\u201dHe thought for a bit, before saying, \u201cNo worries. If there\u2019s a man who dares to deceive you, we brothers will definitely make him suffer to death!\u201dThen, revisiting the thought, he said in a worries tone, \u201cOi, oi! But don\u2019t be stupid and be willingly deceived by men just because of what I said just now!\u201dIn the end, the conversation had turned to be, don\u2019t start dating before the national exam, you need to study hard and make progress every day\u2026After that, he turned to Cao Yang and exclaimed, \u201cThis little lady has grown up, so worrisome. I wanted her to be pure and innocent, but now I\u2019m worried that she\u2019ll be deceived by men.\u201d\u201cOh, right. She doesn\u2019t want to hear about your life. As long as she doesn\u2019t listen, you\u2019ll still remain a saint that doesn\u2019t poop or fart, with no shortcomings or mistakes, and no desires!

But looking at all the effort she put into studying, they were still quite happy for her.On the weekends, Cao Yang would bring her along to attend dance parties for stress relief.At one of those parties, she met Wang Man for the second time. Although Cao Yang and Wang Man seemed very polite with each other, they didn\u2019t seem to be that much closer or familiar with one another like they had been in her past. They still looked like strangers and didn\u2019t have much contact in private.Actually, she wasn\u2019t sure how Cao Yang and Wang Man had gotten along before they had gotten married before. The first time she met Wang Man last time was when Cao Yang had officially brought her back to introduce her to Cao Xiong.At that time, Wang Man was already Cao Yang\u2019s girlfriend.After that, they were engaged. Seven months later, they held the wedding ceremony, and Wang Man became Cao Yang\u2019s wife, and her sister-in-law.Cao Yang noticed that Xia Rou had drifted off into thought again, her absent gaze following Wang Man\u2019s figure. This habit of hers didn\u2019t seem to have been fixed just yet.But she had always seemed to have a particular interest in Wang Man. She had even inquired about her to Cao An.\u201cWhy are you so interested in her?\u201d he asked.Xia Rou\u2019s heart thumped. She thought for a little and said, \u201cShe\u2019s my idol.\u201d\u201cIdol?\u201d Cao Yang found it amusing. Translated by The Novelst\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about whether I\u2019ll be able to get into a university,\u201d Xia Rou sighed. \u201cBut Wang Man has a degree from an Ivy League.\u201dOriginally, she was going to blunder through her response, but as she continued speaking, she really thought of herself in the situation.Except for Wang Man\u2019s attitude toward her, every aspect of her could really be seen as an idol.Cao Yang had realized that Xia Rou felt inferior to smart people. She especially longed for those with brains.She had actually been very hardworking in regards to her studies. According to Cao An, she seemed to be afraid they might dislike her because of her grades.Cao Yang felt that it was all just Xia Rou\u2019s overactive adolescent imagination at work.They had seen quite a few girls that weren\u2019t the brightest.Some of them were finicky, others unreasonable, and yet more arrogant. A few were just stupid, insensible and unable to read the atmosphere. All these annoying traits were mostly due to a lack of intelligence.Xia Rou might not be the smartest, but she didn\u2019t seem to have any of these shortcomings.She did have a very precious virtue for someone who wasn\u2019t that smart, and that was self-awareness.She knew her shortcomings, and knew to ask for help, seek their advice, and be obedient to their arrangements.This kind of person: even if she couldn\u2019t get the job done well, at least she wouldn\u2019t create any additional trouble.The most hated type of person by smart people weren\u2019t stupid people, but those who were stupid without any self-awareness, wanting to show off how clever and knowledgeable they were.Luckily, Xia Rou wasn\u2019t this type of person.And due to this both father and son had taken a liking to Xia Rou.In their family, the toughest nut to crack was probably second brother. But even he spoke of her, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s a good child.\u201dActually, she didn\u2019t have to work so hard.The Cao Family was behind her. Her future was already guaranteed.But looking at how hardworking and serious she was, who wouldn\u2019t like a girl like that? Who would want to stand in the way of a child who enjoyed making progress on their own? Thus, they naturally encouraged her more.Looking at the way she furrowed her brows and pursed her lips and the sad look on her face when her intelligence was overwhelmed, Cao Yang sighed lightly in his heart.This was a silly girl; a good girl.He stubbed out his cigarette, softly tapping her forehead to say, \u201cLet\u2019s go for a dance.\u201dXia Rou had practiced hard to perfect this dance in the past, because Cao Yang would bring her to this sort of occasion.Just as she started dancing, Cao Yang praised her, \u201cYour dancing isn\u2019t bad.\u201dShe chuckled.At such a close distance, Cao Yang could clearly see her skin was like a freshly peeled egg, white and delicate.Dark pupils, and clear eyes.And Cao Yang\u2019s favorite: her pinkish, petal-like lips.He raised his head and let out a slight breath.He couldn\u2019t help but grip tightly at Xia Rou\u2019s waist.Just as he thought, her waist wasn\u2019t even enough to fill his grip.The occasion was wrong \u2013 the person was also wrong. If it had been another woman who had such a slim waist, Cao Yang would definitely have taken a measure of it.But this was Xia Rou\u2026Too bad. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou only knew Cao Yang was a long-hair-con. But what she didn\u2019t know was that everyone in the circle knew that the Cao crown prince\u2026 loved a slim waist.She didn\u2019t have any idea about the slight changes to Cao Yang\u2019s hormones.She was still too na\u00efve.Her recognition of men all came from Liang Ziheng.Her fianc\u00e9 could be said to be handsome with a could figure.At that age, he naturally had physiological needs.Xia Rou\u2019s concern for a long while was how exactly to reject Liang Ziheng\u2019s demands.It was her choice to get married. That year they got engaged, she was 23. He had promised to marry her when she was 25.In those two years, Liang Ziheng had demanded to be with her quite a few times, but Xia Rou had rejected him. She insisted on staying pure until marriage.She had been disgusted by an experience with the opposite gender during her high school years. However, to confront that fianc\u00e9 she had obtained with all her strength and had even defied her big brother for, she had no choice but to forbear and compromise.That problem of hers had decreased a little with the help of Liang Ziheng; he made it so she could at least stand being kissed and touched.But it was still in no way a happy experience for Xia Rou.Since she lived alone, she didn\u2019t allow Liang Ziheng to visit her. She would also avoid going to his apartment to look for him, even though he had already given her a key.She would try her best to avoid being alone with him as much as possible, in order to escape from doing intimate things that a couple would do.The strange thing was that though all the members of the Cao Family were men, she had never really recognized that they were \u201cmen.\u201d To her, after Cheng Wan had passed, the people of the Cao Family had filled up the familial void, so Xia Rou had never been conscious of any gender difference between them.In the Cao Family, Cao Yang and Cao An were the closest to her. They would sometimes place their hands on her shoulder, or even on her waist. But these actions never made her conscious of gender. That was why they were never even near her radar.That same mindset accompanied her to this new life. But she didn\u2019t notice that something had changed now, as opposed to her past life.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Translated by The NovelstBefore her, Cao Yang didn\u2019t have to put on a mature adult act, nor did he need to keep his distance from her. He was very relaxed before her.So in this situation, before either of them had noticed, she had already subconsciously become much more close with him than her previous life.As for Xia Rou, she had been taking care of Cao Yang as her big brother from her past who would furrow his brows every time he looked at her.She had never seen him as a man.He had always only been her family. The most, most important, inseparable, family that would destroy her to lose.But that was Cao Yang of her previous life \u2013 not the Cao Yang of her current life.This point was something that Cao Yang didn\u2019t know, while Xia Rou couldn\u2019t yet comprehend.\u201cDon\u2019t turn around. I\u2019m telling you\u2026\u201d Xia Rou tiptoed all of a sudden and whispered in his ear, \u201cWang Man\u2026 She\u2019s glanced over here a few times already.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d Cao Yang wasn\u2019t paying any attention.Her hot breath swept by his ear, a fragrance floating to his nose.When she tiptoed, her soft breasts even pressed against his chest.\u2026Who cared about Wang Man being a snob.\u201cEh, did you hear me?\u201d Xia Rou was so anxious she pinched his shoulders.\u201cYes, I heard. So what?\u201d Cao Yang said helplessly. He felt that this little girl\u2026 wasn\u2019t on the same frequency as him.\u201cWang Man was peeking at you!\u201d Xia Rou\u2019s eyes sparkled like stars.\u201cAnd so what?\u201d Cao Yang was speechless.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you putting it into your heart!\u201d It was really like the emperor was not worried, but his eunuch Xia was worried to death. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Wang Man is super arrogant. There were so many people who tried to chase after her, but she just wasn\u2019t interested in any of them!\u201d\u201cMm, so?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s interested in you!\u201d Her eyes twinkled brightly.Cao Yang found it funny. \u201cWhat are you so proud of?\u201d\u201cWang Man is so arrogant. She doesn\u2019t look up to anyone but my brother! Why can\u2019t I be proud?\u201d Xia Rou\u2019s nose was stuck in the air.My brother\u2026Cao Yang raised his head to look at the ceiling, letting out a slow breath.He released his hands just slightly and pulled away from Xia Rou\u2026But Xia Rou was relentless, drawing even closer to him: \u201cLater, you should go and invite her to dance!\u201dCao Yang replied with a \u201cmm,\u201d without expressing his opinion.The song ended, and before Xia Rou could urge Cao Yang to invite Wang Man to dance, she herself approached him.\u201cCao Yang,\u201d she said, poised. \u201cDo me a favor and dance with me?\u201d\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d he smiled, holding her hand.The playful, naughty side of him that came out with Xia Rou was immediately tucked away.When facing Wang Man, not even a second was necessary for him to change to mature mode.Xia Rou was struck dumb.T-That was also a sort of skill, huh.Cao An could also switch so freely.Even Hu Xuan could change smoothly from a perverted ghost to a polite gentleman, and it was as natural as breathing.Xia Rou was amazed. Translated by The NovelstShe mumbled a few words to herself, feeling relieved as she watched the two dance together harmoniously.It was hard to reject the attraction between two outstanding people, right? Just like those two.She had decided that since her junior year was almost over \u2013 she had just one more year! All she had to do was study hard in senior year and get into a nice university. At the very least she didn\u2019t want to repeat the events of the past, when she got into a third-tier university in the city. Cao Yang hadn\u2019t let her stay in the hostel and asked her to commute instead.So when she entered her first year, that would be when Wang Man would marry into the Cao Family, and Xia Rou as the annoying white lotus would not be around any longer.She wouldn\u2019t affect their relationship!Without her wrapped around his leg to hold him back, both Cao Yang and Wang Man were both intelligent and had high EQ. They should be able to live a happy, fulfilled life, right?As Xia Rou thought further, her eyes slowly turned red\u2026Luckily, there wasn\u2019t anyone paying attention to her. She tried to hold back her tears, going to the buffet and grabbing a non-alcoholic drink.Then she heard someone call her, \u201cEh, aren\u2019t you Xia Rou? Who are you here with?\u201dXia Rou turned her head. The man speaking to her was twenty-five or six, looking very refined like a courteous gentleman.I\u2019m telling you that you\u2019re very beautiful and that you\u2019re not even related to them. If you were to stay in our house, I\u2019m not trying to scare you when I say that you\u2019d be eaten right up within three days by either my brother or myself. It would simply be a matter of who gets there first.Hu Xuan\u2019s words echoed in her mind.Whenever Xia Rou encountered such a person who spoke and acted in such different ways, and she couldn\u2019t see through them, she would feel scared. She could sense her scalp begin to numb as she addressed him: \u201cBrother Hu Chen.\u201dHu Chen smiled in response, asking, \u201cWho\u2019d you come with? Cao An?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m here with big brother.\u201d\u201cBrother Yang is here? Nani! I\u2019m going to greet him.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Xia Rou pulled at his sleeves. \u201cHe\u2019s dancing now.\u201dIt was easy for Hu Chen to spot Cao Yang and Wang Man.Yo, it was Wang Man!He immediately understood what was going on, smiling, \u201cI get it. I\u2019m not going to get in the way. I\u2019ll leave first then.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he walked back to his own circle.Xia Rou\u2019s shoulders relaxed.Before Hu Xuan left, he had given her a heads-up.The people of that circle, the image they portrayed before people and their actual behavior, he had briefly described it all for her. That day, she had been instilled with a huge amount of negative energy.It made her feel creeped out now that she saw those people.She drank some juice to suppress her emotional reaction.Xia Rou took another careless glance in Hu Chen\u2019s direction.A handsome young man in the group had turned around, facing Xia Rou\u2019s direction.Under the bright lights illuminating his face, she could clearly make out his face.Xia Rou suddenly felt the blood in her veins freeze like ice.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He immediately noticed that Xia Rou didn\u2019t look okay.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He frowned.\u201cI\u2019m a little dizzy,\u201d Xia Rou said lowly. \u201cI want to go back first.\u201d\u201cAre you alright? If not, let\u2019s go to the hospital.\u201d\u201cNo need, I might\u2026 I think my blood sugar is a little low. I just need some rest.\u201dCao Yang then took out his phone and called Xiao Yang to drive the car to the entrance.He sent Xia Rou to the car. \u201cGo back and sleep early, don\u2019t stay up too late.\u201dXia Rou nodded. \u201cYou too, come back early.\u201d Translated by The NovelstCao Yang replied: \u201cI have friends here so I might not return tonight.\u201d\u201cOh, then\u2026 don\u2019t drink too much.\u201d\u201cGot it, got it, housekeeper.\u201d Looking at the color in her face improving already, Cao Yang began to tell jokes.\u201cIf you drink too much, you\u2019ll get drunk and act crazy again,\u201d Xia Rou mumbled to herself.In the past, big brother had never acted drunk or crazy in front of her before. In this life, she didn\u2019t understand what had happened but she felt that his image turned out to be a little different\u2026She was already nagging at her young age, already like an old lady.Cao Yang stuffed her head into the car, waving his hand in annoyance.The car drove away.As the party ended, Cao Yang hitched a ride home with a buddy.\u201cWhere\u2019s your car?\u201d he asked.\u201cDrove my little sister back home already.\u201d\u201cYour little sister?\u201d His friend didn\u2019t react quickly enough.\u201cNo matter if she\u2019s related to me by blood or not, she\u2019s still my little sister.\u201d\u201cThat child\u2026\u201d The other man took a puff of his cigarette, his eyes squinting. \u201cHer waist is so small\u2026\u201dHis tone was playful.Cao Yang glanced at him lightly, a hint of warning in his gaze.The buddy turned his head around, and sensibly enough did not continue that line of questioning.As they arrived at the club, they met another group of people.Hu Chen had brought some of the younger crew.He was five to six years younger than Cao Yang, so he didn\u2019t stick around Cao Yang a lot when they were younger. Instead, he was more familiar with Cao An.The people he had brought along were all quite young, most of them in their twenties. Obviously, he was the leader.\u201cBrother Cao Yang,\u201d he greeted. \u201cIt\u2019s just the few of you? Want to join up?\u201dCao Yang\u2019s group were all in their thirties. They normally didn\u2019t really hang out with the younger generation.But that day, they didn\u2019t have enough people \u2013 there were only four of them. They felt a little cold; men usually preferred a much more lively environment when they drank.The two groups combined and went to Cao Yang\u2019s usual room.Those who were able to stick around Hu Chen, this sly person, were all quite sensible. The atmosphere soon became lively.In between, there was one handsome young man who was especially attentive, trying all he could to get closer to Cao Yang.Cao Yang asked for his name.\u201cI\u2019m Liang Ziheng,\u201d he smiled pleasantly.There wasn\u2019t a family surnamed Liang within the top circles of the city.A small fry. Translated by The NovelstCao Yang didn\u2019t put in any effort to remember his name.The manager very soon lead a group of princesses to the room, each attractive in her own way.The men had all waved to the princesses they were interested in. Only Cao Yang was still gripping his cigarette between his lips without moving.Liang Ziheng had also stretched out a hand to one of the princesses\u2026 Hu Chen kicked him under the table. He was able to react quickly, immediately swapping his attention to another princess.Hu Chen was unfamiliar with that princess; she looked like a newcomer. So he went and gave her a push, nodding his head furtively toward Cao Yang. \u201cThat person.\u201dThe princess reacted, moving her hips to sit beside Cao Yang.\u201cNew here?\u201d Cao Yang asked. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\u201cTwenty.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cXi Xi.\u201dCao Yang nodded before starting to drink with his friend.When Cao Yang went to the bathroom, Liang Ziheng took the opportunity to ask his question.Everyone in the circle already knew this, so Hu Chen didn\u2019t hide it from him: \u201cIt\u2019s an old rule. The one with the smallest waist always goes to Cao Yang.\u201dThat was how it went.Cao Yang had grazed Xi Xi\u2019s waist, and somehow he felt that sensation was lacking, so he lost interest.He didn\u2019t know why but he suddenly thought of Xia Rou, before immediately realizing his carelessness.Her face had been pale. Even though she said she had low blood sugar, but the moment he had called her, her expression had clearly been frightened\u2026Cao Yang furrowed his brows.But then he recalled the moment she had moved out to the car, she didn\u2019t seem to be ill. So he had been relieved.He would wait until he was home before asking her about it.So he continued to drink to his heart\u2019s content.That night, he didn\u2019t bring Xi Xi with him out of the club. He called someone to take him home.On his way back, the alcohol hit him hard and he faded in and out of consciousness, dizzy. After he entered the house, he went straight to the elevator. He wanted to quickly go to bed and fall asleep, but somehow he pressed the button for the second floor.There wasn\u2019t a big difference between the corridors of the second and third floors. He blearily made his way to his bedroom. It was dark and he couldn\u2019t see well, but the layout was the same, so he felt his way to the bed and fell into it\u2026Xia Rou woke at night to go to the bathroom. When she returned, her bed suddenly had another person!She was so surprised she almost screamed!She rolled pulled away the blanket and switched on the lamp, which revealed the face she was most familiar with.She let out a sigh of relief. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou called his name once, twice, but he didn\u2019t respond.She climbed onto the bed and nudged him, but his eyes remained tightly shut, the smell of alcohol drifting into her nose, tinged sweetly with a hint of perfume.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The position of it and the layout were all the same. She could easily deduce that this guy must have had too much to drink and gone to the wrong floor.She tried to pull him up\u2026 Cao Yang was 1.84 meters tall. Though he wasn\u2019t as buff as Cao Xiong, who was built like a bear, he wasn\u2019t someone that could be pulled so easily by a girl with such slim arms like herself! Her efforts were in vain and she had sweat all over.Xia Rou took a glance at the clock beside the bed. It was one in the morning, almost two\u2026 She hesitated. Should she wake everyone in the dead of night?Before she had gone to bed, she had seen Cao Xiong\u2019s car was back, but Cao An didn\u2019t seem to have returned home.If she were to call someone, she would have to go all the way to the side building to ask Xiao Yang and Uncle Zhou for help\u2026 that was going to drag in a lot of people\u2026\u2026\u2026Never mind. Translated by The NovelstSince Cao Yang was sleeping so deeply, Xia Rou thought, why not just leave him be. She would just give him the bed and she would sleep on the sofa.She rubbed her arms, looking at him.His suit was crumpled on the floor, his tie still around his neck. He hadn\u2019t even taken off his shoes!Xia Rou felt helpless. She took off his shoes, then his socks, pulling his legs on to the bed. She eased off his tie.She thought of a long while, then undid his belt in case it was making him uncomfortable, leaving him in his shirt and long pants to sleep in.She turned off the lights, darkening the entire room in just an instant. After a few seconds, her sight recovered.Within the dark, she could still clearly see his face. His eyes were closed\u2026 so quiet\u2026 as if she hadn\u2019t seem him like this before in her memories\u2026Thick brows and a straight nose.His lips that were always reflexively pursed when he saw her were now relaxed\u2026The moment she died, she had thought she would never be able to see him again\u2026She remembered clearly: the last thing to flash through her mind was his face.Everyone says that when someone is going to die, the last person they think of is probably the person closest to them.From her adolescence to her adulthood, he had protected her for ten years. Ten years\u2026 to her, he had already become her closest family.In the dark, Xia Rou hugged her knees and sat on the bed, staring at this man.She stared at him for a long while\u2026To be able to look quietly at him like this \u2013 she felt her heart fill with satisfaction.He was very still, the movement of his chest the only indication he was alive. Suddenly, he seemed to dream of something, the familiar \u201c\u5ddd\u201d character appearing on his forehead.Xia Rou kneeled on the bed, her body tilting forward as she stretched out a hand to rub that \u201c\u5ddd\u201d character out with two fingers, softly.To see him remain so still, she couldn\u2019t help but softly\u2026 hold onto his hand\u2026Cao Yang\u2019s palm was huge and warm, she needed both her hands to cover one of his.She was quite familiar with this hand. His fingers were long, knuckles distinct and powerful.She could still remember how he looked as he gazed at her smile, two fingers balancing a cigarette. She could also remember how he looked when he was angry with her and with nowhere else to vent, he would violently suppress the cigarette butt onto the ashtray.She could still remember the warmth of this hand when he patted her head. Sometimes he would follow the curve of her hair down to the back of her neck. When he would stop there, his hand would be hot.But he would take it off her.In this life, she was very obedient and hadn\u2019t yet made him angry. She listened carefully to everything he said, closer to him now than in the past.But she could feel it. That familiar feeling between herself and her big brother\u2026 was nowhere to be found any longer\u2026Those feelings that brought up such nostalgia in her, and made her yearn \u2013 they seemed to have slowly faded away.It made her uneasy.She held his hand, slowly laying down. She pillowed her face onto his warm, dry hands.Little by little, she thought back to the things that had happened in the past.Though this life seemed to be much better\u2026 she didn\u2019t want to forget the past.Slowly, sleep overcame her.Without her realization, her eyes drifted shut\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026As Cao Yang woke, he felt the bed was very comfortable, with a warm, soft body beside him.He didn\u2019t open his eyes, instead flipping his body to embrace the woman beside him.The sensation he felt was not the smooth texture of a woman\u2019s skin, but instead the comfortable texture of\u2026 cotton pajamas?The feeling was off. Cao Yang\u2019s eyes flew open.What appeared before him was an angelic sleeping face; pure and innocent, unblemished like a child\u2019s.Sleeping right beside him, she was completely defenseless.Cao Yang held his breath for a few moments, staring at her. He then gently got up.Her long hair was strewn over the bed, her light gray cotton pajamas wrinkled upwards to reveal her thigh. She was curled up like a baby in her mother\u2019s womb.However, one of her hands was gripped tightly onto his arm, not letting go\u2026Cao Yang lowered his head to look at himself.Although his shirt had two buttons unbuttoned, he still had it on. Even his long pants were still on him, it was just that he was barefoot.Luckily. Translated by The NovelstHe let out a huge sigh of relief.The problem was \u2013 how did Xia Rou get into his bed?No\u2026 He raised his head to realize that it was actually Xia Rou\u2019s room they were in. The question should be: how did he get into Xia Rou\u2019s bed?The effects of a hangover assailed him immediately. He couldn\u2019t help but rub at his temple.What was worse than the hangover was the situation before him.\u201cXia Rou, Xia Rou!\u201d He pushed her and tried to pull his arm away.But this little girl mumbled nonsense and hugged his arm even tighter than before.She seemed to be cold, even squeezing herself into his arms.A snowy white leg wrapped around his waist\u2026The pajama pants slid further upwards all the way to her crotch\u2026So early in the morning, the willpower of men was usually unchallengeable.Cao Yang\u2019s face turned green.He swung his arm in a strong motion, flipping Xia Rou.\u201cXia Rou! Get up!\u201d Blue veins stood out against his forehead as he shouted.Xia Rou sleepily sat up, her hair messy and face confused.She hadn\u2019t shaken off the daze of sleep yet.Her chest sloped up and down following her slow movements, and he could faintly see the shape of her chest.

Everything was blurry and she hadn\u2019t grasped the situation yet.Cao Yang, his eyes sharp and hands agile, quickly pulled the thin blanket to cover his lap, hiding his natural morning reaction.\u201cHow did I end up in your room?\u201d he asked, face stiff.\u201cAh?\u201d Xia Rou rubbed her eyes again and yawned. \u201cYesterday you\u2026 drank too much, got on the wrong floor\u2026 so\u2026 so you slept on my bed.\u201dThat drowsy face obviously hadn\u2019t woken up completely.The night before, she had slept very late so she was still groggy.Hearing her speak, Cao Yang felt a lump in his throat.

She ran quickly off the bed into the closet.Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dFortunately, she wasn\u2019t completely stupid.Tsk. Translated by The NovelstAs soon as she left, he pulled the blanket off him to go to the bathroom.He tidied himself up and returned to the room, finding his belt on the bedside table to buckle on, then located his socks and shoes.When he raised his eyes, he saw that the silly girl had changed into loungewear, blankly standing to the side\u2026\u201cGo and wash your face,\u201d he said expressionlessly.She had gunk in the corner of her eye, and the corner of her mouth had a suspicious white smudge.Xia Rou covered her face and rushed into the bathroom.When she returned, she had performed the magic of a woman\u2019s transformation \u2013 her face was fresh, lips moisturized, and her hair tidy.She had become a pretty lady again.Cao Yang had already taken a seat on the sofa, his head leaning against the back. When he saw her come out, he raised his head and straightened his back.\u201cGet me a glass of water,\u201d he said.Xia Rou stepped barefoot on the carpet to get him some water, before sweetly serving the glass before him \u2013 she didn\u2019t understand why he was angry, but she felt that it was better for her to act obediently.Cao Yang raised his head, drinking all the water with one gulp. He set the glass down on the coffee table with a pak sound.He then glanced at Xia Rou, standing there barefoot, anxiously twisting her fingers together.\u201cSit,\u201d he said, pointing at the sofa across from him.She obediently sat down.\u201cYesterday I drank too much and entered the wrong room?\u201d he asked.\u201cMn,\u201d she nodded, feeling deeply that it wasn\u2019t her fault.\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you call someone to take me back to my room?\u201d\u201cIt was too late\u2026\u201d Xia Rou explained. \u201cIt was almost two in the morning and everyone was asleep\u2026 Also, I was unable to move you by myself; no matter what I needed someone else to help me. Then I would have to wake someone up.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Fine, that\u2019s understandable,\u201d nodded Cao Yang. He then stared hard at her. \u201cWhy did you sleep right next to me?\u201dXia Rou was a little embarrassed.Yesterday, since he was dead drunk, she held tightly to his hands and cried the night away.She fell asleep while crying.She felt it was embarrassing to say this out loud, so she lowered her head and replied slowly, \u201cOriginally I wanted to let you stay on the bed and I would sleep on the sofa. Afterwards\u2026 After that\u2026 I looked at you for a while, then fell asleep without realizing\u2026\u201dWhat did she mean by she was looking at him for a while?What was so great about looking at a drunk man?Cao Yang grew angrier, and clenching his teeth in an effort to hold back his anger, asked, \u201cXia Rou\u2026 Don\u2019t you lock your door when you sleep?\u201dXia Rou was confused. \u201cNo, do you lock yours when you sleep?\u201dCao Yang choked.It was true. He didn\u2019t lock his door.This was his house. This was the house that belonged to the commander of the east! There were guards at the entrance, barbed wires on the walls around the house, an infrared alarm system, and cameras. There were even dogs in the courtyard.Why would he lock the door?\u201cOf course I don\u2019t lock my door! But the problem is,\u201d he said, furiously, \u201cHow can you and I be the same!\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Xia Rou was lost. She didn\u2019t understand why he was so angry.In the past life and continuing into this life, she lived in this house without locking the door even once while she slept. This was Cao Xiong\u2019s house; the security was top-notch. Aside from herself, the only people in the main building were the people of the Cao Family.Cao Xiong lived at the fourth floor, while Cao Yang and Cao Bin shared the third. Cao Xing and Cao An were on the second floor with her.And to be honest, the people who were most regularly there were Cao Xiong, Cao Yang, and Cao An. Cao Bin and Cao Xing only came back during the holidays.Living with these people \u2013 what would be the purpose of her locking the door?What Cao Yang was angry about was Xia Rou\u2019s lack of awareness and self-protection.She was fully grown, yet she didn\u2019t have any awareness about the differences between the sexes. She didn\u2019t realize that she was a woman that a man could desire.After raising her for two years, he couldn\u2019t believe that she was so silly\u2026 Wait no, no. He had realized it already. In the beginning, she didn\u2019t have any inkling of self-preservation and had followed Hu Xuan to that remote place, even being harassed!\u201cXia Rou.\u201d His brows twisted into a \u201c\u5ddd\u201d. He pushed his cigarette butt into the coffee table \u2013 Xia Rou\u2019s room didn\u2019t have an ashtray.The look on his face made Xia Rou feel like she had been transported to her past, like she\u2019d done something wrong again and made big brother angry.But this time\u2026 She hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201cYou\u2019re grown already, be more conscious in the future!\u201d Cao Yang frowned and lectured her. \u201cYou should learn to protect yourself. At school, stay far away from boys. The incident with Hu Xuan must not happen again!\u201dXia Rou\u2019s entire face was aflame. Translated by The NovelstRegarding Hu Xuan, that was really because she had relied on her past. She couldn\u2019t explain it to him. When she thought of Cao Yang taking her as a foolish, oblivious girl, she felt awful, but it wasn\u2019t like she could argue against it.She was so mad inside that she began tearing up.Cao Yang didn\u2019t let that soften him. He continued to lecture, \u201cLook at you! The entire house is filled with men. You\u2019re old enough, why don\u2019t you lock your room when you sleep? If you locked the door, even if I was drunk, would I be able to get in?\u201dXia Rou was listening intently to his words and found it odd.\u201cThe person who drank too much and entered the wrong room was you! Why is it my fault now?\u201d she cried, refusing to take the full blame. She had even told him to drink less!Cao Yang choked again.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How can you be so carelessly naive that you can sleep with me so thoughtlessly in one room?\u201d he said angrily.As a man, he knew deep inside that men couldn\u2019t be trusted when it came to a few things. Even for himself, he couldn\u2019t guarantee that he wouldn\u2019t act out when he was drunk.The truth was, when he was in his teens to his early twenties, he did a lot of things. But as he got older and matured, he at least wasn\u2019t as frivolous as he had been when he was young.Last night, it was really lucky that he was so drunk that nothing happened.If something had happened\u2026An odd image flashed through his mind and Cao Yang\u2019s heart thumped heavily. He subconsciously took a glance at Xia Rou.Her pink lips were pressed tightly together in anger, her black eyes wide with heat as she glared at him.That silly girl\u2026 What if he had lost control and done something to her? He really wouldn\u2019t know how to face her any longer. Most of all, he wouldn\u2019t know how to explain it to Cao Xiong.It irritated him. Translated by The NovelstHe remembered realizing, once, that Xia Rou had a lack of self-preservation when it came to the opposite sex.At that time, he had been looking for a chance to tell her nicely. But when he went to her, he suddenly couldn\u2019t dredge up the courage to talk to her about it, probably because he felt that she was still young. She would probably improve as she grew older.Now that he looked at it again, she had grown a chest but no brain! No sign of any improvement!Xia Rou also got angry.What did he mean by carelessly na\u00efve?\u201cYou\u2019re no stranger!\u201d she flung back in anger.If it was someone else, of course she wouldn\u2019t spend the night alone with him! In the past, she had even tried all methods of trying to avoid being alone with her own fianc\u00e9!She was so angry her cheeks were flushed.Her self-confidence and righteousness were clear.Cao Yang was stunned.You\u2019re not a stranger, you\u2019re my big brother.Xia Rou\u2019s eyes were clear as water as she straightforwardly expressed what she meant.So confident.Inside her heart, she really saw him as a brother!Cao Yang couldn\u2019t say it out loud. He had already started unconsciously\u2026 seeing her as a woman!It was as though, if he were to speak this aloud, he would dirty that pure gaze.This made Cao Yang want to fly into a rage with shame.He was so angry that he stood up to pace back and forth.He stopped lecturing, since he couldn\u2019t get through to her. The Cao Leader knew how to lead and train an army, but he didn\u2019t know how to make a teenager have some awareness toward him.Then he recalled again Hu Xuan\u2019s words about Xia Rou\u2019s situation at school. It wasn\u2019t that she was completely unaware of the dangers associated with the opposite gender.At school, she was colder to the boys when compared with the girls. She spoke bluntly to the boys who followed her around. Toward Hu Xuan, according to what he said, there was a long period that Xia Rou put up defenses when speaking with him. After that, she slowly relaxed that rigorous defense.He thought about it again and finally realized that it was just that she didn\u2019t put up any defenses toward the four brothers.And among the four, especially to him!As if, to her, he couldn\u2019t be considered a man at all!He didn\u2019t know whether to be happy or sad at this realization. He felt deeply that it was very troublesome to raise a girl.He had brought up his three younger brothers, and none of them were even half so troublesome as Xia Rou!Cao Yang kept thinking about it and thought \u2013 why not just keep it simple.Xia Rou was sitting on the sofa, still angry by herself.Clearly, he had been the one to drink too much and walk into the wrong room, but in the end she was getting lectured. No matter how she thought of it, she felt wronged!Her gaze followed his pacing from one end of the room to the other. He swerved to her.\u201cDo you have a boyfriend?\u201dXia Rou, surprised, answered, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cGood. Soon you\u2019re going to be out of junior year, then senior year is the most important. Study well and prepare for the national exams.\u201d Cao Yang gave her a simple, straightforward command: \u201cDon\u2019t date while you\u2019re in high school.\u201dXia Rou hadn\u2019t intended to date around anyway, but the way he said it made it seem like she was looking forward to it. Somehow, it made her uncomfortable.\u201cGot it,\u201d she said in a bored tone.\u201cIn university\u2026 then, you can start to date.\u201d Cao Yang wasn\u2019t so strict he would stop her from dating while in university.\u201cBut!\u201d he added, \u201cif there are boys chasing you around, or you want to date someone in particular, you need to let me know!\u201dXia Rou\u2019s mouth fell open.\u201cT-This\u2026 You\u2019re being too strict!\u201d she protested.\u201cNothing you can say will change my mind,\u201d Cao Yang said mercilessly. \u201cLook at your carelessness. If I don\u2019t approve, sooner or later you\u2019re going to be tricked.\u201dSilly girl. What an idiot! Even now you don\u2019t understand. No matter how much he took care of her, his nature\u2026 he was still a man.Looking at her now, he didn\u2019t realize when this had happened, but she had become a young woman. Long, black hair falling down thin shoulders, accentuating her slim waist and continuing down to her straight legs\u2026 All of those features were just his type.It was only because his self-control was strong and he had good morals that he didn\u2019t do anything to her.But if it were other men\u2026. Hmmph. It was just like a waterfront pavilion that got the moonlight first.He probably had to wait until this silly girl realized that he was also a man, and that is when he would be rest assured.\u201cDo you understand?\u201d He didn\u2019t allow her even a bit of leeway to protest.She indeed\u2026 did let a man trick her\u2026In the past, if she had listened to big brother\u2019s words, then she probably wouldn\u2019t have fallen to her tragic end like that.Originally, Xia Rou had been filled with righteous anger, but it had vanished into the air\u2026She lowered her head, feeling a little sad, then gave out a \u201cMn,\u201d obediently responding, \u201cAlright\u2026\u201dHer long hair rested on one of her shoulders, revealing on the other side a snowy-white neck.Ah, he had forgotten one thing.Her slim, white neck.

Her father placed her in the county, probably to help her gain some experience. But then that gang rape happened, and she pulled some strings and sent the police of Xu City there\u2026 And by the end she really managed to wrap that case up perfectly. I heard the higher-ups were nervous\u2026\u201dCao Yang praised her, \u201cShe really is very competent.\u201dIf she was so competent, you should go after her! Leaving someone with such excellent abilities alone, what are you doing everyday?Xia Rou remembered that when Cao Yang got drunk and entered her room, he smelled not only of alcohol but also of a thick perfume, feeling depressed.However, she knew herself well, and didn\u2019t dare presume her intelligence was enough to show off, so it was better for her not to pull anything. So she didn\u2019t dare try to hint at anything.\u201cHey!\u201d Translated by The NovelstA hand waved before her. She raised her head to notice it came from Cao Yang.\u201cYou\u2019re spacing out even when we talk about your goddess. Don\u2019t tell me you space out in school like this too?\u201d he stared at her.\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said sadly.\u201cHow were your finals? Are the results out yet?\u201d Cao Yang didn\u2019t let her off. \u201cWhat rank do you think you got this time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Xia Rou lowered her head. \u201cAh, this porridge is so good!\u201dThe Cao Family: \u201c\u2026\u201dHer grades were, of course\u2026 middling at best, as usual.Her junior year was finally over and summer break had finally begun.Her classmates had planned a trip outside the country, for one last hurrah before they entered a stressful senior year. Xia Rou also joined in.Over the past two years, she had been living a simple life, so she also wanted to adventure. But she was only a seventeen-year-old, Cao Yang and the others would definitely not let her go alone.But since she was with her classmates, it would be fine.The classmates who were going along on the trip all had good families behind them, not to mention their wealth.Before she left, Cao Yang had given her a card to use outside the country. He also video-chatted her twice, and after confirming that she was safe, he was relieved and told her to have fun without worrying about the money.But\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t drink, and don\u2019t let boys into your room. Especially the boys who like to drink, you hear me?\u201dXia Rou crinkled her nose at him.Cao Yang laughed. If it wasn\u2019t that there was an ocean between them, he would\u2019ve pinched her cheek.Xia Rou was gone for half a month, having a lot of fun abroad.The day she returned, Cao An was supposed to pick her up, but something came up so he arranged for Xiao Yang to pick her up instead.On the way home, Xiao Yang let her know that Cao Xiong had gone to the capital.Xia Rou hadn\u2019t seen them in over two weeks, so it was a little disappointing to see the house empty as she returned.She ran a bath to wash herself of the airplane feeling, before taking out her luggage and organizing her souvenirs, before going to the reading room with her hair still wet.The collection of books in the Cao Family was quite well-known. There were many precious books that had since gone out of print, and most had been collected by Madam Cao.The room itself had a history, filled with the unique scent of aged paper. Xia Rou took a deep breath \u2013 within those short two weeks, she had already begun to miss this room.The house\u2026 counting both her lives, had accompanied her for over ten years.She found a foreign language translation book, sitting down to begin reading.In the past, math had been her weak point, and language was the only subject she dared take on. That was why she\u2019d applied for the Chinese language course at college.It was the same for Cheng Wan.The room had always been a little warm and humid. During the summer, the air conditioning was quite cooling. Xia Rou\u2019s hair wasn\u2019t yet fully dry, so she hadn\u2019t even reached the halfway point in the book when she started sneezing furiously.She rubbed her arms, looking around. Atop the wide windowsill, the sunlight shone brightly on the carpet. She took off her shoes to climb up, arranging a few cushions for maximum comfort.She stretched out her hands to feel the air, then pulled the curtain to block the cold air coming from the vents.Xia Rou sunbathed as she read the book, before feeling sleepiness overcome her.She was jetlagged. It was afternoon now, but it was actually bedtime for her.After struggling to stay awake for a while, she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer.The sun was shining on her so gently that she didn\u2019t want to return to her bed. So she put the book aside, leaning her head on the cushions to succumb to the pull of sleep\u2026She woke to a strange sound.Well.. not really strange.Xia Rou rubbed her eyes, groggily listening for a while before she finally realized it was the heavy breathing of a man intermingled with the suppressed moans of a woman\u2026 and some other\u2026 unmentionable sounds\u2026Her mind blanked out.Although she\u2019d never participated herself, it didn\u2019t mean that she didn\u2019t know anything about it.Hearing just the sounds, she knew she was separated from what was happening in the reading room by just the layer of a curtain.But this\u2026 had happened before, in the past as well.But the timing was off. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou clearly remembered the time she\u2019d accidentally walked in on something like this. It was during the summer of her senior year, so this was one year early!But maybe\u2026Maybe\u2026She didn\u2019t want to admit it, but it was possible that maybe this kind of thing happened more frequently than she realized.

When she finally realized what exactly it was that she was hearing, it was too late to leave.All she could do was continue to hide behind the shelves with a red face, covering her hears\u2026 the entire time until the two were finished, and they left\u2026Xia Rou hid behind the curtains and covered her ears.However, the distance between herself and the pair wasn\u2019t far. She could even hear the squeaking of the wood\u2026There was a heavy log table that came with a set of six chairs placed in the middle of the reading room\u2026Please, let this quickly come to an end!However, the sounds continued for quite a while.The woman even let out a few uncontrollable screams a few times to echo through the spacious room.Xia Rou really couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and tried to quietly change her position. Her elbow scraped against the glass of the window, the sound vibrating.The squeaking rhythm of the wood seemed to stop for a second, then starting again to become more forceful, like they were trying to break the log table.Fortunately, it finally came to an end.The man breathed heavily for some time, then whispering into the woman\u2019s ears. The woman let out a shocked noise, mumbling softly in response.Very soon, there was the click of the door shutting once more.The reading room was finally silent.Thank god! Translated by The NovelstXia Rou took her hands off her ears, letting out a long sigh of relief.She promptly spaced out again as she began to think who it was, so annoying!The time in the past she had never figured it out. She could only exclude Cao Xiong from the list since he had been on a business trip for the week.Also, even though she hadn\u2019t experienced it herself\u2026 Cao Xiong was quite elderly. He couldn\u2019t be nearly so fierce anymore, right? So it could only be one of his sons.Was it Cao Bin? That wasn\u2019t likely, as second brother was very careful about his image.Then it would be either Cao Xing or Cao An. Of the Cao Family members, the two were considered the most lustful when compared to the others.Xia Rou felt that doing it in the reading room really fit their style.From start to finish, the past life to this life, Xia Rou had never even entertained the thought that it could be Cao Yang.Cao Yang had always been a special existence to her.Just as Cao An had joked to Cao Yang, saying that she idolized Cao Yang \u2013 to her, Cao Yang was perfect, nearly omnipotent.Also, she viewed him as her \u201cbig brother\u201d and couldn\u2019t even fathom anything related to sex.To Xia Rou, Cao Yang was really set apart from all things, kept well away from dust\u2026The thick curtains were pulled back with a swoosh.Xia Rou was so frightened she trembled.She raised her head to see\u2026Cao Yang was in an unbuttoned white shirt, revealing his chest. His abs were well-defined.A sharp gaze that could cut like a knife was directed at the girl quailing behind the curtain.When their eyes met, both were stunned.Time seemed to freeze.\u201cHow come it\u2019s you!\u201d he said angrily.Just then, he had noticed someone with them in the reading room. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed that someone was there, but he was angry that someone dared to try and peek at the ongoing activities. He thought it was a worker.So he had quickly finished, coaxing the woman to leave first. Then he wanted to see who in the world dared to do so. The salary \u2013 this person shouldn\u2019t dream of receiving it any longer.He\u2019d never imagined that when he pulled back the curtain, the person who had been listening to the entire time would be Xia Rou!Xia Rou had thought it was Cao Bin, Cao Xing, and even Cao An.But she had never thought it would be Cao Yang.Of course, she understood that in her past, that person might not have been Cao Yang.But\u2026 But\u2026 In this life, right now, the person\u2026 was Cao Yang!Xia Rou felt her head buzzing.Although Hu Xuan had told her before, and so had Cao An \u2013 any rumors about Cao Yang had always been something she had rejected right off the bat.She tried to fit this new information into her image of Cao Yang as \u201cbig brother.\u201dBut now, she clearly felt that something deep in her heart had fallen and shattered to pieces.Cao Yang\u2026 Her big brother had finally been taken down off his pedestal. Standing before her now, he became a living man.At this very instant, she felt that the Cao Yang before her and the big brother of her past had developed a flaw.She felt that something had fallen from her hands.She couldn\u2019t bear it.Inside her heart, she was embarrassed, and awkward, but at the same time she felt wronged and depressed.Xia Rou was also deeply afraid.Tears began to leak from her eyes.When Xia Rou cried, Cao Yang\u2019s heart would soften.He had also calmed down. Translated by The Novelst\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he said helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dHowever, the reasons he was saying these things were completely off as to why Xia Rou was crying.Her past life had been quietly scattered to the wind, and no one could help her recover it. Xia Rou couldn\u2019t explain this, so she felt even sadder.Cao Yang was also caught in a headache.To bring this matter up \u2013 it wasn\u2019t just Xia Rou that was awkward.In fact, this kind of stuff was usually taught by the older female members of the family as they shared knowledge with the younger generation. But the reason Xia Rou had joined their family was because she had lost her mother. Nobody was there to teach her about it.In the beginning, when she first joined the family, Cao Yang had bit the bullet and asked her whether it was her first time experiencing her period.But now he had no choice.

However, he\u2019d never given a lecture to a minor before\u2026He didn\u2019t know where to start. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou calmed down before he could decide what to tell her. However, it was clear that awkwardness and embarrassment had overcome her.She tried to hide this by rubbing her eyes, wondering how to dissolve the awkward air. As she looked anywhere but at him, she unintentionally glanced at his waist, surprised at what she found there.She quickly knelt down and pulled his shirt out of his pants.Her slightly cold, soft hand touched his waist.He was quite sensitive there, and combined with the activities that he\u2019d just completed, the feeling remained in his body.At the sensation of a womanly touch, Cao Yang trembled.His face darkened.\u201cXia Rou!\u201d he shouted.

The tears she had suppressed began to fall once more.Cao Yang was conflicted \u2013 he still had a headache from this mess, but he was confused.At least the reason she was crying was because she cared for her big brother, which was much better than her crying because she had witnessed that very same big brother doing something embarrassing, right?The awkward atmosphere had mostly dissipated. Cao Yang was happy to smooth the matter over just like that.Though he feared neither heaven nor God, thinking about giving The Talk to Xia Rou made his scalp go numb.He couldn\u2019t stop the corner of his mouth from curving up, ever so slightly.\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he said, patting her head.Obviously, her eyes were filled with fright and a complex mix of emotions he couldn\u2019t understand. Compared to how she had sobbed earlier, the quiet tears she spilled now hurt his heart.\u201cWhat should I do? I\u2019m ugly now. I might not be able to find a wife,\u201d he joked deliberately.Xia Rou heard the words, responding instinctively, \u201cThat\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cThere are so many women who want to marry you!\u201d she continued.That was right \u2013 many women wanted to marry him. After looking around here and there, he picked the best option most suited to him in the end. In the beginning he treated his wife with respect, but as their relationship cooled, they ended up parting ways.She remembered the day he had finalized his divorced. He had run to her apartment to look for her, but to this day she didn\u2019t know what he was going to ask her.His expression had turned very ugly after he had seen Cao An. He left after that without saying a word.Even until she died, she didn\u2019t know what he wanted to say.She guessed he was probably in a bad mood, so he was probably looking for someone to vent to.In the end, when he\u2019d needed her the most, she wasn\u2019t able to help him.It had greatly upset her. Translated by The NovelstShe felt that he was such a proud person that he must have only had her remaining to talk about his failed marriage. Toward other people, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have even let out a single word.So he could only keep it locked up inside. It must have been so hard on him.But after that day, when she went to look for him, the timing had passed. He was unwilling to speak on the matter.And starting from then, he started to keep a distance between them.His alienation had hurt her, so she held a grudge and didn\u2019t want to bother with him.In that one year of time, they grew very distant.That lasted until she told him she wanted to get engaged. He had thrown down that person\u2019s information before her, and that was when she finally realized that he\u2026 had been protecting her the entire time.He had been carefully holding the umbrella over her head to protect her from the shadows.At that time, she didn\u2019t fear anything any longer.As long as he was there, what did she have to be afraid of other than him?The Liang Family may have had less-than-pure intentions regarding her, but so what?So, just as in the past, he had softened in the face of her stubbornness once again.The windowsill wasn\u2019t very high up, reaching his waist. Xia Rou was kneeling atop the surface, still coming up short in terms of height when facing Cao Yang.She raised her head.Cao Yang was looking at her from above.His face was exquisitely crafted, and to her, the most familiar face she knew.Just now that person that had been torn in two in her heart had overlapped to become one being once again\u2026Xia Rou\u2019s heart thudded heavily, once.She called out, \u201cBig brother,\u201d hugging him and burying her face in his chest. She couldn\u2019t control the tears pouring out of her eyes.She had been fine, but why was she crying again? Why was this little girl being so emotional?Cao Yang could feel his headache growing.\u201cAlright, alright,\u201d he said helplessly. \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dHe patted her head softly, fingers winding through her hair.She had just washed her hair, so it was still a little wet and thick. The texture was pretty strong. Cao Yang\u2019s hand slipped to the end and stopped at Xia Rou\u2019s waist.This was the first time he had actually touched her waist.Xia Rou was still crying in his embrace. She felt the arms at her waist tighten as he carried her down from the windowsill.\u201cAlright, my little boss,\u201d he said as he released her. \u201cLook at those tears and that runny nose.\u201dXia Rou was embarrassed. She ran out of his arms to get some tissues from the table.Under the thick wooden table, there was a basket full of used tissues. Cao Yang maintained his composure and walked up to grab some tissues to help Xia Rou wipe her face clean, then throwing it inside the basket and quickly hiding the entire thing behind him\u2026Xia Rou sniffed, noticing a strange smell.\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d she asked. Translated by The NovelstWhen she raised her head, Cao Yang\u2019s face had blackened. She realized immediately what it was, and her face colored a bright red. The hand that was resting on the table was immediately withdrawn back to her body, as though she was burned.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, the two were in a great mood and ended up entwined in passion\u2026But he couldn\u2019t even chase Xia Rou to explain this to her. Cao Yang was so angry he forcefully let out a few hmmphs!Damn little girl!

She didn\u2019t meet Cao Yang\u2019s gaze from start to finish.\u201cSuch a rare sight,\u201d said Cao An, who had always spoken without fear. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you guys?\u201dCao Yang and Xia Rou stiffened simultaneously.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you keep your mouth shut, aren\u2019t you busy eating?\u201d Cao Yang gave him a look of warning.\u201cI\u2019m done with my meal,\u201d said Xia Rou quickly, getting up to leave.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Cao An stared at Cao Yang. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201dCao Yang put down his chopsticks and began with a black face to explain what had transpired.Cao An was rolling on the floor in tears of mirth.\u201cIf I said even one bad thing about you, she would glare at me. This is good \u2013 great! Big brother, you\u2019ve finally dealt a heavy blow!\u201d he cackled, arms over his stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s how it should go! Now she knows you\u2019re not a saint. Don\u2019t let her keep you on a pedestal! Hmmph hmmph~\u201dHaving a little brother like this was much worse than having Xia Rou.\u201cEnough! Just let the matter pass. Don\u2019t bring this up in front of Xiao Rou. She\u2019s a girl with thin skin, this kind of stuff can\u2019t be said,\u201d he lit up a cigarette.\u201cIf you don\u2019t explain it to her, her imagination might run wild. What if she has remaining trauma over this, what are you going to do? Brother, you\u2026 eh?\u201d Cao An looked at Cao Yang\u2019s expression. \u201cBro, are you planning on explaining it yourself?\u201dCao Yang gave a cold smile: \u201cIf not me, then who? Do you want to do it?\u201dCao An felt that this entire day had brightened with this breakfast. When his third brother came back, he needed to tell him right away! Their mighty big brother, after all these years, was finally going to carry out his duty as a big brother!\u201dHe laughed so hard he almost rolled under the table.Cao Yang really wished he could kick this little brother of his to death\u2026Xia Rou was in her room when she heard a knock at the door. Cao Yang was there with his hands in his pockets, leaning on the wall as he looked at her.Xia Rou immediately flushed a bright red.Cao Yang was speechless as he moved to the sofa in her room.\u201cAre you planning to ignore me forever?\u201d he lit up another cigarette.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Xia Rou snipped. She grabbed a glass to fill with a shallow pool of water, putting it on the coffee table as an ashtray.She sat across from him.\u201cAre you angry at me?\u201d Cao Yang asked. The awkwardness of it all gave way to a little humor.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Xia Rou\u2019s ears were red as she avoided his gaze.She wasn\u2019t angry. In the past she had lived to the age of 25, so she was an adult. Though she didn\u2019t have any firsthand experience, she also knew that this was quite normal for other adults.And most of all, there were still Cao Xing and Cao An, the two perverts, for comparison.It was just that in the past, Cao Yang had never let her know about this like this before. Even after she became an adult, she dealt with the Cao Yang that furrowed his brows.The Cao Yang of the past and the Cao Yang of the present were too different \u2013 it was just that she had suddenly been hit with this realization and couldn\u2019t accept it.She had been depressed the entire night but had finally managed to convince herself.But the setbacks of her slow reflection were now before her, so she had become irritated.She didn\u2019t know how to face Cao Yang, which was why she had been avoiding him since the early morning\u2026Cao Yang blew out some smoke, indicating the seat beside him with a nod: \u201cXiao Rou, come over here.\u201dXia Rou hesitated, but in the end obediently took the seat beside him.Before when she sat next to him Xia Rou would lean on him. But now, she left a strange distance between them.In the end, the matter had made her feel that Cao Yang\u2026 wasn\u2019t the \u201cbig brother\u201d of her memory.No matter how closely he resembled him, it wasn\u2019t the same.Cao Yang was very pleased to see the distance she left between them.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a big girl now, so you should pay attention and keep the opposite sex at a distance. Even if you\u2019re at home\u2026 you should pay attention now.\u201dCao Yang paused in hesitation, but in the end said it all: \u201cXiao Rou\u2026 I know you took me as a brother from the bottom of your heart. I\u2019m not trying to keep you at a distance. I\u2019m just worried that you might get too used to being close with us, and that you might accidentally give other people the wrong idea in the future when you\u2019re with them. You\u2019re a girl and can suffer disadvantages easily. It\u2019s impossible for me to look after you all the time. You need to learn how to protect yourself.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not that easygoing!\u201d Xia Rou said, a little angry. \u201cYou guys\u2026 are not the same as the rest.\u201dBut she couldn\u2019t explain how special they were to her\u2026 Once again, she was frustrated.Not the same?

He felt that a stone was lifted off his shoulders.Only big brother would do this, huh\u2026He asked her if it was her first time experiencing a period\u2026He worried if she would be traumatized regarding adult matters\u2026Not only did he care if she had enough food, clothing, or a roof over her head \u2013 he really, really cared for her and worried about her.He took her as a real little sister. He acted as a brother, a father, and even\u2026 took the responsibility of mothering her.Xia Rou felt a sour feeling creep into her heart.She lowered her head to conceal it.After a while, she softly\u2026 spoke out the secret she hadn\u2019t ever revealed, hiding it deeply within her heart for several years: \u201cI\u2026 I just\u2026 I don\u2019t like having other people touch my body\u2026\u201dAs she spoke, she felt Cao Yang\u2019s gaze sharpen.\u201cWho touched you?\u201d His tone was cold. \u201cHu Xuan?\u201dXia Rou was shocked. \u201cNo! Of course not!\u201d\u201cI just\u2026 I just\u2026 don\u2019t like boys to get too close to me\u2026\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI don\u2019t like bodily contact. Skin on skin\u2026 I just can\u2019t stand it. My heart rejects it\u2026\u201dCao Yang finally relaxed a little, frowning. \u201cWhat\u2019s it called?\u201dXia Rou lowered her head and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dThat day, she had heard Liang Ziheng embracing another woman and laughing through the door.\u201cSuch a big thing has happened, you\u2019re not nervous at all?\u201d the woman had asked.\u201cNo worries, don\u2019t I still have Xia Rou?\u201d Liang Ziheng\u2019s response was laughter.It was probably that she was also a woman that she complained for Xia Rou. \u201cThat reminds me. Your fianc\u00e9e is so pretty, and she could help you. But you treat her so badly, are you able to bear the weight on your conscience?\u201dLiang Ziheng tsked. \u201cThat woman\u2019s such a blockhead! You just don\u2019t know it. We\u2019ve been engaged for so long, but we still haven\u2019t slept together! Damn! She definitely has issues.\u201dThe Liang Family used her connection with the Cao Family to obtain a municipal project. When issues arose, she shamelessly went to beg Cao Yang for help.Because of this, Cao Yang had flown into a rage.She had known that he wasn\u2019t angry because of the problems in the project. He was most angry that in this kind of situation, the Liang Family had pushed her out to defend themselves.But she knew it well in her heart: she needed to resolve the matter for the Liang Family. If she wasn\u2019t able to, then it meant she didn\u2019t have any use to offer. That meant it would render her engagement to Liang Ziheng meaningless.So she had no choice but to power through the shame. She once again brought her awkward predicament to Cao Yang.That was the last time she saw Cao Yang in the past, but she left him with such a shameful image of her. Everytime she recalled the memory, she was so regretful that she couldn\u2019t even breathe.In the end, Cao Yang had promised her. But his gaze on her had been so very dark. It had scared her.She had left the Cao Family, and as she rushed to Liang Ziheng\u2019s apartment, wanting to tell him in person that Cao Yang had promised her, she had heard that. Before the door to her fianc\u00e9\u2019s bedroom, she heard him say to another woman that she had issues.She had issues.Did she really have issues?She had been forcing herself to accept more skinship with Liang Ziheng. She knew that sooner or later they would be married, and ultimately she wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from that kind of stuff.All she could do was try her best\u2026 and delay it after their marriage.\u201cBig brother,\u201d Xia Rou raised her head. \u201cDo you think\u2026 I have issues?\u201dShe sounded a little puzzled, a little desperate.If he was to meet an adult woman who rejected bodily contact with men, Cao Yang would definitely think she had issues.But his double standard was already vividly developed at this point.This was his girl and she was only seventeen. She wasn\u2019t even an adult yet. How could a simple matter like this be a problem?\u201cOf course not!\u201d Cao Yang lifted his brows. \u201cIn a girl who treasures herself a lot \u2013 this is normal.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d Hearing his reassurance, Xia Rou let down the huge rock on her heart. She couldn\u2019t help but let out a long sigh of relief, her shoulders sagging.Actually\u2026 she indeed did have issues. Cao Yang knew this clearly.But\u2026 she was still young. She wasn\u2019t an adult yet. Waiting for just two more years, after she had dated a few boyfriends, wasn\u2019t bad. The problem just might resolve itself.Cao Yang tapped out the ashes of his cigarette on the rim of the glass, looking at Xia Rou.He suddenly stretched out his hand to touch her face: \u201cLike this?\u201dXia Rou was surprised. Before she could react, Cao Yang\u2019s hand had already moved to the back of her neck. He caressed her: \u201cWhat about this?\u201dXia Rou finally reacted.She was a little embarrassed.\u201cI won\u2019t\u2026\u201d she said, softly. Translated by The Novelst\u201cYou don\u2019t feel repulsed?\u201d Cao Yang raised a brow.\u201cIf it\u2019s you, I don\u2019t,\u201d she said, feeling the soft touch of his hand and the warmth that emanated from it on her neck. She had a feeling of yearning. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re not a man.\u201dThis was the first time Cao Yang had heard from a woman that he didn\u2019t count as a man.He was so angry he wanted to laugh.He took back his hand, taking a deep draw off his cigarette.Cao Yang exhaled a long stream of smoke.\u201cXia Rou ah, you need to understand,\u201d he turned his head to look at Xia Rou, feeling that this matter could not be tolerated. \u201cNo matter how you think of me, I am still a man.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Xia Rou\u2019s ears were slightly red.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was just that this aspect of himself \u2013 he had never revealed it before her.In front of her, he had always been so grim that it was a little scary, but\u2026 he had always been a reliable brother for her to lean on.A person had tried to keep his image pristine for her for several long years.Xia Rou was finally enlightened.

Was it your girlfriend?\u201dCao Yang was speechless looking at Xia Rou. He thought, this little girl\u2026In the end she hasn\u2019t grown up yet!Just now she had been embarrassed and blushing red, but within seconds she\u2019d started nosing into his business.\u201cNo,\u201d he replied.She wasn\u2019t? Xia Rou was a little disappointed.He still hadn\u2019t started dating Wang Man? Ah, probably. If he had started seeing her he wouldn\u2019t be hanging out with other women, right?Xia Rou also had a double standard.It this were another man, she would definitely scold them for being \u201cnasty.\u201d But this was Cao Yang, so she reasoned for him within her mind.She thought it was natural that before he dated Wang Man, it was his right to have the freedom to play with other women.\u201cWhen are you going to get a proper girlfriend?\u201d She muttered to herself.\u201cAre you really trying to manage me?\u201d Cao Yang gritted his teeth.\u201cNo\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Xia Rou retreated quickly.She really couldn\u2019t hide her thoughts. The things she had suppressed in her mind for a long time were coming loose, as she opened her heart again to Cao Yang\u2026Unable to hold back, she asked, \u201cWhat do you think of Wang Man?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think of Wang Man?\u201d Cao Xiong had asked.Cao Yang remembered Cao Xiong asking him the same question. Why was everyone so fixated on Wang Man?\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he had responded.\u201cMy last trip to the capital I spoke with her father. Wang Man is single now and doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d Cao Xiong took a pause to inhale on his cigarette. \u201cWang Ting was full of praise for you, so it seems he\u2019s taken a liking to you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that close to her,\u201d said Cao Yang truthfully.Someone with a background like Cao Yang wouldn\u2019t date a princess like Wang Man lightly.She was different than the women he usually went for. They had equal family backgrounds, so he didn\u2019t dare treat her rudely. If they really started to date, both their parents would have eyes on them.If something happened, he might be forced to marry her.That was why Cao Yang and his friends still hadn\u2019t given much thought to getting married. They wanted to play around a few more years, keeping well away from wealthy daughters.\u201cYou\u2019re thirty-one already. It\u2019s time you settle down,\u201d Cao Xiong said unhappily, his fingers drumming softly on the table.\u201cSooner or later, you will need a wife. I\u2019ve looked around for you, and there\u2019s no one that compares to Wang Man. Are you going to miss this opportunity and marry worse later on?\u201dThis wasn\u2019t the first time Cao Xiong brought up settling down. Ever since Cao Yang had entered his thirties, it was true that his thoughts had changed when compared to his twenties.Also, he felt that what Cao Xiong was saying to him did make sense.\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll give it a try,\u201d he said. Translated by The NovelstSummer break ended. Xia Rou became a senior and started to study with her head attached to a beam and stabbing her thigh with an awl*. She even asked Cao Yang to hire a tutor for her on the weekends.The longer she went, the more she recognized the difference in her intelligence level when compared to the others. Whether in the past or present, there was no doubt that she was lacking when it came to studying.To be able to live another life \u2013 though she wasn\u2019t able to win it all, she must at least not waste the second chance that had been so graciously provided to her. She must at least do a little better than her past.Even if she failed, as long as she worked hard, then at least she would not have regrets.That was why she would make up for her natural shortcomings with hard work.Cao Yang was a little worried she was overdoing it.\u201cJust do your best,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be too stressed.\u201dLife wasn\u2019t only for studying, and they weren\u2019t expecting much from her. Since they had taken her in as a child of the Cao Family, they would naturally take responsibility for arranging her future.Although it was nice to see her working so hard, they didn\u2019t want to see her put herself through too much stress.A girl didn\u2019t have to be too successful. All she needed was to get a certification, dress herself up, and live a happy and healthy life. That was enough.When she hit the right age, they would find her a good husband.With the Cao Family behind her, they would be able to guarantee a good match.As long as the Cao Family was there, and as long as he was there, he could provide a happy and peaceful life.It was good.

It hurts!\u201d Xia Rou surrendered immediately, saying weakly, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything\u2026\u201d\u201cInstead of worrying over you, why not find myself a wife?\u201d Cao Yang gritted his teeth.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, you must have heard wrong!\u201d Xia Rou refused to admit to it.While Cao Yang hadn\u2019t used much strength, she pulled her hair out of his grip and quickly ran away.Ran away\u2026Away\u2026Damn little girl!! Translated by The NovelstThe corner of his mouth lifted.She was clumsy, not great at studying, and didn\u2019t have many thoughts.But she knew how to work hard and was serious and persistent. Though she knew she wasn\u2019t the smartest, she believed that her hard work would make up for it.Like a stupid bird trying hard to flap its wings.Sometimes it was funny to see her that way, but after laughing at her, he would let out a sigh, feeling an ache in his heart for her.And sometimes, he couldn\u2019t hold back and wanted to stretch out his fingers, and let her blunted fangs hold onto him, and tell her\u2026You can stop working so hard, can\u2019t I just\u2026 carry you to the top?She immersed herself in her studies every day, as though she couldn\u2019t feel time ticking onwards. It made Xia Rou feel like time had stopped her at age seventeen.If time did stop, that would be nice too.At least, when compared to her twentieth year, when she had to face all those complicated matters after stepping into society, she was much more willing to stay at the age of seventeen, spending all day studying and solving questions. She didn\u2019t need to think too much, and every day was simple.\u201cWhy do humans have to grow? How great would it be if I could stay this age forever\u2026\u201d She let this thought out at the dining table.This girl, grieving over the passing of spring and groaning without being ill\u2026 Smiles spread on Cao Xiong and Cao Yang\u2019s faces.\u201cIn your dreams! I also want to be twenty forever!\u201d Cao An rolled his eyes. \u201cHow are your preparations going for next week?\u201d\u2026.Oi! Can we even talk peacefully like that!An entire semester passed in just the blink of an eye. After exams were over, Xia Rou went straight home and fell onto her bed to sleep for an entire evening.She was still groggy at the dinner table.\u201cAlright, this means you can finally relax, right?\u201d Cao Xing had returned. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you to ski next weekend.\u201d\u201cNext weekend is Wang Man\u2019s birthday, she\u2019s throwing a party,\u201d said Cao Yang just as Xia Rou was about to accept. \u201cDo you want to go?\u201dXia Rou\u2019s eyes immediately began to shine.\u201cYes yes yes! My goddess\u2019 birthday! Of course I want to go!\u201dShe asked Cao Yang, \u201cAre we going to her house? Is it a banquet?\u201d She would have to prepare a dress.\u201cNo, it\u2019s just a gathering. There\u2019s no need to wear a dress, it\u2019ll be casual.\u201d\u201cAh, then what present should I bring?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it. You don\u2019t need to worry.\u201dIt meant that this would be a gathering for the younger generation. She kept that in mind.If he was being invited to participate in this kind of private gathering, it looked like Cao Yang was still keeping in touch with Wang Man, more or less. Xia Rou was excited in her heart.\u201cWhy do you like Wang Man so much?\u201d Looking at the way her eyes shone, Cao Xing was curious.\u201cShe\u2019s my goddess!\u201d Xia Rou replied happily.\u201cShe\u2019s a little too arrogant,\u201d said Cao Xing. He didn\u2019t like that type of girl.\u201cBut she has the right,\u201d responded Xia Rou.She really felt that Wang Man truly had the right to feel proud.After dinner, Xia Rou was told to stay and have a chat with Cao Xiong.\u201cDo you like Wang Man that much?\u201d Cao Xiong felt it odd.\u201cMn,\u201d nodded Xia Rou.Since Cao Yang wasn\u2019t there, Xia Rou mustered up the courage to ask Cao Xiong, \u201cUncle, is it possible that big brother could marry Wang Man and bring her home to become my sister-in-law?\u201dCao Xiong laughed, asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s this coming from, why do you want them together?\u201d\u201cI checked! Among the daughters of the city, Wang Man is the most excellent. If big brother needs to marry, then nobody else is worthy other than her,\u201d she responded confidently.What she said fit right into Cao Xiong\u2019s own thoughts.Changing the topic, he asked after her school life, sparing a thought to her exam results.After that, he said to her, \u201cAt least you\u2019ve taken it seriously, and put sincere effort in. As long as you don\u2019t regret in the future it\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t have to be so worried. As long as uncle is here, I won\u2019t let you suffer in the future.This was a promise to her. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou felt warmth overtake her heart.\u201cUncle,\u201d she looked at him. \u201cI understand.\u201dCao Xiong could see that she really did understand. In just two years, she had grown from a depressive little girl to a sweet, happy and sensible lady.Cao Xiong noticed a sour feeling growing in his heart.His plan was to wait until she grew a little more, prepare some assets for her so she didn\u2019t have to worry about what to eat or wear. And after that, he would take a good look around to find her a suitable man and arrange her a marriage.As long as he was around, he could guarantee her a peaceful life.Even if he passed away, there were still Cao Yang and the others to look after her.This way, Cheng Wan would be able to be at ease, right?Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since this was a party for the youngsters, she didn\u2019t need to wear a dress, but could go a little more casual.Although in the past Xia Rou was twenty-five, she could take advantage of the fact she was only seventeen now, so she tied her hair into two braids. Then she loosened them and combed through them to add some volume.This kind of hairstyle would become popular in a few years. It really caught people\u2019s attention.Both sides of her ears had blinged out crystal clips, shining under the lights. They were cheap crystals and couldn\u2019t be counted as real jewelry. If she was at a banquet, they would look cheap, but her age made it alright.When she left the building, even Cao Yang raised his brows.Xiao Yang drove the car. Translated by The NovelstOn the road, Cao Yang brought out two boxes and gave one to her. \u201cPresent.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xia Rou asked curiously.\u201cYours is perfume, mine is a fountain pen,\u201d said Cao Yang.Xia Rou: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Cao Yang raised his brows.\u201cWhat the hell, a fountain pen?\u201d Xia Rou asked, feeling a headache formingIt\u2019s your future wife\u2019s birthday, big brother, can\u2019t you put more heart into it when choosing a present?Cao Yang responded calmly, \u201cShe\u2019s working in the government, so she needs to write a lot. A fountain pen suits her well, her handwriting is very nice. Which reminds me\u2026 Find some time during the holiday to practice your handwriting. I\u2019ll buy you a pen when we get back.\u201dW-Wait a second! How did the topic change to her own handwriting!Though her penmanship wasn\u2019t too bad when compared to her class, the four brothers had been trained since they were young, having had top-notch tutors to supervise them. They could each write beautifully, not to mention their skill with the fountain pen. Compared to them, her penmanship was nothing to glance at\u2026No, no! The topic had strayed too far!\u201cWho would want to receive a fountain pen from her boyfriend? No matter what, it should at least be jewelry or an accessory!\u201d Xia Rou said.\u201cI\u2019m not her boyfriend,\u201d Cao Yang said.\u201cAren\u2019t you dating?\u201d\u201cWho told you that?\u201d\u201c\u2026I was guessing. But,\u201d she continued, \u201cUncle really fancies Sister Wang Man.\u201d\u201cBig brother! Sister Wang Man is really the most excellent woman in society. I really can\u2019t even pick out a flaw. If you\u2019re going to marry, it needs to be her,\u201d Xia Rou said, her face full of seriousness. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever marry someone like Sun Miaolan, I won\u2019t be able to stand it.\u201dEver since Wang Man had come to the city, Sun Miaoli who had been priding herself as \u201cthe number one lady in the city\u201d had finally met a roadblock.\u201cYou\u2019re quite picky. Am I the one who\u2019s marrying, or are you?\u201d Cao Yang laughed.\u201cYou and Wang Man really aren\u2019t dating?\u201d Xia Rou was persistent.According to her memories, Cao Yang and Wang Man should already be dating in her senior year. Cao Yang wasn\u2019t an easygoing person, nor was he the kind to lose himself to love.Since he had formally brought Wang Man to meet Cao Xiong, they must have dated for some time or to some extent.However, in this life, there were many differences when compared to her past. People\u2019s attitudes to her were different, or even\u2026 the shocking scar on Cao Yang\u2019s body.That was why as the first semester of her senior year passed and she didn\u2019t hear any news about Cao Yang and Wang Man, she couldn\u2019t help but become anxious. She was afraid that because of her, some variables had occurred to change the situation.In this life, she had made up her mind to not be greedy, and not to beg. When it came time for her to leave the Cao Family, she would just leave.That way, Cao Yang wouldn\u2019t be dragged down by her any longer. He would marry the most excellent woman and live his life to the fullest.It wouldn\u2019t be a waste of her rebirth.\u201cCan\u2019t be counted as dating. I just ate with her twice,\u201d Cao Yang replied casually, dragging a few times on his cigarette.\u201cSo useless,\u201d Xia Rou derided. \u201cYou\u2019ve already taken her out twice and still haven\u2019t managed to become her boyfriend! If it was fourth brother, the rice would have been cooked already!\u201dCao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying!\u201d His face turned dark as he pinched her cheeks.\u201cOuch ouch ouch!!\u201dLooking at Xia Rou\u2019s eyes tearing up, Cao Yang let out a hmmph. He released his hands and said, \u201cYou better not get too close with Cao An. He\u2019s the king of chaos in our family, what else would he teach you?\u201dXia Rou rubbed at her cheeks and didn\u2019t dare speak. Cao Yang found it funny in his heart, but his face was still stiff as he scolded her, \u201cYou better not learn from him.\u201dSeeing how sad she was, Cao Yang paused. In the end, he still explained to her, \u201cUsually, we just play around, so it\u2019s fine. But with someone like Wang Man, I can\u2019t treat her simply. Xia Rou, do you understand?\u201dXia Rou remained silent for a while before nodding.Cao Yang\u2019s brows gentled as he saw her response. He held her lower jaw, his thumb rubbing softly at the red spot he\u2019d pinched just then.\u201cYou too,\u201d he continued. Translated by The Novelst\u201cYou\u2019re the only girl in our family\u2026\u201d Cao Yang was deep like the draw of a cello, gentle and slow. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need to remember that no one can treat you simply.\u201dThe sensations on his fingertips were soft and delicate.In the dark, he seemed to be able to see the reflection of the wavering lights in her eyes.But the next moment, she immediately revealed a joyful smile, letting out a heavy, \u201cMn!\u201dXiao Yang took a glance at the rearview mirror before immediately withdrawing his gaze\u2026And continued to drive.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She booked a room for the party.Cao Yang and Xia Rou arrived just in time.When Wang Man saw Cao Yang, she came forward and greeted, \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dShe then looked at Xia Rou, \u201cXiao Rou is here too.\u201d\u201cSister Wang Man, happy birthday,\u201d Xia Rou said in a well-behaved manner, handing the present that Cao Yang had prepared for her.\u201cThank you,\u201d Wang Man said, smiling warmly as she received the gift. \u201cHave fun at the party.\u201dAlthough Wang Man had already learned that Xia Rou wasn\u2019t Cao Xiong\u2019s biological child, her attitude toward Xia Rou was so much better when compared to the past that she was a little overwhelmed by the unexpected grace.As Cao Yang looked at Xia Rou, he felt that she really liked Wang Man. He patted her head, \u201cYour friends are over there.\u201dAlthough this was a younger gathering, people still split up by age. Xia Rou left for her friends.She sat down and greeted her peers, turning around to watch Cao Yang speak with Wang Man.A cigarette was in his hand and a smile was on his face.He was tall, his body falling into fine, structured lines for a manly look.Who could even compare to him? That was her big brother. If Wang Man didn\u2019t like him, who else would she like? They were a perfect match!Xia Rou couldn\u2019t help but reveal a satisfied smile.Slowly, the room crowded up, the atmosphere heating up with the continuous amount of people.Xia Rou was speaking with someone until she heard someone shout her name: \u201cXiao Rou!\u201d She turned around and saw that it was Hu Chen. No matter whether or not she disliked him, their social circles were so small that this day was inevitable.She smiled and greeted him, \u201cBrother Hu Chen.\u201dHu Chen continued toward her and as he neared, a handsome boy appeared from behind him.Xia Rou\u2019s expression immediately changed. Translated by The NovelstThat young boy revealed a surprised face, asking Hu Chen, \u201cBrother Chen, this is\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, Xiao Rou, this is Liang Ziheng,\u201d he said, patting Xia Rou\u2019s shoulder. He turned to Liang Ziheng, \u201cThis is Xia Rou of the Cao Family.\u201dBy mentioning the Cao Family at this sort of occasion, there was only one Cao Family it could be.That introduction was a little odd, but Liang Ziheng wasn\u2019t bothered, not asking further. He pulled on a smile and said, \u201cHello, Xia Rou.\u201dLiang Ziheng was quite handsome and slick with his words, so he was quite popular among the female population.And that female population consisted of rich young ladies, rather than beautiful young ladies. The truth was that many wealthy girls\u2026 weren\u2019t beauty queens\u2026Liang Ziheng naturally preferred pretty girls.Although Xia Rou was still young, she was a beauty. When he scanned the room, just looking at faces, the most attractive were definitely Xia Rou or Wang Man.Wang Man was a wealthy family\u2019s daughter, and a woman of quality. She held all the cards: a strong family background, ability, and beauty. Her personality was arrogant and she didn\u2019t let just anyone in her eyes.Liang Ziheng was still self-aware enough to know that he had to rely on Hu Chen to bring him to her birthday gathering, so he didn\u2019t dare scheme in regards to her.He greeted Xia Rou with a smile.She had to admit that he was quite attractive. A few girls by Xia Rou\u2019s side took a few more looks at him.In the past, the reason Xia Rou continued to pursue him and accept him was because of these looks of his.Xia Rou responded coldly.Liang Ziheng hadn\u2019t noticed, but Hu Chen did.Hu Chen and Hu Xuan \u2013 the two brothers were very shrewd. Xia Rou\u2019s small change in emotion didn\u2019t escape his notice.The Hu and Cao Families had always had a good relationship. Hu Chen was also close with Cao An. Before Hu Xuan left to study abroad, he also seemed to have gotten close to Xia Rou. This was why Hu Chen was comfortable with Xia Rou.She had a sweet temper and a gentle character. Though she had the Cao Family behind her, she seemed well-aware of her place. She treated people politely and was quite likable.She appeared to be quite cold and it was the first time Hu Chen had seen her like this.He of course knew that her attitude wasn\u2019t towards him. He took a glance at Liang Ziheng and calmly interrupted his attempts to strike up a conversation with Xia Rou, bringing him along to meet others.Xia Rou\u2019s stiff shoulders finally relaxed.Since the last time she\u2019d met him, she had already known she couldn\u2019t avoid him completely. They would still have to meet sooner or later, but she thought that Liang Ziheng wouldn\u2019t have had the status to be invited to Wang Man\u2019s birthday celebration, so she hadn\u2019t expected him.That was right. No matter how, he would find some way to involve himself in their ranks. He was originally a very clever person. He knew how to choose sides, and was very thoughtful, sensible, with a sweet-talking attitude.In the past, he had treated her like a princess.To a counterfeit that hadn\u2019t been acknowledged by Cao Xiong, her pride was greatly satisfied. Until\u2026The room suddenly turned dark.A waiter was pushing a three-tiered birthday cake into the room. Someone began the happy birthday song and everyone joined in under the candle-lit atmosphere.After that, it felt like a scene from a drama as a beautiful princess made a wish and blew out the candles. She smiled prettily while accepting well-wishes from the gathered crowd.Shortly after, gentle music started up and someone said, \u201cWang Man, go for a dance!\u201dOthers joined in to encourage her as well.Wang Man shrugged her shoulders and jokingly said, \u201cBut there\u2019s no gentleman to ask me to dance!\u201dAll heads swiveled to Cao Yang.There was no need to consider the younger kids. Those who were at the right age and single didn\u2019t dare try as long as the Cao crown prince was present, even though they might have the thought.Cao Yang felt a little alienated, the scene a little too old and cheesy for him. For a man at his age, it was a little greasy.But he couldn\u2019t refuse to give Wang Man face.No matter what he was thinking inside, his face still revealed a pleasant smile. He looked like a gentleman sporting a charming aura.When he held Wang Man\u2019s hand and brought her to the dance floor, they made a striking pair: the handsome man, with his tall stature paired with the beautiful, elegant woman with an outstanding temperament.Anyone who looked at them would think they were the perfect match. A few of the other women couldn\u2019t help but reveal their envy toward Wang Man. And among those women, Sun Miaolan was the most obvious.People began to whisper. Translated by The Novelst\u201cThey\u2019re together?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about it.\u201d\u201cNow that you mention it, the Wang Family and the Cao Family\u2026 There aren\u2019t any other families on the same level\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, they look well-suited to each other.\u201d\u2026\u2026Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She should be very happy for them, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood.Both Cao Yang and Wang Man were spectacular dancers, spinning smoothly around the dance floor. After a few laps, other people began to join them. Everyone had given face to Wang Man by cheering her on.Xia Rou felt a gaze on her and turned to see Liang Ziheng looking at her.She stared at him for a while before coldly turning away her gaze.Liang Ziheng hesitated a little and stayed where he was.Just now he had discreetly asked Hu Chen about Xia Rou\u2019s identity.Hu Chen\u2019s answer was hard to see through: \u201cShe belongs to the Cao Family.\u201dBut her surname was Xia. Translated by The Novelst\u201cCousin?\u201d asked Liang Ziheng.\u201cNo,\u201d replied Hu Chen. \u201cHer mother was involved with Commander Cao. When she passed away she didn\u2019t have any other relatives, so he brought Xia Rou into the family.\u201d\u201cIllegitimate daughter?\u201d\u201cNot blood related.\u201dXia Rou not being blood related to the Cao Family was admitted by the person herself. Almost everyone in their circle knew her identity.Liang Ziheng seemed a little surprised at the unexpected answer. He couldn\u2019t tell if he was disappointed or happy about it.Hu Chen shot him an interested look.This kid was very good at fawning over others, and especially himself. Hu Chen had always enjoyed watching people with wild ambitions that knew which side to choose. So he didn\u2019t really mind bringing him along and even letting him rub elbows with the very highest reaches of their circle.And it was true \u2013 he was very good at grasping these chances.It was just that the Liang Family didn\u2019t have a long history. They had made a great fortune seemingly overnight, so were noveau riche; not many people were interested in getting to know him.\u201cIt\u2019s true that she\u2019s not blood-related. But\u2026\u201d Hu Chen lit up a cigarette. \u201cDo you see anyone here daring to treat her rudely?\u201dLiang Ziheng\u2019s face revealed that he was willing to learn.The young man was promising and worthy enough to be taught.Hu Chen generously shared his knowledge. \u201cThe Cao Family has acknowledged her. At their banquet, she stood together with Cao Yang and the rest. Even for other occasions, Cao Yang brings her along personally.\u201dIn actuality, Hu Chen also liked Xia Rou. Though she wasn\u2019t too bright, she was well-aware of herself. To be able to live that way, she was already smarter than most others.He thought that was probably why she had been accepted so readily into the Cao Family. With their backing, she had turned from an orphan to a princess.\u201cSo one could\u00a0 think of her as adopted?\u201d Liang Ziheng asked.\u201cIt\u2019s similar enough, I guess. There wasn\u2019t any official ceremony, but since they\u2019ve acknowledged her, it\u2019s much more powerful than any other formality. Though her surname is Xia, she\u2019s the Cao Family\u2019s only girl. No one dares treat her rudely,\u201d answered Hu Chen. The last sentence seemed like an explanation, but was more of a warning.Liang Ziheng began to think deeply.Another song started up as he stared discreetly at Xia Rou in the crowd and mulling something over.When Xia Rou looked at him, he briefly thought of inviting her to dance. But her gaze as she looked at him was way too cold, so he hesitated.Then she turned away, seeming to ignore him. He felt slightly regretful and could only give up.It was probably because they were not yet close, he thought. Though she was adopted, she seemed to have a temper just like any other young miss, tsk.But this kind of girl should be easier to coax when compared to other, genuine wealthy daughters, right? She also had a beautiful face.And most importantly, though her surname wasn\u2019t Cao, she could be said to be the same as a Cao Family daughter.And as a daughter of the Cao Family, the fact that her surname wasn\u2019t Cao was the best part.So, thought Liang Ziheng, there would be more opportunities in the future.The slow dance song ended, and the DJ spun his disks to change the music from soothing to noisy. The waiters switched on the LED lights and the atmosphere in the room became energetic.This was originally a party for the younger generations. This kind of atmosphere suited them.The slow dance songs before were obviously arranged well beforehand to serve as a backdrop for the main character princess today.The manager of the club even brought in two sexy dancers to follow the beat and dance on poles of the main stage.This had all been arranged. Translated by The NovelstThe party was being thrown for a girl, and this party was mixed-gender, and most importantly, there were people milling around that were the same age as Xia Rou, who had followed their older brothers and sisters to the party.So though the dancers were sexy, they didn\u2019t wear revealing outfits, nor did they bust out any of their erotic dance moves. Their main goal was to set the mood.A group of men and women began to crowd together to dance.Cao Yang had already outgrown this kind of thing, so he and a few others were sitting to the side, drinking and throwing dice.Occasionally, he would take a glance at the dance floor. He saw Xia Rou being pulled in to dance, her waist slim and legs long, and shorts tight around her hips. She looked quite charming as she twisted her body under the flashing lights.Cao Yang stared at her for a while.Soon, he realized that he wasn\u2019t the only one staring at Xia Rou.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026This little girl, she was quite entrancing!Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then she understood how he had come to be at Wang Man\u2019s birthday party \u2013 Hu Chen brought him.Of course, she also saw him using every method he had to flatter Hu Chen, being very attentive.In the past, she hadn\u2019t been familiar with this kind of thing. During her high school years, Cao Yang didn\u2019t bring her along to these kinds of occasions. It was only after she had matured a little and revealed her desire to attend, and then he would sometimes bring her along.That was why she didn\u2019t know until now that the Liang Family was connected to those at the top only because of their careful treatment of the Hu Family.So in the past, when she single-mindedly pursued her goal of marrying into the Liang Family\u2026 Not even to mention how Cao Yang and the others had seen that, but how ridiculous had she looked in the eyes of the Hu Family?All the things that had happened in the past \u2013 though there were some memories she wanted to clutch tightly in case they disappeared, there were more that were so embarrassing she hoped to forget them.However, the memories she wanted to keep close had begun to fade, while the embarrassing moments stuck to her like glue.Xia Rou covered her face\u2026 Suddenly, she felt someone pulling at her arm.She lowered her hands to look at the young boy that was about her age.\u201cXia Rou!\u201d he shouted in her ear. \u201cWant to get a drink?\u201dAlcohol? Translated by The NovelstXia Rou was touched.But she still remembered that she was only seventeen, so she turned around to look at Cao Yang.He was looking at her then, his brow furrowed.That expression overlapped with the past\u2026Cao Yang hadn\u2019t done as Xia Rou had expected by staying by Wang Man the entire time.Wang Man, in reality, just came by to greet and stay a bit, before she had to leave to entertain other guests. After all, she was the guest of honor, so she had to take care of it all.Cao Yang started to play cards with others, before realizing that there was a boy tugging Xia Rou and whispering in her ear.He was too close.Cao Yang unconsciously furrowed his brows.Not long after, he dragged Xia Rou all the way to where Cao Yang was sitting. He smiled broadly, asking, \u201cBrother Cao Yang, can Xia Rou drink alcohol? She said I have to ask you for permission.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s fruit wine, so not too strong.\u201dXia Rou also looked at him, looking very excited.At least she knew to ask him first. Cao Yang was pleased inside.Except for a few exceptions, all the people in the room were the younger generations of the most powerful families in the city. Everyone knew each other well, and even better was that Cao Yang was there.\u201cLook after her properly. Don\u2019t drink too much,\u201d he said.He agreed. The two youngsters ran off with a smile.In a while, Cao Yang realized he was a little drunk, and he hadn\u2019t seen Xia Rou for some time.He had just finished a round of cards, so he put his hand down to go look for her. He found a few young ones lying on their sides, having drank too much while the older siblings hadn\u2019t been paying attention\u2026Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis bunch of wild kids!Cao Yang called out to the others, and a few people heard and gathered. When they saw the situation\u2026 they were flabbergasted.Bringing the small ones out to play and letting them drink to this state, in the end the ones to be scolded when they returned was still the older brothers and sisters!\u201cYou little brat!\u201d One of the sisters was angry and pinched her younger brother\u2019s ear.The little brother was still giggling foolishly.The older siblings were helpless.Fortunately, the party was almost over, so it wasn\u2019t too impolite for them to leave. So they called the waiters for their coats, and summoned their drivers.Cao Yang wore his coat and wrapped Xia Rou up.Xia Rou was so drunk her face was the color of a blooming hibiscus. She couldn\u2019t stand properly, so she leaned against Cao Yang as he used both arms to support her.Cao Yang looked around, wanting to let Wang Man know he was leaving. She found him instead.\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d she laughed.\u201cA bunch of wild kids happened, that\u2019s what. We didn\u2019t check up on them for just an instant, and they\u2019re already like this,\u201d Cao Yang said, also helpless.\u201cHow much did they drink? I specifically prepared fruit wines, the alcohol content is very low,\u201d Wang Man was shocked.\u201cThey\u2019re probably not good drinkers yet, they\u2019re so young. Normally they\u2019re not allowed to drink at home,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving first.\u201d\u201cAlright, keep in touch,\u201d Wang Man smiled and nodded.Her gaze followed his figure as he held Xia Rou and left, before returning to entertain another few guests.When she finally made it to the sofa to rest a while, she was tired.Her gaze filtered through the presents piled on the sofa. With just a glance, she found that a thin, long box was addressed to her from Cao Yang.This was because she had put it away by itself in a corner\u2026What would it be, this kind of long box?A bracelet?Curiosity won out. Wang Man peeked at her surroundings. Her guests were still partying happily, so no one would pay special attention to her\u2026She sat there, unwrapping the box eagerly.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026A fountain pen?Well, it was her favorite brand. The price for this model would probably be around ten or twenty thousand.With their current relationship, and as a birthday present given between the younger generation, this was still quite rare. It fit perfectly with Cao Yang\u2019s identity.But\u2026 Translated by The NovelstInside the box, there was a rectangular card. She took it out and saw in sky-blue ink embellished with the dramatic flourishes of a fountain pen:\u3010Happy birthday.\u2013 Cao Yang\u3011His writing was nice and powerful.Just like his personality.Wang Man somehow felt a little disappointed.She had a few run-ins with Cao Yang lately, and she believed he had the same thoughts as her\u2026 they were testing the waters.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It meant that they were on the same page: they were both looking for a future partner.But their courtship process had been so bland, like a cup of water. They were perhaps only slightly more familiar with each other when compared to their first meeting.Originally, she thought their relationship might grow on her birthday. But giving her such a present\u2026 She couldn\u2019t puzzle out what it meant.In the past, no matter where Wang Man went, she was always the moon surrounded by a myriad of stars, being pursued enthusiastically by men. She had never imagined that she herself could be swayed by a man.She couldn\u2019t help it and let out a sigh. Translated by The Novelst\u2026\u2026Xia Rou was unable to walk alone, still mumbling to herself.Cao Yang dragged her for quite a distance before simply bending down to carry her in his arms. She was slim, so the weight in his arms was light, which was much easier than dragging her along.On the road, a few fellow guests thought he\u2019d picked up a drunk girl. Her face was hidden in his chest so they couldn\u2019t see it, but they could still see her slim waist and long legs through the coat that covered her. She looked like a beauty.Their gazes as they looked at Cao Yang were envious.He had just gone to war and had injuries from bullets. Though he was dressed casually, a simple glare from him made their hearts tremble, so they immediately turned their gazes away.Xiao Yang had brought the car around to the entrance. When he saw Cao Yang carrying Xia Rou, he ran to open the door: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI let my attention wander for a little and she had drunk herself to this state,\u201d he said, his tone displeased.Xiao Yang laughed as he buckled the seatbelt, \u201cIsn\u2019t this her first time drinking? It\u2019s natural she would get drunk.\u201d\u201cRaising a girl is so troublesome,\u201d Cao Yang said, rubbing the furrow between his brows.\u201cI can\u2019t agree more. If you raised a girl like you raised a boy, wouldn\u2019t you let her run wild?\u201d Xiao Yang also had a little sister. He knew the feeling. \u201cThen wouldn\u2019t you worry about her day and night, afraid that she might get bullied or deceived by a bad guy?\u201dHe really spoke to the feeling in Cao Yang\u2019s heart.When the car began to move, it shifted due to a bump in the road. With just that brief shake, Xia Rou almost rolled off the seat.Cao Yang, his hands quick, immediately stopped this from happening.She couldn\u2019t even lie down properly! Cao Yang could only hold onto her and let her drift away in his arms.The light of the streetlamps shone steadily into the car. He could see that her eyes were closed, her face like a peach blossom, but her eyebrows were furrowed.Was she dreaming of something unhappy? Both her hands were wound tightly into his clothes\u2026Xia Rou dreamt of a lot of people, and a lot of things.She felt like she was floating above the clouds, but kept sinking down, and down, and down\u2026 in the end, she stopped at that day\u2026The day she died.The Liang Family had used her to borrow the Cao Family\u2019s power to obtain a government contract and something had gone wrong. She had powered through the shame and begged Cao Yang, only to see her fianc\u00e9 embracing another woman while she was busy running about for him.And he even scolded her for having issues.The anger she felt at that point was unimaginable.They quarreled, they fought.The apartment was a duplex, with two floors empty. During the fight she had used too much strength and gone over the railing. Below that railing was a porcelain vase about half her height.As she lay dying on the floor she could see that there was sharp glass pierced through her body.The blood flowed out\u2026Her strength faded, bit by bit\u2026The twenty years of her life played back into her mind like a revolving lantern.And in the very end, it stopped at a frame with Cao Yang.Just two hours before, she had met with him. It was the last time she saw him in life.She could still remember the furious look on his face\u2026And in the end, when he looked at her, the gloom in his eyes.She didn\u2019t dare raise her head\u2026 Because of the Liang Family, she could only lower her head in front of him, for pity.They had known each other for ten years and it was the first time that he had used such a hopeless gaze when looking at her.Finally, even her big brother was\u2026 disgusted with her, huh?\u201cBig brother, don\u2019t hate me! Please don\u2019t hate me!\u201d Xia Rou begged, crying loudly as she clutched Cao Yang\u2019s neck. \u201cSorry! I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m really sorry!\u201dShe kept crying, repeating her apology.What had she done that she had to apologize to him like this? Cao Yang couldn\u2019t imagine.Also, when had he said he hated her? She even dared to frown at him when he was drunk, how he wished he could record his and let her see herself!\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. Don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, okay?\u201d Cao Yang comforted her patiently.He hugged her and softly patted her back.Xia Rou was truly very drunk. She continued to cry and didn\u2019t stop.After whimpering for some time, she suddenly fisted her hands tightly into his clothes and shouted, \u201cLiang Ziheng is a bastard! Big brother! Liang Ziheng is a bastard! \u2026 is a bastard!\u201d\u201cBig brother! You must take revenge for me! Revenge for me\u2026 Huhuuu\u2026 Avenge me\u2026\u201dXia Rou kept crying, shouting, and with her other hand punched his chest.The moment she said those words, both Cao Yang and Xiao Yang\u2019s expressions changed.Cao Yang had always been a calm and collected person. He stretched his hand into Xia Rou\u2019s coat and touched her waist.Her shirt was still tucked into her pants and didn\u2019t look messy. Inside the party, he had only taken his attention off her for a small period of time, which was while she was drinking. But when he found her she was together with a few peers, and they had obviously not left after they got drunk.Even if she had gone to the bathroom, that was also in the same room as the party. And anyhow, she had no reason to leave the room.Cao Yang was relieved.He lifted his gaze to see Xiao Yang\u2019s worried gaze in the rearview mirror.\u201cShe\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. Translated by The NovelstXiao Yang let out a sigh of relief.He had been scared to death!\u201cXiao Yang,\u201d Cao Yang asked, \u201cWho is Liang Ziheng?\u201dThe name wasn\u2019t familiar, so it was probably someone from her school.Xiao Yang held onto the steering wheel and looked ahead of him. After thinking hard, he stated firmly, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a person before.\u201dThe backseat was silent. Cao Yang\u2019s voice sounded after a while, \u201cTomorrow, go and get the surveillance video from the club.\u201dProofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He murmured comforting words into her ear.Slowly, Xia Rou began to calm\u2026She leaned on him, mumbling, and tried to shrink herself smaller, sticking her hand into his coat.There were still tears at the corners of her eyes. As she moved, the tears moved to streak down her cheeks, leaving a faint trail on her pale face.Cao Yang stared at her face in the darkness before using his thumb to rub that line away.Then he closed his eyes. Translated by The NovelstAs the car arrived at the entrance to the house, Xiao Yang called him twice. Only then did he open his eyes.Compared to the kids who had gone wild, the alcohol he had downed were all spirits. The after-effects were quite evident.\u201cDo you want me to do it?\u201d Xiao Yang leaned on the car door.Cao Yang took a long, slow blink. He swung his head from side to side and replied, \u201cNo need.\u201dXiao Yang backed away. Cao Yang stretched his long legs out of the car and carried Xia Rou out.The sudden drop in temperature caused the person in his arms to shiver.Xiao Yang had already opened the door to the house for Cao Yang to enter. He took the elevator to the second floor, kicking open Xia Rou\u2019s bedroom door to place her on her bed.As he stood up to leave he found himself being hugged very tightly by Xia Rou. She called out, softly, \u201cBig brother\u2026\u201dCao Yang was taken aback.He looked at her closely, but her eyes were still closed and she was frowning. She was obviously still drunk and hadn\u2019t woken.He wanted to shake off her hands, but he heard her mumble: \u201cBig brother\u2026 Don\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t hate me\u2026\u201dTears dropped from her eyes again.Why did she like to cry so much?Cao Yang\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but soften.\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t hate you\u2026\u201d he said in a low tone.His arms stretched to encompass her form and he hugged her again. He stayed like that, embracing her, half-sitting.He was thinking that all he needed to do was comfort her and then he would return to his room\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026He woke up very suddenly, so bleary he couldn\u2019t guess how long he\u2019d slept. The room was still pitch-black, evidently still night.He was still tipsy, a little dizzy.And the reason he woke up was because of the person in his arms, squirming around uncomfortably\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cWater\u2026\u201d Xia Rou\u2019s voice was scratchy.Cao Yang rubbed his temples, getting up to pour her a glass of water.Xia Rou hadn\u2019t fully come to her senses yet, so she didn\u2019t move from the bed.Cao Yang was also a little dizzy and had a bit of a headache. He sat down at her bedside and helped her get up and steady her.Seeing that she didn\u2019t move, he shook her slightly. \u201cDrink the water.\u201dShe didn\u2019t budge.Seeing that he had no other choice, he held her and brought the cup to her lips to feed her a few sips.Xia Rou blearily opened her eyes, but when she saw that it was Cao Yang, she was at ease and closed her eyes once more\u2026The water dripped out from the corner of her mouth to follow the lines of her jaw and down her neck\u2026Even in the dark, Cao Yang could see the glistening of the water along her body clearly.He put the glass on the bedside table and slowly lifted his hand.His fingertips brushed softly against Xia Rou\u2019s lips\u2026 They looked like flower petals and the feeling was comparable to the silky smoothness of a flower petal\u2026Cao Yang\u2019s thumb rubbed softly against those tender lips\u2026He followed the water traces all the way down from her lower jaw to her slim neck.Xia Rou was still nestled in his arms, her head tilted backwards, completely exposing her neck to him.This was a defenseless woman.The man\u2019s hand traced that slim neck softly and felt that all he needed to do was expend a little bit of strength and he could have her life in his hands. Or perhaps it was that he didn\u2019t need to use any strength at all for that.The arms hugging her tightened suddenly and in the dark, the harshness of Cao Yang\u2019s breathing seemed to be oddly paced\u2026He hugged Xia Rou tightly and pressed her head to his chest.His body began to calm as his heart did.He softly released her to let her sleep in comfort.Then he stood up and stared quietly at her in the dark for some time.Before he left, he pulled up the blanket to cover her and picked up the coat dropped on the floor.The next day, Xia Rou\u2019s head was pounding as she levered herself off the bed. She could see her reflection showing a pale, white, ghost-like face staring back in the mirror.Her throat was dry and painful, and she felt so disgusting she wanted to vomit. So she spent half the day retching futilely over the washbasin and felt a little bit better.She was still wearing yesterday\u2019s clothes and one sniff revealed that they smelled like smoke. She quickly disrobed and took a hot shower.When she appeared in the dining room, she looked much more refreshed, but her face was still white as a sheet.\u201cSecond brother, good morning\u2026 Fourth brother, morning\u2026\u201dAfter her feeble greeting, Xia Rou slammed her face onto the table.\u201cGood morning, Sadako,\u201d Cao Bin greeted with a laugh.Cao An let out a tsk and poked her head to ask, \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d\u201cWhere is third brother?\u201d Xia Rou\u2019s voice was weak.\u201cHe went to ski. You look like you\u2019re running out of breath,\u201d Cao Yang replied.\u201cIt\u2019s not so far anymore\u2026\u201d Xia Rou felt like she was actually dying. She moaned painfully, \u201cMy head hurts\u2026\u201d\u201cYou drank?\u201d Cao An was surprised. \u201cBig brother let you drink?\u201d\u201cI could drink because he was there\u2026\u201d she explained weakly.Cao An thought about it. It made sense. If there was no one to look after her, who would be rest assured enough to let her drink alone?Cao Bin had already rung the hotline on the wall to reach the kitchen: \u201cChef Zheng, is there any sobering soup left? We have ourselves a little drunkard here\u2026\u201dCao An took off the lid to a bowl on the dining table, ladling out a bowl of porridge for Xia Rou: \u201cWarm your stomach first.\u201dXia Rou took the spoon and had a few bites, before asking, \u201cWhere is big brother?\u201d\u201cYou think big brother is like you? Big brother got up before all of us and has already eaten,\u201d replied Cao An. \u201cHe\u2019s in the audiovisual room. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing there.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Xia Rou didn\u2019t care much. Translated by The NovelstCao Yang was indeed alone inside the audiovisual room, looking at the surveillance video of the birthday party. Xiao Yang had already rushed back to the club to get this video the night before, and he had presented it to Cao Yang in the morning.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It looked as though she hadn\u2019t left the party room the entire night. He was relieved.As he watched the video, he noticed a small thing: just as they arrived at the party, after Xia Rou had greeted a few people, her body suddenly stiffened up.When he paused that moment and zoomed in, he could see the side of a face he recognized: Hu Chen.Though Hu Chen was quite lusty, he was also a smart person with a good grasp of boundaries. Cao Yang was rest assured of him.He zoomed in closer to look in detail, and he realized that Xia Rou was still smiling as she looked at Hu Chen. The moment her expression changed was when Hu Chen drew nearer.Cao Yang watched that part twice before realizing\u2026 As Hu Chen moved his body, Xia Rou probably saw the person behind him.He fast forwarded a little to see that person from the front. He was quite a handsome young man, and Cao Yang had a vague recollection of seeing him before at Hu Chen\u2019s side.He called Hu Chen. Translated by The Novelst\u201cBrother Yang?\u201d Hu Chen\u2019s voice was a little hoarse, having obviously just woken up. No one knew how late he stayed last night.\u201cYesterday there was a young man with you. He looks good, who is he?\u201d Cao Yang asked.Hu Chen let out a long \u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d as he processed the question, since his brain wasn\u2019t quite at peak performance. After a few seconds, he finally answered, \u201cOh, Xiao Liang?\u201dLiang\u2026Big brother, Liang Ziheng is a bastard!Cao Yang\u2019s tone was calm. \u201cWho is he?\u201dHu Chen didn\u2019t know the reason for Cao Yang\u2019s sudden interest in Liang Ziheng, but since he had called specifically to ask, something was off. He pushed away the woman on him, sitting up straight to rub his eyes.Thinking it over for a minute, he answered, \u201cHis name is Liang Ziheng. His family works in engineering. His mother passed away two years ago, and his father remarried last year. His stepmother is my mother\u2019s very extended relative; we aren\u2019t related by blood, but he comes down to our house frequently.\u201d\u201cBrother Yang, why are you asking about him?\u201d he asked.\u201cNothing much. Do me a favor and sound him out,\u201d Cao Yang said. \u201cSee whether he has anything to do with our Xiao Rou.\u201dHu Chen was a little surprised, not having imagined that this was about Xia Rou. He quickly recalled the happenings of the previous night and more specifically, the way Xia Rou\u2019s expression changed when she saw Liang Ziheng.That expression, that gaze\u2026 it looked like she had seen her enemy.\u201cAlright, leave it to me,\u201d he said immediately.Hu Chen gave Cao Yang the results of his search the next day.\u201cIt was Xiao Liang\u2019s first time meeting Xiao Rou. He was really surprised, he felt that Xiao Rou was quite beautiful. Other than that, there\u2019s nothing between them,\u201d said Hu Chen.\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d Hu Chen was positive.Hu Chen was a smart person and Cao Yang was confident in his abilities. Since he said that was all, there was probably nothing else.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Hu Chen hesitated a moment.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cXiao Rou\u2026 Could it be that she knew Xiao Liang before? The way she looked that night\u2026 It didn\u2019t seem like the first time she\u2019s met him. It\u2019s like something happened between them. She doesn\u2019t seem to like Xiao Liang,\u201d he said to Cao Yang.\u201c\u2026 I got it,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201dHe hung up. Hu Chen took a glance at the screen before putting away his phone.There was another thing he hadn\u2019t told Cao Yang. When he was questioning Liang Ziheng, he seemed excited when he brought up Xia Rou and had asked many questions about her.When he learned she was only seventeen and that she was still in her junior year, he had revealed an obvious disappointment on his face.His aspirations were quite high! It was probably because Xia Rou\u2019s surname wasn\u2019t Cao, huh.Hu Chen knew that Liang Ziheng was the only child of the Liang Family. In the last few years, his father had been allowing him to try and manage the family business.Though the Liang Family\u2019s business wasn\u2019t good enough to pique his interest, he still liked to see Liang Ziheng\u2019s wild ambitions.Xia Rou\u2026Xia Rou was quite a likeable child. It was too bad that she wasn\u2019t surnamed Cao.Hu Chen remembered that just this morning his little brother who was still abroad had brought her up as they videochatted.At such a young age she was so good at seducing men\u2026If the Cao Family really intended to raise her as a daughter, even if her surname wasn\u2019t Cao, she wasn\u2019t someone that Liang Ziheng could touch. If it was his foolish little brother, then maybe that would be possible\u2026But\u2026He thought back to the party again. He saw Xia Rou rocking to the music on the dance floor, with that small waist\u2026He lit up a cigarette and pulled two deep inhales. The corner of his mouth quirked into a smile.The Cao crown prince\u2026 liked small waists, too.When Cao Yang was on the phone with Hu Chen, he was still out and about. He only returned home at night.When he saw Xia Rou at dinner, she had already recovered. Her face was white and slightly pink, her skin shining with youthful radiance. Her eyes curved into crescents when she smiled to reveal her white teeth.As long as she was there, the atmosphere at the dining table was very relaxing and joyful.She had brought warmth to the house.He observed her during their meal, and could only see the gentle and calm attitude on her face. As soon as the heavy learning had ended, she looked very relaxed.He couldn\u2019t see even a hint of the sorrow of that night when she had clutched at him and cried in grievance.She hadn\u2019t been acting.

The day of the party, Brother Hu Chen brought him along,\u201d she said, smiling after she calmed down.The smile was so reluctant and her acting was very poor, was all Cao Yang thought.Xia Rou even acted cheerfully to ask, \u201cWhy are you asking about him?\u201dCao Yang lit up a cigarette. \u201cYesterday you were so drunk you cried the entire time and kept cursing his name.\u201dHe let out a puff of smoke, staring at her: \u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201dXia Rou felt the smile on her face stiffen.She was very clear that her acting skills couldn\u2019t deceive Cao Yang. But she really couldn\u2019t explain it away, so she could only continue to act.\u201cI can\u2019t remember anymore. I must have had too much to drink and started babbling nonsense,\u201d she answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know him that well, anyways.\u201dCao Yang bit down on his cigarette. Under his gaze, her back began to sweat as she gritted her teeth, trying to withstand the attention.When he called Hu Chen, he remembered seeing Liang Ziheng around before, once or twice. Mostly he had seem him trailing Hu Chen very attentively.And the occasions he remembered him from, thinking back\u2026 Xia Rou had been there too. It was possible that she had met him before this.Though that kid\u2019s background was quite mediocre, he had a good-looking face.He stared at Xia Rou, looking carefully at her.He had experience with a lot of women, and so had practice in inspecting people. Just by her attitude he could confirm she was still a virgin.Even if she had been deceived by a bad guy, at least she hadn\u2019t lost too much.Seeing her cry so sadly that day, it seemed like she cared about that kid\u2026 Since she wasn\u2019t willing to tell him, he decided he wouldn\u2019t force her any longer.Just when he thought this, he heard her say, \u201cBig brother, my stomach hurts, I think I might have eaten something bad\u2026 I-I need to go to the bathroom\u2026\u201dCao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d Translated by The NovelstIn order to escape this topic, she had even used the poop trick!Cao Yang gritted his teeth, his face darkening. He waved his hand at her.Xia Rou was glad to be free, acting painfully, covering her stomach and trying to flee.\u201cXiao Rou!\u201d Cao Yang called after her.\u201cHm?\u201d Xia Rou turned around at the entrance.\u201cWhenever\u2026\u201d he said, \u201cNo matter what kind of person or matter you run into \u2013 don\u2019t let anyone bully you.\u201d\u201cIf anything happens, you must come back to tell me.\u201d\u201cDo you understand?\u201dA whole-hearted smile took over Xia Rou\u2019s face.\u201cMn!\u201d she replied. \u201cOf course!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Cao Yang said, \u201cYour stomach isn\u2019t hurting anymore?\u201dXia Rou: \u201c\u2026!!\u201dShe quickly ran away.Cao Yang let out a tsk and laughed.He flicked the cigarette ash into the ashtray, then decided to make a call.\u201cHelp me check on someone,\u201d he said. \u201cCheck if\u2026 the person has anything to do with our Xia Rou.\u201d\u201cMn, his name is Liang Ziheng\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Wang Man sat at the window, looking at the unmelted snow on the road, bored.She looked at her watch\u2026 twenty minutes. That person was already twenty minutes late.She felt that ever since she had returned to the country, her patience had improved. She would actually wait for a man and tolerate him being over twenty minutes late.If this was the past, she would have left early. But from the beginning to now, she didn\u2019t have any intention of leaving. Now that she thought about it, she found herself\u2026 unbelievable.Her phone rang. It was that person \u2013 she waited two rings and then picked up, speaking slowly in a soothing tone: \u201cHello?\u201dThe man\u2019s voice was deep like a cello. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m here. Are you still here?\u201dWang Man smiled. \u201cYes. Walk inside and turn right, I\u2019m near the window.\u201d\u201cI see you.\u201dHe hung up.Wang Man turned to see Cao Yang.He was in a black uniform with a black cashmere coat. Under the hat, his sharp eyes peered out.He tucked his phone away and strode toward her.Wang Man felt that the little unhappiness she felt in waiting was dispersed by his powerful footsteps, so she put down her phone and smiled.\u201cI\u2019m really sorry\u2026\u201d he took off his coat and hung it off the back of his chair before taking off his hat and apologizing. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect my boss to look for me all of a sudden.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already ordered two dishes that are going to be a while,\u201d she said, pushing the menu to him. \u201cYou should order some more.\u201dCao Yang smiled, \u201cYou can order for me. We\u2019re northerners, the two of us, so our tastes should run the same.\u201dWang Man smiled back and ordered more vegetables and noodles.As he had expected, it fit Cao Yang\u2019s tastes very well.\u201cHow was your New Years\u2019 visit down to your hometown?\u201d Cao Yang asked.With the smile on his face, he looked much gentler.Handsome and charming. Translated by The Novelst\u201cIt\u2019s so much colder than it is here. I can\u2019t get used to it,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhat about you? Did you go back to your hometown?\u201d\u201cNo. Ever since my grandparents passed away, we haven\u2019t returned. My father left his hometown very early and all my brothers were born here\u2026\u201dThe couple sitting by the window, chatting and laughing, exuded a harmonious atmosphere.They both had excellent appearances. The woman had an outstanding temperament, and the man was wearing an army uniform and sitting straight, masculinity in every line of his form.Even the guests who walked by took a few more glances.The atmosphere of the dinner was great, but Wang Man felt irritation in her heart.As usual, there was no progress\u2026Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But each time was the same. Though the atmosphere seemed harmonious, the contents of their conversation were actually quite plain.They spoke of the news, exchanged some information and talked about a few other casual topics.They hadn\u2019t gone deeper in their conversations before. They never spoke of their relationship or pushing forward.Instead of classifying their meeting as a date, it was more like a friendly meet-up. Although\u2026 they had started seeing each other as friends.But\u2026 Translated by The NovelstWang Man felt that compared to all the other men she had encountered previously, Cao Yang was the only man who could retain his composure in front of her.The other men who had pursued her \u2013 some were enthusiastic, and some were shy, but all of them clearly expressed that they were interested in her.Facing those interests, it was always her who maintained her composure.Now she finally had a taste of how the other side felt.This feeling was uncomfortable.But she was Wang Man with her own arrogance. She enjoyed being wined and dined, and couldn\u2019t just forget abou that.Even if she wanted to take the first step, she could only do it vaguely.When they finished eating, they walked out of the restaurant together. Cao Yang asked, \u201cWhere did you park your car?\u201dWang Man answered, \u201cI sent it to be serviced. I took a taxi here.\u201dHearing that, he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a ride home.\u201dNaturally, she didn\u2019t reject the idea. On the road they talked and laughed, the atmosphere very good.They arrived before the gates of Governor Wang\u2019s house. Wang Man thanked him and got off the car, not saying anything about inviting him in. With the state of their current relationship, it was too much to even consider bringing him to meet her family.But when she looked at Cao Yang who waved her goodbye and drove casually off, she stood for a while in front of the gates, alone and feeling lost in her heart.She turned around at the sound of another black car driving to the gate. Wang Man stood still.\u201cXiao Man,\u201d he called.Wang Man smiled and went to tuck her hand into the crook of her father\u2019s arm. \u201cYou\u2019re home so early today?\u201dGovernor Wang nodded. They walked together as he asked, \u201cJust now, was that Cao Yang?\u201dWang Man let out a \u201cmn.\u201dHe was concerned, \u201cHow are the two of you?\u201d\u201cJust like that.\u201d Even before her father she didn\u2019t want to lower herself, so she responded very lightly.But no matter what, a father could always understand his own daughter. He could hear the repressed note of disappointment in her plain tone.\u201cNo need to rush,\u201d he comforted her. \u201cYou\u2019re not old yet. You can take it slow.\u201dHe added, \u201cStay in the county for a while and get your qualifications. Then I can transfer you back in a few months.\u201dWang Man was a little anxious. Of course she knew that she needed her qualifications from the base first \u2013 it was the most important step of her career.But because she worked in the county, she could only return to the city once every one or two weeks, so it was inconvenient for her to be able to meet Cao Yang.She felt that one of the largest reasons their relationship hadn\u2019t progressed to the next step was because they didn\u2019t meet often enough. They only saw one another about two times a month, and each time they met their feelings would fade a little, and it was like they were starting from the beginning each time.But she couldn\u2019t rush things now. She had already put so much time into her work at the county; she couldn\u2019t just give up halfway.All she could do was\u2026 wait until she was transferred back into the city and try again\u2026\u201cYou and Wang Man\u2026\u201d Cao Xiong began when he sat with his eldest after dinner, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\u201cJust like that,\u201d Cao Yang replied.Cao Xiong wasn\u2019t pleased with Cao Yang\u2019s obvious attitude. He scolded him, \u201cPut your heart into it!\u201dCao Yang was helpless: \u201cI\u2019m already doing my best.\u201dHe paused before continuing: \u201cShe\u2019s currently working in the county, so she\u2019s not home that often. She can\u2019t meet me every time she returns.\u201dCao Xiong thought back, \u201cShe\u2019s been there for nearly a year. It\u2019s almost time that she\u2019s transferred back.\u201dCao Yang didn\u2019t express any reaction. \u201cMm.\u201dCao Xiong\u2019s finger tapped softly on table: \u201cNo need for you to rush. Just take it slowly\u2026\u201d\u201cMost importantly,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhat do you think about her?\u201dCao Yang stilled in his motion to pick up the teacup. He thought deeply for a bit, before responding properly, \u201cShe excels in various aspects.\u201dCao Xiong puffed on his cigarette and let out a cloud of smoke, brows slightly furrowed and not responding.He did not continue to force the conversation along.He was already in his fifties. His experience in life told him there was no doubt that the best of the best would attract each other. But\u2026 in choosing a life partner, the only consideration was not whether they were excellent in all aspects.When Cao Yang first met Wang Man, he had already admired that about her. So he got in touch with her with sincerity.Just as Cao Xiong was saying, he had really gotten to the age where he needed to start thinking about settling down.He had been single until now not only because he hadn\u2019t settled his heart, but also because he hadn\u2019t encountered any women who could make him eager to marry.Just looking at her, Wang Man was obviously the best choice in every aspect, including her family background, knowledge, abilities, and appearance. Because of that, he had first become interested in her and they were testing the waters.After a few of their not-quite-dates, he knew he indeed admired her.However, it was nothing that made his heart pound.At least, Wang Man wasn\u2019t able to make him think of taking their relationship further. Currently it was in a state of an almost but not quite relationship.Just like that, the two maintained their lukewarm relations and continued to keep in contact.At this point, Xia Rou didn\u2019t have the time to worry after Cao Yang any longer.In her second semester as a senior, it was the last chance for her to go all out before she began university.Two months after the start of school, Xia Rou handed Cao Yang a notice. \u201cNah.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cParent meeting.\u201dAh, that\u2019s right.

Have you already thought about your university?\u201dXia Rou handed over a list of the universities she was interested in to Cao Yang.In this life, because she had attended a great school like Nan Hua, her standing was much better than in the past though her grades could still be considered below average. That was why that the universities she had chosen this time were much better.With the little improvements she strove to make\u2026 she was happy with herself.He looked at the list wordlessly, folding the paper to keep it well.Then he said, \u201cDon\u2019t think about anything else, focus on your studies.\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Xia Rou nodded. Translated by The NovelstThe first and most important thing was to face the national university entrance exam.In that revision-intensive high-stress environment, time passed quickly.On the 7th and 8th of June, it seemed even the streets were filled with a tense atmosphere.The Cao Family didn\u2019t expect to see Xia Rou not nervous at all. They had expected her to be too nervous to even eat breakfast.But the child was calm, her condition excellent.Cao Xiong looked at her with pride, encouraging her, \u201cGood luck on your exams.\u201d\u201cMn!\u201d Xia Rou smiled.She was really not nervous at all.The national university entrance exam \u2013 she had already experienced it once.And in this life, she understood that this exam was just a way to record her ability. The Cao Family was the one to give her a future.When a person had something to fall back on, someone to depend on, that person would have confidence.All her hard work was just to prove herself and put herself at ease.On the first day, Cao Yang and Cao An drove her to school and picked her up together.On the second day, Cao Yang had pressing matters, so it was only Cao An that ferried her to school. But in the afternoon, both brothers showed up to pick her up.After the nonstop examinations over two days, Xia Rou was calm but very tired.When she returned home, she immediately flung herself into bed.Cao Yang came by to knock on her door. She didn\u2019t open it, instead wearily saying, \u201cThe door\u2019s not locked\u2026\u201dHe opened the door himself and saw her sprawled out on her bed like a dead dog.\u201cGet up,\u201d he said, nudging her bed. \u201cCome down to eat.\u201d\u201cWhy so early?\u201d\u201cIf I don\u2019t call you early, you won\u2019t come down on time.\u201dActually, Cao Yang wanted to speak to her about her major, but the way she looked now\u2026 He thought he should let her rest for a few days first, so he didn\u2019t say anything but called her down to eat.Xia Rou said, \u201cI\u2019m already dead. Just put the chopsticks on my rice.\u201dCao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe stretched out his hands to drag her up.The atmosphere at the dining table was very relaxed. Xia Rou had eaten a lot today.\u201cI used up too much brainpower,\u201d she complained.\u201cYeah,\u201d Cao An looked at her with pity. \u201cYour brain cells were lacking in the first place and now you\u2019ve used them all up.\u201dXia Rou acted like she wanted to use her chopsticks to stab him, and the entire table laughed.She was asked what her plans were for after the exams. Xia Rou\u2019s eyes shone: \u201cSo many things!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to buy clothes! Perm my hair! Do my nails! I\u2019ve already set a date to go shopping with my classmates!\u201dCao Xiong, Cao Yang, and Cao An: \u201c\u2026\u201dHaiz, no matter what she was a girl! The men thought.\u201cI want to color my hair,\u201d she said, pulling the hair from her ponytail over her shoulder. \u201cFourth brother, which color do you think is the best?\u201dBefore Cao An could answer, Cao Yang rejected the idea for him: \u201cDon\u2019t dye your hair, you look good as you are now.\u201dCao An felt his big brother was being too bossy. Just as he was going to speak up, he heard Xia Rou pipe up in a weak voice: \u201cThen\u2026 Can I perm it a little? Just the ends?\u201dCao An: \u201c\u2026\u201d He was so mad he felt his eyes rolling around in his sockets.What a spineless little girl!He had already noticed it early on \u2013 this little girl had a sharp tongue when arguing with him, but was so obedient when confronting his big brother. Whatever his big brother said, she would listen.Look, she had allowed him to become more and more authoritative. Now he wanted to control her hair!Cao Yang liked to see Xia Rou listening to his words the most.She was much easier to raise than the little monkeys that were his little brothers. Look how lovely she was!\u201cAlright,\u201d he agreed with a smile. \u201cJust perming the ends is going to look good on you, you\u2019re all grown up now.\u201dAfter that, he looked at his fourth brother, smirking, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your eyes? Want me to rub that twitch away for you?\u201d\u201c\u2026No need.\u201d The one who had been criticizing another for having no guts inside shrunk to the same treatment.It was just that he was really traumatized by this big brother hitting him when he was young\u2026Cao Yang was thinking he would let her rest for two days so she could have the time to herself, then bring up the topic again. But in the end he realized he couldn\u2019t seem to find her.He didn\u2019t know what she was so busy doing, but the first few days she slept until very late, even past when Cao Yang left the house. And when he returned home, he realized she hadn\u2019t come home yet!So he asked Cao An, and that\u2019s how he learned she was shopping out with her friends all day, every day.It wasn\u2019t easy to graduate from Nan Hua, and now that they didn\u2019t have to wear their uniforms, this bunch of rich girls started to let loose.Cao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d Translated by The NovelstFine, it would be okay to let her rest for a few more days.

For any large purchases, he would receive a text as a notification.He looked at the two transactions, double-checking online. He realized that the purchases were from two different decoration and architecture companies.When he saw Xia Rou at dinner, he brought it up.Xia Rou was surprised for a moment, before responding, \u201cI went to look at the apartment. It was starting to look a little rundown, so I found someone to renovate it. Mainly the wallpaper and the tiles.\u201dCao Xiong\u2019s chopsticks paused midair. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It should be renovated now, it\u2019s been so many years already\u2026\u201dInside that apartment, Cheng Wan had accompanied him for eight years\u2026Suddenly, the atmosphere seemed to plummet.Cao Yang didn\u2019t expect that Xia Rou was looking to renovate the apartment, so he was surprised. He scolded, \u201cThese kinds of things\u2026 You could have just told me. You don\u2019t have to do it all on your own.\u201dXia Rou took a glance at Cao Xiong\u2019s dejected eyes and tried to lift the atmosphere by being naughty. She pushed her nose up into a pig nose at Cao Yang: \u201cIf I asked you, I would end up with blue wallpaper again!\u201dCao Yang knew what she was trying to do and liked to see her cute face. But her words surprised and puzzled him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with blue wallpaper?\u201d he asked, confused.Xia Rou: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe felt helpless. Translated by The NovelstShe didn\u2019t want to explain! Let him be confused by himself. She let out a hmmph in her heart.Then she changed subjects. \u201cYou and Wang Man\u2026 Any new developments?\u201dSince she brought it up, Cao Xiong and Cao An turned to Cao Yang.\u201cBro, you and Wang Man are together already?\u201d Cao An was speechless. \u201cShe\u2019s a little tough.\u201d\u201cWhat nonsense are you saying!\u201d Cao Xiong glared at his fourth son. Cao An was afraid and shrunk back. He then turned to show his care and asked his son, \u201cIs there any progress?\u201dThis little girl!Cao Yang gritted his teeth, responding to his father first. \u201cNo, it\u2019s still the same. She\u2019s transferring back to the city in July. It\u2019s not too bad, seeing her once a month.\u201dThen he asked Xia Rou, \u201cYou clever little girl. Where did you hear the news?\u201dXia Rou said, \u201cMiao Ke from our class came to ask me in secret. She asked if you were dating Wang Man and I told her I didn\u2019t know. Miao Ke\u2019s father is the head of the General Office.\u201dAfter hearing this, the men at the table raised their brows.That habit was really genetic.\u201cSuch a busybody,\u201d Cao Yang smirked.\u201cThere are many people watching you,\u201d said Cao Xiong, slowly. \u201cBe more careful.\u201dCao Yang nodded.This was also the reason that they had been so careful with each other, though they both had intentions to test the waters.Wang Man and Cao Yang \u2013 they weren\u2019t like normal men and women, to be able to date casually for a few months or half a year, having sweet times and arguments, then simply breaking it off.When they began to get close, there were already many eyes on them, trying to guess at any changes in the relationship between the Cao and Wang Families.Wang Man had been in the county, so it had been a great inconvenience for them to meet and date. After connecting on and off for a few months, they only met one day per month.So there wasn\u2019t anything to indicate he wasn\u2019t being careful.Cao Yang didn\u2019t take it to heart.Instead, he remembered the mischievous face that Xia Rou made when she brought up the blue wallpaper in his heart.One day, when he had finished going over business with his boss, he remembered that he had a daughter currently studying in high school.So he asked, \u201cIs your daughter a senior already?\u201d\u201cShe just started 10th grade.\u201dCao Yang chatted with him about high school things. He had attended Xia Rou\u2019s parent meetings three years in a row, so he was quite clear on what happened in high school.His boss asked him a lot of questions like placement tests and when school started. Coincidentally, his daughter was also going to study at Nan Hua.As their conversation came to an end, Cao Yang asked casually, \u201cHow did you decorate your daughter\u2019s room? What color did you choose for her wallpaper?\u201dThe natural response was, \u201cPink.\u201dCao Yang remained silent for a while before he was finally enlightened.Damn that little girl. If she didn\u2019t like it she should have just told him earlier!Had she really just let him know after living there for three years?Cao Yang gritted his teeth, ruminating on the thought while he walked. His footsteps slowed to a stop, unconsciously.He tried to think about it from Xia Rou\u2019s point of view.If he had arrived at an unfamiliar place when he was so young, living under someone else\u2019s roof\u2026 even if things didn\u2019t appeal to him\u2026 even he might have also\u2026That was right.

So even if he felt something, it was very light.Cao Yang hadn\u2019t actually developed any special feelings for Wang Man.The reason he was considering her as a partner for marriage was just as Cao Xiong had said: Wang Man was the best choice in their social circle. If he were to marry, surely he wouldn\u2019t pass up this opportunity and find another woman that couldn\u2019t compare.With this attitude, he kept in touch with her. Of course he admitted she was indeed excellent, but\u2026 Cao Yang knew inside that there wasn\u2019t that spark between them that should be between a man and a woman.He also didn\u2019t like it when women were too arrogant.He was like his father: slightly chauvinistic. Compared to a woman exuding arrogance, he preferred obedience.When he heard the hinting from Wang Man, he started to feel a little annoyed at their relationship, which had remained lukewarm.He drew on his cigarette and thought deeply. He already had plans for Saturday, but he had time on Sunday.\u201cSorry, I have plans this weekend. Let\u2019s meet again when you return next time.\u201dOn the other end of the phone, Wang Man was surprised.But her reaction was immediate, an appropriate response coming out of her, \u201cAlright. Next time, then.\u201dAfter she hung up, Wang Man stared at the screen that had gone dark. She let out a sigh. She wanted to wrap up this county job quickly and transfer back to the capital.When Cao Yang returned home, he realized it was only his father and fourth brother who joined him at the table again.\u201cWhere is Xiao Rou?\u201d he asked. Translated by The Novelst\u201cShe went out with her classmates, she\u2019s going to be back late. They went to the night market,\u201d replied Cao An.The capital\u2019s night market was very popular, and the event went as late as three in the morning on the weekend. And coincidentally, it was Friday.This little girl! She was really going crazy with her free time in the last few days!\u201cIt\u2019s a good time for her to relax,\u201d Cao Xiong said, unbothered. \u201cShe worked so hard this year.\u201dCao Yang let out a soft hmmph.After he finished dinner, he watched a movie alone. Looking at the time, it was already 9 o\u2019clock.He called the guards at the entrance, learning that Xia Rou still hadn\u2019t returned.Cao Yang called her phone.\u201cHello, big brother!\u201d Her surroundings seemed to be very noisy, so Xia Rou shouted.\u201cWhen are you coming back?\u201d he asked.\u201cIt\u2019s still early! W-We\u2019re going for another round!\u201d Xia Rou said, laughing.Cao Yang heard her words wobble, and his voice turned deep: \u201cYou\u2019re drinking?\u201dXia Rou was still naturally in awe toward Cao Yang, having faced him in two lives. Even if her mood was still high from the drink, she was still a little surprised: \u201cJ-Just a little beer\u2026\u201d\u201cWho are you with?\u201d he asked.\u201cH-Half our class is all here together,\u201d she said, quickly adding: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve planned it all out. After this the boys will be taking us girls home.\u201dSomehow Cao Yang was inexplicably angry.\u201cIs Zhang Jinglun there?\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s here,\u201d Xia Rou responded.\u201cPut him on the phone!\u201dHe heard the phone pick up noise as it was jostled, background music blaring, and very soon a boy\u2019s voice sounded on the other end: \u201cBrother Cao Yang!\u201dHe was familiar with this kid, from the same class as Xia Rou.His voice was level. It didn\u2019t sound like he had rank a lot.Cao Yang said, \u201cXiao Lun, look after Xia Rou. Don\u2019t let her drink more, and send her home when you guys are done!\u201dHis tone was very firm. Zhang Jinglun promised him carefully, \u201cAlright, alright! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll do that.\u201dHe pulled the phone to his side after that, thinking they were done, but Cao Yang remained with the phone pressed up against his ear.Barely discernible amongst the other noise, he could hear a boy speaking to Xia Rou: \u201cStop drinking, Brother Cao Yang said you have to stop.\u201d Then the little girl had the gall to mumble, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little beer. He can\u2019t even see it anyway\u2026\u201d and then the call ended.Cao Yang almost laughed in anger.After completing her national exam, she had really spread her wings now, hadn\u2019t she?Just wait till she got home!He waited until half past eleven and Xia Rou still hadn\u2019t returned.Cao Yang\u2019s face turned darker and darker.Xia Rou rarely went out and partied hard. In the past, when she went shopping with her classmates, she would call ahead to the house to let them know in advance if she couldn\u2019t make it to dinner. It wasn\u2019t a big deal then, so Cao Yang hadn\u2019t set a curfew.It looked like he would need to set one in the future, thought Cao Yang, gritting his teeth.He called them twice, but nobody answered. So he called again and went straight to voicemail.At that time, Cao Yang wasn\u2019t angry any longer. He was worried.This was beyond the scope of a brother\u2019s responsibility \u2013 he felt like he knew the feeling of being a father!Cao Yang knew a few of Xia Rou\u2019s classmates \u2013 but they were all still kids. Cao Yang had the numbers of their older siblings, or even their parents, but he didn\u2019t call them.He looked at his watch. It was already a quarter to twelve\u2026 Just as he was thinking of calling Zhang Jinglun\u2019s father to get his number, the guard opened the entrance gate to a taxi.Xia Rou had returned. Translated by The NovelstThe taxi drove to the main doors of the house.Cao Yang stood at the door, holding his cigarette.Zhang Jinglun got out of the car from the passenger seat first. When he saw Cao Yang, he said, \u201cBrother Cao Yang.\u201d Then he carefully explained, \u201cUmm\u2026 Xia Rou, she\u2026 drank a little more after that.\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop her. She was very happy and insisted on drinking,\u201d he said, trying to excuse himself with a bitter face.Looking at Cao Yang who only nodded, he went to open the backseat door, bending down to pull Xia Rou out and supporting her from the car.\u201cBig brother!\u201d Xia Rou smiled joyfully, opening her arms wide and hugging him. \u201cI\u2019m back!\u201dAt least she wasn\u2019t so drunk she couldn\u2019t stand, but it was obvious that she was still very drunk. She probably didn\u2019t know what her surname was at this point.Cao Yang grabbed her arms, trying to pull her away from him, exchanging a few pleasantries with Zhang Jinglun and watching as the taxi drove away.Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Happy! I\u2019m so happy!\u201dCao Yang: \u201c\u2026\u201d Damn! Translated by The NovelstLooking at her state, it seemed she wouldn\u2019t be able to understand even if he did lecture her. He was too lazy to continue, so he grabbed her arms to drag her into the house.After he left go, his tone wasn\u2019t too good. \u201cGo back to your room and sleep!\u201dXia Rou was wobbling as she walked, twisting and turning, humming a song.She had a new hairstyle, her long hair circled at the ends, pulled back.Cao Yang followed her, looking at her hair swinging back and forth like a snake. His hand was itchy. How he wished he could pull her hair to wake up her brain so she could walk straight!Xia Rou continued humming a song, turning. She raised both hands high up and smiled recklessly at Cao Yang. \u201cBig brother! Big brother!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Cao Yang was snappish, annoyed at the fact she was acting so wildly.\u201cBig brother! Big brother! I\u2019m so happy! I\u2019m so happy!!\u201d Xia Rou spun in a circle.Cao Yang recalled that Zhang Jinglun had also told him she was too happy, and that was why she had insisted on drinking. So he was curious and asked: \u201cWhat are you so happy about?\u201dXia Rou then smiled, she smiled happily.\u201cI\u2019ve grown up! I\u2019ve grown up already!\u201d She answered with joy. \u201cI have grown up for three years, and finally I\u2019m 18 years old! I\u2019ve become an adult! Long live! Ohhhhhh <del>~</del> \u201cShe even raised her hands to shout!What did she mean, she\u2019s grown up for three years? Did her previous fifteen years count for nothing? Cao Yang was expressionless.Xia Rou was born in April, but because she was focused on her studies, only the family gathered to celebrate. Cao Bin and Cao Xing had taken leave to rush back for her birthday. From the perspective of the law, she had indeed turned into an adult.The little drunkard hadn\u2019t finished acting crazy yet. She jumped here and there, running forward and then suddenly running backwards.Her arms were outstretched: \u201cI\u2019ve finished the national exam! Hahaha, I\u2019m leaving soon! Leaving soon!\u201dThen she grabbed on to the clothes at Cao Yang\u2019s chest: \u201cBig brother, if I leave would you miss me? Would you?\u201dCao Yang raised his brows. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cTo study of course! I\u2019m going to university soon, far away from you!\u201d Xia Rou released him, smiling joyfully while stepping backwards.Behind her were the stairs. Just as Coa Yang expected, she fell backward.He\u2019d prepared for this and reached out to scoop her up.So that\u2019s how it was\u2026 That\u2019s what she was so happy about! He was enlightened.Before this, he had asked Xia Rou which university she wanted to go to, and she\u2019d given him a list. That time he\u2019d looked through it and felt it was different than he\u2019d expected. But then she had still been studying, so he didn\u2019t bring it up, afraid he might distract her.No wonder she was overjoyed!All the universities she had chosen were far away \u2013 was she trying to stay away from his lecturing, so she could fly freely above the sky?Cao Yang couldn\u2019t help but reflect on himself. He wasn\u2019t that strict on her\u2026 was he?He didn\u2019t restrict her too much, right? Because Xia Rou had always been obedient, she didn\u2019t make him worry much. Sometimes he would say something to her, but she had always listened obediently.Although the three years of study in high school was always difficult, he had never pressured her regarding her grades before. It had always been Xia Rou herself taking the initiative to work hard on her studies.Then why was it that she wanted to leave now that she was eighteen, and choose to study so far from the city?He couldn\u2019t think of the reason.But that Xia Rou was thinking this way made him very uncomfortable.Before him, Xia Rou was obviously the opposite, very happy.She had so many things to tell him!\u201cBig brother!\u201d She stood on the stairs, balancing both her hands on his shoulders, staring at him at eye-level. \u201cGuess who I met yesterday?\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d He wanted to brush her little claws off his shoulders, but seeing how she couldn\u2019t even stand properly, he held back.\u201cLiang Ziheng!\u201d she said.Coincidentally, while she was out shopping with her classmates, she saw him at a distance in the mall.Her eyes were wet looking at him.She suddenly seemed to have turned into an adult woman from the silly drunk girl she had been before.Such a weird misconception, thought Cao Yang.He felt that it was because she had curled her hair, so it made her look more mature.When the name Liang Ziheng came out of her mouth, he was surprised.The last time he heard this name, he asked his people to check on Liang Ziheng. But the result was that he and Xia Rou didn\u2019t have any contact \u2013 just as Hu Chen had said.So he started to guess that Xia Rou had run into him at some kind of occasion, and the little girl might have been silly enough to have been attracted to him by his looks. He indeed was handsome, and had a sweet mouth.At six- or seventeen years old was exactly the right time for love to bloom. Maybe she had fantasies about him that had been destroyed by reality, so she had a one-man show to act out now. Reveling on her own, suffering in pain on her own.This was the kind of pain that adults would headache about. The best way was to just let her be, and as she aged she would pull herself out of it. That was why he didn\u2019t meddle.And after that, Xia Rou hadn\u2019t looked very peculiar, and had never mentioned this name again.But it was the second time for Cao Yang to hear this person\u2019s name from Xia Rou.She looked into his eyes and said, \u201cBig brother, you have already taken revenge for me right?\u201dThis was also\u2026 the second time for him to hear the word \u201crevenge\u201d from Xia Rou.He looked at her and noticed the painful expression on her face.If that was the pain of a young girl\u2026 Translated by The NovelstWasn\u2019t it\u2026 too harsh\u2026Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I died!\u201dShe was just laughing and now she was crying, Xia Rou was really drunk! Now she was even speaking nonsense?The buttons on Cao Yang\u2019s shirt were beginning to strain, so he said helplessly, \u201cI got it, I got it. I\u2019ll take revenge for you!\u201d\u201cNow go back to your room and sleep!\u201d he urged her. Translated by The NovelstShe released him in satisfaction. When she turned around, she tripped on the staircase and fell to the floor. Luckily the staircase was carpeted, so it wasn\u2019t that painful.But she didn\u2019t want to get back up. After an entire round of trouble, the alcohol had overtaken her and she couldn\u2019t find the will to get up herself.Cao Yang was speechless, looking at the little drunkard splayed over the stairs. She had only managed to climb a few steps. He rolled his eyes and went to pull her up so she could stand.He bent down, grasped her legs, and threw her over his shoulder.Hmmph. This damn little girl who had gotten drunk and come back late didn\u2019t deserve to be princess carried!He used one hand to carry her and with just a few steps reached the second floor. He entered her room and threw her onto her bed.Xia Rou rolled on the bed, beginning once again to cry as she curled up her body.\u201cDon\u2019t kill him\u2026\u201d she said, crying, \u201cYou just have to beat him a little, I\u2026 I\u2026\u201dAs she spoke, she began to sob, unable to speak properly.Cao Yang snuffed out his cigarette, going to her side and patting her back.She continued to sob for some time, before recovering. She tried to suppress her hiccups: \u201cI-I just hate when people touch my body\u2026 I\u2026\u201dCao Yang\u2019s hand froze.She was just speaking nonsense, he thought.Hu Chen had asked and his people had investigated this matter. That Liang kid was nearly a stranger to her and they had no contact at all, so it was nearly impossible for him to have done anything to her.Xia Rou was indeed speaking nonsense. The next minute her eyes filled back up with tears as she looked at Cao Yang and said, \u201cBig brother, I\u2019m leaving soon. I have to go to school, I won\u2019t return home anymore\u2026 Y-You need to live well and not get divorced\u2026\u201dShe was raving. Cao Yang was relieved.\u201cI\u2019m not married yet,\u201d he said, reaching to brush at the hair over her forehead.\u201cThen don\u2019t get divorced. Don\u2019t, okay?\u201d she said, her eyes still watery, dripping tears. \u201cDon\u2019t get divorced\u2026 Live well, you need to live well\u2026 Alright?\u201d\u201cAlright,\u201d he coaxed her. Translated by The NovelstXia Rou liked to hear his reassurance, like what he said was a promise weightier than a thousand bars of gold.She fell asleep while she was still crying.Cao Yang stood up, taking the blanket to tuck around her.He also took a tissue to wipe the tears on her face and her runny nose before he left, quietly.After shutting the door to her room, he stood in the corridor and lit up again. The moonlight streamed through the huge windows into the hallway.He looked at the dark shadows, thinking.A happy person, when drunk, would act funny.A weak person would hit his wife.Someone who was wronged would curse someone.A depressed person when drunk\u2026 would only cry.He had known Xia Rou for three years and she had been drunk twice.And both those times she had cried.Cao Yang stared at the windows.He couldn\u2019t help but think that Xia Rou\u2026 perhaps wasn\u2019t as happy as she appeared to be.And he had not realized this before\u2026He couldn\u2019t help but feel\u2026 a little grief in his heart\u2026The next day when Xia Rou woke, she could faintly recall how crazily she had acted.She regretted it. So much so that she wanted to bang her head into the wall!She didn\u2019t actually drink that much; it was just that her capacity for liquor was very small, so she fell drunk easily!Why had she said such things to big brother! She grabbed at her hair and felt troubled.What bullshit Liang Ziheng, what bullshit divorce! Ahhhhhhh so annoying ahhhh!After she tidied up her appearance, she snuck to the dining table, only to see Cao An seated alone.\u201cWhat are you doing?

But in that case I would have to leave the fashion company.She was surprised, knowing immediately what Cao Xiong was planning. He wanted Cao An to run a real estate business. So it was around this time that he had brought up the idea to Cao An. In the end, the matter had been delayed until she had almost finished her first year of college, probably because Cao An didn\u2019t want to accept it.She remained silent for a while. Translated by The NovelstBecause of Cao An\u2019s resistance, Cao Xiong had used his connections to suppress the fashion company so Cao An had been forced to yield.But in the end the one to be deeply hurt was He Chengzhe. His career was set back, yes, but he had always held the fashion company close to his heart as his painstaking lief\u2019s work, and he had taken Cao An as a lover but also as an entrepreneurship partner.But with this he realized that the career that he had put his utmost effort into growing was actually merely a hobby to the fourth young master of the East Commander.Because of this, Cao An and He Chengzhe had their most serious fight.Xia Rou stirred the porridge in her bowl, spacing out a little.\u201cHey! Hey!\u201d Cao An unpleasantly waved his hand in front of her face. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dXia Rou lifted her eyes to look at him, emotions complex. She struggled for a moment, and said, \u201cAnd you\u2026 you\u2019re not willing, right?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m not, how annoying it would be! I just want to do the things I like,\u201d he said carelessly.\u201cThen have you told uncle that?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201d\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201dCao An unhappily crushed the salted egg into the table. \u201cWhat do you think he said?\u201dXia Rou then asked, \u201cWhat about big brother\u2019s answer?\u201dCao An was even more frustrated. \u201cYou know he always stands with my father.\u201dXia Rou stirred the porridge again, asking, \u201cAnd what about you? What do you plan to do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about them,\u201d Cao An mumbled.\u201cBut when uncle and big brother are on the same side on a decision, you know you can\u2019t defy them,\u201d she said, looking directly into his eyes.He choked.Because what Xia Rou was saying was right. He himself knew it deep in his heart.That was why his struggling and defiance were not so fierce. It was just the fourth young master throwing a tantrum.But the one to be implicated was He Chengzhe.\u201cEven if you struggle here and there, you still end up listening to uncle,\u201d she explained.\u201cYou should know uncle\u2019s character better than me. Once he decides on something there\u2019s no room for you to refuse. Unless you bring big brother to your side, no matter how hard you struggle, all your effort will be in vain.\u201d\u201cIf you make uncle angry, he will definitely go against your fashion company. In the end you will still end up listening to him, and Brother Chengzhe would become the unlucky one instead\u2026\u201dDespite the expression on Cao An\u2019s face turning uglier, Xia Rou still unfolded the truth.\u201cI know you like to design, but it\u2019s only what you like. Actually, you don\u2019t really cherish the company as Brother Chengzhe does, right?\u201d\u201cIf you force uncle to that step and he touches the company, in the end it\u2019s only a step back for you. But what will Brother Chengzhe do?

The crook of his mouth revealed his anger, but he couldn\u2019t respond.What Xia Rou was saying was the big fat truth.Even if he struggled, it would be useless in the end. In the end he would have to return home and obediently listen to his father\u2019s words, like he always did in every other aspect of his life.Actually he\u2026 did not have the courage to defy Cao Xiong.He was already in his twenties, but in his bones he was still the Cao Family\u2019s youngest son that hadn\u2019t grown.In the past, Xia Rou was very close to him so she had always helped him find excuses.In this life, she could see the difference between Cao An and Cao Yang quite clearly.And that was responsibility.The oldest and youngest sons were both sons.But after their mother passed, the youngest could be capricious, carefree, and cry.But the eldest had no choice but to stand up and bear the responsibility of a big brother.That was why big brother knew to take care of people, shielding a shortcoming or a fault.Even if her surname wasn\u2019t Cao, he still wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to look down on her.Any requests she had, he would fulfill.That was why she came to have \u201cvalue\u201d in the eyes of others.In the end, Cao An couldn\u2019t face Xia Rou properly after her lecture, so he angrily stormed off.She didn\u2019t mind it.That was how fourth brother was. He never grew up. He could be angry in the morning but still come happily to look for her in the afternoon to reconcile.She ate breakfast alone, quietly. Translated by The NovelstLady Yu stood at the entrance, sticking her head in. Once she saw Xia Rou was alone, she walked in.After Lady Fang had resigned, Lady Yu was promoted and could be said to be the housekeeper of the Cao Family.\u201cXiao Rou, you\u2019re up,\u201d she said. \u201cCao Yang wanted me to tell you that tomorrow is a Sunday so don\u2019t make plans. He wants you to accompany him to buy some stuff.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d she found it odd. \u201cAlright.\u201dWhat did big brother want to buy that he wanted her to come along?Proofread by: HannahPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Cao Yang found it funny just looking at it.He held back his laugh and made a stiff face to teach her a lesson. \u201cThink of how you looked yesterday! How could a girl get drunk to such a state?\u201dXia Rou was scared of getting scolded by him the most, so her head sunk even further, whole body contracting. She let out a soft, \u201cMm.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to have to set a curfew. If you go out, you need to return by 11 at night at the very latest, understand?\u201d Cao Yang said, strict.\u201cGot it,\u201d she said, nodding. Translated by The NovelstAt least her attitude was good when faced with her faults. He was satisfied and let the matter go.\u201cHas Lady Yu spoken to you already? About tomorrow,\u201d he said.Xia Rou saw that he had put the matter out of his mind so she suddenly was revived.\u201cShe did, she did,\u201d she said, nodding like a chick pecking at rice. She tried to butter him up, \u201cWhat do you want to buy? I\u2019ll accompany you.\u201d\u201cAlright, then we leave at 9:30 in the morning.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright!\u201dThe next day, Cao Yang drove his usually black Hummer and left with Xia Rou.When they arrived, she let out a \u201chuh.\u201d \u201cWhy did you come here? What do you want to buy?\u201dCao Yang had brought her to a furniture store. It was the same place she had been visiting the past few days.\u201cBuy a sofa, first,\u201d he said.When they entered the hall, Xia Rou tugged him in the right direction. \u201cSofas are this way.\u201dHe was surprised. \u201cHow do you know?\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to say that a few days ago she had just purchased a new sofa, so she only answered, \u201cThere\u2019s a sign right there,\u201d and muddled through it.When they arrived, he lit up and patted her head, saying, \u201cGo and choose a set you like.\u201d\u201cMeh?\u201d her face was full of confusion.\u201cThe sofa in your room is too old,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking of getting you a new one, but I kept forgetting.\u201dHe was telling the truth. It wasn\u2019t just once that he had thought the sofa was a little old when going into Xia Rou\u2019s room, bringing the thought that he should change it to a newer one for her, but he kept forgetting.Because he kept thinking it was a very small matter\u2026 that wasn\u2019t worth mentioning\u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t have to; that sofa is quite comfortable,\u201d she said. The worn brown leather of the sofa was still quite new so she didn\u2019t find it necessary to change it.\u201cIt looks very old and doesn\u2019t suit a girl\u2019s room,\u201d he said. \u201cGo and pick one you like, it\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201dShe didn\u2019t really want to buy one. She was already planning to leave the Cao Family so there was no need to redecorate the room according to her own tastes.But she had never brought this intention up to Cao Yang before. She was scared that if she continued to insist, Cao Yang would realize. Most of all, a new sofa didn\u2019t really cost that much to him anyways.So she obediently went and chose a sofa.Cao Yang was then satisfied.Xia Rou chose a beige set that gave off a very gentle vibe. When they went to pay the bill, she couldn\u2019t hold back and asked him, \u201cWhy are you suddenly interested in changing the sofa?\u201dCao Yang paused for a little big and replied, \u201cYour room\u2026 I decorated it in the first place and it doesn\u2019t seem like a girl\u2019s room.\u201dAfter he swiped his card, he turned around to say honestly, \u201cXiao Rou, that time you still hadn\u2019t come yet and we weren\u2019t close. So when I chose the decorations for your room, I didn\u2019t put that much heart into it. Now that you\u2019re still living in that room, changing the wallpaper is a little too troublesome\u2026\u201dSo that was why that he at least\u2026 wanted to give her a sofa that she liked.There was a hint of apology in Cao Yang\u2019s eyes.Xia Rou didn\u2019t imagine that the reason was like this. She suddenly was at a loss for words, tearing up unexpectedly.She wanted to say no, no need, she would be leaving soon\u2026But she didn\u2019t dare.In the past when she moved out of the Cao Family residence, she had been much older. It was obvious that Wang Man didn\u2019t like her and was cold to her.But even so Cao Yang tried to persuade her to stay.But now, she was still young and she couldn\u2019t find the right words to tell him. She was scared that if she told him he wouldn\u2019t agree to her move.But\u2026 she had already decided that she must leave.In this life, no matter what, she refused to become the white lotus that was disgusting to others.She would study hard, get a good job, and mind her own business and live her own life.She definitely wouldn\u2019t make any trouble for him and become a burden again.This way, when he married Wang Man, she wouldn\u2019t become the crack in their marriage, causing them to divorce!Cao Yang, her big brother\u2026 He was too good to her.In this life, she would be the one to protect him!After Cao Yang finished speaking, he looked at her. Her somber eyes had become red and wet with tears.Her pink lips moved slightly like she wanted to say something, but in the end no sound came out.After that she wanted to cover herself up and quickly lowered her head.Inside his heart, he felt a little heartache. Translated by The Novelst\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, I was too careless,\u201d he said, patting her head.Xia Rou sniffled, raising her head to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.

He couldn\u2019t help but lower his head as well to kiss the crown of her head, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, as long as you know now.\u201dA kiss like that, at the top of her head, felt like the love of family, mixed with a hint of doting. It didn\u2019t cross any boundaries. Xia Rou didn\u2019t notice anything strange, instead feeling unspeakably sad.Two lives, and in both, big brother\u2026 loved her so much\u2026Facing this kind of big brother, how\u2026 would she be able to tell him she wanted to leave?After purchasing the sofa, he wanted to buy her a new desk.She pulled him away, \u201cMy desk is an antique, I like it. And I\u2019m already used to it too.\u201dSo he gave up. Translated by The NovelstShe tugged him until he was out of the shop. \u201cLet\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat! I\u2019m hungry!\u201dHer long, curly hair swung behind her back.Cao Yang looked at her, a smile playing at the corner of his mouth.He let her pull him along.But he remembered that day she had been so happy, insisting on drinking because she thought she could spread her wings and soar to greater heights if she got into foreign universities.He couldn\u2019t help but grit his teeth.There were only a few more days until the results of the national exam came out\u2026By that time, she would realize. Her dreams were too beautiful to be true!They got to the car and prepared to look for food. When the car drove out of the intersection, another car happened to be across from it.Inside that car, Wang Man suddenly turned her head back, but that black Hummer had already made a turn and she wasn\u2019t able to see the license plate very clearly\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d her mother asked from beside her.\u201cI saw a familiar car,\u201d she answered.Very familiar. Though she wasn\u2019t able to see the license plate, Wang Man knew the man driving the car was Cao Yang, and in the passenger seat had been a young woman with long hair. The car drove very quickly so she hadn\u2019t seen her face.Cao Yang told her that he was busy this weekend\u2026Wang Man pursed her lips, not saying anything.Before the national exam results came out, Cao Yang received another document.That day Xia Rou had gotten drunk, she mentioned Liang Ziheng once again. Though she had been speaking nonsense, Cao Yang asked someone to investigate once more. And this time, they\u2019d discovered something.He looked at the papers in front of him expressionlessly.It looked like Cao Yang\u2019s connections were quite extensive, thought his friend who worked at the police station.\u201cIndeed, this exceeds my expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you first told me, I only checked for anything between that Liang guy and Xiao Rou, and didn\u2019t look into the people related to him. Now that you mention it, if only I\u2019d looked into it before \u2013 who would\u2019ve thought that they had such a relationship between them.\u201d\u201cSo what are you going to do, tell the little girl?\u201d he continued.\u201cWhat use is that?\u201d Cao Yang asked, slipping the piece of paper back into the envelope, lighting up a cigarette. \u201cEver since she arrived to our house she already became a child of our family.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d His friend exclaimed, \u201cYour family is really sincere about her.\u201d\u201cMy father took her as a real daughter.\u201d Cao Yang said.\u201cSo you\u2019re going to keep it from her? After all.. They are related by blood\u2026\u201d his friend said.\u201cRelated by blood?\u201d Cao Yang smirked. \u201cHe didn\u2019t bother to find her for ten yeras. If they hadn\u2019t met my father, both that little girl and her mother might not have anywhere to stay right now. That kind of blood relation \u2013 it\u2019s much better to cut it off.\u201dHe returned home and holed up in his study. He brought out the document again.To be able to find this sort of thing, it was also out of his expectations.In the afternoon, he was able to say that kind of thing decisively before his friend, but now that he had calmed a little, he took another look at the name written on the paper. He couldn\u2019t help but feel annoyed.He lit up once more and remembered what his friend had told him\u2026 related by blood\u2026The Cao Family had always valued their blood relations. The relationship of blood ties, Cao Yang understood very well.But\u2026Knock, knock, knock. The door sounded.\u201cCome in,\u201d he answered.Xia Rou stuck her head in. \u201cBig brother, it\u2019s dinnertime.\u201d\u201cMm, I\u2019m coming.

She blinked at him a few times in confusion.Cao Yang took a few puffs of his cigarette, suddenly asking, \u201cAre you living happily right now?\u201d\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d Xia Rou was baffled, both her eyes glaring roundly.Cao Yang looked at her for a while before smiling suddenly.\u201cWait for me for just a second.

He waited for it all this time.When he saw the marks he smiled and gave Xia Rou a call.\u201cDid you see your score already?\u201d\u201cAh? Is it out already? I thought it was tomorrow!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Cao Yang was speechless. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u201cAt the apartment.\u201d\u201c\u2026What are you doing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m doing the flooring. I\u2019m changing it to wood,\u201d she answered.\u201cBy yourself?\u201d Translated by The Novelst\u201cNo, Xiao Yang brother is helping.\u201dAlthough Xiao Yang wasn\u2019t very educated, his ability to work was pretty good. So hearing that Xiao Yang was the one accompanying Xia Rou, Cao Yang was rest assured.Xia Rou then finally remembered to ask: \u201cSo how is it? How did I do?\u201d\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t really care about it? Check it tomorrow, then,\u201d he responded sarcastically.Xia Rou: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter teasing her a little, he told her the score. \u201cYou did pretty good, much better than you were estimating\u2026\u201dHe heard her shout from the other end of the phone: \u201cOh yeah!\u201d as she ran off to Xiao Yang to flaunt her score.Cao Yang was still holding the phone. \u201c\u2026\u201dHe tried to suppress the veins bulging on his forehead, called \u201cHello?\u201d a few times, finally managing to catch her attention. \u201cTonight I\u2019m busy so I will be returning late. Tomorrow we can talk about your major.\u201dXia Rou happily promised him.After he hung up, he couldn\u2019t help but shake his head and laugh.Silly little girl.She looked at the list of universities that Cao Yang had selected, her face not moving.In the past, he didn\u2019t agree to allow her to study overseas and insisted she study in local universities, saying he was worried about her staying away from home.At that time it was the first time she was taking the national exam and she had been very introverted, and also afraid of going \u201coverseas.\u201d That alongside Cao Yang\u2019s usual domineering attitude drove her to choose a local university.Of course, in this life, he had chosen much stronger schools compared to her past. But\u2026 just as she expected, all the universities were in the capital.He was still thinking that if Xia Rou dared to argue with him and insisted on studying in a foreign university, he would lecture her.She couldn\u2019t think that just because she was eighteen it meant that she could spread her wings as she pleased and simply run around the world!She was a pretty girl, and her character was soft and easy to talk to. He really couldn\u2019t put down his heart if he didn\u2019t keep her close. He would always worry that she was being taken advantage of, bullied, or that she would meet someone bad.That wouldn\u2019t do.But Xia Rou didn\u2019t argue with him.She only asked him whether Hua Zhong or Sheng Cheng University should be her first choice before obediently agreeing, \u201cThen I guess it\u2019s done?\u201dHer somber eyes stared at him, blinking once, then twice.Cao Yang didn\u2019t know what to say. Originally, he had stockpiled his momentum and had been fully prepared to give this silly little bird a lesson, but it resulted in a strong fist hitting cotton \u2013 ineffective.Xia Rou didn\u2019t know why big brother was suddenly quiet.Her heart was heavy with guilt, so she acted innocent, blinking her eyes at him.After a few seconds of that, just blinking at each other\u2026Cao Yang finally returned to the topic at hand: \u201cWhen are you going to school to turn in the form?\u201dIn the last few years, the national exam had undergone some changes. Xia Rou was in the last batch of graduates that had to turn in the form by hand. When Xia Rou entered college, the students then would be submitting the form online, instead.\u201cFriday at the latest,\u201d she responded. \u201cI\u2019ll go and fill out the form like we agreed?\u201d\u201cAlright, you can go,\u201d her big brother said softly.His voice was very gentle.Xiao Rou was really a good girl!So soft and obedient, and she didn\u2019t really lose her temper.As her big brother, he felt that no matter how much he spoiled her it would never be enough!A soft-tempered girl like her \u2013 how could he leave her to stay alone outside the city?
