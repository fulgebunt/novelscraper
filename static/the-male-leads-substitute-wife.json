Everyone one of them who joined had not seen each other for a few years. After the meal, they decided to go to a KTV to continue. Their old class president gathered everyone to play a game, but Su Yaya was very unlucky last night and lost several rounds. As a result, she had to drink five or six glasses of wine as a penalty.She became drunk after drinking a few glasses of wine. Her head was muddled and everything became blurry, so she couldn\u2019t make out the faces of people clearly. In the end, she dizzily laid and slept on the sofa in the KTV room.While she was in a daze, she felt as if her body had been overturned pressed down multiple times. It seemed like her whole person was rolled over by a road roller, and the bones in her body were about to fall apart. Su Yaya opened her mouth like a fish that was dying of thirst. She let out a weak cry for help from her dried and scorching hot throat. A white ray of light suddenly flashed in her head, but she didn\u2019t understand what was going on.She also didn\u2019t know how long she had slept for. The gurgling sound of water running made Su Yaya annoyed as she turned over to the other side of the bed. She can\u2019t help but become irritated. Which loathsome person would run the water so loudly this early in the morning? Disturbing someone\u2019s dream was immoral!The soundproofing quality of this rental room was too lacking to where she could even hear the water running from the next room over. Every day in the middle of the night, she would often hear the sound from next door when that particular neighbor watched programs that weren\u2019t suitable for children. Unable to stand it any longer, Su Yaya decided that she must quickly look for a new place to live.But it would cost her a lot of money for her to move to a new place and she was very poor! Su Yaya was very irritated by this, so she wrapped her quilt around her and rolled around a few times on her bed.At this time, the sound of running water finally stopped.\u2018Haahh,\u2019 She let out a breath of air and flipped over on the bed, planning to continue to sleep.Just at this moment, her chaotic brain seemed to finally react and realize that something was off.Su Yaya thought for a moment. Although she had rolled on the bed a few times, she still had not fallen off. But in her memory, she clearly remembered that her bed was never large enough for something like that!She swiftly opened her eyes and found herself in an unfamiliar yet luxurious room. The spacious room was finely decorated and the furnishings in it were very fashionable. The size of this room was more than double the size of her 20 square meter room, and the furniture here were all high-class in quality; even the \u2018Danish Carl Hansen &amp; Son\u2019 curved leather sofa with a single recliner in the corner of the room was worth tens of thousands. Su Yaya was stunned by everything in front of her.Was she dreaming?Su Yaya foolishly gazed at everything in front of her, without even noticing that the quilt that was wrapped around her began to slide off her body.Chen Xiuqi had a white towel wrapped around his waist when he walked out of the bathroom. As soon as he looked up, he saw Su Yaya sitting on the bed with a blank expression on her face. On top of her head, two stray strands of hair playfully stuck up and her eyes were wide open like a pair of big deer-like eyes. Her rosy cherry-like lips were slightly apart, which was extremely attractive and alluring.She appeared innocent, charming, and sexy all at the same time, just like a beautiful blooming flower. But she had a questioning expression on her face, as if to ask \u201cwho am I and what am I doing here?\u201d She was nibbling her lower lip, appearing foolish yet cute.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if he was hit by an electric current when he gazed at her; he could only feel his heart suddenly pounding, his throat tightening, and his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing up and down.Chen Xiuqi wasn\u2019t the type of person who would deny himself what he wanted. The corners of his mouth curved into a slight smile and he took large strides toward Su Yaya who was still immersed in her confusion.Su Yaya was still in a state of shock.No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn\u2019t understand how she would end up here. She had only attended a class reunion, got drunk, and dizzily fell asleep. Yet how did she end up in an unfamiliar room with such a big bed when she opened her eyes?At this moment, her brain had crashed and wasn\u2019t able to properly process all this information. Meanwhile, a dangerous human cheetah was slowly approaching the foolish little rabbit.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d The human cheetah, Chen Xiuqi walked towards her. He reached out and wrapped an arm around her neck, then he lowered his head and kissed her lips.Su Yaya\u2019s head suddenly felt dizzy, and many memories that didn\u2019t belong to her began to flow into her mind like a tidal wave. The enormous amount of information that flooded her mind began to drown her like a violent storm. She wasn\u2019t able to endure onslaught of memories, and her brain let out a buzzing noise and she fainted as soon as she closed her eyes.By the time she regained consciousness, only Su Yaya was left in the room; the human cheetah Chen Xiuqi was no longer here.A breeze blew in from the wide, transparent French window and the sea-blue curtains gently swayed. Su Yaya turned over on the bed as she hugged the quilt and began to sort out the extra memories in her brain that didn\u2019t belong to her. Thus, she gradually began to understand what this was all about.It turns out that after she had drunk heavily and passed out on the KTV room\u2019s sofa, Su Yaya had somehow transmigrated to a melodrama novel called\u300aThe President\u2019s Lovable Sweet Little Wife\u300b.This melodrama novel about a certain CEO was a story she had read the night before she had passed out from drinking.At that time, she was lying on her bed as she casually swiped through Jinjiang Literature City app. Her finger slipped and accidentally clicked on a book. She turned to look at the title, which read\u300aThe President\u2019s Lovable Sweet Little Wife\u300b. At that time, she had chuckled and thought \u2018why would the author use such a dumb name?\u2019When she scrolled down, she said that there was a supporting character with the same name as hers, Su Yaya! She turned out to be a malicious villain and a cannon fodder!At that time, Su Yaya was driven by a strange curiosity when she opened the novel,\u300aThe President\u2019s Lovable Sweet Little Wife\u300band began reading it.In the book, Su Yaya was the ex-wife of the overbearing president male lead, Chen Xiuqi. She looked about 70% similar to the female lead, An Yutong. In order to pursue her musical dream, An Yutong went abroad to study. The overbearing president had painstakingly chased after his white moonlight female lead, An Yutong. He was heartbroken when she left, but he just happened to meet Su Yaya who was a popular female on the one hundred and eighty network.In order to find a substitute to fill up the emptiness in his heart, he crazily pursued after Su Yaya. How could the little white rabbit that had just graduated from college resist the overbearing President Chen\u2019s temptation? Su Yaya soon fell into the beautiful yet poisonous snare of love that Chen Xiuqi had weaved for her.At this time, Chen Xiuqi\u2019s grandfather was seriously ill and made a will, stating that Chen Xiuqi, who was 30 years old must marry before he can inherit his tens of billions of inheritance. In order to inherit the inheritance, Chen Xiuqi naturally asked Su Yaya to sign marriage contract and marry him.Su Yaya was deeply immersed in his gentle doting at that time, so there was no way she would\u2019ve rejected him. She only wanted to marry him, with or without a contract.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 - Transmigration (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.3 Transmigration (3)Su Yaya was very happy at the prospect of marrying him, so she nodded and agreed to all the conditions he had proposed. In accordance to his request, she signed the marriage contract, the prenuptial agreement, and other documents.Because Grandpa Chen was still sick, the two people didn\u2019t have a wedding reception. They issued their marriage certificate first, so Chen Xiuqi was able to successfully inherit his tens of billion dollars of inheritance.Chen Xiuqi, who had inherited such wealth, wasn\u2019t a harsh person. In the beginning, he treated his wife very well because she had helped him. As long as Su Yaya\u2019s request wasn\u2019t too much, he would always try his best to satisfy her. If she asked for money, he would give her money. If she asked for a car, he would give her a car. If she asked for a house, he would give her a house. If she asked for jewelries, he would willingly gift her jewelries. When he goes abroad for business, he would sometimes bring her along.Su Yaya originally thought that this happy, sweet, and rich life would last forever, but the turning point of the plot came.Two years later, Chen Xiuqi\u2019s first love and white moonlight**, An Yutong returned. She had suffered hardship abroad, so the moment An Yutong saw Chen Xiuqi, she held him and cried bitterly. She told him how difficult it was for her to make a living outside and Chen Xiuqi naturally felt very distressed for her. He busily arranged many things for her, hoping that she will live a better life after returning.(**T/N: white moonlight\u2013Chinese idiom for \u2018first love\u2019)Chen Xiuqi\u2019s care for An Yutong at that time was merely that of friends, so he wasn\u2019t overstepping the bounds of what was proper.Su Yaya couldn\u2019t sit still because she felt that her position was in imminent danger now that An Yutong returned. She didn\u2019t want to lose her position as Mrs. Chen and her rich life, so she turned evil. Su Yaya constantly created trouble for the female and male lead, putting them at odds with each other.Perhaps the female and male lead were truly attracted to each other, because no matter how serious or deep the misunderstanding and problem was, the two people would eventually resolve these issues and their feelings for each other would deepen.Su Yaya became even more anxious when she saw that she couldn\u2019t separate the female and male lead by creating trouble and misunderstandings between them. As a result, she had someone kidnap An Yutong.This time, she had poked the hornet\u2019s nest.Chen Xiuqi safely rescued An Yutong from the kidnappers and sent someone to investigate who it was that had hired those kidnappers to kidnap An Yutong. After discovering that it was Su Yaya who had paid the kidnappers, he couldn\u2019t tolerate her any longer. Chen Xiuqi was so angry that he immediately proposed a divorced with Su Yaya.Chen Xiuqi took the divorce papers for her to sign it, but Su Yaya wasn\u2019t willing. She made a terrible scene, crying and threatening him with suicide.How could Chen Xiuqi be someone who was willing to be threatened by her? Not only did he force her to sign the divorce papers, he also used all the means necessary to cut off all her paths, leaving her not far from death.In fact, if Su Yaya had not turned evil when the female lead returned, she could\u2019ve taken the initiative to divorce Chen Xiuqi. According to the original marriage contract, she would have gotten ten million dollars of alimony.Thinking of this, the current Su Yaya wanted to scold the former host of this body for being so foolish. \u2018Why would you try to create misunderstanding between the male and female lead? Isn\u2019t it great to get out of here after getting ten million dollars?\u2019If it was her, she would immediately sign the divorce papers and take off with her ten million dollars. She would go back to the countryside to buy a small courtyard and to farm; upon opening her farmhouse, she will be feeding chickens, ducks and fishes while planting some flowers and other plants on the side. Su Yaya will pass her days joyously with such a simple life.\u2018Hee hee hee\u2019, Su Yaya can\u2019t help but sit up while holding the quilt at this thought.When Chen Xiuqi opened the door to the room, he saw Su Yaya sitting on the bed with a foolishly happy expression on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once she gets ahold of it, it will be as if money were raining down from the sky, enough to fill her small bed to the brim with money. She will be able to happily sleep and roll on this bed of money every day.Heeheehee\u2026The silly and happy little rabbit failed to notice the human cheetah that had been staring at her for a long time by the door. She was completely immersed in her own beautiful fantasy.Who knows whether or not Chen Xiuqi was influenced by Su Yaya\u2019s silly appearance, but the corner of his mouth soon curved into a smile and his mood suddenly became better. He walked over with large strides and reached out to rub Su Yaya\u2019s disheveled hair. The man\u2019s voice was deep, beautiful, mellow, and rich like the cello, \u201cWhat are you thinking about that\u2019s making you so happy? Let me hear about it, hm?\u201dTen million\u2026\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Su Yaya looked up and finally noticed Chen Xiuqi. She hurriedly covered her mouth with her hand and stared at him with her sparkling wide eyes, but deep down, Su Yaya was secretly rejoicing that she had reacted promptly, and didn\u2019t blurt out her true inner thoughts.How will Chen Xiuqi react if he finds out that she saw him as a walking \u2018ten million\u2019?Ah, she doesn\u2019t dare to think about it\u2026\u201cWell?\u201d Chen Xiuqi\u2019s deep gaze swept across her face a few times, and saw how her eyes sparkled with light as she stared at him with worship and admiration.Of course Su Yaya would like at him with eyes full of worship and admiration because to her, he was worth ten million dollars! Everytime she looked at his handsome face, she would be reminded of this. He was the automated ATM machine that will make her rich in the future and reach the peak of her life!Su Yaya seemed to be unable to take off her bright and sparkling big eyes off him, this greatly satisfied Chen Xiuqi\u2019s ego. Her cheeks were rosy and soft, and her skin was delicate and smooth, it seemed like water could be squeezed out of her cheeks with just a light pinch.At this thought, Chen Xiuqi did just that. He reached out and gently pinched Su Yaya\u2019s cheek. Her skin was satiny soft and glossy, and very comfortable to the touch. After pinching her once, Chen Xiuqi wanted to pinch her again.\u201cHurts\u2026\u201d she weakly mumbled. Upon being pinched twice by Chen Xiuqi on the cheeks, she looked at him pitifully with her bright eyes.Her little rabbit-like gaze caused the man\u2019s heart to inexplicably soften, so he quickly let go of her cheeks and withdrew his hand. Chen Xiuqi coughed and sternly said, \u201cI need to go to the company in a little while, so obediently stay at home. If you\u2019re bored, you head out and go shopping.\u201dSu Yaya nodded her head and obediently replied, \u201cOh, okay.\u201dShe appeared lovable and soft, obedient yet clever like a silk flower, lightly wrapping around him, stirring his heart. He took out a wallet from his pocket and took up a card from the wallet. Chen Xiuqi hand her the card and said, \u201cTake it.\u201dHer eyes fell on the Platinum card in front of her and blinked her eyes in surprise. Su Yaya\u2019s heart began to pound and she looked up at Chen Xiuqi with excitement and nervousness. She pointed a finger at her nose and said, \u201cIs this card for me?\u201dHow could her silly appearance look so cute?His heart was about to melt.The corners of Chen Xiuqi\u2019s mouth curved upwards and handed her the card again, he whispered, \u201cUse it to spend.\u201dWow!She was rich!Su Yaya was so happy that she almost bounced up!She was a poor person before she transmigrated into the novel in her sleep and became rich.

She was so happy that she was about to turn crazy!Su Yaya took the card with both hands sincerely with a brilliant smile on her beautiful face. She said in a sweet and lovable tone, \u201cThank you husband, *muah* ~\u201d (kissing sound)Although the original owner of the body was married to Chen Xiuqi, she and Chen Xiuqi were just strangers.Su Yaya truly admired her ability to adapt to any situation. She had obviously just transmigrated and had merely ten minutes of interaction with Chen Xiuqi.Of course, the deep physical interaction that occurred last night didn\u2019t count since at that time, she had fainted and couldn\u2019t experience it herself. Yet at this moment, the fact that she was able to calmly address Chen Xiuqi as her husband and kiss him, was quite impressive.Who told Chen Xiuqi to be so handsome, rich, and generous? She loved him to death!When faced with the immense temptation of money, she can abandon all morals and reservations; these things don\u2019t exist for the poor. What\u2019s the use of arrogance and an unyielding character for a poor person? Some of them had been persistently struggling just to barely survive!For a person like her who was scared of being poor, don\u2019t even talk about calling Chen Xiuqi husband, she was even willing to call him Sugar Daddy since he gave her a platinum card and told her to use it as much as she wants.However, her reaction made Chen Xiuqi had different thoughts about her character. He thought of her as someone different from those other women who are greedy for his money. She appeared very happy with just a card, it seemed like she was going to be very easy to raise!It seemed like his choice to marry and sign a marriage contract with her was correct. Since she had helped him so much by helping him successfully inherit his grandfather\u2019s inheritance, he will do his best to treat her right in the future. As long as her requests weren\u2019t too demanding, he will satisfy all her requests.\u201cOkay, I will go to the company.\u201d Chen Xiuqi smiled and rubbed her head again. Her hair was very soft and felt good to touch, making him unable to bear to part with her.Since her sugar daddy had given her a platinum card, shouldn\u2019t she serve him well? Even if she had to pretend, she should make sure her acting skills were on par. Otherwise, he will feel that her service wasn\u2019t enough.Therefore, Su Yaya\u2019s face revealed the most perfect smile as she spoke with a sweet and soft voice, \u201cHusband, you have to pay attention to your safety when you drive to work. Work hard and come back early, I will make you a delicious meal.\u201dChen Xiuqi swept his deep gaze across her face and her slender and fair fingers. He had known her for a long time, but he had never seen her cook. Was the food she made edible?\u201cI\u2019m going to a little busy today, so I don\u2019t know when I will be coming back. I will call you after I finish work.\u201dBefore he made sure that her cooking was edible, he didn\u2019t want to make things difficult for his stomach. Seeing how happy she was and that she was taking the initiative, he didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings, so he subconsciously used the excuse that he was busy with work.Sure enough, after hearing what he had said, the light in Su Yaya\u2019s eyes dimmed a little.\u201cThat\u2019s alright, be careful on the road.\u201d She stared at him and waved goodbye.She appeared reluctant to part with him, just like a small little kitten. Chen Xiuqi\u2019s heart slightly stirred. If the company really didn\u2019t have something waiting for him to deal with, he was willing to stay with her. She was his woman so it was acceptable for him to occasionally coax her, as long as she wasn\u2019t being too unreasonable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The moment Chen Xiuqi turned around to close the door, he inadvertently glanced at Su Yaya and saw her sitting still on the bed while holding her quilt. Her big, watery eyes were staring at him without blinking.Chen Xiuqi lowered his head and closed the door, his mouth curved up into a faint smile.Su Yaya waited for Chen Xiuqi\u2019s footsteps to gradually drift away. Now alone in this room, she held up the platinum card that Chen Xiuqi had just given her. She chuckled like a crazy little mouse and incessantly rolled around the bed.Oh my god! She would\u2019ve never imagined that she would become a rich person after transmigrating into a novel after falling asleep.She felt extremely happy and refreshed.Su Yaya couldn\u2019t stop laughing as she rolled about on the mattress, and she had even kissed the platinum card multiple times. This woman appeared more enthusiastic than she did before when she was facing Chen Xiuqi. Su Yaya finally stopped laughing and rolling about when she heard the sound of the engine of the car starting from below.According to the current plot, the novel had not yet entered the main storyline. Right now, the original owner of the body and Chen Xiuqi had only been married for five days, so they were still at the sweet and loving phase of their marriage.Regardless of why Chen Xiuqi had pursued the original owner of the body, or the purpose he had in mind when he married the original host, Chen Xiuqi seemed to like her and was willing to coax and dote on her based on the current situation.Therefore, Su Yaya, who was a counterfeit that had transmigrated here, planned to win Chen Xiuqi\u2019s favor by fawning over him. She will serve Chen Xiuqi and do her best to have a good relationship with him in order to leave behind a good impression of herself. She won\u2019t oppose the female lead, so when they divorce in the future, he will remember her goodness and give her more alimony.Thinking about this, a scene from the novel suddenly flashed in Su Yaya\u2019s mind. She quickly reached out and grabbed the robe that was at the corner of the bed. After putting on the robe, she quickly walked to the French window and pulled aside the sea blue curtains. Su Yaya looked down, just in time to see Chen Xiuqi\u2019s car slowly driving out of the villa\u2019s gate.A bright idea suddenly dawned upon her. She quickly raised her hand and waved at the rearview mirror of the car. It didn\u2019t matter if Chen Xiuqi saw it or not; it was good enough as long as she did it!In fact, early this morning when she was sending Chen Xiuqi to work, she had suddenly remembered a novel she had read. In the story, the female lead had done this same thing, which firmly tugged at the male lead\u2019s heartstrings, thus leaving the male lead a favorable impression of her.Therefore, she hoped that she will be able to curry Chen Xiuqi\u2019s favor by doing this.Heeheehee\u2026 she applauded at how quick-witted she was.Inside the car, chauffeur Zhong Shu saw Su Yaya standing by the window and waving goodbye at Chen Xiuqi from the rearview mirror. He didn\u2019t know what was wrong with himself today since he usually wasn\u2019t a talkative person, but he wanted to tell Chen Xiuqi about this. The chauffer spoke up and said, \u201cPresident Chen, young Lady Su is waving goodbye at you from upstairs.\u201dChen Xiuqi had been looking at the documents, but his fingers stopped flipping through the files when he heard Zhong Shu\u2019s words. He didn\u2019t even have to look to know that Su Yaya, this silly girl, was probably standing in front of the French window as she reluctantly looked at the departing car. He already had a smile on his face since he left the villa, but the smile deepened while he thought of her.Kitty Jiu: more advanced chapters will be available next week in myPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Whenever she made a mistake at her job, she was scolded by her team leader, and to add salt to the wound, she could barely earn enough to live paycheck by paycheck each month. At the end of every month, Su Yaya had to pay rent, water and electricity bills. She didn\u2019t dare to buy new clothes or expensive cosmetics because she had to save money. But no matter how much she tried to budget, there was still not much money left at the end of each year. Each day she lived was miserable.Sometimes, she would spend her free time reading romance novels while fantasizing that one day, a rich and handsome guy will descend from the sky and give her a gold card. He would tell her, \u201cSpend as much as you want and swipe the card as many times as you wish.\u201d She always thought that if that had actually happened, she would surely jump for joy.And this fantasy was exactly how her current situation is playing out at the moment; even the idiom \u2018to be over the moon\u2019 could not describe her how happy she is right now.Su Yaya, who had been lying in bed for a while finally got up after she felt like she had stared at the platinum card long enough. She hummed a tune as she cheerfully bounced towards the bathroom.Su Yaya twirled into the room, locked the bathroom door, and walked to the sink. She could barely hold back her scream when she saw herself in the mirror.The reflection was too beautiful! She had never seen someone as beautiful this image in her entire life. What\u2019s more, the beautiful reflection in the mirror belonged to her!Below her dark, willow-like eyebrows was a pair of big sparkling watery eyes. Her eyelashes were thick and long like a small curling fan; whenever she blinked, it would tremble like a butterfly\u2019s wings.Su Yaya turned left and right to examine her face; she discovered from the reflection that her face was a perfect shape from her forehead to the tip of her nose. Her nose was straight and small, just the kind that she had always wanted.The nose Su Yaya had before was a little flat. Even though it wasn\u2019t ugly, it just didn\u2019t reach the beauty standards in her heart. However, she had always been a little regretful because she didn\u2019t have the courage to get a nose job.But now that she had transmigrated here, she had obtained the nose that she always had dreamed of. Her nose was natural, without any signs that she had surgery done on it in the past. She was exceptionally happy; her happiness was similar to how a person would feel after their long awaited dream had finally come true.Her rosy lips were like sakura petals, as if she had applied on a layer of lip gloss. With a small smile on her face, Su Yaya couldn\u2019t help but use her a finger to trace her lips, her chin, and then all the way down to her slim and fair collarbone of her neck\u2026The face of the person in the mirror was flushed peach pink and the corner of her eyes was radiating charm. It was obvious from her appearance that she had been fiercely loved by someone. There was also a hickey on the left side of her collarbone. Chen Xiuqi was especially fond of her collarbone, so he would always nip and bite there, leaving behind traces of love.The woman in the mirror was extremely beautiful and her whole body exude charm. She appeared to be innocent, sexy, and charming all at the same time. Not to mention men being attracted to her, even she couldn\u2019t stop her heart from rapidly pounding and her face from flushing red when she saw her reflection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She lifted her straight, long, and skinny legs and stepped into the bathtub. Then, she lied down in a comfortable position.While she was bathing, Su Yaya immersed herself in the warm water and began enjoying the comfortable massage after she pushed the massage button. Su Yaya let out a soft sigh, it was very comfortable.It was no wonder that everyone wanted to live like rich people; they lived so comfortably.Su Yaya lied in the bathtub and took a warm and relaxing bath. A slight dizziness overcame her at this moment, and in her drowsy state, she seemed to hear a voice telling her: Enjoy your comfortable life right now, since you\u2019ll have to rely on yourself in the future.She was startled awake when she heard this, but when she looked around, there was no one else in the bathroom. Was she just dreaming?When she recalled the words she had heard in her dream, she couldn\u2019t help but think deeply.Enjoy your comfortable life right now, since you\u2019ll have to rely on yourself in the future.She really wanted to enjoy this life.

But her rationality was telling her that this life was too unrealistic.Right now, she had transmigrated into the novel and had become Chen Xiuqi\u2019s wife. She was living a rich and relaxing lifestyle, but a dream will always end. One day, she might transmigrate back to her old life, so she can\u2019t indulge herself and become blinded by this glorious and wealthy life in front of her. It was hard to become frugal after becoming accustomed to luxury. She was afraid that she won\u2019t be able to adjust to her original lifestyle once she transmigrated back.Even if she didn\u2019t transmigrate back, she still couldn\u2019t continue to live this luxurious lifestyle. In the near future, the female lead, An Yutong will return from abroad. An Yutong was Chen Xiuqi\u2019s destined wife\u2013 the female lead and the male lead was destined to be together. She was a cannon fodder that could only maintain her current lifestyle for two more years. After that, she will have to return back to her original lifestyle.In the original novel, the female supporting character, Su Yaya had courted disaster by herself. She fell into her own traps and offended Chen Xiuqi in every way, and she ended up being detested by everyone just like a street rat.Since she already knew the ending in the novel, she can\u2019t do anything to offend Chen Xiuqi and An Yutong. She could only hope to change Su Yaya\u2019s ending in the novel and live until she was old.But since An Yutong had yet to return, and Chen Xiuqi was still nice to her, all she could do was to please him and serve him well so that she could leave a good impression behind.When An Yutong returns, she will take the initiative and hand over her position. She won\u2019t do anything that will harm the female lead and the male lead\u2019s relationship, and will stay as far away from them as possible.Yes, that\u2019s right. Su Yaya was more and more certain of her plan.After she finished bathing, Su Yaya stepped out of the bathtub and used a towel to wipe away the droplets of water on her body. Relying on the original character\u2019s memory, she opened the cabinet that contained all her skin care products, and was then greeted by the sight of various skin care products that filled up the space. There were skin care products for the body, for the face, skin care products in Chinese and in foreign languages. There were also brands that she had heard of, but never used such as La Mer and Pola, and many others.(TLN: La Mer and Pola are luxury skincare brands. The smallest bottle of La Mer (0.5 oz) cost around $100 and can go up to several thousands of dollars.)Her current body was already born with such good skin; her complexion was smooth and soft, without any blemishes just like a baby\u2019s skin. It seemed like with just a soft pinch, water will come out from her pores. In addition to the natural beauty that this body was born with, it was also maintained by using those expensive skincare products.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her parents were ordinary company employees. However, they had spent a large portion of their salaries on their daughter, who in turn used this money to buy skincare products. Before she met Chen Xiuqi, the original host would only eat once once a day to save enough money to buy La Mer. After she met him, he was very generous towards her, so she could buy these products without holding back.The owner of this body had taken such extreme care to maintain this body by spending large amounts of money and effort. So even though Su Yaya had transmigrated over and took over the body, she still regarded this body as something that truly belonged to the original Su Yaya. Just like how she was taught since little that it was wrong to destroy other people\u2019s things, she can\u2019t just treat the body too casually. A beauty needed to have a beauty\u2019s conscientious attitude, so she needed to take good care of the body just like the owner did.Of course, Su Yaya also has her own selfish motive; she finally became as beautiful as she had always dreamed to be, so she needed to work hard to be worthy of this beauty. She needed to make her beauty more long-lasting, more fragrant, and more attractive.Su Yaya decided to take good care of her body according to the memory left behind by the original owner. She tried her best to imitate the owner\u2019s routine, only finishing up when she finally felt satisfied.After she completed her routine, Su Yaya opened the closet and chose a white dress. This was the latest dress from the Chanel brand\u2013simple yet graceful. It seemed like the dress was tailor-made for her body when she put it on, as it perfectly outlined her exquisite curves.Su Yaya twirled in front of the mirror, and stared at her own reflection, unable to look away.After she finished dressing herself and admiring her appearance, she walked out the room and came down from the second floor.It appears that she was the only person in the house at this time. The household\u2019s maid, Liu Ma, had a son whose family welcomed a newborn son a few days ago. Liu Ma resigned from her position to help raise her newborn grandson a few days ago, but a replacement for a housemaid had yet to be hired.Su Yaya checked the refrigerator and couldn\u2019t find anything to eat. There was no one else at home to cook for her either.As a result, Su Yaya can only bring her purse and go out to look for food.Su Yaya knew how to drive, and the owner of the body also had a driver\u2019s license. She went to the underground garage and drove a white car towards the closest shopping mall.\u2026\u2026Chen Xiuqi was having a meeting in the conference room. The marketing manager was reporting this month\u2019s marketing sales with vivid explanations. Chen Luqi listened to his report without any expression on his face when he suddenly noticed the screen of his phone light up from the corners of his eyes.Yaya: Husband, I saw a dress that I like a lot, but it was a bit expensive. *Dress Image.jpg*Upon seeing the message, Chen Xiuqi\u2019s heart began to pound at the thought of how obedient and clever she was earlier that morning. He picked up his phone and opened WeChat to check out the image she sent. The style of the dress was quite ordinary and he couldn\u2019t see what brand it was. This dress was different from the usual style of clothing she bought. Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t think much of it since he didn\u2019t lack money, so he responded with:\u00a0buy!After he sent the message, Chen Xiuqi waited for Su Yaya\u2019s response. Earlier that morning, when he gave her the card, she smiled sweetly at him and said, \u201cHusband, *muah*.\u201d Now that he agreed to buy the dress, she should have some appreciation, right?Chen Xiuqi thought that Su Yaya would reply immediately upon seeing his straightforward response, but there was still no response at all even after 10-20 minutes.He couldn\u2019t help to check his WeChat a few times. Seeing that she still hadn\u2019t replied, his handsome face suddenly darkened. He pointed his finger at Su Yaya\u2019s profile picture and thought while gnashing his teeth,\u00a0heartless little bastard, I gave you the card but you won\u2019t even reply with a simple thank you. I will sort you out when I return home later!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She stepped out of the vehicle with her purse and took an elevator up.The elevator stopped on the third floor and opened its doors. Su Yaya walked out with her pair of high heels, but before she could even take two steps, a dress with flared sleeves caught her eye on the display\u2019s latest fashion.The color and style of this dress looked exactly the same as the dress that she saw in a shopping mall before her transmigration into this novel world. At that time, she took a fancy to the dress at first glance and had specially asked the shop assistant to take the dress off the display for her to try on. After trying it on, she found that it fit perfectly and suited her looks well. She really liked the dress.But at that time, she was embarrassingly short on money and the dress cost over half a month of salary for her. If she had bought the dress, it would\u2019ve been difficult for her to pay her rent and food for that month. After thinking about it, she could only regretfully abandon the thought of buying the dress.Now that she saw the same dress, Su Yaya was moved. She really wanted to buy it. After all, she always carried this lingering regret for not being able to afford it at that time. When she returned to work shortly after that event, it was difficult for her to stay motivated in her job and she felt down for a long time. Her dream was both to find wealth and to buy the dress she adored for herself. Now, she wanted to satisfy her own wish.As Su Yaya walked into the store, the sales staff observed her from head to toe. Seeing that she wore a Chanel dress and necklace, along with a Chanel bag, the sales staff knew she was a wealthy person. Her eyes brightened and she revealed the sweetest smile she could to the customer, not forgetting to gently ask if she needed any help.\u201cI want to try that dress.\u201d Su Yaya pointed at the dress hanging on the display window.The sales staff nodded and promptly went to take the dress down. She led Su Yaya to the fitting room to try the dress on.Su Yaya brought the outfit into the fitting room and changed into it. The moment the sales staff saw her coming out of the fitting room, her eyes brightened even more. She complimented genuinely and said, \u201cMiss, you\u2019re so beautiful in this dress.\u201dShe had been a sales staff in this store for almost three years, so she had seen many customers before. Some were beautiful, others had average looks, some had a great figure, and there were others who lacked such figures. Yet, she had never seen a woman like Su Yaya who was both beautiful and had a great figure.There were people who were more beautiful than her but were lacking a good body shape. There were people with more slender figures than her but lacked her beauty. In short, this customer was the most perfect woman she had seen; she was good in all ways.Her skin was white as though it was glowing; it was moist and white, like a newly peeled egg. She exposed her beautiful and slender swan-like neck after wearing the dress. Her waist was skinny and exposed her figure just perfectly. Her appearance couldn\u2019t be described in words.Su Yaya looked at herself in the mirror and thought she was beautiful too.In the past, she wasn\u2019t beautiful; at most she was just pretty. When she stood beside someone who was actually beautiful, she became ordinary like a maid.Plus, she came from an ordinary family and her parents were just normal workers. There was only so much monthly income, so they had to be frugal in their spending. Even after she had a job, she had to be wise with her money so she naturally became petty. So when she did have money in her hands, she didn\u2019t dare to spend it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the original host came from an ordinary family, people didn\u2019t think badly of her. Maybe it was because she was really beautiful so it hid her bad characteristics. People could only see her beauty.If someone was pretty, they looked good in anything. Su Yaya felt like the dress she wore this time looked better than when she tried it on before she transmigrated through the book. She was even more touched by this.The sales staff was also convincing her, \u201cMiss, you look beautiful in this dress and you\u2019re the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. You should buy this.\u201dSu Yaya obviously wanted to buy it. Unlike before, she had money now. Chen Xiuqi had prepared a card for her so she could purchase it if she desired.\u201cHow much does this dress cost?\u201d Su Yaya asked.The sales staff glanced at the tag and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that expensive. It\u2019s 5880 dollars.\u201dSu Yaya was stunned at the price.In the past, the dress she fancied was only 3880 dollars, half of her monthly salary, so she couldn\u2019t bear to buy it. Now that she transmigrated it over, the same style and color dress became pricier by 2,000 dollars in the blink of her eyes. Although she was wealthy, she still looked upset.Perhaps she had always been a frugal spender because she was born from an ordinary family and knew that her parents worked hard to earn money in order to support the family. She had never spent that much just to buy a piece of clothing.After Su Yaya found out that the price was 5,880 dollars, her intense desire to buy the dress immediately diminished. To someone like her who was used to a frugal lifestyle, it was really too expensive. Despite having a platinum card, she still thought that the price was too much and couldn\u2019t bear to buy it.Seeing that the Su Yaya wasn\u2019t responding, the sales staff failed to guess the customer\u2019s frugal mindset since the dress this woman currently wore was in the ten thousands, along with her purse. This was much more costly compared to a dress of only 5,880 dollars. \u2018Could it be because the dress\u2019 price is too cheap, so she thinks that it doesn\u2019t fit her status?\u2019As she thought of this, the sales staff observed Su Yaya\u2019s expression again. Seeing how she slightly knitted her eyebrows, it could be because she disliked how cheap the dress was. But this dress was the most expensive one in the store. Had she known this earlier, she would\u2019ve increased the price. Sometimes, wealthy people refused to buy cheap things. It\u2019s better to raise the price so they would buy it. She felt like she had miscalculated.In order to make up for this mistake, the sales staff tried her best to market this dress to Su Yaya. She said, \u201cMiss, you look really beautiful in this dress. The style of this dress isn\u2019t any worse than those from famous brands. Sometimes, dresses from famous brands are just expensive and the quality isn\u2019t that good. You won\u2019t lose anything from buying this dress. People will definitely compliment you if you wear this.\u201dSu Yaya liked this dress from the start, but only hesitated because of the price. After the sales staff\u2019s persuasion, the desire to buy this dress rose once again. She really wanted to.Yet, she had never bought such an expensive dress like this before. She couldn\u2019t make up her mind. Even though it was Chen Xiuqi\u2019s card and he wouldn\u2019t care about this bit of money, she was still restless and anxious. Should she tell him?Su Yaya needed someone to make a decision for her. She tapped on the phone screen and opened WeChat, found Chen Xiuqi\u2019s WeChat and sent him a message.Yaya: Hubby, I\u2019m interested in a dress and I like it a lot. But it\u2019s a bit expensive. *Dress Picture.jpg*Yet the moment she sent the message, Su Yaya regretted it. Chen Xiuqi was probably the busiest at work right now. He disliked people disturbing him while he was doing work. Now that she sent him a message, would he be unhappy? This morning, she succeeded in pleasing him. \u2018Would he dislike her now?\u2019 She was really worried!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was nothing she could do to fix it.\u2018I\u2019m done for this time.\u2019 Chen Xiuqi will definitely think she\u2019s an annoying person after he receives her message. He will have a bad impression on her too, right?What should she do? Should she call him to explain that she didn\u2019t mean to disturb him? But if she was really busy and she called him, wouldn\u2019t that make him angrier?Su Yaya was so anxious.While she tweaked her ears and scratched her cheeks, her phone dinged.She stared at it to see a notification that Chen Xiuqi had sent a message.There was only one simple word: buy.Su Yaya looked at Chen Xiuqi\u2019s profile picture several times. After confirming it was truly him, she sighed.Thankfully he responded, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t know what to do.His message: \u2018buy,\u2019 was really simple, straightforward, and blunt.Su Yaya was thinking that since he had the time to reply, he wasn\u2019t angry that she had disturbed him. But he only replied with \u2018buy\u2019 which meant that he was really busy and didn\u2019t have time to chat with her. So it\u2019s better if she didn\u2019t disturb him. She sensibly placed her phone away and stopped sending him messages.When the sales staff saw that Su Yaya was done sending messages, she smiled and asked if she was going to buy the dress. After receiving Chen Xiuqi\u2019s message, Su Yaya felt like she finally had a backbone. Since he told her to buy it, she surely will.\u201cI\u2019ll take the dress.\u201d Su Yaya said generously. This was the first time she had bought such an expensive dress!\u201cThen how does Miss want to buy? You can pay using WeChat, Alipay, card, or cash.\u201d The sales staff looked happily at her. She was extremely ecstatic. This staff member will be rewarded with an outstanding performance once this dress is sold. Afterwards, she could sell other products and take a higher percentage of commission.\u201cBy card.\u201d Su Yaya said.\u201cOk, please follow me.\u201d The sales staff led Su Yaya to the checkout counter.When they arrived there, Su Yaya took out the platinum card that Chen Xiuqi gave her. The sales staff was about to reach over and grab it but Su Yaya held onto the card tightly. After all, if she let go, the sales staff would swipe 5,880 dollars from it. To Su Yaya who was used to being poor, it was a large amount of money. It was about her monthly salary. She really couldn\u2019t bear to. Her heart was dripping blood.\u201cMiss, please give me the card so I can swipe it.\u201d The sales staff held the other side of the card. She tried pulling on it but the hand wouldn\u2019t budge. Su Yaya held on tightly so the sales staff reminded her.Su Yaya pursed her lips. She really couldn\u2019t bear to spend that much. She had never done so, even with Chen Xiuqi\u2019s money. Of course, she uneasy and apprehensive.\u201cMiss?\u201dSu Yaya held on and didn\u2019t let go. The sales staff called her again.Right now, the situation was a bit awkward. Other people gave them strange glances at their odd behavior. Feeling panicked, Su Yaya loosened her grip on the card and the sales staff took it.As though she was afraid that Su Yaya might regret it, the sales staff quickly swiped the card and printed out the receipt. She grabbed a pen for Su Yaya to sign her name.Su Yanyi met the sales staff\u2019s smiling face and thought that she might as well accept this. She took the pen and signed.\u2026Chen Xiuqi had been waiting for Yaya to reply, but received no response for a long time. After he picked up his phone for the nth time, the phone screen finally brightened.He hurriedly unlocked his phone to see a notification from his bank: Dear mudan platinum card user, your card ending with xxxx had spent 5,880 in a shopping mall\u2026Chen Xiuqi was confused.He stared at the final amount spent for a while and was puzzled. He had never bought such a cheap dress for Su Yaya. What did Su Yaya\u2019s message say? That the dress was a bit too expensive? 5,880 dollars is too expensive?

Her parents were also ordinary employees in companies, yet both of them treasured Su Yaya a lot. Perhaps their belief that daughters should be raised in riches was the reason they spent all their money on her. The original Su Yaya never suffered hardship in her youth, and her parents bought her the best and most expensive food and clothing.In addition, Su Yaya was beautiful. She certainly grew up into an elegant and slender woman. Many people tried to pursue her, and there were others who gifted her bags, dresses, and pieces of jewelry from famous brands. Nothing that she used before was cheap.Although Chen Xiuqi\u2019s initial motive was finding a substitute upon meeting Su Yaya, he still had to spend quite a lot of money in order to pursue her. All the gifts he bought for her cost at least five digits or more. He couldn\u2019t give her anything cheap that she would look upon in disdain.It was rare that Su Yaya had bought a dress worth around 5,000 yuan. She specially sent him a message to tell him that. Chen Xiuqi was bewildered by this. Did Su Yaya change her personality?But Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t know that Su Yaya\u2019s personality didn\u2019t change; rather, she was a completely different person.Chen Xiuqi received a text from the bank that money was spent. He thought that Su Yaya would send him a message since she had bought a dress.Yet, he was left waiting for a long time. One minute passed by\u2026ten minutes passed by\u2026twenty minutes passed by. He still hadn\u2019t gotten Su Yaya\u2019s message.Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face turned gloomy, like the sky before the thunderstorm. What was this woman doing? Was it that difficult to send him a message?The marketing manager detected Chen Xiuqi\u2019s gloomy face and thought that he had upset him because of his marketing plan. He carefully observed his expression and trembled in fear while talking.Chen Xiuqi hadn\u2019t realized that his gloomy look seriously affected the marketing manager\u2019s behavior. He was still waiting for Su Yaya\u2019s message as his gaze lingered on his phone screen. Another ten minutes passed by and he finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He tapped on the phone screen and set a message to her.\u2026Su Yaya carried the dress she bought and just walked to a bakery outside when she had a ding from her phone.She saw that Chen Xiuqi had sent her a message and she hurriedly unlocked her phone and clicked on it.Chen Xiuqi: Where did you go?It was a simple question so Su Yaya was unable to understand how anxious Chen Xiuqi had been to receive her message. She didn\u2019t notice that his question was basically a result of his impatience.But Su Yaya obediently replied to his message.Yaya: I am outside Mancosu Bakery. I\u2019m hungry so I\u2019m about to buy something to eat.Once she sent the message, Su Yay placed her phone away and walked in the bakery.Mancosu Bakery isn\u2019t really a famous brand but their matcha cakes are delicious. Before Su Yaya transmigrated, she enjoyed eating Mancosu\u2019s cakes. But, they were expensive. Just a small piece of cake was about 30-40 yuan. She could only bear to buy a piece of it on the day she receives her monthly salary.Su Yaya stood in front of the counter and looked at the different types of cakes on display. Each one of them was so pretty and delicious. She really wanted to taste each of them. Previously, she had tried matcha and chocolate flavored cakes. This time, she will pick another two flavors; in the end, she chose strawberry and coffee flavored cakes.After she chose her cakes, she chose a seat by the window. With a desert knife in her hand, Su Yaya was about to savor her treat when she heard another ding from her phone. She pulled it out and found a message from Chen Xiuqi.Chen Xiuqi: Buy some food for me and bring it to the company.Su Yaya looked over the message twice and blinked her eyes, and again. Chen Xiuqi wanted her to buy food and bring it to her company? Is he free?In her memory, Chen Xiuqi\u2019s assistant was in charge of buying his afternoon tea. He never asked her to buy food for him before. Could it be because of her message saying that she was eating cake in the bakery, so he wanted to eat it too?Hm. This was a possibility since Mancosu\u2019s cakes were pretty good. Otherwise, why else would Chen Xiuqi have her buy food for him?This was reasonable now. Su Yaya decided to buy two pieces of cake for Chen Xiuqi after she finishes her share.Su Yaya enjoyed eating her delicious strawberry and coffee flavored cakes. In the past, she only had the heart to buy a piece to eat when she got her monthly salary. Today, she ate two pieces at once and still wasn\u2019t fully satisfied.She had the waitress pack up the vanilla and chocolate flavored cakes after she was done. Su Yaya planned to bring it to her husband. In addition, those exquisite macarons packed in a box seemed quite good too. Feeling moved, she bought a box of those as well. Su Yaya happily walked out the bakery.She took the elevator and went to the underground parking lot. After finding her car, she got in and carefully placed the cakes by her side. It was time to drive towards Chen Xiuqi\u2019s company.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This entire building of 32 floors belonged to the Chen Group. People must swipe their cards in order to enter the elevator and each employee had specific responsibilities. They could only go to their designated floors.Su Yaya wasn\u2019t an employee in Chen\u2019s Group and she hadn\u2019t visited here before, so she naturally didn\u2019t have a card to take the elevator. She couldn\u2019t go up so she had to call Chen Xiuqi.Su Yaya patiently waited for Chen Xiuqi to pick up his phone. When her phone rang a second time, her call was finally answered. Chen Xiuqi\u2019s deep voice resounded, \u201cAre you here?\u201dSu Yaya hummed in agreement and said, \u201cI just arrived at the parking lot.\u201d\u201cThen come to the 26th floor.\u201d Chen Xiuqi said after.Su Yaya pursed her lips and gently reminded, \u201cHubby, have you forgotten that I need to swipe a card in order to take your company\u2019s elevators? I\u2019m not an employee here and I don\u2019t have a card.\u201dChen Xiuqi clearly paused before he continued, \u201cThen sit at the lounge for a while. I will have Assistant Chen come and pick you up.\u201dIt was just right that Assistant Chen was coming to pick her up. Su Yaya sensibly nodded and said, \u201cOk, I will wait for him at the lounge.\u201dAfter the two agreed upon this, Su Yaya hung up and left the car with the cakes in her hands, then walked towards the building\u2019s entrance.Along with her beauty and pale skin, Su Yaya had a great figure that attracted people\u2019s attention wherever she walked. Not only men, but women couldn\u2019t take their eyes off of her as well.Once she walked through Chen Group\u2019s door, it was the same situation. The guard standing in front of the door gawked at her and only shifted his gaze after she walked in the lounge.The two employees by the reception desk were originally having a conversation when He Rui suddenly noticed a beautiful woman walking in the door. The surprised He Rui stared at the newcomer before excitedly nudging her colleague, Li Lan. She lowered her voice and said, \u201cQuickly look, quickly look. Isn\u2019t that woman a celebrity who was in a scandal with President Chen? What was her name? Let me think about it. Didn\u2019t the entertainment news say her name was Su Yaya?\u201dLi Lan raised her head and looked towards Su Yaya. She pursed her lips and said in disdain, \u201cSaying that she is an ordinary celebrity is already praising her. She is just a side female lead in an online drama. Plus, she probably promoted herself through her and President Chen\u2019s scandal. Maybe President Chen doesn\u2019t even recognize her.\u201dWho was President Chen? He\u2019s a handsome, wealthy, and domineering President. He was frequently on the finance magazines. There were at least a million of women who were in love with him. Of those women, they included beauties from influential families. Also, rumor has it that President Chen is in love with a certain woman. How could he possibly be interested in a mere online celebrity like Su Yaya? President Su had seen many women. Who does she think she is?He Rui thought Li Lan\u2019s words were reasonable. She and Li Lan looked down on Su Yaya, this online celebrity. They watched as she carried the cakes and sat down on a sofa in front, as though she was going to wait here a long time. She couldn\u2019t help but laugh and say, \u201cWhy do you think she\u2019s at our company right now?\u201dLi Lan snorted and said, full of experience, \u201cWhy else? She\u2019s definitely waiting for President Chen.\u201dShe had already chased President Chen here. Now, she wanted to be shameless and wait for him to come out. She\u2019s really losing face!(T/N: Basically, \u2018losing face\u2019 is losing \u201cdignity\u201d or \u201cprestige\u201d, but no translation can aptly cover all its fine nuances\u2026)He Rui laughed with her and said, \u201cIt will be the end of the world if President Chen comes for her.\u201dAny women who had come to the company to stop President Chen all landed with tragic consequences. She was willing to enjoy the show.At this time, the elevator exclusive for the President dinged. He Rui and Li Lan glanced at each other, thinking that Chen Xiuqi had came down. They hurriedly revealed a smile they thought to be perfect and stared at the elevator door, preparing to leave a good impression on their CEO.The elevator slowly opened, but only Assistant Chen came out of the elevator in haste. He Rui and Li Lan looked at the scene behind him, but no one else was there. President Chen did not come down.\u201cAssistant Chen.\u201d Li Lan greeted him with a smile.Assistant Chen nodded at him and headed for Su Yaya who was sitting on the sofa ahead.\u201cMiss Su, sorry for making you wait. President Chen is waiting for you upstairs.\u201d Assistant Chen walked over and politely said.Li Lan and He Rui, who heard Assistant Chen\u2019s words, froze at that moment. Their faces clearly revealed shock.What did they say before? Wasn\u2019t President Chen supposed to drive her out? How could he let Assistant Chen bring her up? Plus, why is he being so polite? What exactly is going on?But this was the truth. Their embarrassment cut just as deep as their initial disdain towards towards Su Yaya!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His appearance at this time was like a slap right on their faces.Assistant Chen\u2019s polite manners left a good impression on Su Yaya. She smiled at him and followed his lead.\u201cThis way please.\u201d Assistant Chen gestured towards the elevator door.Su Yaya stood up and was just about to pick up the cake on the table when Assistant Chen said hurriedly, \u201cLet me help you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I can take it myself.\u201d This was the afternoon tea that she bought for Chen Xiuqi, so it would seem more genuine by carrying it herself.Assistant Chen didn\u2019t say anything else after she insisted on carrying it herself. He proceeded to lead the way towards the president\u2019s exclusive elevator while Su Yaya followed behind him. When she passed by the reception desk, she gave the two receptionists, He Rui and Li Lan, a friendly smile.However, in He Rui and Li Lan\u2019s view, Su Yaya\u2019s friendly smile was interpreted as a prideful smirk. After gossiping so much about her, their faces were now burning hot, as if their cheeks were slapped red.However, Su Yaya had no idea what He Rui and Li Lan were thinking. She simply followed Assistant Chen to the elevator, where the man swiped his card and caused the doors to slide open. Assistant Chen stepped back to allow her to enter first, and then followed in after her after she got in.He Rui and Li Lan were stunned when they saw the scene.Who said President Chen doesn\u2019t remember the online celebrity, Su Yaya, from the one hundred and eighty network? Who else said that the gossip between Su Yaya and President Chen was made up by Su Yaya in order to increase her popularity? Don\u2019t they see that President Chen\u2019s most trustworthy assistant, Assistant Chen, came down to personally escort Su Yaya? Don\u2019t they see that Assistant Chen allowed Su Yaya to ride the exclusive elevator and even allowed her to enter first? Every detail clearly showed how much President Chen cared about Su Yaya!Oh my god, this was huge news!After being slapped in the face by reality, He Rui and Li Lan quickly sent the news to the company group chat, \u201cCEO Chen sent Assistant Chen to pick up Su Yaya to the President\u2019s office.\u201d Soon after, this news was spread across the company and became a popular gossip topic between women.Su Yaya followed Assistant Chen up to the 26th floor. He then led her to the President\u2019s office and knocked on the door. They waited a moment before they heard Chen Xiuqi\u2019s approval to enter her office from the inside. Assistant Chen opened the door and allowed Su Yaya to enter first.\u201cPresident Chen, Miss Su is here.\u201dEven after hearing that, Chen Xiuqi continued to look at the documents in front of him. He continued to stare at the document until he finished reading it. Then, he picked up a pen and signed the paper. Only after he put down his pen, did he look up.\u201cSend the documents that I had just signed.\u201d Chen Xiuqi handed over the papers he had just signed, upon which Assistant Chen quickly accepted the documents and left.Assistant Chen closed the office door after he left.The spacious office now only encompassed Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi. Golden sunlight penetrated the bright glass window from the left.A ray of sunlight shone upon Chen Xiuqi\u2019s figure as he leaned against his chair behind a huge desk. The man stared at Su Yaya with his deep eyes, appearing tall and intimidating. \u201cCome here, what are doing standing there for?\u201d Chen Xiuqi said in a commanding tone.Su Yaya quickly walked over while carrying the cake and placed it on his desk. She smiled and said in a fawning tone, \u201cI bought this for your afternoon tea. It tastes pretty good, you should try it.\u201dChen Xiuqi\u2019s eyes fell on the cake box and couldn\u2019t help but frown. When did he tell her that he wanted to eat cake?\u201cThat\u2019s what you bought for my afternoon tea?\u201d Chen Xiuqi said coldly.Failing to sense the disappointment in his voice, Su Yaya took out the chocolate flavored cake from the box and placed a fork next to the dessert. She held the cake up with both hands, placed it right front of Chen Xiuqi, and said with a sweet smile, \u201cThis cake tastes really delicious. I\u2019ve always savored eating the cakes from this bakery, so I went there earlier to enjoy a couple of cakes. Since you told me to bring something for you while I was there, I thought that you must really like the cakes from that store. So, I bought you a vanilla and chocolate flavored cake. You should try it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He told her to buy something for him, so she decided to buy him cakes? Did he say that he wanted to eat cakes? Oh, just because she was eating this dessert at the time he asked her to buy something for him, it meant that he also wanted to eat cakes? What kind of logic was this? Did he say he wanted to eat cakes?Su Yaya finally sensed that there was something wrong with Chen Xiuqi. His eyes appeared cold, like he wasn\u2019t very happy. She tentatively asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dChen Xiuqi was literally about to burst out in laughter because of how angry he was at her. He humped coldly, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dWhen her eyes met his cold gaze, Su Yaya suddenly understood something. She asked weakly, \u201cDo you not like to eat cakes?\u201dChen Xiuqi watched her silently.Su Yaya thought Chen Xiuqi was a bit weird. The book didn\u2019t mention anything about his dislike for cakes or having any issues about it.But now wasn\u2019t the right time to worry about this. She blinked her eyes and said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I bought these cakes for myself. What would you like to eat? I\u2019ll go buy something else for you.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need, eat it yourself.\u201d Chen Xiuqi already lost his interest. He turned back to his computer and started to work again.Su Yaya pouted and thought: Fine, you don\u2019t have to eat it. These cakes were not cheap! Each piece cost over ten yuan! She then picked up the cake and turned to eat on the sofa nearby.So delicious!Su Yaya narrowed her eyes with satisfaction. The corners of her mouth curved up into a smile, revealing two small dimples on the sides of her cheeks. She looked both sweet and adorable.It was soft and delicious, sweet but not greasy, making her want to eat even more.\u201cOne more bite.\u201d Su Yaya scooped another bite of cake into her mouth, and then another. Mhmm, she was fully enjoying the food.Chen Xiuqi turned his head unintentionally and saw Su Yaya sitting on the couch eating the cake delightfully. She smiled happily and exposed her two dimples on her cheeks. He was touched by how sweet and adorable she was.From Chen Xiuqi\u2019s perspective, she happily ate the cake as if it tasted like heaven. He had the urge to ask her: was it really that tasty?Not knowing that Chen Xiuqi was looking at her, Su Yaya set her heart on eating the cake, which pleased her greatly. She didn\u2019t even realize the cream on the corner of her lip. After she finished a piece of the cake, she curled her lips up into a splendid smile.Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t know what to say after seeing her bright smile along with the cream on the corner of her lip.Once Su Yaya was done with her chocolate cake, she wanted to continue to eat her vanilla cake. As she reached for it, another hand took the cake from her.Following the direction of the hand, Su Yaya met Chen Xiuqi\u2019s enigmatic face. She pouted her moist red lips and said, \u201cMy cake.\u201dHe already said he didn\u2019t want to eat it, so why is he taking her cake now?She appeared adorable even though she was pouting. When he saw that there was some cream on the corner of her mouth, he pointed his finger at her mouth and said with good intentions, \u201cYou have a little cream here.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Su Yaya blankly stared at her as her face immediately flushed red. The corner of her mouth was covered in cream while she was pouting earlier. How unsightly did I look earlier? I need to quickly wipe it off.\u201cHere.\u201d Chen Xiuqi passed her a napkin.\u201cThank you.\u201d Su Yaya hurriedly reached for it, but Chen Xiuqi took the napkin back.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Su Yaya looked up at him strangely. She still didn\u2019t react when the view in front of her was blocked out by a handsome face pressing down on her.A pair of soft and warm lips pressed against her warm lips. His damp tongue swept over the corner of her lips, putting the cream into his mouth. It tasted a little sweet but it wasn\u2019t greasy at all. The taste had ignited his appetite, this wasn\u2019t enough. His tongue wanted to taste more sweetness as he began to trace the shape of her lips. He pried open her mouth and his tongue entered her mouth, hooking his tongue with her tongue and began to tease her.It was a long French kiss. Chen Xiuqi finally let her go after he kissed Su Yaya deeply and firmly, making her head dizzy at the lack of oxygen.Su Yaya leaned on the sofa as she gasped for air. Chen Xiuqi stared deeply at her slightly red lips and then tilted her chin upwards with a finger. He smacked his lips and said, \u201cSure enough, it\u2019s really delicious.\u201dSu Yaya quivered when she heard him say that. Was he describing the cream on her lips or her?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Delicious (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.17 Delicious (3)When Su Yaya snapped out of her daydream, Chen Xiuqi had sat next to her, very close in fact. His leg touched hers and his hands as well. They were almost on top of each other.Su Yaya thought that they were too close and felt a bit uncomfortable. She wanted to shift to the side but in the next second, Chen Xiuqi detected her motive and reached over to place his arms around her shoulders. He stared deeply and intensely at her.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Chen Xiuqi asked.She met his interrogating gaze and her weak heart rapidly thumped. After all, she needed to please Chen Xiuqi right now and hopefully leave a good impression on him. That way, when they divorce in the future, it wouldn\u2019t end badly. So it\u2019s better if she didn\u2019t do things that he didn\u2019t want her to do and things that would make him unhappy.Now that she processed this, she abandoned her decision and sat there obediently, leaning against his arms like a kitten.Chen Xiuqi reached for the vanilla cake on the side and placed it in front of Su Yaya. He slightly raised his chin and indicated for her to feed him.Su Yaya was stunned and couldn\u2019t help to criticize him. He was the one who aversed the cake she bought and gave her ugly looks. Now, he wanted her to feed him. His personality changes too quickly! Who said that women change quickly? Men do too!Even though Su Yaya had been complaining about Chen Xiuqi\u2019s changing atittude, she didn\u2019t show this on the surface. She obediently scooped a piece of cake to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s mouth.\u201cEat it, eat it. It\u2019s really tasty.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and said.Even though he ordered her to feed him, she decided to cooperate with him in the end. She made sure he enjoyed it.Chen Xiuqi ate a piece of cake and it was sweet but not greasy. It was pretty good.In the past, An Yutong liked to eat cakes, especially chocolate flavored cakes. She could eat two slices at once and ate happily. He couldn\u2019t understand how the sweet and greasy cakes could be so delicious. Every time she wanted him to eat it, he refused. He didn\u2019t find the necessity to try it.Therefore when Su Yaya bought the cakes up, he aversed it in his inner heart. But after seeing how happy she was eating it and her sweet smile and the two beautiful dimples on her cheeks, he was touched. Maybe it was because she enjoyed it, he wanted to try it after tasting her lips.Chen Xiuqi ate several pieces of cake in a row. It was really tasty. Unaware, he already finished a slice of cake.\u201cIs it tasty?\u201d Su Yaya smiled and looked at him with her bright and sparkling eyes.Eating desserts placed people in a delightful mood. Maybe it was because of this, so Chen Xiuqi was in a great mood. He reached over and pinched Su Yaya\u2019s white and delicate face. He commented, \u201cIt\u2019s ok.\u201d\u201cRight, I told you it\u2019s delicious. Hehe.\u201d Su Yaya automatically changed the \u2018it\u2019s ok\u2019 to \u2018pretty good and tasty\u2019. In her eyes, it was great that someone like Chen Xiuqi said something like this.After he finished the cake, Chen Xiuqi sat there for a while before turning to handle his work. Su Yaya had nothing to do and didn\u2019t dare to disturb Chen Xiuqi. She sat there quietly on the sofa and scrolled through her Weibo, playing. She tried to make herself invisible.Su Yaya scrolled through Weibo for a while before she accidentally clicked into a fashion blogger\u2019s Weibo. The blogger just updated with a new set of pictures.Beautiful fashion blogger: I coincidentally met a beautiful girl today. *insert picture.jpg* *insert picture.jpg* *insert picture.jpg*Su Yaya didn\u2019t recognize this fashion blogger but she knew who the person in the picture was. It wasn\u2019t anyone else, but herself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was none other than herself.As it turned out, someone had taken pictures of her while she was at the shopping mall and uploaded them to Weibo.Su Yanyi slightly pouted her red lip. She thought that no one would take pictures of her, who only filmed an online drama which wasn\u2019t even popular and an ordinary celebrity. So while she was shopping, she never considered wearing sunglasses and hat.It was a good thing that she was born beautiful and even though she applied faint makeup and casually shopped, the blogger was still able to take a beautiful picture of her. They uploaded four photos and each of them was natural and made her look beautiful. It was perfect and even more beautiful than the photoshopped celebrities\u2019 photos.Of course, the blogger wouldn\u2019t photoshop her pictures for her. They didn\u2019t even edit it and basically uploaded the pictures onto Weibo right then as they took it.Su Yaya was happy at how beautiful she looked in the pictures. She didn\u2019t think someone would\u2019ve taken pictures of her one day and she giggled at this\u2026The fashion blogger who took pictures of Su Yaya wasn\u2019t that famous and they only had around one million followers or so. Not many people forwarded her post and there weren\u2019t that many comments on her Weibo either. But after she uploaded pictures of Su Yaya, the comments below exploded. Plus, many were commenting on how beautiful the girl was and licking the screen.Up until a user named \u2018I love little pig\u2019 commented.I love little pig: This girl looks familiar. Why do I think she\u2019s the female side lead to the online drama \u300a Pamper before Marriage \u300b?Slight love: I think so too.Commenting happiness: +1Trembling life: Picture. \u300a Pamper before Marriage \u300bFemale side lead.jpgSmiling: After comparison, the picture in the crew and the photo the blogger sent are the same person.A dreaming dog: Woah, this girl is so beautiful. Is \u300a Pamper before Marriage \u300bgood? If it is, I\u2019ll go watch it.\u2026Su Yaya didn\u2019t understand the comments. Didn\u2019t someone just upload some pictures of her on the internet? Who knew she would\u2019ve been recognized that easily. Plus, the only online drama she participated in wasn\u2019t even popular, yet someone had found out about it. It was really the era of the internet. No one had any privacy and the ability for user on the internet to gossip is too powerful. They are able to unravel everything with just one clue.She just sighed when her phone rang. She looked at the caller on the phone and quickly turned her ringtone off.She looked back at Chen Xiuqi who was handling his work behind the desk. He was fully immersed in the information on his computer and didn\u2019t detect the movement.To stop herself from disturbing Chen Xiuqi while he was working, Su Yaya decided to answer the call outside the office. She stood up and started to walk towards the door.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d When Su Yaya was almost at the door, Chen Xiuqi suddenly shifted his gaze from the computer screen. He wore golden rimless glasses and a tint of light flickered in his eyes. He stared straight at her through his glasses.Su Yaya originally thought that he was concentrated on work, but he actually paid attention to her movement as well.Su Yaya turned around and waved the phone in her hand, slightly smiling. She said, \u201cI\u2019m going out to answer a call. It\u2019s Sister Zhou\u2019s.\u201dSu Yaya meant her manager, Zhou Peiyun.Half a year ago, because Zhou Peiyun thought Su Yaya was beautiful, she tried many ways to sign a contract with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Zhou Peiyun (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Peiyun used her connections to help Su Yaya get the female side lead tryout quota \u300aPamper then Marriage \u300b. In the end, due to Su Yaya\u2019s appearance and excellent performance, she obtained the role as her manager.The online drama, \u300aPamper then Marriage \u300b, was actually shot under one of the filming companies, Sheng Shi Entertainment, under Chen Xiuqi\u2019s name. The day Su Yaya went to audition, Chen Xiuqi coincidentally went to Sheng Shi Entertainment for inspection. That was how they met.When Chen Xiuqi first saw her, he was moved and then started to frantically pursue her. People constantly pursued her since middle school because of her beautiful appearance. There were other noblemen who pursued her during that time, but Chen Xiuqi was more generous and charming, holding more power against the others.Once Zhou Peiyun found out she said, \u201cIt\u2019s true that you\u2019re beautiful but there are many beautiful women in the entertainment circle. If you really want to make yourself known in the entertainment circle, you have to find someone to support you, like Chen Xiuqi. That would be the best.\u201dAfter Su Yaya heard this, she was moved. However, it wasn\u2019t because of making herself known in the entertainment circle that made her moved. She thought that since she was beautiful, she was bound to be superior to others. It\u2019s very tiring in the entertainment circle and to shoot scenes. Why must she make herself do all this work? As long as she got Chen Xiuqi to support her, she didn\u2019t even need to do anything to enjoy everything.Plus, Chen Xiuqi was handsome, wealthy, charming, and powerful. There were only benefits to following him and no consequences. Therefore, she quickly accepted and dated him.While they were dating, Chen Xiuqi pampered her like usual. He was extremely generous with her and Su Yaya enjoyed this feeling. Unconsciously, she sank into the love web that Chen Xiuqi made for her and ended up truly falling in love with him. When he mentioned a contract marriage, she agreed without hesitation.Chen Xiuqi knew Zhou Peiyun and that she was Su Yaya\u2019s manager. The fact that she called Su Yaya at this time was probably because of work. Therefore, he nodded his head and said, \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya nodded and walked out the door with her phone.Chen Xiuqi continued to bury himself in his work.Once Su Yaya walked out the office, she planned to call Zhou Peiyun back when she called again.Su Yaya hurriedly picked up the phone and before she could greet her, her voice exploded from the other side.\u201cYou went shopping today? Did you know people took pictures of you? Didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019re just taking a few days off? It\u2019s been almost half a month already. Did you deal with you and President Chen\u2019s matters? When are you coming to the company?\u201d\u201cSister Zhou, sister Zhou.\u201d Su Yaya rushed and called her. When the other party stopped, she asked, \u201cWhich questions do you want me to answer first?\u201dSister Zhou clearly paused for two seconds and then she said, \u201cPeople took pictures of you and even uploaded them to Weibo. Now, it\u2019s quickly gaining popularity. Thankfully, the comments were positive. I want to use this chance to make you even more popular.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Although Su Yaya responded faintly, she was ecstatic in her heart. According to Zhou Peiyun\u2019s words, she wanted to make her even more popular, as in bringing her onto the hot search rankings?Oh my god. She didn\u2019t even do anything yet. People only took some pictures of her and she\u2019s going to end up on the hot search rankings. She was practically begging for this to happen. Hahah\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 - Escape RoutePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Peiyun pondered over Su YaYa\u2019s calm response since she wasn\u2019t being as noisy and rowdy like before. Shouldn\u2019t she be very happy? Did she really lose her mind because Chen Xiuqi had become her sugar daddy?However, she didn\u2019t think much about it as she was quite busy and had to deal with other matters. She didn\u2019t have time to waste on thinking of this matter. She continued to arrange the other events for the future and said, \u201cTomorrow morning, come to the company. I have an advertisement that is very suitable for you. Come over and take a look.\u201dAdvertisement? She\u2019s going to shoot an advertisement?!Zhou Peiyun had been talking nonstop about it and Su Yaya didn\u2019t have more time to consider this. She agreed.\u201cOk. I\u2019ll wait for you tomorrow morning around ten at the company.\u201d Zhou Peiyun made herself clear and hung up.When the light on the phone screen dimmed, Su Yaya held her phone and rubbed her forehead against it. She recalled Zhou Peiyun\u2019s words and smiled happily. Heheh. Good things are constantly happening to her!So delightful.When she was young, she had the dream of becoming a celebrity. When she was a teen, she watched as the celebrities on TV were so bright and beautiful. She hoped that she could be as beautiful as the celebrities and shoot advertisements and TV shows. She wanted to go on reality shows and earn several ten millions or even 100 millions each year, living an exquisite life that normal people wouldn\u2019t be able to. She wanted to eat food made for upper class, buy brand name clothes, bags, and cars. She wanted to live in a huge villa with three floors with a garden. She wanted her parents who had been working hard their entire lives to enjoy this happiness with her. She wanted to travel around the country and abroad with the money she spent, going everywhere she desired.However, it was a great dream, but a ruthless reality.She could dream of this but she had to wake up in the end. Every morning, she had to work from eight to six pm. Her monthly salary was just enough for her to survive. Don\u2019t mention how tiring it was, but she had to endure her boss\u2019s scoldings. During the New Years, she couldn\u2019t really send much money back to her parents either. It was really bitter.Right now, Su Yaya was in a pleasant mood. She never thought that she would\u2019ve transmigrated into a book due to her sleep and then become a wealthy wife. She became a wealthy woman who she had dreamed about becoming. Plus, Chen Xiuqi pampered her a lot and satisfied all the great imagination she held for wealthy families.Although someone else would take her position in the future and she might be kicked out anytime, thankfully she had another status \u2014 an actress.Okay. She had only participated in one online drama so it was a bit reluctant to call herself an actress. Luckily, she was now part of the entertainment circle. She had fulfilled her celebrity dream that she had as a child.As long as she worked hard, there will be a day where she changed from an ordinary celebrity into a well-known one. By then, she would\u2019ve earned enough.Right now, she was completely relying on Chen Xiuqi in order to have a relaxing life. But she will be kicked out in the future. Shouldn\u2019t she leave herself an escape route?The first was to not offend Chen Xiuqi and An Yutong. Besides that, she needed to work on filming movies and becoming a famous celebrity. That way, she could earn more money and create a better life for her future. Even if she decided to go back to her hometown and raise livestock, she could find a great land for herself, right?Plus, these two motives don\u2019t clash. She could work on them both at the same time.Hm. Since she wanted to do this, she will do this. Su Yaya who was an optimistic person quickly made a decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She said she has an advertisement shooting for me.\u201d Su Yaya was happy in her heart and didn\u2019t plan on hiding this from Chen Xiuqi. After all, he would find out sooner or later that she was going to shoot advertisement. It\u2019s better if she told him truthfully.Chen Xiuqi glanced at her and said, \u201cYou want to shoot advertisements?\u201dSu Yaya paused when she heard this and looked around. Something seemed to explode in her mind. She quickly ran over to him and hugged his arms. She smiled at him and said, \u201cYou have an advertisement for me to shoot?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Chen Xiuqi rejected bluntly.Su Yaya pouted her lips in displeasure and she continued, \u201cChen Group is a big company and it has many sub companies, having a hand in many different businesses including: housing, gaming, entertainment, clothing, etc. It seems like every season, it was inviting celebrities to shoot advertisements! How could it possibly have no advertisements to shoot?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not like those celebrities.\u201d Chen Xiuqi said expressionlessly.Su Yaya scrunched her eyebrows and was speechless.Can he not say it in such a hurtful way? She admits that she isn\u2019t some sort of famous celebrity right now but she was at least an online celebrity. Didn\u2019t he see that someone was taking pictures of her? Didn\u2019t he see that she was about to be on the hot search rankings? Didn\u2019t he see that she will have new advertisements to shoot soon? If this continues, she will become a famous celebrity in no time. In the future, even if Chen Group begged her to shoot an advertisement for them, she will deny them. Humph!Chen Xiuqi glanced at her and seeing how deeply unhappy she was, he knew what she was thinking about. He faintly said, \u201cYou\u2019re my wife, Lady Chen.\u201dEven if this was a contract marriage, she was still his wife and Lady Chen. Even if they didn\u2019t make their status public and barely anyone knew, this was not to be doubted. The other celebrities wouldn\u2019t be able to compare against this.\u2026Su Yaya blinked her eyes and then again. She suddenly understood what he meant. She smiled and pounced on him, kissing his right cheek. She then raised her head and said, \u201cHubby, you\u2019re so mean. You\u2019re teasing me on purpose!\u201dChen Xiuqi smiled slightly and flicked her face with his right hand. He said in an uncertain meaning. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dSu Yaya giggled and held onto him. \u201cYou\u2019re teasing me. I knew it.\u201d\u201cI have never seen anyone as shameless as you.\u201d Chen Xiuqi pinched her face and the smile on his face became more evident.Su Yaya decided to risk it. Since he said that she was shameless, she\u2019ll show him shameless! She started blurting out compliments as though it was for free. She pestered Chen Xiuqi and said, \u201cHubby, hubby, you\u2019re the best. You\u2019re the best person in the world. You have Chen Group, such a big company, and Sheng Shi Entertainment as well. You also have a lot of resources so just pass some over to me. I just need a bit from you.\u201dIf she was willing to slip some resources to her, she will be able to enjoy the benefits endlessly.Chen Xiuqi raised his eyebrows and stared at her. \u201cIf I give you some resources, what benefits would I get out of it?\u201dBusinessman. He is indeed a businessman. No matter what he did revolved around benefits. He even dare to bring up conditions for his own wife. She refreshed her knowledge of him again.However, Su Yaya only dared to complain about this in her heart. She didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud or express this.She looked over at Chen Xiuqi and thought about what she had that could move him. In the end, she had an idea and kissed his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked passionately at him with admiration and love.Chen Xiuqi glanced at her and shook his head, unmoved. \u201cNot enough.\u201dUh\u2026This wasn\u2019t enough?Su Yaya pursed her lips. What else could she do?Seeing how she racked her brains to come up with an idea and how she widened her eyes and slightly pouted, she looked innocent and adorable.Chen Xiuqi was touched and reached over to hold her in his arms. He lowered his head and bit her lip. He smiled and reminded, \u201cThink more.\u201dIt was a seductive voice, pleasant to the ears like the violin notes. It enticed her to commit a crime. She felt like her ears were pregnant.Sigh. Su Yaya\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened. She thought of something and murmured something in his ears.The soft breath landed on Chen Xiuqi\u2019s ears and it slightly tickled him. Su Yaya was like a kitten leaning on him. The sweet fragrance attacked his nose, like a hook and controlled his emotions.Su Yaya observed Chen Xiuqi\u2019s expression and smiled sexily and charmingly. She was like a little minx and said in a gentle voice, \u201cHubby, what do you think?\u201dChen Xiuqi\u2019s deep eyes swept over her face. He stared at her bright and sly smile. He was suddenly moved by her actions and he lowered his head to kiss her face. He said in her ears, \u201cOk.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d He agreed, Before she could thank him, he sucked on her earlobe. That was her sensitive part and she couldn\u2019t help but to scream.Chen Xiuqi chuckled and sat her down on his thighs. His charming voice said by her hairs, \u201cI\u2019ll collect some interest first.\u201dAlthough he said this, Su Yaya felt like it wasn\u2019t as simple as collecting interest as he claimed. She finally concluded something later on. That is to never make deals with a businessman. With someone who didn\u2019t know how business works like her, she will end up being eaten alive!\u2026The entire night, Chen Xiuqi claimed that he was just collecting his debt. He made her go a couple rounds with him and in the end, she ended up crying and begging for his mercy. She cried like a kitten.Yet, she didn\u2019t know that the more she cried, the more Chen Xiuqi wanted to make love with her. He finally stopped after she fainted.Of course, she had gotten a generous amount of benefits from this night. The next day, Chen Xiuqi gave her a contract for a TV show\u2019s second female lead.\u201cIs this for me?\u201d Su Yaya hugged the contract, unable to react. Yesterday, she said she just wanted an advertisement. Who knew he decided to give him a second female lead role in a TV show. She was too excited and surprised.Chen Xiuqi rubbed the top of her head and he chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s a reward.\u201dHe was very pleased with her performance last night.\u201cThank you.\u201d Su Yaya held onto the script with both his friends and sat on the bed. She raised her head and smiled.Chen Xiuqi slightly smiled and caressed the corner of her lip. She was obedient so he won\u2019t let her suffer.\u201cI\u2019m going to work.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya answered, very sensible. \u201cHubby, be careful on your way and have fun. Smooches.\u201dChen Xiuqi kissed the corner of her lip and walked out. Su Yaya watched him leave.After he left, Su Yaya lied back on her bed and started to laugh foolishly.Although she was in pain due to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s tortures, she and Chen Xiuqi were a married couple so she enjoyed the entire process. Chen Xiuqi had a mouth-watering figure and was experienced at this. Now that she thought about it, it was amazing so she didn\u2019t suffer from much. Plus, she had gotten a second female lead for a TV show. She basically earned more than expected.Chen Xiuqi who came back heard the laughter inside the room. He stopped the action of opening the door. Without looking, he could imagine how Su Yaya was lying on bed and rolling around happily. Why is she so adorable and easy to soothe?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She headed out the door and drove the car over to the company to meet up with her manager. Su Yaya soon found Zhou Peiyun, who was holding the second female lead script and the contract in her hands.The entertainment company she was at right now was a small company called Starlight Entertainment. This year was the fifth year since it was created.The battle within the entertainment circle had became competitive. There were all sorts of entertainment companies, film studios, online celebrities, and actors. Up to hundreds of people would fight over a side lead role in an online drama.As expected of a small entertainment company like Starlight Entertainment, there were limited resources. It was indeed no easy feat for this company to have survived for five years under such intense competition.Perhaps it was because Starlight Entertainment had great luck; originally, it wouldn\u2019t be able to survive the year before, but who would have predicted that the manager, Brother Wang, would discover a handsome man with potential on the roadside. Brother Wang fixed the man up and then used his connections to send him to participate in an online drama. Then, that online drama suddenly became popular. Even the handsome man who acted as the second male lead became popular. Right then, this actor climbed his way up and became one of the current popular male celebrities.The handsome man naturally became the top person in Starlight Entertainment. It was around this time that the said handsome actor, Xu Chaoran, had filmed a few drama series and advertisements one after the other before finally winning the Newbie Award. He had earned quite a bit for Starlight Entertainment and even brought fame to some ordinary actors in the company. He helped Starlight Entertainment through the period of difficulty.Half a year ago, Su Yaya signed a contract with Starlight Entertainment. She was basically a newbie since she only took part in an online drama which had a normal amount of views. She was a second female lead who fought for the male lead with the female lead, but her role didn\u2019t have much screen time. If it weren\u2019t for yesterday\u2013when someone had taken pictures of her and uploaded it on the internet, resulting in a majority of positive users\u2019 comments\u2013Su Yaya wouldn\u2019t even be known. Zhou Peiyun had helped her as well.At ten in the morning, Su Yaya arrived at the company on time. The moment she walked in, a group of people walked out from the elevator. The person walked in front of the group was about six feet tall. He wore a casual gray outfit and had long legs, making him stand out from the crowd. People noticed him in the first moments. He wore sunglasses that covered half his face and his lips were pursed, which made him appear cold and indifferent.Su Yaya recognized him. He was the elder brother of the popular Starlight Entertainment who participated in the filming of a movie, Xu Chaoran.Xu Chaoran walked past her without glancing at her, and the group of people followed behind him. There was a breeze of wind as he walked by. The fans waiting outside the company started to scream out his name as Xu Chaoran walked out. It was so loud that it almost bursted Su Yaya\u2019s ear drums.Su Yaya looked towards the door, but there were too many fans surrounding it. Xu Chaoran almost couldn\u2019t walk out. The guards had to protect and escort him out as he made his way towards his van.\u201cAre you envious? If you\u2019re envious, then work hard. When you become popular, there will be many people who will be your fans to support you. They will chase and idolize you.\u201d Zhou Peiyun, who came out of nowhere, stood by Su Yaya\u2019s side and said this.There wasn\u2019t a single person within the entertainment circle who didn\u2019t want to be popular. Those who are calm and didn\u2019t join the fight are just people who didn\u2019t have the abilities to become popular. Those who are able to become popular and desire to become such won\u2019t remain calm and peaceful within the circle. Many times, people simply acted calm on the surface but they would hinder others in different ways, for roles and advertisements.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 - Because I\u2019m Cute (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.24 Because I\u2019m Cute (2)From Zhou Peiyun\u2019s perspective, Su Yaya would be a good person to cultivate. She was beautiful and had the ability to bring life into her roles as well. There was also Shen Xiuqi who supported her from behind. If she tried harder, she might become popular one day.But this woman had a bad habit. She was a bit lazy and picky. When Zhou Peiyun arranged work for her in the past, she would express dislike, and would rather go on dates with Shen Xiuqi or have sex with him.Perhaps Su Yaya believed that with having Shen Xiuqi as her supporter would free from worries, so as a result, she didn\u2019t place any importance towards her manager. There were a few times when Su Yaya turned down the work she had arranged for her, which was annoying.In the beginning, Zhou Peiyun reprimanded Su Yaya for not working. Who knew that Shen Xiuqi would over to talk to her the second time. He said that if she was willing to work, let her work. If not, let her be, as long as she was happy.Ok. Since he had said that as long as Su Yaya was happy, what else could she say? She was just a manager who didn\u2019t have much power. Zhou Peiyun could only listen to him. Of course, she simply let these matters pass by while pretending to not know anything. At that time, Zhou Peiyun stopped bothering with Su Yaya\u2019s matters and allowed her to do as she wished.Thank goodness that there was still a possibility to cultivate this woman. Her best weapon was certainly her beauty; Su Yaya was able to be on a fashion blogger\u2019s Weibo just by going out and shopping. This caught many people\u2019s attention, which was why Zhou Peiyun was willing to help her take a spot on the hot search rankings in the future.However, this actress was still currently at the bottom, so no matter whether she was really popular or not for the time-being, she needed to become well-known first. That way, people would come over with resources.As Zhou Peiyun was pondering this matter, Su Yaya turned her head around and smiled. She said sweetly, \u201cSister Zhou, I was just looking for you. I have an important matter to share with you.\u201dZhou Peiyun slightly raised her eyebrows. She wondered what important matter this girl wanted to say. \u2018Could it be that she was too tired and didn\u2019t want to work?\u2019 Zhou Peiyun already spent a lot of effort to help her obtain a role for the advertisement. If this actress wasn\u2019t willing to do the work, she could just give it to someone else. After all, there are other actors working under her; Su Yaya wasn\u2019t the only one. Of course, if that happens, she will no longer arrange work for Su Yaya and will simply let her do whatever she wants to.\u201cWhat do you want to say to me?\u201d Zhou Peiyun crossed her arms over her chest and asked.This was the company\u2019s lounge room where employees would come in and out from time to time. Su Yaya looked left and right. When no one was paying attention, she moved closer to Zhou Peiyun and then said in a low voice, \u201cSister Zhou, President Chen gave me a second female lead role in a TV show.\u201dZhou Peiyun\u2019s eyes brightened when she heard this. This was clearly unexpected. She thought that Su Yaya was being lazy and didn\u2019t want to work. Who knew that she had given her such a surprise. She hurriedly held her arms and said quickly, \u201cLet\u2019s talk upstairs in my office.\u201dSu Yaya hurriedly agreed. This seemed right. They should be talking about work matters in the office. Plus, she had gotten the second female lead easily. If people found out about it, it wouldn\u2019t be good, so she obediently followed Zhou Peiyun into the elevator.Once they were inside, Zhou Peiyun pressed \u20185\u2019 indicating the 5th floor. She still had not let go of Su Yaya\u2019s arm. It was rare that she was affectionate to her. Sensing this, Su Yaya quickly straightened her posture, and kept her bag aside. She watched as the elevator\u2019s floor numbers overhead change until it stopped at the fifth floor with a \u2018ding\u2019 sound. The elevator door opened and two walked out with Zhou Peiyun still holding onto her arm, pulling her straight to the office.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She escorted Su Yaya to the entrance and took out the key to unlock her office door. The manager pulled Su Yaya in before closing the door and locking it. Then, she turned around to look at Su Yaya.Zhou Peiyun stared at this actress with a confused expression. Su Yaya left her feeling perplexed. \u2018Did this woman finally become smart? Does she no longer believe that love is everything? She wanted to work now? Or, President Chen didn\u2019t want her anymore so this was the compensation he had given her for breaking up? But this wasn\u2019t right. President Chen was a very generous person. If they broke up, he wouldn\u2019t just give her a second female lead\u2019s role in a TV show! Could there be other reasons?\u2019\u201cTell me. What exactly happened? President Chen really gave you a second female lead\u2019s role in a TV show?\u201d Zhou Peiyun asked.Su Yaya didn\u2019t know that Zhou Peiyun had thought of that much. She nodded her head and delivered the contract to her. She said, \u201cSister Zhou, this is my contract. I just got it this morning. You know that I don\u2019t really understand these things, so can you take a look at it for me?\u201dZhou Peiyun scrutinized her before taking the contract. She lowered her head to glance at the TV show\u2019s name on the cover and was soon stunned. \u201cThis is the drama directed by Zhou Tongguang, called\u300aFlourishing Palace\u300b?\u201dShe flipped through the contract to see that it was really Zhou Tongguang directing this.Director Zhou Tongguang was an expert at filming historical dramas. The TV shows that he had filmed before all had great ratings. In short, as long as he was part of the TV show, nothing could go wrong.In this \u300aFlourishing Palace\u300bwhich was one of Sheng Shi Entertainment\u2019s important investments, everyone revealed their talents and best abilities in order to obtain one of the roles in this drama. These people were about to fight each other.From what Zhou Peiyun knew, the female lead of the drama appeared to be the actress who won both the Thousand Flowers Award and Best Actress award, Cheng Yan. The male lead hadn\u2019t been decided yet but there were two potential ones. One was from Starlight Entertainment, Xu Chaoran and the other was the popular celebrity, Yan Junyi. The two had their special talents and were good at acting. Both had the chances to obtain the male lead.With such a great configuration, Zhou Peiyun was really suspicious as to how Su Yaya obtained this role. She looked at her and asked, \u201cWhy would President Chen give you this role?\u201dSu Yaya laughed and said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m cute!\u201dHeh.It would be strange if Zhou Peiyun believed her. She said with a gloomy face, \u201cBe serious. What exactly happened?\u201dShe didn\u2019t believe her words so Su Yaya stopped smiling. She told Zhou Peiyun the truth, \u201cI slept with him.\u201dZhou Peiyun was slightly stunned before she reacted. Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi were in a relationship anyways. Instead of saying that they were a couple, why not say that Chen Xiuqi was Su Yaya\u2019s sugar daddy? It was normal for him to sleep with her.\u201cIsn\u2019t it a parting gift?\u201d Zhou Peiyun crossed her arms over her chest and asked.Su Yaya widened her eyes in shock, unable to understand why Zhou Peiyun would say this. She hurriedly shook her head and said, \u201cNo, no. How could it be? We\u2019re pretty good together.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Zhou Peiyun confirmed again.\u201cOf course!\u201dThe moment she finished her words, her phone rang. She opened her bag to take her phone out. Seeing the name on the screen, she smiled happily and waved her phone at Zhou Peiyun. She indicated for her to look at the name on the screen.She said proudly, \u201cSee, President Chen called me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi were in a pretty good relationship as Su Yaya claimed!Su Yaya smiled and said to Zhou Peiyun, \u201cSister Zhou, I\u2019m going to answer him.\u201dAs she said this, she went to the side to answer his call.Chen Xiuqi\u2019s pleasant voice rang from the phone, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m at the company.\u201d Su Yaya responded, \u201cI\u2019m talking to Sister Zhou regarding work matters. She said there\u2019s an advertisement that I can film.\u201dChen Xiuqi remembered now. \u201cRight, you told me about this yesterday.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d Su Yaya felt it was strange that he was calling her now. She asked out of curiosity, \u201cAre you not busy now? How do you have time to call me?\u201dChen Xiuqi replied, \u201cSome matters in the company came up all of a sudden. I need to go to S City and won\u2019t be back until the day after. Do you want anything? I can bring something back for you.\u201dThere was not a single woman who didn\u2019t like to buy things. In the past when Chen Xiuqi went on business trips, he would bring some gifts back for Su Yaya. After that, it became a habit. Whenever he went on business trips, he would ask her what she wanted and he would bring it back.Su Yaya thought about it. She had everything she needed and plus, Chen Xiuqi just gave her a platinum card. If she needed something, she could just buy it at the shopping mall. There was nothing else she needed at the moment, so she replied obediently, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything I want. I just want you to come back earlier.\u201d\u201cDo you really not have anything you want me to buy for me?\u201d Chen Xiuqi was really generous with Su Yaya. Ever since he met her and started to pursue her, he bought her everything she wanted. Firstly, he had enough money and didn\u2019t care that much about it. Secondly, Su Yaya was to his taste. It\u2019s fine if he pampered his own woman.Every time, Su Yaya wasn\u2019t polite about it either. Whatever she wanted, she told Chen Xiuqi, whether it be limited edition purses, makeup products, or jewelry, she asked for many precious and valuable items from him. Because of this, Chen Xiuqi had a certain understanding of her. He felt it was strange that she didn\u2019t ask for anything from him this time; this wasn\u2019t like her usual style.Aware of how the original host got along with Chen Xiuqi, Su Yaya laughed and explained, \u201cYou already gifted me many things. I temporarily don\u2019t have anything I want.\u201d She thought about it and added, \u201cIf I really want something, then I hope you can come back safely. I will be waiting for you at home.\u201dChen Xiuqi was slightly stunned. This was the first time she had said something like since he had known her. A strange and warm feeling rose in his heart. Her considerate words made him happy.\u201cOk.\u201d Came Chen Xiuqi\u2019s laugh. He said, \u201cI will try my best to finish my work and come home earlier. You have to be good at home, do you understand?\u201d\u2018Is he talking to her like she was a kid?\u2019\u201cI know.\u201d Su Yaya said obediently.Chen Xiuqi talked with her for a bit before hanging up.Once Su Yaya got off the call, she looked over to see Zhou Peiyun leaning against the table, smiling at her. She looked warmly at her, like she was family.\u201cSister Zhou, don\u2019t look at me like that, ok?\u201d Su Yaya was really frightened by her gaze. She was scared that she had done something wrong.\u201cSo it was President Chen\u2019s call before. Seeing how you guys are stuck like glue, it seems like you two have a great relationship.\u201d Zhou Peiyun was satisfied with Su Yaya\u2019s behavior, the most she had ever been with her. No wonder people say one makes great progress after a few days of not seeing each other. She and Su Yaya have not seen each other for half a month, and within that span of time, Su Yaya had become smarter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If President Chen didn\u2019t want her, this girl probably wouldn\u2019t even have time to cry, but she was fine now. Su Yaya seemed to have reached a certain kind of understanding, so now there was the possibility of continuing to cultivate her.Su Yaya didn\u2019t know what Zhou Peiyun had been thinking. When she heard her manager comment that she and Chen Xiuqi had a great relationship, she couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Su Yaya smiled her crescent-like eyes and sweetly said, \u201cWe do have a great relationship. He even gave me a platinum card and told me to buy whatever I like. He even asked if I wanted gifts just now, but I was quite embarrassed to ask him for more things since he had already given me so much, especially the second female lead role this morning. Hehe\u2026\u201dSeeing how foolishly happy she was, Zhou Peiyun really wanted to take back her previous thoughts. She thought that this girl became smarter, but as it turned out, she only had that much ambition. Zhou Peiyun was really wondering if she made an error in choosing her.After her laugh, Su Yaya finally thought of the real reason why she was here. She looked at Zhou Peiyun and said, \u201cSister Zhou, is it fine if I sign the contract for the second female lead? You know that I don\u2019t really understand this. Can you look at it for me?\u201dAlthough Su Yaya had a dream of becoming a celebrity, she was never part of the entertainment circle in her past life, so she didn\u2019t understand contracts and such. Even though the original host had entered the entertainment circle, she only filmed an online drama and never worked seriously after. Every day, she was focused on going on dates with Chen Xiuqi. Her heart wasn\u2019t on her work so she naturally didn\u2019t understand this either.But Su Yaya felt that since Zhou Peiyun was her manager and an expert in this field, there will definitely be no problem in letting her handle this matter.In reality, the truth was as Su Yaya expected. After Zhou Peiyun saw the contract and parts of the script, based on the basic knowledge of the drama, she said positively, \u201cPresident Chen had given you this role so there will naturally be no problem with the contract. Plus, this script is reliable. If you can film with Director Zhou Tongguang and receive his guidance, it is a very good opportunity for you. You don\u2019t need to consider. Just sign it.\u201d\u201cOk. Since Sister Zhou had said this, I\u2019ll sign the contract.\u201d Su Yaya was obedient. She did what Zhou Peiyun said.Zhou Peiyun looked at her and slightly shook her head. She said in concern, \u201cYou probably don\u2019t know the things people do to get a role in this drama, even if it\u2019s just a side role. Yet, you easily obtained the second female lead. Once people find out, they will all be envious of you, so it\u2019s better to keep this low-profile. You must not let others know, otherwise you might receive their hate.\u201d\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Su Yaya hurriedly nodded her head. Sometimes, when someone obtained something good, others will be envious and hate them. This was like working in a company. Although she obtained a bonus because of her hard work, people around her would become jealous and congratulate her, asking her to treat them out. Behind her, however, they would talk badly about her. She had experienced this before so she understood this reasoning. Su Yaya definitely won\u2019t brag about this.After she reminded Su Yaya, Zhou Peiyun reminded her on other matters. She specifically emphasized, \u201cDirector Zhou Tongguang has high standards for actors, especially their acting. If you\u2019re bad at this, he will reprimand you. Your acting won\u2019t be good enough in front of Director Zhou Tongguang, so you better observe and study the script on your free time. When you have time, come to the company for acting classes. Otherwise, you might be reprimanded by Director Zhou Tongguang and cry.\u201d\u201cDirector Zhou Tongguang isn\u2019t that bad?\u201d Su Yaya spit her tongue out. She was a bit afraid!\u201cYes, so you need to work hard.\u201d Zhou Peiyun said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since Director Zhou Tongguang has high standards, she will listen to Zhou Peiyun and learn. After all, it\u2019s not a bad idea to have extra talents. It\u2019s good to learn more things.

I won\u2019t ever be absent.\u201d\u201cThe fact that you have this mindset puts me at ease.\u201d After Zhou Peiyun heard this, she was comforted. Despite how much of a headache Su Yaya gave her in the past, she was still her artiste after all. Plus, President Chen was supporting her from behind, so if she has a good future, it will be good for her too. Artistes and managers benefited each other.The two of them wrapped up the discussion regarding second female lead\u2019s role since Chen Xiuqi had gifted it to her already. It was set and couldn\u2019t be changed. No matter how others will attempt to take her role, it was impossible. Zhou Peiyun set aside this topic temporarily and began to talk to Su Yaya about other things.\u201cYesterday, I was talking to you about an advertisement I got for you after a lot of difficulties. Originally, I wanted to give this to Xiao Xin. Yet, someone had posted pictures of you on Weibo yesterday and the users gave nice comments. Our contract partner was also satisfied so I decided to give this advertisement to you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Sister Zhou.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and said in appreciation. If she wins a job, this meant that she will make money. No matter who Zhou Peiyun wanted to give this project to in the past, she decided to give it to her now. Su Yaya will take this seriously and earn money. \u2018Why not go for it?\u2019Zhou Peiyun waved her hands and said, \u201cDon\u2019t thank me too early. Although this advertisement is mine now, the contract partner wanted to see you first. Come with me to their company later on.\u201d\u201cOk, I have no problem.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and made an ok hand gesture.\u201cWhen we go there, I will be there for you. Do you understand?\u201d Zhou Peiyun looked at Su Yaya and said.This meant that she wanted her to speak less or even be quiet. After all, she could handle everything.Su Yaya nodded her head and said, \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cOk, let\u2019s go.\u201d After Zhou Peiyun reminded her head, she led her out the door.Zhou Peiyun said they\u2019ll take the company\u2019s car but Su Yaya had driven over. She offered to give Zhou Peiyun a ride in car over instead. Zhou Peiyun thought about it and didn\u2019t reject her offer. She followed Su Yaya to the parking lot.Upon seeing the white Cayenne that Su Yaya driven over, Zhou Peiyun had no idea what to say. There was only one thought in her mind: \u2018Chen Xiuqi really pampers her.\u2019 She had been a manager for so many years but she couldn\u2019t even afford a Cayenne! \u2018Look at this comparison!\u2019The two drove to their partner\u2019s company and Su Yaya parked the car in the parking lot. The pair got out of the car and took the elevator up. When the door was about to close, someone called from outside, \u201cStop the door.\u201dWhen Su Yaya heard the voice, she hurriedly pressed on the open door button on the side. The elevator door, which was about to close, opened again, and two men wearing business suits walked in.The man upfront held a briefcase, clearly an assistant or something similar. The man behind had an imposing manner and held more status.When Wang Wenhao walked in, he subconsciously glanced at Su Yaya while slightly squinting his red phoenix eyes. He revealed a tint of happiness on his handsome face. He said, \u201cSu Yaya?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29 - Wang Wenhao (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.29 Wang Wenhao (1)Su Yaya was dumbstruck for a moment. She didn\u2019t recognize the man in front of her. The original host must\u2019ve known him, but she didn\u2019t have a deep impression of him.The man guessed that she didn\u2019t recognize him from her look. He softly smiled and said, \u201cI am Wang Wenhao. Do you remember now?\u201dSu Yaya gasped in surprise and said, \u201cYou look so different. I almost can\u2019t even recognize you.\u201dShe casually said this. Saying that they had changed a lot so she couldn\u2019t recognize him was only to conceal her awkwardness since she couldn\u2019t remember.Wang Wenhao\u2019s lip twitched at this. \u201cI have always been like this. You just didn\u2019t place me in your heart.\u201dUh\u2026This was awkward now.Seeing this, Zhou Peiyun came to relieve the situation. She said happily, \u201cHello President Wang, I am Yaya\u2019s manger. So it seems like you already knew her. If I had known, I would\u2019ve taken her here earlier. Are you guys high school classmates?\u201dWang Wenhao responded calmly, \u201cElementary classmates.\u201dHeh.Su Yaya glanced at him and complained: Elementary classmates? He hadn\u2019t seen the original host for at least a decade. Now that she transmigrated over, it would be peculiar if she was able to recognize him in one try!Zhou Peiyun felt slightly awkward but then she started to use her skills as a manger. \u201cSince President Wang and Yaya are good friends, President Wang please take care of her.\u201dGood friends, not elementary classmates. She deepened their friendship. Very good, very good.Wang Wenhao glanced at her and then at Su Yaya. He knew that she entered the entertainment circle and that his company conveniently had an advertisement to film. It could easily be seen why they came here today, yet he pretended to be clueless and asked, \u201cWhy are you guys here today?\u201dZhou Peiyun laughed and said, \u201cWe came over to sign a contract with your company for an advertisement.\u201dWang Wenhao said ok and then looked towards his assistant. His assistant understood and said, \u201cVice President Huang is in charge of this.\u201dWang Wenhao nodded his head, indicating that he knew.As they spoke, Su Yaya and Zhou Peiyung arrived at their designated floor and the elevator door soon opened. Both manager and walked out. Meanwhile, Wang Wenhao who was originally supposed to go up another three floors, actually followed them out unexpectedly.Su Yaya looked up at him and met his gaze. A tint of light flashed through his red phoenix eyes. He smiled and said, \u201cYou guys can go sign the contract. I\u2019ll take a look too since this will affect our company\u2019s achievements.\u201dIt was his company so they had to accompany him to take a look. They didn\u2019t have the right to refuse.Su Yaya was just worried. She didn\u2019t recognize him from before. Will this man take revenge?However, she only thought this in her heart without revealing it on the surface. It was Zhou Peiyun who reacted first and pulled on her, giving her a look.Su Yaya wasn\u2019t stupid. She understood Zhou Peiyun and smiled at Wang Wenhao. \u201cClassmate, I\u2019ll trouble you to take care of me.\u201dShe first greeted him and then brought out the fact that they were classmates. Although she didn\u2019t recognize him before, he probably won\u2019t try to obstruct her just when they were about to sign the contract. This wouldn\u2019t be worth it. After all, he was a man.\u201cNo worries.\u201d Wang Wenhao answered bluntly.They quickly walked to Vice President Huang\u2019s office. When the secretary saw that Wang Wenhao was here too, he hurriedly greeted him.Wang Wenhao said, \u201cI heard that you guys will be signing a contract for the advertisement so I decided to come and take a look.\u201dThe secretary nodded his head and said, \u201cYes, yes.\u201dHe already recognized Zhou Peiyun by the side. A few days ago, in order to get this advertisement contract, a manager named Zhou Peiyun had accompanied Vice President Huang and the others and drank a lot of alcohol. She really would do anything for it.Who knew that she came with President Wang today. It seemed like they actually knew each other and were familiar even. If they knew this earlier, Vice President Huang probably wouldn\u2019t torture her like that.Plus, when Vice President Huang had the manager bring her actress over, he actually had other plans as well. But from this situation, it seemed like Vice President Huang\u2019s plans will fail.\u201cIs Vice President Huang in the office?\u201d Wang Wenhao asked the secretary.Although the secretary knew some things, he didn\u2019t dare to act in front of Wang Wenhao. He hurriedly replied, \u201cHe\u2019s in there.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019ll go in.\u201d After Wang Wenhao said this, he turned around and said to Su Yaya and Zhou Peiyun, \u201cYou guys can come in with me.\u201dAfterwards, Wang Wenhao knocked on Vice President Huang\u2019s door. President Huang, who was on the phone at the moment, heard the knock but did not immediately let the newcomers in. Instead, he soothed his mistress and spoke sweet words to her, up until he agreed to buy her what she wanted and she was finally happy. He happily hung up and then looked at the door. The man knitted his eyebrows and called them in.Wang Wenhao walked in and gave a sharp look at Vice President Huang. With a smile that was not truly a smile, he said, \u201cVice President Huang, you seem to be very busy? We had to wait outside for a few minutes.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30 - Wang Wenhao (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment Vice President Huang saw Wang Wenhao walking in, he trembled. \u2018Why was Wang Wenhao outside his office? Did he speak too loudly before? The soundproof quality of the office was pretty good so they probably didn\u2019t hear anything.\u2019Feeling guilty, he didn\u2019t dare to look at Wang Wenhao\u2019s questioning gaze. He smiled on the surface and said, \u201cI was a bit busy. Before, I was discussing with a company we were partnering with about business so I didn\u2019t know that you were outside. If I did, I would\u2019ve invited you in much earlier.\u201dWang Wenhao chuckled. How could he not know how Vice President Huang was as a person? He pretended to be kind and caring but did he really think he didn\u2019t know?\u201cI heard that someone is signing a contract with us for an advertisement so I decided to come and take a look.\u201d Wang Wenhao didn\u2019t bother with nonsense and immediately went straight into the topic. He pointed at Su Yaya and said, \u201cShe is my old classmate. I heard that you\u2019re going to sign with their company so I came to see.\u201dVice President Huang was slightly stunned before he smiled and said, \u201cOh, what a coincidence. As it turns out, she is your old classmate. Then we definitely should sign the contract.\u201dYet, he was complaining inside his heart. Damn. He was interested in her first, but she got taken by him. Wang Wenhao really liked to go against him.Wang Wenhao pretended to be clueless and said in a proper manner, \u201cI am quite pleased with my classmate so just sign the contract.\u201dWhen he finished, he looked at Su Yaya and revealed a gentle expression. His eyes seemed to be smiling and he said, \u201cYaya, am I right?\u201dOh my god. His smile was too enchanting. Su Yaya\u2019s heart thumped and didn\u2019t know what he was referring to when he said that he was pleased. But at this time, it\u2019s not like she could just refuse to answer, right?! She followed along and nodded her head. \u201cRight.\u201dThere must be something going on between the two. Vice President Huang was unhappy. Originally, he had personal motives and wanted to take advantage of her. But because Wang Wenhao was present and he was bent on protecting her, he couldn\u2019t do anything about him so he could only swallow this anger. He had his assistant bring the prepared advertisement contract and on the surface, he politely signed the contract with Su Yaya.Su Yaya was supposed to film an advertisement on the white rabbit candy. She just needed to follow the contract\u2019s requirements and film as if the white rabbit candy was very sweet and delicious. To a foodie like Su Yany, she had no problem with this. Plus, she enjoyed eating white rabbit candy.But because Su Yaya wasn\u2019t that popular, the advertisement fee was only 350,000. It was a normal price and her company had to withdraw some from the fee. In addition to that, she also had to pay Zhou Peiyun. In the end, Su Yaya won\u2019t have over 100,000. However, Su Yaya was still satisfied. After all, she hadn\u2019t earned that much money in one go. Of course, she wasn\u2019t counting the money Chen Xiuqi had given her.After they signed the contract, Zhou Peiyun and Vice President Huang praised each other again. The two smiled and shook hands, hoping for a delightful cooperation.Wang Wenhao watched them the whole time. When they were about done praising each other, Wang Wenhao looked at the time on his watch, turned around, and said to Su Yaya, \u201cYaya, we haven\u2019t seen each other for so long. Let\u2019s go out for dinner.\u201dSu Yaya was speechless.President Wang, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m that familiar with you\u2026Zhou Peiyun looked at her expression and knew what she was thinking. She was afraid that she might offend him so she interrupted and said, \u201cPresident Wang is right. You guys are classmates so you guys should go out for dinner. Let\u2019s go.\u201dSince Zhou Peiyun had said this, Su Yaya couldn\u2019t really refuse his offer. She agreed to dinner.Wang Wenhao turned around and asked Vice President Huang if he wanted to come along as well.Vice President Huang wanted to shred Wang Wenhao to pieces. If he didn\u2019t appear, he would be the one having dinner and having a more intimate interaction with her. Now, he could only watch on with a smile without even reveal his displeasure.Vice President Huang said, \u201cMy wife said that she just cooked soup and is waiting for me to go home to eat now.\u201d\u201cThen Vice President Huang can\u2019t come with us. What a pity.\u201d Wang Wenhao said faintly.Heh.The two casually chatted and Wang Wenhao didn\u2019t have much to say to him. He turned around and looked at Su Yaya. With a gentle voice, \u201cLet\u2019s go, Yaya.\u201dWang Wenhao was basically going against the rules; not only was his voice pleasant to the ears, he seemed to be seducing her. Especially when he called her \u2018Yaya,\u2019 it was as if he tasted her name on his tongue first before saying it. With that handsome face, the young man looked at Su Yaya playfully with his red phoenix eyes, as if to seduce her. Onlookers can\u2019t help but think more about their relationship. Su Yaya\u2019s heart thumped quickly, since such a look from this man could easily cause misunderstandings.She screamed inside her heart: \u2018Heaven knows that she was really not familiar with him!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)Zhou Peiyun originally planned on joining them for dinner, but who would\u2019ve expected her to receive a call along the way; there were some problems with on of her actresses, Xiao Xin. She needed to rush back to the company to take a look. In the end, Wang Wenhao and Su Yaya went to dinner together.Wang Wenhao brought Su Yaya to a private restaurant. It was located in an unremarkable alley in the flourishing city. The restaurant was interesting and appealing, with tables, chairs, and utensils that all mimicked the ancient styles.\u201cThe dishes in this private restaurant taste very good. I came here a couple of times. Yaya, you\u2019ll know after trying them out. You will definitely like this.\u201dNaturally, the owner of the private restaurant was acquainted with Wang Wenhao. As Wang Wenhao escorted Su Yaya to the entrance, the owner enthusiastically welcomed them along with his staff. They greeted Wang Wenhao and brought them to the private room behind.The two sat down and the owner had the waiter bring them tea. They then asked these guests what they wanted to eat. Wang Wenhao passed the menu to Su Yaya and asked for her opinion. \u201cYaya, what do you want to eat? Order it.\u201dSu Yaya glanced at the menu and was shocked by the prices. They weren\u2019t eating food. They were basically eating money!What sort of prices are these? A picked tofu water spinach costs 55 dollars. She could buy a bunch of water spinach at the supermarket for just two dollars. Oh, what else? Minced pork with egg costs 85 dollars. Is the egg a dinosaur egg? And is this minced meat dinosaur meat? Su Yaya continued to flip through the menu, but the prices further behind were even more expensive. She didn\u2019t dare to order any dishes because it was way out of her expectations.While she was complaining internally about how expensive the dishes were, Wang Wenhao commented, \u201cThe food tastes delicious here and the prices are reasonable too. It\u2019s not expensive at all. After having a taste, you\u2019ll discover that the food is worth its price.\u201dSu Yaya glanced at him. How did he know that she thought the prices were too expensive? Could he read minds?Wang Wenhao obviously couldn\u2019t read minds. He watched as Su Yaya didn\u2019t order anything so he thought that she didn\u2019t like the dishes because the prices were too cheap. That was why he said this.Su Yaya clearly misunderstood. But since she sat here, it didn\u2019t look good if she didn\u2019t order so she chose two dishes that she liked. The dishes were slightly cheaper for her.\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya placed the menu back.\u201cYou\u2019re done?\u201d Wang Wenhao looked at her. \u201cJust order whatever you like. It\u2019s fine if you order a lot.\u201dSu Yaya laughed and said, \u201cI need to maintain my figure.\u201dWang Wenhao observed her and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not fat and in fact, you\u2019re quite skinny. You need to eat more.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to film an advertisement tomorrow and I will have to eat a lot of white rabbit candies. I will be gaining weight for sure. In order to look good on camera, I need to restrain myself.\u201d Su Yaya found a very suitable excuse.That was the truth. Celebrities tried their best to maintain their figures so they would look good in front of the camera. Wang Wenhao understood this so he didn\u2019t force Su Yaya. He ordered a few more dishes himself then handed the menu to the waiter.While waiting for the dishes, Wang Wenhao and Su Yaya started chatting about their memories. \u201cWhen we were in elementary school, you were the literature and art committee member and the most beautiful girl. You were great at singing, dancing, and everything else. Everyone liked you. At that time, I sat behind you. Every day, I would look at your ponytail and I would tug on it sometimes. Do you still remember this?\u201dSu Yaya was speechless.To speak the truth, she didn\u2019t remember. The original host didn\u2019t leave this portion of the memory for her either. The original host was a beautiful person and there were many people who liked her in school. Some guys were naughty and wanted to attract her attention like tugging on her hair, teasing her, and pulling pranks. There were others who wanted to please her by buying things for her. This happened frequently and there were many who were good to her. She obviously can\u2019t remember everyone and Wang Wenhao was clearly one of the people who she didn\u2019t remember.Seeing that she didn\u2019t react, Wang Wenhao was a bit upset. \u201cSo you really don\u2019t remember this.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026I have a bad memory.\u201d Su Yaya found an excuse and said, \u201cYou know, almost a decade had passed.\u201d\u201cRight. After all, I transferred after I finished sixth grade. After separating for so many years, it was normal that you couldn\u2019t remember.\u201d Wang Wenhao said this, wanting to save himself some embarrassment.The dishes quickly came up. Su Yaya looked at the dishes on the table. It was all the food that she liked. She couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.\u201cThese are all the dishes that you like. Eat more.\u201d Wang Wenhao said.Meeting his gaze, Su Yaya was a bit frightened. She remembered that she only ordered two dishes and that Wang Wenhao ordered the rest. This meant that he remembered what she liked to eat. He really knows how to flirt with her!If this man really took her to be elementary classmates, why would he say such ambiguous words to her? Why would he order dishes that she liked? What motives did he have?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBecause she was suspicious of Wang Wenhao, Su Yaya wasn\u2019t at ease while eating. Facing the dishes that she enjoyed eating, she wasn\u2019t able to taste anything in her mouth. She ate a bit of everything then used the excuse that she needed to maintain her figure.Seeing that she stopped eating, Wang Wenhao didn\u2019t have the appetite to continue eating either. He placed his chopsticks down.Su Yanyi saw this and hurriedly said, \u201cYou can continue to eat. If we don\u2019t finish it, we will be wasting food. I just stopped eating because I need to lose weight.\u201dThey had spent so much money but only ate a bit. They\u2019re really wasting money!Wang Wenhao laughed and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no worries. After all, I ate here a couple of times already. If you can\u2019t finish it, then don\u2019t eat it.\u201dOk. Those are wealthy people\u2019s thoughts. Since he had said this, Su Yaya couldn\u2019t really say anything else.\u201cI want to go back.\u201d Su Yaya felt it was awkward being with Wang Wenhao. It was mainly him. He seemed to have other motives around her but he didn\u2019t state it explicitly. She didn\u2019t think much about it either. It\u2019s safer if she was away from him.She knew that some men just liked to flirt with women naturally. Maybe he just wanted to tease and play with her, yet she didn\u2019t want to play with him. After all, she had a husband, even if it\u2019s by contract.She had transmigrated and found a husband beside her, but Chen Xiuqi was scarier than Wang Wenhao. Although Chen Xiuqi may seem warm and harmless when he pampered her, if he were to discover that she made a cuckold, he will definitely skin her alive. The original book talked about the methods he used against the original host. Such methods were enough to make people wish they were dead!Su Yaya was a coward so didn\u2019t dare to go over her boundaries, nor did she have the courage to. She wanted to stay alive and earn enough money to return to her hometown. That way, she could plant crops and enjoy her time.When Wang Wenhao heard Su Yaya\u2019s intentions to leave, he offered to bring her back. Su Yaya rejected and said she will be going to her boyfriend\u2019s place.Wang Wenhao was stunned by this. He slightly squinted his red phoenix eyes and said, \u201cYou have a boyfriend?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Su Yaya answered quickly, her voice clear and pleasant as though speaking of her boyfriend made her happy.Actually, the boyfriend she was referring to was Chen Xiuqi. Because the original host and Chen Xiuqi had married by contract and didn\u2019t hold a wedding, no one else knew about them except a few important people in the Chen Family. Chen Xiuqi said that if other people asked about them, she was to say that they were a couple which is why Su Yaya had said this. Of course she said this now to get rid of Wang Wenhao so that he would stop flirting with her.Thankfully, this idea was effective. After Wang Wenhao heard that she had a boyfriend, he wasn\u2019t as enthusiastic. He didn\u2019t persist on bringing her home but he accompanied her out of the private restaurant. The man watched as she got in the car and only when her car disappeared into the distance did he get in his own car.After Su Yaya arrived home, she was restless at the thought of Wang Wenhao. Thankfully, she was smart enough to say that she had a boyfriend so he knew what was best for him. Half of this had to do with Chen Xiuqi.When her husband came to mind, she wondered how he was doing in S City. Her original intention was to please Chen Xiuqi and strengthen their relationship, so it was necessary for her to ask how he was. It was also a chance to gain a favorable impression.Su Yaya decided to call Chen Xiuqi but he didn\u2019t pick up. She thought that he was definitely busy so she stopped calling him and took her clothes in to shower.Once she came out, she got three missed calls. It was all from Chen Xiuqi. Su Yaya hurriedly called him back.\u201cWhy did you call me?\u201d When the call connected, Chen Xiuqi\u2019s tired voice rang. He seemed to be still busy.Su Yaya said, \u201cHubby, I got an advertisement with a pay of 350,000. I\u2019m so happy! I wanted to share my happiness with you.\u201dChen Xiuqi chuckled softly. She was so happy at earning such little money and wanted to share this with him. Who knew how many times more money he earned than her? Wouldn\u2019t she end up fainting from happiness?\u201cDo you know how much money the project I just settled with someone is worth?\u201d Chen Xiuqi asked in his low and deep voice.\u201cHow much?\u201d As expected, Su Yaya asked in curiosity.Chen Xiuqi laughed since he was in a pretty good mood. He said happily, \u201cMore than 3.5 billion.\u201dCompletely stunned at this shocking number, Su Yaya was unable to react for a moment. Then, she started to scream ecstatically. Her delightful voice was filled with admiration for him as she gleefully praised, \u201cWhoa, hubby, you\u2019re amazing! You\u2019re outstanding!\u201dChen Xiuqi didn\u2019t think that she was being too talkative when he heard her screaming and yelling through the phone. Instead, he was quite pleased. The fatigue from negotiating this project immediately vanished.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 - She Has Talent for Acting (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySu Yaya rested for a day at home and prepared for the white rabbit candy advertisement she had to film tomorrow. She didn\u2019t have a lot of filming experiences. In order to learn, she searched up advertisements filmed by celebrities on the internet, whether it be white rabbit candy, jello, chocolate, or cake, as long as it was related to food. She paid close attention to their actions, expressions, and looks. Afterwards, she tried to mimic them.However, one must admit that she was great at imitating these celebrities. Her expressions, actions, and gaze were about the same as the others. It could even be said that she did a better job than them.Su Yaya soon realized that she had a natural talent in acting. Whatever she wanted to act, as long as she tried a couple of times, she was able to replicate it perfectly. She also added in her interpretation so whatever she tried to act, it looked exactly like it.Su Yaya knew that this didn\u2019t belong to her talent. This was probably an instinct left behind by the original host. She was able to enter the entertainment circle not only because she was beautiful, but also because she had a natural talent in acting. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain the second female lead role in \u300aPamper before marriage \u300bif not for her superb acting that made her stand out under intense competition. After all, she was just an ordinary newbie.With the original host\u2019s acting talent and Su Yaya\u2019s hard work, after only a day of learning and analyzing, she had a certain preparation and understanding for the white rabbit candy advertisement for tomorrow.The advertisement time begins filming the next day at ten in the morning. Zhou Peiyun went to pick her up at nine in the morning before driving her over to the filming studio.By the time they arrived, it wasn\u2019t even ten yet. The other staff members were preparing the site. Zhou Peiyun brought Su Yaya to see the photographer, but who would\u2019ve guessed that Vice President Huang would be there as well.When Vice President Huang saw them, he looked at the time and smiled insincerely, \u201cYou guys came on time.\u201d\u201cOf course. We need to be on time for work.\u201d Su Yaya replied, indicating that she will take her work seriously. She was always like this. She was the kind of person who worked hard and made sure she did her best in her work without ever resorting to tricks or cutting corners.Upon hearing her words, Vice President Huang revealed a faint smile. Will she resort to tricks and cut corners or will she not? Will she take her job seriously or not? They\u2019ll find out later.After they greeted Vice President Huang and the photographer, Zhou Peiyun brought Su Yaya to the dressing room to apply makeup.Su Yaya had really delicate, soft, and moist skin. Her complexion was tender like a baby\u2019s, without a single flaw. When the makeup artist saw her skin, she praised her endlessly and complimented how soft her skin was.\u201cMiss Su\u2019s skin is very good. I can\u2019t even see hair on it and it\u2019s very smooth and soft. I am so jealous of you! How do you take care of your skin?\u201dSu Yaya smiled and said, \u201cDoes it count if I am naturally beautiful?\u201dShe said the truth. Her body was naturally beautiful. Although the original host spent a lot of money in taking care of her body, she had a great foundation. That was why she was able to maintain her smooth and delicate skin like a baby\u2019s.But, in the makeup artist\u2019s ears, she didn\u2019t think that. She felt like she was overly confident but her skin was indeed good. She had the ability to be proud and confident. She couldn\u2019t retort.The makeup artist believed that this woman was straightforward and cute. So was it good or not for someone like her to enter the entertainment circle?After quickly applying makeup on her, they proceeded to filming. However, a staff member suddenly ran over and informed Su Yaya that there were problems at the filming studio. A piece of equipment unexpectedly broke so they needed to go and buy a new one. For now, they could only ask her wait patiently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, she only needed to film this advertisement for today and she didn\u2019t have any other anxious matters.Su Yaya replied to the staff member, \u201cYou guys can go ahead. You don\u2019t need to worry about me. I can wait.\u201d\u201cThank you, thank you.\u201d The staff member thanked her and hurriedly left.The makeup artist had other work to do as well so she left after packing up her makeup box.There was only Su Yaya left in the dressing room. Zhou Peiyun had not yet finished handling the matter with her artiste, Xiao Xin. The phone call she had received earlier was a bit serious. After informing Su Yaya about it, she hurried over to check out Xiao Xin.Su Yaya sat in the dressing room by herself. She took out her phone and started to play a game called Fruit Smash, which she had downloaded just yesterday. That night, she won quite a bit of rounds. Of course, it got more and more difficult as the levels increased. She eventually got stuck on level 72, where she tried hard to analyze how to surpass her current level.Time flew as she played the game. Without paying attention, almost two hours passed. At first, Su Yaya thought she wouldn\u2019t have to wait that long for the staff members, but the time on her phone indicated it was almost one in the afternoon.Su Yaya had the habit of napping in the afternoon, so she couldn\u2019t help but yawn. But looking at how late it was, she wondered why the staff members didn\u2019t come to call her to film. She put her phone away and walked out of the dressing room to look for a staff member and ask about the situation.There was no one in the hallway. It was very quiet. As Su Yaya passed a staff room, she heard voices inside, which caused her to stop on her tracks. Just as she was about to knock on the door to inquire, she heard Vice President Huang\u2019s voice from inside. \u201cThat Su Yaya doesn\u2019t know the rules at all. I\u2019ll let her see who is in charge today.\u201dRight after, there was another voice. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t suitable to keep her waiting in the dressing room. It\u2019s almost one in the afternoon. If we don\u2019t arrange for her to film, we probably will have to wait until tonight.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good that she will film tonight.\u201d Vice President Huang said with a hint of vulgarity in his voice. \u201cWe can have her join us for some midnight snacks. After that, we can go to the hotel and rent a room. She has a nice figure and a curvy and smooth butt. Her waist is slender and she looks quite charming. Just looking at her, I can tell that she\u2019s good at serving people. Yesterday, she accompanied Wang Wenhao, so today, it should be my turn.\u201dSu Yaya, who stood outside the door, had heard their words clearly. She held her phone in her hand and looked at the screen. Afterwards, she smiled and knocked on the door.\u201cWho is it?\u201dSu Yaya stood outside and remained silent. She knocked on the door again.The two people in the room waited a bit but failed to get a response. They turned to each other and Vice President Huang gave the man a meaningful look. The man nodded his head in affirmation and proceeded to open the door.Su Yaya held her phone outside and leaned against the door. She smiled mockingly at the two men before pressing a button on her cellphone and Vice President Huang\u2019s voice resounded from the recording.\u201cIt\u2019s good that she will film tonight. We can have her join us for some midnight snacks. After that, we can go to the hotel and rent a room\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Once Vice President Huang heard the recording, his expression changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He angrily rushed over, trying to grab Su Yaya\u2019s phone.She moved a step back and quickly said, \u201cI already sent a copy of the recording to my manager. If you dare to touch me, I promise you that you will end up bankrupt and homeless.\u201dVice President Huang who was on the verge of exploding successfully stopped his footsteps after hearing this. He stared at her in an unfriendly way. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dSu Yaya raised her eyebrows. \u201cI should be the one asking Vice President Huang what you want to do. I\u2019m just an artiste and I just want to complete my work and leave after I get paid. Why must you make things difficult for me? You probably don\u2019t want me to send the recording to your wife and President Wang, right?\u201d\u201cOk, you\u2019re good.\u201d Vice President Huang clenched his teeth and said. \u201cFilm. We\u2019ll film right now. After that, scram after you get your money.\u201dSu Yaya waved the phone in her hand and she smiled. \u201cSorry for troubling Vice President Huang then.\u201dBecause Su Yaya had information against him, Vice President Huang didn\u2019t dare to do anything. The filming process was very successful and Su Yaya did an amazing job as well. However, the photographer had high standards. He wasn\u2019t satisfied and had her film again, and then again. She ended up filming this multiple times.The first time she filmed this, she was quite happy to eat the white rabbit. She had a natural smile and didn\u2019t need to act to portray how delicious the white rabbit tasted.But after she filmed multiple times, she had eaten too much white rabbit. She tasted the white rabbit in her stomach and in her mouth. It was too greasy. The muscle on her face became stiff from smiling as well. She posed according to the photographer numbly. In order to film the advertisement, she was basically using her acting to support this.After filming for a few more hours, who knew that the photographer liked the first one the most when they completed filming. He decided to use that one.Su Yaya complained in her heart. Since the first was good enough, why did she have to film so many times? And he had made her eat so many white rabbits. It was so greasy.After the filming was complete, Su Yaya chugged down water and finished half a bottle in one gulp. This suppressed the sweetness in her mouth.Wang Wenhao came at this time. Seeing that the filming was done, he came over to congratulate. Then, he represented the company and gifted her two boxes of white rabbits as gift. This was the usual courtesy so Su Yaya couldn\u2019t reject it either. Although she ate too many white rabbits today, she could bring it home for other people to eat.Wang Wenhao continued to say, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to eat today and celebrate this.\u201dSu Yaya rejected politely. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry, I already made an appointment with someone else. It\u2019s also for work.\u201dWang Wenhao could tell that she rejected him. He glanced at Su Yaya with his red phoenix eyes and revealed a bitter smile. It\u2019s hard to pursue a beautiful woman. \u201cThen let\u2019s do it another time.\u201dSu Yaya didn\u2019t reply. She went to chat with the staff members and then said goodbye to Wang Wenhao. Then she got in her car and left.On the way back, she passed by a supermarket. Su Yaya recalled the empty fridge in her house and stopped the car. After putting on her sunglasses, she got out of the car and went to buy some food and daily items.When she carried the food to the cashier counter to check out, Su Yaya noticed a finance magazine on the side. The cover had Chen Xiuqi wearing a gray suit with a tie on. He sat on the black leather sofa with folded arms and a look of certainty, just like a business elite. She couldn\u2019t shift her gaze from him.Feeling touched in her heart, Su Yaya took the magazine and added it to the list of items she was checking out at the counter.After she got in her car, she took out her phone and messaged Chen Xiuqi. \u201cHubby, you\u2019re so handsome! Love you.jpg\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 - A Big Surprise (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.36 A Big Surprise (1)Chen Xiuqu didn\u2019t respond to her call, so his phone must be off at this time. At this thought, Su Yaya pursed her lips and gave up.After driving home, she placed the business magazine and the White Rabbit candies that Wang Wenhao gave her on top of the table. She then organized the food and items she bought from the grocery store, distributing some of the items in the refrigerator and placing others in the kitchen within their designated places. Once she finished, she heard the phone ring.Su Yaya opened her bag and took out her phone. Upon seeing Chen Xiuqi\u2019s name on the screen, she hurriedly answered it.\u201cHubby,\u201d she sweetly called. Her natural way of affectionately calling him showed that she was completely used to Chen Xiuqi. This probably had to do with her natural acting talent.Chen Xiuqi said, \u201cI just got off the plane so I will be home in about half an hour.\u201dAt his words, Su Yaya replied with surprise, \u201cHow are you so quick? Didn\u2019t you say that you won\u2019t be home until tonight?\u201d She thought that he would be returning at 9 or 10 pm in the evening at the latest.\u201cIt\u2019s nighttime now.\u201d Chen Xiuqi laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s already seven at night.\u201dOk. Seven pm was also night time. Chen Xiuqi was right.\u201cWas the filming successful today?\u201d Chen Xiuqi asked.\u201cIt was pretty good.\u201d Su Yaya responded, not planning on telling him about Vice President Huang. After all, she was done filming it and she had solved the problem. They won\u2019t see each other in the future so it\u2019s best to avoid unnecessary trouble.The two chatted for a bit. Then, Chen Xiuqi said, \u201cI received your message.\u201d\u201cHm,\u201d Su Yaya laughed softly.\u201cI\u2019m going to hang up now.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes. Why is he hanging up so quickly? She looked down at the black screen and smiled.Earlier that afternoon, Su Yaya had eaten too many white rabbits so her stomach now felt greasy. At this moment, she just wanted to drink some porridge.Su Yaya placed her phone down and walked into the kitchen. She took out the rice she bought and ladled out half a bowl of rice, after which she prepared some minced corn and mixed it into her bowl. She held the bowl containing the uncooked rice and corn and rinsed its contents. Afterwards, she placed it into the pot, added some more clean water, and turned the fire on to a moderate amount in order to boil the corn porridge.While the corn porridge was cooking, Su Yaya made a cucumber salad. She added some salt to marinate the vegetables. Since she couldn\u2019t stand spicy food, she simply added light soy sauce, minced garlic, and chicken bouillon powder for seasoning.If she was simply cooking for herself, the serving size was already enough for her. Having cucumber salad with corn porridge was quite tasty.However, she knew that Chen Xiuqi would be arriving home soon, and he probably had not eaten yet at this time. At most, he just had a meal on the airplane. However, Chen Xiuqi was picky; how could he like the meal on the airplane? He probably didn\u2019t eat much.At this thought, she decided to cook another dish \u2014 stir fried green pepper with lean meat.Su Yaya took out the newly bought green pepper from the refrigerator and got rid of the seeds. She then washed it and chopped it to shreds. Afterwards, she took out the lean meat she bought today and washed it, chopping it to shreds as well.Su Yaya turned the fire on high and poured a bit of oil in the pan. Once the oil was warm, she placed the garlic grains into the pan and stir fried it. She placed the lean meat in there as well and fried it until its color changed before adding the chopped green pepper. Su Yaya stir fried all of these ingredients for a minute or two before seasoning the dish with light soy sauce and chicken bouillon powder. Now, a delicious dish of stir fried green pepper with lean meat was complete.When Chen Xiuqi arrived at home and changed his shoes, the very first thing he noticed was the magazine on the table. The cover was himself wearing a gray suit, sitting on the black leather sofa and talking with the host. He was the typical business elite.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 - A Big Surprise (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.37 A Big Surprise (2)This was the interview last week for the finance magazine. Every month, Chen Xiuqi would accept one or two interviews. The questions were basically the same so he could even memorize them.However, he was surprised that Su Yaya would actually buy a magazine that featured him, and couldn\u2019t help but feel delighted.Chen Xiuqi recalled how obedient she had been and how she tried to please him every day. She probably fell deeply in love with him.He subconsciously smiled at this thought. Not everyone was as outstanding as him.Chen Xiuqi shifted his gaze to the side where two boxes of white rabbit candy caught his eye. It wasn\u2019t from a famous brand but it looked appealing to him. According to his usual habit, he didn\u2019t like to eat sweets; he didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him today since he actually opened the box and placed a white rabbit candy in his mouth. The smell and sweetness was just right. The flavor stayed in his mouth and was actually delicious.As Su Yaya brought the corn porridge and cucumber salad out from the kitchen, she noticed Chen Xiuqi standing by the table and eating a second white rabbit.\u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201dChen Xiuqi didn\u2019t know that he would be caught eating a white rabbit. He murmured in his heart and pretended to act proper on the surface. The man expressionlessly said, \u201cYes, I just got off the plane so I\u2019m feeling a bit hungry.\u201dSu Yaya guessed that he ate the White Rabbit candies out of hunger because he hadn\u2019t eaten anything earlier. She nodded in understanding.\u201cIf you\u2019re hungry, come and eat. I made some corn porridge and a cucumber salad as well as stir fried green pepper with lean meat,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it should taste pretty good.\u201dThe white and yellow corn porridge, along with the fresh, green cucumber salad aroused Chen Xiuqi\u2019s appetite. He felt like he was about to drool.Based on his memory of her, his wife had never cooked before. In the past, Su Yaya said that she will, but he thought that she was simply saying this without truly meaning it. He wondered if the food she cooked was even edible. But looking at the corn porridge and the cucumber salad on the table, it looked pretty good. But how would it taste? He decided to give it a try.Su Yaya went to the kitchen and came out with another bowl of corn porridge. She also brought the stir fried green pepper with lean meat out.The couple sat down by the dining table, and Su Yaya passed a pair of chopsticks to Chen Xiuqi.\u201cLet me try out your cooking.\u201d Chen Xiuqi smiled and placed a piece of cucumber in his mouth. Crunch, crunch. It was crispy and fresh. A pure cucumber taste spread through his mouth that was exceptionally tasty. It was even better than when Aunt Liu cooked it.When he was doing business discussions abroad, every meal he had was accompanied with meat, fish, and some alcohol. Now that he suddenly tried out this crisp and fresh cucumber salad, he felt that the taste was delicious. Chen Xiuqi couldn\u2019t help but eat a few more.\u201cIt tastes very good, right?\u201d Su Yaya smiled. She was confident with her cooking skills.Chen Xiuqi nodded his head. \u201cIt does taste pretty good.\u201d\u201cThen eat some more.\u201d She was happy that he liked it. She had successfully pleased him, right?Chen Xiuqi thought the cucumber salad was tasty and crispy and felt as if he had never eaten such a delicious cucumber salad. He ended up having two bowls of corn porridge on the side as well. Yet compared to his servings, Su Yaya simply ate one bowl and half a bowl of cucumber salad. Most of it went into Chen Xiuqi\u2019s stomach.After they finished, Su Yaya cleaned up the bowls and brought it to the kitchen to wash. On the other hand, Chen Xiuqi went to his study to handle work. When Su Yaya finished washing the dishes, she glanced at the glowing lights in the study where she could faintly hear Chen Xiuqi speaking. He was probably in a video conference with others.Su Yaya quietly went to her bedroom and took out her clothes from the drawer to shower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38 - A Big Surprise (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.38 A Big Surprise (3)Su Yaya took a nice warm shower and washed her hair. When she was cooking, the smell of soot caught onto her hair. After she was done with her shower, she felt fresh and clean.Su Yaya\u2019s wet, jet-black hair was scattered on her neck and back; under the light, it was bright and flickering. She paid careful attention to wiping her hair with the towel until it was about half dry. Afterwards, she took care of her skin by carefully applying a layer of body lotion, which made her skin glossy, smooth, and delicate. When she was done taking care of her body, she put on a face mask on and patted some essential oils on herself. She also applied eye cream and many other kinds of products, all of which took quite some time.Chen Xiuqi came out of his study and stopped by the door, where he watched Su Yaya put on a variety of skincare products. He didn\u2019t understand why women liked to do this. Didn\u2019t their face feel weird from being layered over with so many things?When Su Yaya finished, she turned around and noticed Chen Xiuqi. How long had he been standing there for? She smiled at him and said, \u201cWhy are you standing there?\u201dChen Xiuqi stared at her and walked over. He reached out and touched her face; it was indeed glossy and smooth, just like an egg white that was peeled from the egg. He didn\u2019t want to let go of her face. It seems that a woman\u2019s thoughtful care of her face was quite effective.\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful today,\u201d He complimented.Su Yaya looked up at him with a smile and asked, \u201cAm I not beautiful in the past?\u201dChen Xiuqi quickly replied: \u201cNo, you\u2019re beautiful in the past too. But you\u2019re even more beautiful today.\u201dThe answer was good enough. Su Yaya was happy in her heart so she didn\u2019t argue with him.Chen Xiuqi brought his clothes to the bathroom to shower. In the meantime, Su Yaya used a blow dryer to dry her hair. It was getting late by the time she had finished. Feeling tired and a bit drowsy, Su Yaya climbed on the bed and prepared to go to sleep.When Chen Xiuqi came out from the bathroom, he saw Su Yaya\u2019s butt sticking out as she laid on the bed. Her pajamas were folded up, exposing her white thighs. If it went up any more, she would\u2019ve exposed herself completely. His eyes darkened and he walked over quickly, patting her butt.Shocked, Su Yaya hurriedly turned around and said in surprise, \u201cWhy did you hit me?\u201d\u201cWhat are you doing then?\u201d Chen Xiuqi raised his eyebrows. She wanted to pretend to be stupid while seducing him?\u201cI was fixing the bed sheet!\u201d Su Yaya said, feeling wronged.\u201cWho fixes the bed sheet like you?\u201d Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t believe this. Lying on the bed and fixing the bed sheet? Very good. She successfully aroused his interest.\u201cHey, don\u2019t\u2026\u201dSu Yaya wanted to stop him but Chen Xiuqi had already pressed her down. The difference in power between men and women was huge. She wasn\u2019t his opponent at all. Quickly, she begged for mercy.The whole night, Chen Xiuqi was overly excited. He had her lying down the whole time, not letting her turn around. There was no use in begging for mercy. In the end, she didn\u2019t have the energy to even talk. She felt as though she was about to die but Chen Xiuqi remained unmoved. He held her slender waist with his hands and continued his action. He had her say \u2018Hubby, you\u2019re so handsome\u2019 the whole night\u2026The next morning, Su Yaya was woken up by Chen Xiuqi touching and rubbing her. The moment she opened her eyes, she recalled their lovemaking session last night. Her face was red from anger and embarrassment. Chen Xiuqi was overstepping his boundaries, as he spared no pains or effort in bullying her. She was just fixing the bed sheet! And yet he claimed that she was seducing him. It\u2019s too infuriating!Humph! Su Yaya shoved the arm on her waist away and unhappily turned around. Why did she suddenly felt something on her neck? She reached for it and her instinct scared her. She looked down. Oh my god! What a huge diamond necklace!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Around her neck was a necklace with a large droplet-shaped diamond in the middle. Surrounding this diamond were layers upon layers of smaller diamonds, which slowly extended and formed a necklace with the two chains. The big jewel hung around Su Yaya\u2019s neck and seemed to blind people\u2019s eyes with its sparkly appearance.Never in her two lifetimes had Su Yaya ever obtained such a beautiful diamond necklace. Now that she suddenly had a valuable diamond accessory hanging on her neck, she was shocked and ecstatic. She was even worried; it was too valuable!\u201cDo you like it?\u201d came Chen Xiuqi\u2019s deep and pleasant voice, like the notes played on a violin string. It was also a bit hoarse in the morning. Just like a hook, his voice captivated Su Yaya, causing her heart to tremble upon hearing it.\u201cI like it,\u201d Su Yaya turned around and looked up at him lovingly. She was in a very good mood. Although she was bullied a little too much by Chen Xiuqi last night, anyone who received a valuable diamond necklace in the morning will end up being in a beautiful mood. She smiled at Chen Xiuqi and sweetly said, \u201cHubby, you\u2019re so nice to me. I love you.\u201dEnjoying her admiration and compliments, Chen Xiuqi smiled and looked extremely relaxed. He patted her head as if he was patting a puppy.Su Yaya touched the diamond necklace on her neck and held on to it as if she couldn\u2019t bear to let go. It emitted a sparkling and bright light, reflecting her smiling face. She laid on Chen Xiuqi\u2019s chest and asked in curiosity, \u201cHubby, how much did this necklace cost?\u201dWhen he heard her asking about the price, Chen Xiuqi was stunned. Of course he had gifted his wife with many valuable items in the past, but Su Yaya had accepted them without ever asking their prices. What was wrong with her? Why did she suddenly want to ask about the price? Did she become a money grubber?But that didn\u2019t seem to be the case either. Back then, whenever he asked if she wanted him to bring home gifts, she would turn down his offer, saying that she had everything she needed and wasn\u2019t in need of anything. This time around, he thought the necklace was beautiful so he decided to buy it for her. Su Yaya didn\u2019t know that he had bought this necklace beforehand either, so then\u2026 did she just want to know the price because she was curious?He looked towards her in confusion. Speaking of which, she seemed to be different now.She never cooked in the past but she actually cooked dinner last night. What was surprising was that the dishes tasted pretty good too.In the past, she never looked at the price while buying items. As long as it looked nice, she bought it. That day, although the dress was only 5880 dollars, she even messaged him saying that it was a bit expensive.What was even more strange was that she wanted to stay home in the past, claiming that work was too tiring and that she didn\u2019t want to be exhausted. Based on his memory, Su Yaya simply wanted to live a relaxing and wealthy life; she wanted to wake up in the morning naturally without time constraints and her hobby was to go shopping. Yet for some reason, she wanted to work now. Not only did she ask for a second female lead role, she even went to film an advertisement. She was even happy that she had earned 350,000 yuan and had called him afterwards to share the happiness. Su Yaya had changed. Did something happen to her?The said person was frightened by his gaze. Su Yaya pursed her lips and said, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d\u201cAre you ok these days? Nothing happened, right?\u201d Chen Xiuqi stared at her. If she didn\u2019t look exactly like how she did before with the same familiar body, he would\u2019ve thought that she was another person.Su Yaya paused and wondered if he noticed something. But what could he find out? Her soul had transmigrated but it was the same body. It would be peculiar if he found out something was different. At most, he would just think that she had a different personality than the original host.But according to the original host\u2019s personality of screwing herself over, she might not be able to support herself until the female lead came back. That was why the current Su Yaya wanted to change her routine, but she couldn\u2019t say this to Chen Xiuqi. She needed to find another excuse, one that could convince him.Su Yaya thought about it for a moment and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been fine these days and nothing happened. Why are you asking?\u201dChen Xiuqi observed her and believed that other than her strange actions, there was nothing different about her, so he probably thought too much about it. He reached over to pat her hair and smiled. \u201cI just think that you are acting differently than usual.\u201dAs expected, she had guessed the same.Su Yaya prepared her excuse. She rubbed against Chen Xiuqi\u2019s chest like a little kitten. With a careful tone, she tried to please Chen Xiuqi, \u201cThat\u2019s because I already married you.

That way, the man could maintain his good reputation while bringing his wife around with him in public. In the past, Su Yaya could only be Chen Xiuqi\u2019s girlfriend at most. This is one of the reasons why he didn\u2019t make their marriage public.He was willing to pamper and soothe her only because she pleased him, but if she asked for more, he wouldn\u2019t allow it. But now, Su Yaya was willing to change herself for him and become more outstanding. This satisfied his vanity as a man, and he accepted her excuse openly.\u201cIf you think it\u2019s too tiring, you don\u2019t need to work that hard. You can just stay at home and rest like before.\u201d Chen Xiuqi patted her back, soothing her.Su Yaya thought: it\u2019s not tiring at all. She needed to use this chance to please him and make their relationship stronger. For her purposes, she needed to work harder for resources and earn more money so that when the time comes for divorce, her life wouldn\u2019t be too bad. She could go back to her hometown and plant crops, where she will have a relaxing life with the money she earned.The two thought differently and had different motives, yet no one exposed it. It was like a strange harmonious feeling.\u201cI\u2019m hungry, go make me something.\u201d Yesterday night, after Chen Xiuqi ate Su Yaya\u2019s food, he discovered that he really enjoyed her cooking. After thinking about it, he decided that he wants to taste her food again. Before this, he was deeply suspicious as to whether or not Su Yaya\u2019s cooking was edible or not\u2026Who knew the change came so quickly. That was really a slap on his face.Su Yaya was really happy that Chen Xiuqi had gifted her such a huge diamond necklace. Of course she wouldn\u2019t go and offend him right now. What he asks for is what he gets. He wanted to eat so she quickly tidied up and endured her back pain to cook for him.Su Yaya walked to the kitchen and looked at the ingredients she bought the previous night. There were tomatoes, eggs, pork, eggplants, etc. She decided to make egg and tomato soup, stir fried lean meat and cold eggplants.Su Yaya scooped a bowl of rice and rinsed it with water before pouring it into the rice cooker. When the water was deeper than the palm of the hand, she switched the rice cooker on. Su Yaya sliced the meat into small parts and prepared the green papers, which she will be using in her stir fry soon. She then sliced the eggplant in half and placed it in the pot to steam it. Afterwards, she went to prepare the dipping sauce which she will use for later. She also removed the skin of the tomato and beat the eggs in the bowl with her chopsticks, mixing it clockwise until the egg yolk was broken apart. She was almost done in her preparations.Su Yaya was agile in her movements. She finished cooking the two dishes and soup quickly, and the rice was done steaming as well. Afterwards, she brought the dishes over to the table and placed two pairs of chopsticks on top. Su Yaya also scooped two bowls of rice and carried both over to the table. As she did this, Chen Xiuqi happened to be walking down the stairs. She smiled and greeted him, \u201cWe can eat now.\u201dChen Xiuqi walked over quickly and complimented her after seeing the dishes on the table. \u201cIt looks pretty good.\u201d\u201cIt tastes even better.\u201d Su Yaya was confident in her cooking. She picked up the chopstick and handed it to him: \u201cTaste it.\u201dChen Xiuqi accepted the chopsticks and sat down on the spot next to her. He gave the stir fried lean meat a taste\u2013it was magically delicious. The moment he started to eat, he couldn\u2019t stop. In the end, he had two bowls of rice and one bowl of soup. Two-thirds of the food went down his stomach.After eating the meal, Chen Xiuqi patted his round belly and felt regretful. If he continued this way, within a few days, his six packs would be gone completely. He needed to go workout some more. What a sorrow!Although he knew that Su Yaya was good at cooking, he would always eat too much if he didn\u2019t pay attention. Chen Xiuqi couldn\u2019t control himself, as if he was under a spell. If he didn\u2019t eat what she cooked, he would miss it.Originally, Chen Xiuqi wanted to restrain himself, but he failed to in the end.Before heading off to the company early this morning, Chen Xiuqi reminded his wife, \u201cRemember to bring me lunch. The minced meat with tofu from yesterday was very good, and the dessert as well.\u201dAfter he finished, he just realized what he said. He told himself he wouldn\u2019t eat it. Why did he forget again? Chen Xiuqi couldn\u2019t express this in front of Su Yaya, so he walked out the door with a cold face.Su Yaya curled herself up on the sofa and chuckled at this. What was the saying? \u2018In order to capture a man\u2019s heart, one must capture their appetite first.\u2019 She never thought of capturing his heart. She knew her place. The male lead was made for the female lead. Su Yaya simply wanted to have a harmonious relationship with him so that when the time comes for divorce, he could think about how good she was and give her more alimony. Heh\u2026(Kitty Jiu T/N: Chen Xiuqi, who didn\u2019t have the best motives for marrying has finally met his match. These two hypocrites are strangely harmonious hahaha)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her acting class was 2:30 in the afternoon so she had nothing to do in the morning. She stayed at home to look through her script then she prepared according to her understanding.When it was eleven, she went to the kitchen to prepare three dishes and soup. She then placed them in the lunchbox before driving over to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s company.When Su Yaya arrived, she called Chen Xiuqi first to notify him. He said that he had already informed the reception desk so she just needed to find the receptionist and take the elevator directly up.\u201cOk, I know.\u201d She hung up and carried the lunchbox off the car before walking into Chen Xiuqi\u2019s company.At the front desk, a slender woman with thick makeup and fashionable clothes was talking to the receptionist.\u201cI\u2019m here for Brother Xiuqi. Open the elevator door for me.\u201dHe Rui looked at An Yuting and said in an official manner, \u201cSorry, Miss An, you don\u2019t have an appointment. I can\u2019t let you up.\u201d\u201cThen call Brother Xiuqi. If he knows that I\u2019m here, he will definitely let me up.\u201d An Yuting said proudly.He Rui looked at her and met her harsh gaze. She recalled the rumors she heard privately in the company and decided to call the President\u2019s office.Su Yaya carried her lunchbox to the front desk and was about to say that she bought food for Chen Xiuqi when An Yuting recognized her. She immediately glared at her harshly and yelled, \u201cSu Yaya, why are you here?\u201dAn Yuting?Su Yaya immediately searched information on An Yuting in her mind. She was An Yutong\u2019s sister and younger than her by two years, yet she didn\u2019t look similar to her at all. In fact, Su Yaya might\u2019ve looked more similar to the female protagonist An Yutong.An Yuting liked Chen Xiuqi but he didn\u2019t like her back. Rather, he liked her sister, An Yutong. She originally thought that she would have a chance now that her sister was abroad. Who knew that she had no chance regardless.When An Yuting found out that Su Yaya, an ordinary celebrity, became Chen Xiuqi\u2019s mistress, she thoroughly disliked her. Thus, she would mock her at every opportunity and whenever they crossed paths. Ever after the original host landed with a tragic consequence, An Yuting didn\u2019t forget to hit her while she was down.An Yuting didn\u2019t like Su Yaya and it was vice versa. In her previous world, Su Yaya already had a bad impression of An Yuting when she had read the novel. This character didn\u2019t come from a great background and she also lacked a good personality. She relied on her sister, An Yutong, for everything, and yet she still acted proud. What a distasteful attitude.Su Yaya also hated how An Yuting tried to seduce Chen Xiuqi behind her sister\u2019s back. Even in the second half of the book when Chen Xiuqi and An Yutong were married, she ran to their house to shower and then wore a transparent lace lingerie, trying to seduce Chen Xiuqi while An Yutong was out. But Chen Xiuqi remained unmoved while she tried to seduce him. In the end, he mercilessly taught her a lesson.Su Yaya hated people who were eager to be mistresses, especially when it was their own sister who they\u2019re trying to screw over. She despised them.An Yuting also disdained her, feeling too lazy to bother with her at this time. She didn\u2019t even want to talk to this unimportant woman, so An Yuting pretended as if Su Yaya was nonexistent.At this time, Li Lan who was working at the front desk recognized Su Yaya. She experienced being slapped in the face before so she didn\u2019t dare to neglect her. Li Lan smiled at her and said, \u201cMiss Su? President Chen already informed me. Follow me and I\u2019ll open the elevator for you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and thanked. She carried the lunchbox and followed.\u201cDon\u2019t you guys dare to go!\u201d Seeing that Su Yaya was about to leave, An Yuting pulled on her and stopped her from going.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She interrogated Li Lan harshly, \u201cYou guys won\u2019t let me up so why can she go up?\u201d\u201cPresident Chen told us\u2026\u201d\u201cBullsh*t\u201d An Yuting looked at Su Yaya in disdain. She believed that she was just a Chen Xiuqi\u2019s mistress and an ordinary celebrity. Who knew when she will be dumped by Chen Xiuqi. How could she compare to her? She dared to go up before her. She didn\u2019t want to believe this no matter what.Li Lan explained, \u201cIt\u2019s true. If President Chen didn\u2019t agree, how would I dare to let her go up?\u201dAn Yuting obviously knew this was true, otherwise the receptionists wouldn\u2019t be so polite to this despicable woman. She just didn\u2019t want to accept this. Just earlier, she wanted to pay Chen Xiuqi a visit so she asked the receptionist to contact the CEO\u2019s office and obtain his permission before she could go up. But while she had to go through these procedures, Chen Xiuqi had informed his receptionists beforehand to let Su Yaya go straight to his office. The way he treated that annoying woman and her was like the difference between heaven and earth. She couldn\u2019t let this go so she refused to loosen her grip on Su Yaya.Thankfully, He Rui finished calling and obtained Assistant Chen\u2019s permission.She said to An Yuting, \u201cAssistant Chen said that you can go up.\u201dWhen she heard this, she proudly raised her chin. She knew that based on her status as An Yutong\u2019s sister, there was no way that Chen Xiuqi won\u2019t let her up.As a result, An Yuting and Su Yaya went on the elevator together.An Yuting glanced at her lunchbox and mocked her, \u201cIs the food edible? Do you know how picky Brother Xiuqi is? Do you know what he likes to eat? Even dogs won\u2019t eat the food you prepared!\u201d\u201cSorry, but he likes to eat the food I prepare for him!\u201d Su Yaya responded expressionlessly. She thought it was funny in her heart. There was no way that she didn\u2019t know that the dog she meant was Chen Xiuqi. He was truly a human sized wolf; when he bullied people, he was harsh and cruel.An Yuting was quite displeased at her retort. She snapped back like an exploding chicken, \u201cWhy are you pretending in front of me? Don\u2019t think that you can become a phoenix by staying with Brother Xiuqi. You\u2019re just his plaything. Maybe one day you will be dumped by him. You\u2019ll have to face the consequences later on!\u201dSu Yaya remained calm, not angry at her words at all. She hummed, answering her in a way.Of course she knew that she was just a plaything, since that was how her character was written in the book. Su Yaya knew her place and didn\u2019t dare to overstep her boundaries. She wouldn\u2019t dream of unrealistic things either. All she wanted was to take this chance and make her relationship with him better so she could gather as much resources as she can right now as well as receive more money when she divorces. Then, she will leave him for good. That was her motive. It was very clear.An Yuting looked at her careless look and became angrier. She was thinking that she must be pretending. She must be!\u201cDon\u2019t think\u2013\u201d An Yuting wanted to say some more when the elevator door opened. She raised her head to see Assistant Chen outside. This man was one of the most trusted men by Chen Xiuqi\u2019s side, so she had no choice but to swallow her words and change her fierce expression to a polite smile. She said to him, \u201cAssistant Chen, you came specially to pick me up?\u201dThe corner of Assistant Chen\u2019s lips stiffened. In reality, he came over to pick Su Yaya according to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s direction.However, he reacted quickly. He had experienced many sudden events that were harder to handle than this during his time at work. He smiled and said to An Yuting, \u201cPresident Chen is in the parlor. You can go straight over to meet him. Do you need me to take you over?\u201d\u201cNo need. I can go over myself.\u201d Once An Yuting said this, she walked quickly over to the parlor. She was too eager to see Chen Xiuqi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please follow me.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya nodded at him and followed him to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s office.One waited in the parlor while the other went to the office to meet him. This clearly showed the difference between the two!When Su Yaya arrived at the said office, she was shocked to discover that Chen Xiuqi was still there. \u201cAren\u2019t you in the parlor?\u201d\u201cI still need to handle some work here. I\u2019ll go over later,\u201d Chen Xiuqi said honestly. Su Yaya no longer suspected his actions.As she walked over and placed the lunchbox on the coffee table, Chen Xiuqi came to her side and said, \u201cWhat did you bring for me today?\u201dSu Yaya replied, \u201cPicked vegetables with meat slice soup, cucumber with scrambled eggs, tomato with stir fried meat, and stir fried bok choys.\u201dChen Xiuqi nodded his head in satisfaction. He said to her, \u201cI\u2019ll go out for now and I\u2019ll be back later. Don\u2019t you dare eat without me.\u201dWhy is he acting like a kid? Su Yaya found it funny. \u201cOk, I won\u2019t eat without you. Go quickly and come back.\u201dShe knew that he was going to see An Yuting, but she didn\u2019t care. Su Yaya was just a cannon fodder female side lead, so she just needed to do her job. That way, she could live longer.Who knew that Chen Xiuqi would observe her intently and ask, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me why I\u2019m going out?\u201dSu Yaya\u2019s heart thumped. What did he mean? He was unhappy because she didn\u2019t ask what he was doing? But what right did she have to ask him? He is the male lead and she was the cannon fodder female side lead. They were only married by contract and she was only his wife by name, meaning that she simply needed to do her best at acting her part. Why did she need to care about so much?Heh.She laughed and said, \u201cYou\u2019re going out because you have matters to attend to. I can just wait here for you.\u201dChen Xiuqi looked deeply at her, his eyes mixed with unexplainable emotions. He turned around and walked out.\u2026At the parlor, An Yuting who had been waiting for a while finally saw Chen Xiuqi. She watched as his tall figure walked into the parlor and she hurriedly stood up from her seat. An Yuting sweetly called, \u201cBrother Xiuqi.\u201dThe man turned to look at her. Compared to her enthusiasm, he was much more indifferent. He nodded his head at her and faintly said, \u201cSit.\u201dAn Yuting sat down and stared at Chen Xiuqi. He was really handsome and she really liked him. Her heart thumped quickly and nonstop as she watched him.\u201cWhy are you looking for me?\u201d Chen Xiuqi sat on the seat across and asked faintly.An Yuting purposefully spoke in a soft and artificial voice, \u201cBrother Xiuqi, I heard that Sheng Shi Entertainment invested in \u300aFlourishing Palace \u300b. I\u2019ve read the original novel and I really like the second female lead. Can you give me that role?\u201dThe female lead was the Thousand Flowers Award and best actress, Chen Yan. It was already set in stone. Plus, based on her popularity, status, and acting, she was much better than herself. She can\u2019t change who was the female lead but she could act as the second female lead for sure. She had the confidence.An Yuting believed that since Chen Xiuqi liked his sister the most and since she was her sister, with this layer of relationship, he will definitely agree.She begged, \u201cBrother Xiuqi, it\u2019s just a small role. You can just order them to give the role to me. Just give me the second female lead role please! You said that you will take care of me as if I am actually your sister.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just give me the second female lead please! I\u2019ll call my sister tonight and tell her about this.\u201dNothing sounded wrong but once someone listened to it carefully, it didn\u2019t seem right. If he agreed, everything would be good. But what if he didn\u2019t agree? She said that she would tell her sister about this. Didn\u2019t that mean that she will threaten to tell her sister?How would Chen Xiuqi allow himself to be threatened? Even if he liked An Yutong a lot, he wouldn\u2019t allow An Yuting to threaten him.He stared indifferently at her and said, \u201cI already chose someone for the role and the contract is signed. If you want other roles, I can arrange it for you but not this one.\u201d\u201cBrother Xiuqi\u2026\u201dAn Yuting wanted to fight for it but Chen Xiuqi already stood up and showed her to the door. \u201cI have other matters to attend to.

It took a while before she finally reacted. Brother Xiuqi won\u2019t even give her sister face. She liked the second female lead role so such and she already made it clear. Yet, he won\u2019t even agree. She was sad and upset.She suddenly thought of Su Yaya who brought food for Chen Xiuqi. That cheap woman looked similar to her sister. It must be her. She must\u2019ve charmed Brother Xiuqi. That cheap woman. She must tell her sister about this. She won\u2019t let her go!\u2026Chen Xiuqi walked to the office door and recalled what An Yuting had said to him in the parlor. He knitted his eyebrows and tugged his tie. He placed his hand on the door and pushed it open.Su Yaya was scrolling through Weibo when she heard movement by the door. She placed her phone down and looked up. She revealed a sweet smile and her voice was pleasant to the ears. \u201cHubby, you\u2019re back!\u201dChen Xiuqi stared at her smile and her two cute dimples on her cheeks. He strangely felt the irritated feeling disappeared and his heart softened a bit.\u201cHubby, you must be hungry. Come over and eat. I didn\u2019t secretly eat anything.\u201d Su Yaya smiled as she greeted him. She opened the lunchbox and placed the dishes and chopsticks on the table.Chen Xiuqi watched her and he suddenly thought of how he teased her and told her not to eat without him. He smiled and said, \u201cYou really listened to me.\u201dSu Yaya raised her head and looked innocently at her. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re my hubby!\u201dThis pleased Chen Xiuqi successfully. He couldn\u2019t help but walk up to her. He sat next to Su Yaya in a pleasant mood. He reached over to pat her head. \u201cYou\u2019re really a treasure.\u201dSu Yaya slightly smiled and took it as a compliment.\u201cTime to eat.\u201d Su Yaya delivered the bowl and chopsticks to him.He took it and said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya smiled sweetly and followed his actions.The food was very tasty and the pickled vegetables with sliced meat soup looked really appetizing. The cucumber with scrambled eggs was fresh and delicious . The two enjoyed their meal. Chen Xiuqi felt that with her by his side, he was very happy while eating.Sigh. He ate too much again. His six packs will be gone soon! Chen Xiuqi was sad for some reason.After they finished, Su Yaya packed everything up. Then, she took out a dessert. Seeing Chen Xiuqi\u2019s complicated gaze on her, she blinked her eyes and said, \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201dChen Xiuqi sighed and he wanted to scold her. \u201cYou\u2019re an artiste. Aren\u2019t you afraid of being fat from eating so much desserts?\u201dSu Yaya heard this and laughed. She scooped a bit of the mango pudding in her mouth, wanting to prove something. She said in satisfaction, \u201cMy body can\u2019t get fat!\u201dShe said the truth. She enjoyed eating and sleeping every day. She exercised occasionally but when she went to weigh herself on the scale, she ended up losing two pounds. When she saw the number on the scale, she was stunned and thought that it was broken. She went to another place to weigh herself and reality proved that she became skinnier.That was when she realized that she would never be fat from eating. Who doesn\u2019t want a body like this? She could eat all the delicious food she desired and didn\u2019t need to be afraid of being fat. After she found this out, she was ecstatic and ate everything she wanted to.Once Chen Xiuqi heard this, he deeply sighed. He seemed to have gotten a bit fatter after eating. Nevermind. He\u2019ll have to arrange to go to the gym sometimes!While Chen Xiuqi decided to exercise in the gym, Su Yaya came over and asked him if he wanted to eat a mango pudding that she brought over and hasn\u2019t opened yet. \u201cDo you want?\u201dChen Xiuqi looked at her then at the mango pudding in her hand. He originally wanted to refuse but he couldn\u2019t control himself and took it. After all, he had already eaten too much. A pudding wouldn\u2019t do him too much harm. Anyway, he could just run on the treadmill for two hours.After he ate the pudding, he rested for a while before going back to work.Su Yaya sat by the side and scrolled through Weibo. She received Zhou Peiyun\u2019s call. \u201cCome to the company.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She seemed to be anxious.\u201cSomething good happened.\u201d Zhou Peiyun said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Now, she hurried over. \u201cThen I\u2019ll come in a bit.\u201dSu Yaya hung up and said to Chen Xiuqi, \u201cSister Zhou wants me at the company.\u201dChen Xiuqi raised his head from the documents and looked at Su Yaya. \u201cBe careful on your way and call me if anything happens.\u201d\u201cOk, I know.\u201d Su Yaya answered. She waved at Chen Xiuqi and left with the lunchbox.Su Yaya drove over to the company and took the elevator upstairs. She just walked out of the elevator when Zhou Peiyun pulled her to the training acting room.Inside the room, an elegant woman with exquisite makeup on stood in the very front. Artistes from different companies surrounded her. She was teaching them right now.Zhou Peiyun whispered to Su Yaya, \u201cIn the front is Miss Sun Qin. She was a Film Empress and was the professor at S City\u2019s Filming College. She\u2019s an expert in acting and she has some relations with our boss. That\u2019s why she agreed to teach acting class in our company for a few days. You need to learn from Miss Sun Qin and prepare for your second female lead role.\u201dIt was rare that she had a great chance to learn from S City\u2019s Filming College professor. Su Yaya nodded and found a seat, concentrating on the lesson.What was magical was that Su Yaya noticed that she was able to understand everything Miss Sun Qin said. She was also able to perform what was asked. Her body was really special, as if she was born with a talent for acting. Whatever she wanted to perform, she was able to do according to her imagination. It was really unbelievable.Miss Sun Qin had noticed her on the stage as well. She indicated for her to come over. \u201cCome over and perform what I just did.\u201dSu Yaya was slightly nervous but walked over to Miss Sun Qin. She performed according to her understanding and the script that she had read.Miss Sun Qin took the lead and started to clap. She smiled and complimented, \u201cYou did a good job. You have your own understanding and interpretation. Very good.\u201dSu Yaya couldn\u2019t help but blush. She bowed at her and said, \u201cThank you Miss Sun Qin.\u201dThe other artistes were jealous and envious that she had gotten Miss Sun Qin\u2019s compliment.A class lasted an hour and a half. It passed by quickly and Su Yaya was about to leave when Miss Sun Qin stopped her.\u201cI really like your performance. You are very lively. This is my contact. I am eager to have an opportunity to work with you in the future.\u201d\u201cThank you Miss Sun Qin.\u201d Su Yaya accepted the contact information she was given and hurriedly gave her own contact to Miss Sun Qin. The two exchanged WeChat and promised to contact each other frequently.Sometimes, it was that simple to make friends. They became friends just because they liked each other.After Su Yaya watched as Sun Qin got in her car and left, Zhou Peiyun held onto Su Yaya\u2019s hand and smiled.This is the first time she felt like she made a correct decision in signing a contract with her to be her artiste. She really made a right decision. Right now, she completely forgot how angry she got with how lazy Su Yaya was.Who had the ability to make Sun Qin like them at their first meeting? Who had the ability to make Sun Qin compliment them? And who had the ability to let Sun Qin say that she is eager to work with them? She was the Film Empress. Not everyone could be friends with her! Only Su Yaya. She felt like she had hit the jackpot. Her artiste will become famous! Haha. The path to becoming the golden manager will be much closer for her now.Su Yaya calmly stared at Zhou Peiyun who laughed foolishly for a long time. She really didn\u2019t understand why she laughing so happily about. Her tears fell down her face due to laughter. Was she really that happy?When Su Yaya\u2019s phone rang, she shifted her gaze. She opened her bag and found her phone.She saw the name on the screen, it was Chen Xiuqi who called. She answered quickly and heard Chen Xiuqi say, \u201cI have some matters to attend to today. I won\u2019t be going back. Be good at home.\u201dWhy did it feel like he was worried about her when she heard the last sentence? Why did he need to worry about her? She must be overthinking.Su Yaya knew that it was normal for bosses like Chen Xiuqi to not come home for a few days because he had to manage the whole company and handle businesses. Of course, besides work, there were a lot of dinner parties and social outings he needed to attend. There were a lot of appeals outside.However, she didn\u2019t really care about this. After all, she wasn\u2019t the original host. Even if she was, they were married by contract. She had no right to intervene. So what if he didn\u2019t come home? She was happy and relaxed!He could work on his matters while she worked on hers. She decided that he had given her a day off. That way, she didn\u2019t need to see him and carefully act to try to please him. She thought this was pretty good. She could have a good night sleep and not be crushed. Yay!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She didn\u2019t forget to show her concern towards him by reminding him, \u201cYou have to take care of yourself too.\u201dWhen Chen Xiuqi heard her words, he smiled with satisfaction. After replying okay, he hung up.Su Yaya put her phone away and suddenly felt someone staring at her. She raised her line of sight and her eyes met Zhou Peiyun\u2019s gaze. Her gaze was full of concern as she looked at her.Su Yaya felt uneasy under her gaze, she nervously gulped and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhou Peiyun frowned slightly and asked in a concerned tone, \u201cWas it President Chen who just called you?\u201dSu Yaya nodded her head, \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Zhou Peiyun asked.Su Yaya blinked her eyes and thought that she was acting a little strange. However, she still answered truthfully, \u201cHe said he\u2019s not coming home today because he has matters he needs to attend to.\u201d\u201cDid he say what he\u2019s doing?\u201dSu Yaya thought the question was a little funny; she cast a glance at Zhou Peiyun and asked, \u201cWhy do I need to be concerned about that he\u2019s doing?\u201d\u201cAre you stupid?\u201d Zhou Peiyun reached out and poked her forehead. His gaze was sharp like a knife, it seemed as if she was resentful at Su Yaya for failing her expectations. \u201cPresident Chen is not an ordinary person. If you don\u2019t grasp him tightly, what if he finds a new woman outside? When that time comes, you don\u2019t even have a place to cry!\u201dSu Yaya pouted and thought, he will find a new person sooner or later. Oh, that person isn\u2019t a new person, she is his white moonlight female lead. Meanwhile, Su Yaya was simply a cannon fodder so what could she use to hold him tighter? What could she use to compete with his white moonlight female lead? She shouldn\u2019t do anything she shouldn\u2019t be doing, otherwise it\u2019ll produce the opposite result. Just forget it!When Zhou Peiyun saw that she didn\u2019t respond, she asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201dSu Yaya shook her head, \u201cNothing.\u201dZhou Peiyun was a little angry because she could tell that Su Yaya was lying to him. Whenever Su Yaya encountered anything related to love, she would become stupid. Does she think that Chen Xiuqi would stay hers for this lifetime just because she claimed him?Forget it, since this woman was the artist she had her eyes on, she should remind her a little.She said to Su Yaya, \u201cDo you understand what I said? Take advantage of the fact that he still likes you right now and is willing to spoil you, ask him for more resources. Don\u2019t waste your chance. After you become popular, even if he doesn\u2019t want you anymore, you will still be able to live comfortably.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes and replied slowly with an oh.When Zhou Peiyun saw her like this, she sighed in her heart. It seemed like she had wasted her energy trying to explain. Zhou Peiyun doesn\u2019t even know if Su Yaya had understood her good intentions behind this advice or perhaps she might even think she was an evil person for interfering!Su Yaya was thinking over what Zhou Peiyun\u2019s words. Although Zhou Peiyun was a little snobbish, she knew that Zhou Peiyun was thinking about her when she said those things. She was hoping that she would ask for more resources and connections, so that she could live well even if she leaves Chen Xiuqi in the future.However, there were some things that Zhou Peiyun didn\u2019t know and things weren\u2019t as simple as this manager imagined. According to the plot of the original novel, the female lead, An Yutong will also enter the entertainment circle after she returns. At that time, Chen Xiuqi will fully support her, and she will become the most popular star in film, television, and music circle. In contrast, she will only be suppressed until there is no more chance for her to survive because she was a cannon fodder. It was impossible for her to stay in the entertainment circle and even if she accumulated any connections right now, it would become useless later. She could only go back to the countryside to farm.However, she couldn\u2019t tell Zhou Peiyun about these things, so she could only laugh insincerely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You should go back to rest first. I will take you to the audition for a commercial tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cAnother commercial?\u201d She had just finished shooting a commercial, why did she need to shoot another commercial?\u201cWhat do you mean why is it another advertisement?\u201d Zhou Peiyun raised an eyebrow, \u201cDo you know which company the commercial is from? It\u2019s K Group\u2019s new couple watch. Do you think just anyone would be able to shoot this commercial? You would need to audition for the role and you might not even get it. Do you know how difficult it was for me to get you a chance to audition for it? Do you want it or not? If you don\u2019t want, I\u2019ll just give this opportunity to someone else\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I want it. I want it!\u201d Su Yaya quickly said, \u201cSister Zhou, I will go with you to the audition tomorrow.\u201dWhat a joke, K Group\u2019s watches were very famous. If she could shoot the commercial for them, then she would receive a big sum of money for it! She was going to work hard to save up money right now, so she could go to the countryside and buy a small garden.\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Zhou Peiyun was finally satisfied. She warned her repeatedly, \u201cCome to the company at 9 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning, don\u2019t be late.\u201d\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Su Yaya promised her again and again.Zhou Peiyun said, \u201cI heard that they have already decided that the lead male role will be Yan Junyi for the couple watch commercials. Right now, they are mainly focused on finding the female lead role for the commercial. Yan Junyi\u2019s request was that they can\u2019t find someone more popular than him, otherwise the other party will steal his limelight. He said it was best if the female lead is a newcomer. K Group also hopes to find a beautiful newcomer, that\u2019s why they\u2019re having this audition.\u201dSu Yaya understood that she was a newcomer and that she was also beautiful. Since she met the conditions, she must carefully seize this opportunity.\u201cAfter you return home, learn more about the K Group.\u201d Zhou Peiyun urged her.\u201cOkay.\u201d After saying goodbye to Zhou Peiyun, Su Yaya left the company and went back home first.\u2026\u2026When Sun Qin left Xinghui Entertainment, she saw Su Yaya standing by the side of the road, and watched her car leave. Sun Qin became more and more fond of Su Yaya.Driver Lao Tang glanced at Sun Qin who was sitting behind him from the rearview mirror. When he saw her smiled and sensed that she was in a very good mood, he asked, \u201cTeacher Sun, why are you so happy?\u201d\u201cI met a very cute girl. She is both smart and cute, I really like her.\u201d Sun Qin thought of Su Yaya, who had a talent for acting. Su Yaya was able to make the characters she portrays come to life vividly when she was given only a simple plot description. She hadn\u2019t encountered such an intelligent child in a long time. As long as she was carefully groomed, she will definitely achieve excellent results with time. It seemed like she saw her younger self in Su Yaya.\u201cDoes Teacher Sun want to take her in as a student?\u201d Seeing how much Sun Qin liked the girl, Lao Tang couldn\u2019t help but asked with a smile.Sun Qin paused, as she was too immersed in the joy of finding someone like Su Yaya that she hasn\u2019t thought about this yet. Now that Lao Tang had asked her, she carefully considered it. Su Yaya was indeed talented and it was a good proposal for to accept her as a student. It was just that she had just met Su Yaya, she didn\u2019t know much about her.There were many people with talent in this world, but she wanted someone with good moral integrity. She still needed to know Su Yaya better. It wouldn\u2019t be too late for her to take her in as a student after she confirmed that she was indeed good enough.\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Sun Qin said with a smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It didn\u2019t mean that she didn\u2019t want to, but rather she wanted to be more cautious. She wanted to test her a little more to make sure to guarantee that she was absolutely safe. Accepting someone as a student wasn\u2019t a simple matter, so it was better to be more cautious.The car shuttled through the traffic and Lao Tang asked Sun Qin, \u201cTeacher Sun, where are we going now?\u201dSun Qin returned to the capital this time because she was invited to participate in the Jingdu\u2019s Film Festival\u2019s award ceremony. The Jingdu Film Festival is scheduled for 8:000 pm the day after tomorrow. She had some other things she needed to deal with, so she arrived in Jingdu two days earlier. Sun Qin looked out at the familiar yet unfamiliar streets, and thought about it. \u201cCan we go to the Chen Family from this road?\u201dLao Tang was a little stunned. He had been driving for Sun Qin for many years, so he knew many things about Sun Qin. For her to ask about the Chen Family, it was because she couldn\u2019t put the matter down.He quickly replied, \u201cI just need to drive forward a few hundred meters, then turn right at the crossroads, and drive for around 20 minutes to reach the Chen Family.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he waited for Sun Qin\u2019s reply.There was no movement in the back, and it seemed like Sun Qin was in a daze thinking. Lao Tang slowed down the speed of the car and gave her more time to think clearly.He drove for a few hundred meters and they would soon arrive at the crossroad. Sun Qin, who was sitting in the back, had yet to speak. Lao Tang thought that she would give up again like in the past.At this time, Sun Qin seemed to have suddenly awakened from her thought and said, \u201cLao Tang, turn right and go take a look at the Chen Family.When Lao Tang heard it, the worried expression on his face was replaced with a cheerful expression. It was good to go to the Chen Family whom they haven\u2019t seen them for a long time, so it was good to visit them. When the car arrived at the crossroad, the light had just turned green. He quickly turned the steering wheel to the right and headed for the Chen Family.\u2026\u2026Since Chen Xiuqi wasn\u2019t coming home today, Su Yaya was the only person in the villa. She casually made a bowl of noodles and poached two eggs for dinner.In this big villa, only Su Yaya was present, but she didn\u2019t mind it. Instead, she felt happy and comfortable like this. She could do whatever she wanted to. First, she went on the internet and checked the information on the K Group. She then searched for the previous commercials the K Group had filmed in the past and watched those videos for a bit. She also went to the gym and exercised for an hour before going to take a shower. Afterwards, she did her skin care routine, and then laid on the bed while scrolling through Weibo.The two meter long bed had a soft mattress, yet only Su Yaya was sleeping on it. No matter how she rolled, to the left or right, she didn\u2019t have to worry about falling off the bed like before.\u201cOh, hehehe. It\u2019s so comfortable!\u201d Su Yaya held the blanket as she rolled around the bed. She was happy to death that she won\u2019t be flattened like a pancake by Chen Xiuqi today.\u201cSince the lion isn\u2019t home today, the monkey will be the king!\u201d she cried out happily as she threw the pillow to the ceiling.\u201cWho\u2019s the lion?\u201dSu Yaya was so pleased that she lost herself and said the words hidden deep in her heart out loud. Who would\u2019ve known that the moment she finished speaking, a clunk sounded by the doorway. Chen Xiuqi opened the bedroom door and appeared at the bedroom door. He swept his sharp gaze across her. There was no expression on his handsome face, and his tall figure emitted a strong pressure.Eh\u2026Why is he here?Su Yaya was scared witless as she blankly stared at Chen Xiuqi who was standing by the door. She even forgot to smoothly call him \u201chusband\u201d.The author has something to say:Chen Xiuqi: Call me!Su Yaya: Husband, husband, husband, husband, husband\u2026Her will to live was very strong, hahahaha.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He tugged the tie on his neck and walked towards her in large strides.\u201cDidn\u2019t\u2013 didn\u2019t you say that you aren\u2019t going to be back today?\u201d Su Yaya finally snapped out of her trance and looked at Chen Xiuqi.Chen Xiuqi stood in front of her bed and held her chin up with his slender and long finger, making her raise her head. He slightly squinted and looked at her with a tint of danger in his eyes. He said softly, \u201cIf I don\u2019t come back, what do you plan on doing?\u201dMeeting his dangerous gaze, Su Yaya\u2019s heart thumped rapidly and loudly, as if her heart was about to jump out of her chest. She nervously fisted her hands on her side and gulped. She said shyly, \u201cI, I don\u2019t plan on doing anything.\u201dHeh.He\u2019d be stupid to believe her!He curled his lip and half-smiled, \u201cDo you plan on tearing down the house?\u201dThis was a frightening question. She felt as if she dared to say yes then he would tear her apart.Su Yaya was a coward and couldn\u2019t help but shiver. Out of her instinct to survive, she hurriedly said, \u201cHow could that be? This is our house! I don\u2019t even have time to treasure it. Why would I do that? Heh!\u201dChen Xiuqi said \u201coh\u201d, purposefully dragging the letter. He clicked his tongue.Su Yaya trembled as she heard this. Her instinct told her something bad was about to happen.As expected, Chen Xiuqi asked, \u201cThen who was the one that said that since the tiger isn\u2019t home, they\u2019ll be in charge of the house?\u201dShe knew that she couldn\u2019t avoid this. Ahhh!!Su Yaya cried in her heart. If she admitted to this, she\u2019d be done for. Therefore, she tried her luck. She pounced and hugged Chen Xiuqi\u2019s waist, her desire to survive was evident. She stared at him with her big watery eyes and said in a miserable tone, \u201cNot me. I didn\u2019t. You must\u2019ve heard wrong.\u201dShe must submit in this situation.Su Yaya knew to act according to the other person\u2019s mood. When facing danger, she immediately submitted to the opposing party entirely.After all, there wasn\u2019t much she could do. All she needed to do was to soothe Chen Xiuqi. Who let Chen Xiuqi to be the male lead of this novel? Not only that, he\u2019s the dominant CEO and her sugar daddy! She really couldn\u2019t afford to offend him, otherwise, she might die!Heh!Chen Xiuqi clearly didn\u2019t expect her to suddenly throw herself in his arms. She reached over to hug him tightly and revealed a pitiful look like a little kitten. With a beauty in his arms, his heart softened instantly. He couldn\u2019t keep the taut look on his face and laughed suddenly.Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t expect Su Yaya to be terrified that quickly. He thought that she would at least persist for a while.The truth is, this girl had pretended to be obedient and sensible in front of him. She sweetly called him hubby without a trace of unease and was really well-behaved. Plus, she was also very cute and adorable. His heart softened at her calling him hubby.Who knew that the night he wasn\u2019t home, she started to cause a ruckus. She really thought that she, a monkey, could flip the world over when he, a tiger, wasn\u2019t home watching her? Never having seen anything like this, he couldn\u2019t help but think: which side was the real her?Was it the well-behaved and cute girl the real her? Or the wild girl who did as she wished whenever he wasn\u2019t home the real her?But thinking deeply about it, it seemed like whatever side of her was the real her, he thought she was very cute. He wanted to pamper her.Chen Xiuqi was scared by his thought. It felt like he was in a spell.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It felt like he was in a spell.He didn\u2019t know whether it was because he felt guilty from thinking of this or for other reasons, but he couldn\u2019t help looking at Su Yaya. When he saw her chubby face, watery eyes, and her miserable look, he couldn\u2019t release his anger on her even if he wanted to!Sigh. Nevermind. Who let her be his woman? No matter which side is the real her, seeing that she had helped him successfully inherit the hundred billion inheritance, he will be generous and not argue with her.When Su Yaya heard him laugh, she knew that he was probably not angry at her anymore. She admitted to how terrified she was. She carefully looked at Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face and continued to hug him as she rubbed her face against his chest like a kitten. She acted cute and said, \u201cHubby, didn\u2019t you say you aren\u2019t going to be home tonight?\u201dWhy did he come back? She almost got scared to death. Plus, he had a tense face on. It felt like he was very angry. Being the male lead and dominant CEO, Chen Xiuqi was a bit scary when he was angry so she needed to soothe him!Chen Xiuqi felt himself warming up from her rubbing herself on him. Chen Xiuqi\u2019s heart stopped thumping for two seconds. He reached over to pinch her face. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want me to be awayso that you can have all the fun you can at home?\u201d\u201cSince when?\u201d Su Yaya didn\u2019t admit to this. Seeing that he was staring at her, she blinked her big doey eyes. She murmured in a low voice, \u201cAt most, I was just rolling in bed.\u201dChen Xiuqi said, \u201cHeh.\u201dHe sneered and he swept his sharp gaze over her. He said, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201dSu Yaya immediately raised her right hand and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go turn the hot water on so you can take a shower and relax.\u201dBeing eager to work and well-behaved!Chen Xiuqi tilted the corner of his lip up and was very satisfied in his heart. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d\u201cYessir.\u201d Su Yaya mimicked how the court eunuch would have saluted as shown on TV. She went to the bathroom to turn the hot water on.That night, Su Yaya did everything to the best of her ability. She turned the hot water on and then massaged Chen Xiuqi, hoping that he will forget about it and let her go generously.Who knew that after Chen Xiuqi enjoyed the service, he leaned against the headboard and squinted his eyes. He said, \u201cSince you like to roll in bed, let\u2019s roll a few times in bed together.\u201dSu Yaya was speechless.The result of Chen Xiuqi having sex with her too many times was that Su Yaya fell asleep early. By the time she was up, it was already almost nine in the morning.\u201cI\u2019m going to be late, I\u2019m going to be late!\u201d She urgently got out of bed and when she did, her legs were trembling. She almost fell due to a lack of balance.\u201cIt\u2019s still early. Why are you so anxious?\u201d Said the guy who had been doing the work all night but didn\u2019t seem tired at all. Instead, he seemed refreshed and energetic.\u201cI am supposed to go to an audition with Sister Zhou at nine.\u201d Su Yaya said honestly.\u201cAudition for what? Didn\u2019t I just give you a second female lead role in a TV show?\u201d Chen Xiuqi asked curiously.\u201cAn advertisement audition.\u201d Su Yanyi said this and walked to the bathroom.\u201cWhy do you want to tire yourself? There are advertisements in my company. Do you want some?\u201d Seeing her slender silhouette, maybe it was heartache, or because he was in a good mood; he thought of how she asked him for advertisements a few days ago and somehow decided to say this.\u201cFor real?\u201d Su Yaya said in surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On his slender body were a few red marks. It was all due to her scratching him because he had taken her too roughly.At that time, it felt like the two of them were fighting. The man\u2019s skills were great and she was pleased by it. Now that she calmed down and saw the marks, she turned around frantically. She endured the sore and pain as if her body was falling apart and quickly walked into the bathroom.When the bathroom door was closed, Su Yaya heard Chen Xiuqi who laid on the bed saying, \u201cReally.\u201dWhen she heard this, Su Yaya who stood behind the door silently laughed. She might as well take the resources Chen Xiuqi is providing her. At least, she had gained something from pleasing him, right?Su Yaya got up late so she had to get ready at the quickest speed. She looked at the time and it was about to be nine. She hurriedly left, not having time to make breakfast. She smiled at Chen Xiuqi and said, \u201cCan you eat out this morning? I need to head to the company right now.\u201dEver since Chen Xiuqi tried out Su Yaya\u2019s cooking, he didn\u2019t like eating out and wanted her to cook three meals every day. Whenever she wasn\u2019t busy, she would cook with the motive of forming a good relationship with the male lead and CEO, Chen Xiuqi. But this was a special case. She really wouldn\u2019t be able to make it on time.Chen Xiuqi stared at her without an expression on his handsome face. He seemed very unhappy.Su Yaya sighed in her heart. Why did he act like a child?He was unhappy now so she had to make him happy. Otherwise, who knew what he would do with her.\u201cHubby, I\u2019ll kiss you, hubby.\u201d Su Yaya softly called him. She moved over and kissed the corner of his mouth.While Su Yaya didn\u2019t pay attention, the corner of Chen Xiuqi\u2019s mouth slightly twitched. He didn\u2019t change his expression however, maintaining a taut look as he coldly said, \u201cRemember. You owe me a meal.\u201d\u201cOk, ok.\u201d Su Yaya nodded her head immediately. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll make it up to you later.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201d Chen Xiuqi waved his hand in a cold manner. \u201cGo.\u201d\u201cThank you hubby, muah~\u201d Su Yaya smiled splendidly and kissed Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face again. She happily left, carrying her bag.Once Su Yaya walked out and closed the door, Chen Xiuqi touched the place on his face where Su Yaya kissed. He softly chuckled.Su Yaya hurried over to the company. By the time she found Zhou Peiyun, it was just ten minutes past nine. Zhou Peiyun didn\u2019t mind that she was late for ten minutes. After all, she made her come earlier.When the two meet up, Zhou Peiyun explained to Su Yaya some things that she needed to pay attention to. Then the two of them drove to the hotel for Su Yaya\u2019s advertisement audition.When they arrived, quite a number of people were already waiting.\u201cWait here. I\u2019ll get your number.\u201d Su Yaya found a place to sit and Zhou Peiyun wanted her to wait. She went to the sign in booth to pick up a number,Su Yaya said ok and quietly sat on the bench, waiting. She lowered her head and scrolled through Weibo.At this time, a tall, handsome, and built man walked in. He was surrounded by a few staff. The moment he walked in, people had recognized him and began to scream at the top of their lungs, \u201cYan Junyi, Yan Junyi!\u201d\u201cAh \u2014 So handsome!\u201dNot far from Su Yaya, a girl shrieked. It violently and intensely irritated Su Yaya\u2019s eardrums. She knitted her eyebrows and looked in the direction of Yan Junyi.At the same time, Yan Junyi seemed to be attracted by something. He turned around, towards Su Yaya. Their eyes met.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was a very handsome man; no wonder he was a popular celebrity that was known by many people all over China.However, he wasn\u2019t to her taste and his style wasn\u2019t to her liking. At most, she could only give him eight points. When she thought of this, Su Yaya shook her head and continued to scroll through Weibo.Yan Junyi seemed to be provoked by this. He slightly squinted his eyes and walked towards Su Yaya in the next second.\u201cHe\u2019s coming. He\u2019s coming!\u201d\u201cAhhh, he\u2019s so handsome!\u201d\u201cHe seems to be smiling!\u201d\u201cIs he smiling at me?\u201dThe two girls behind Su Yaya were so excited that they were about to faint.But happiness only belonged to them. It had nothing to do with Su Yaya. She bowed her head and continued to scroll through her Weibo until she spotted some photos of food that was uploaded by a food blogger. It looked quite delicious, so she plans to learn how to cook this when she returns home.\u201cSu Yaya!\u201dSu Yaya, who was focused on the delicious-looking food, suddenly heard a pleasant male voice calling her.She raised her head subconsciously to see Yan Junyi\u2019s tall figure standing in front of her. It blocked half the light shining on her.The sudden action made Su Yaya a bit shocked. She stared at the man in front of her, stunned. For a moment, she had no idea what to do when she heard Yan Junyi laugh. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me?\u201dIn reality, Su Yaya didn\u2019t know him.She was a fake who had transmigrated over before the novel even started, so it would be strange if she knew him!Yan Junyi stared at her watery eyes which appeared quite cute to him. She hadn\u2019t reacted so he assumed that this girl probably didn\u2019t remember who he was. But he was used to it. This woman had always been like this. Since she was a young child, many people were surrounding and pursuing her, but there weren\u2019t many whom she took to heart.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Yan Jun. Do you remember now?\u201d Yan Junyi stared intently at Su Yaya while pointing to himself.Su Yaya observed the man as she tried her best to search through the original host\u2019s memory for any memory of him. In the end, she found someone named Yan Jun.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d Su Yaya was shocked. \u201cWhy do you look so different from when you\u2019re young?\u201dIn the original host\u2019s memory, there was indeed a neighbor called Yan Jun when she was young, but he was short and chubby in appearance. However, the Yan Junyi right now was tall, handsome, and well-built. It was completely different from her memory of him. Putting aside the fact that she herself is a fake, even if the original host was here, the host probably wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize Yan Junyi either if he didn\u2019t mention it himself!Yan Junyi also knew that his appearance now was too different from when he was young. He slightly smiled and said, \u201cI am a bit different. After I moved away when I was ten, I never saw you since then. Who would\u2019ve guessed that after many years passed by, you\u2019re now more beautiful than before.\u201dSu Yaya was pleased at being complimented for her beauty. She smiled and said, \u201cI remember when you were young\u2026\u201d\u201cShh!\u201d Yan Junyi hurriedly made a shushing gesture and slightly shook his head at her.Su Yaya was slightly stunned but reacted quickly. He didn\u2019t want her to mention it, after all, it would ruin his reputation if people found out he was short and chubby as a child. Good thing right after he turned seven or eight, he gradually lost weight. However, he was a popular celebrity now, so he needed to pay attention to these things.Many people were watching them, so Su Yaya needed to be mindful as well. She couldn\u2019t leak Yan Junyi\u2019s secret to the public so she hurriedly made a shushing gesture too.The two smiled at each other, knowing each other\u2019s thoughts. They began to chat about other things.\u201cYou\u2019re here to join the audition?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat number?\u201d\u201cMy manager went to grab a number for me.\u201d Su Yaya pointed to the front.Yan Junyi moved closer and whispered, \u201cDo you want me to help?\u201dSu Yaya slightly paused then shook her head.Yan Junyi looked at her but wasn\u2019t angry at being rejected. Instead, he revealed a smile.\u201cBrother Yan, it\u2019s getting late. The audition is about to begin. Director Song is asking you to go in.\u201d A staff came to remind Yan Junyi.Yan Junyi had no choice but to bid goodbye. \u201cSee you later.\u201dSu Yaya nodded her head and said, \u201cOk, see you later.\u201dYan Junyi smiled at her and followed the staff in.Su Yaya patted her chest and breathed heavily. So close, so close. Thankfully she was able to find some information related to Yan Junyi from the original host\u2019s memory. That way, she was able to chat with him successfully, otherwise, she would feel bad at having an awkward conversation with him.Heh. Her acting skills were pretty good. Even Yan Junyi didn\u2019t realize that she wasn\u2019t the original host.After all, they just met after many years. Even if they were familiar with each other, it\u2019s not easy to detect the other person\u2019s change in personality.After Yan Junyi left with the staff, the people who were waiting for their turn at the audition started to gossip about Su Yaya.\u201cShe knows Yan Junyi. We probably won\u2019t stand a chance against her.\u201d\u201cThe male lead can\u2019t decide who he wants. The main person in charge is the Director!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She continued to scroll through Weibo instead. Zhou Peiyun already reminded her earlier that those people who took part in the auditions all got here through their connections as well, so no one here was any simple person. Heh, she knew this all too well.\u201cYou know Yan Junyi?\u201d Zhou Peiyum, who was on the way back from picking up a number, had seen Yan Junyi walk over to talk to Su Yaya just now. The two seemed to have enjoyed their conversation so it wasn\u2019t hard to tell that they knew each other.\u201cWe were neighbors when we were kids.\u201d Su Yaya responded calmly as she continued to scroll through Weibo expressionlessly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201d Zhou Peiyun looked at her in shock. She mentioned Yan Junyi many times but the girl never reacted to his name. Zhou Peiyun thought that she didn\u2019t know him.Su Yaya scrolled through Weibo and found something that interested her. She said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t his name when he was young. He also looks different now, so I didn\u2019t remember.\u201dZhou Peiyun was confused.Just how big was her heart? And the popular celebrity, Yan Junyi, looks different from when he was young? Did he undergo plastic surgery? But his appearance looks normal. He doesn\u2019t seem like he had gone through plastic surgery.Su Yaya got number eighteen. There were a total of 23 people, and each one of them received the chance to try out for auditions through their connections. Su Yaya\u2019s number was leaning towards the end, which wasn\u2019t very beneficial for her.But Su Yaya didn\u2019t mind. It would be nice if it worked out for her, but if it didn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t care either. After all, Chen Xiuqi had promised to give her advertisements, so if it didn\u2019t work here, she will simply work for the other side. Heh, she had her sugar daddy supporting her!In a bit, the staff came out to announce the beginning of the audition. Those who were called were to follow them to audition in the audition room.Each candidate had five minutes of acting. Some candidates who stayed a bit longer in the room have walked out with relaxed expressions, while other contestants left the audition room quickly with their heads down low; they obviously didn\u2019t pass.Su Yaya continued to scroll through Weibo silently. Upon seeing her current state, Zhou Peiyun couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYou\u2019re not nervous?\u201dSu Yaya said, without raising her head, \u201cWhat is there to be nervous about? If it doesn\u2019t work, even if I\u2019m nervous about it, I won\u2019t pass. There\u2019s no need to be nervous.\u201dZhou Peiyun stared at Su Yaya, who had a peaceful state of mind.Soon enough, the staff called number eighteen. Seeing that it was her turn, Su Yaya stood up and walked over in her high heels, then passed her number plate over to the staff. She allowed the staff to guide her to the audition room.The tryout took place in a conference room. Su Yaya lightly knocked on the door. Upon hearing the staff call her in, she pushed the door and walked in.Five people were sitting on the desk in the conference room. Su Yaya only knew one of them and didn\u2019t know the rest. She knew that the middle-aged man with a round and chubby face was Director Qu Jing, and on his left side was the representative of the K Family. On his right side was her handsome neighbor, a popular celebrity right now \u2014 Yan Junyi.When Yan Junyi saw her, he revealed a smile in his eyes and fisted his hand to indicate her good luck.Su Yaya revealed a sweet faint smile on her beautiful face. She sweetly greeted the five people, \u201cHello teachers, I am number eighteen \u2014 Su Yaya.\u201dWhen Yan Junyi walked in and recognized Su Yaya, he especially came over to talk to her. It caused a bit of a ruckus. Even Director Qu Jing and the others had heard a bit about their interaction in the conference room.Now that they saw the rumored female lead, she was indeed very beautiful. She had all the curves in the right places. Just by standing there and doing nothing, she revealed a charming and sexy aura, the type of woman that men would fall for.Qu Jing whispered to Yan Junyi, \u201cXiao Yan, is she your childhood sweetheart?\u201dYan Junyi softly laughed. He faintly said, \u201cNot childhood sweetheart. We\u2019re just neighbors when we were kids.\u201dNeighbors when they were young, yet he remembered her clearly. There was clearly something going on!Su Yaya didn\u2019t know what Director Qu Jing and Yan Junyi were talking about. She heard Director Qu Jing say to her, however, \u201cPerform a scene where a boyfriend gifts their girlfriend a watch.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya nodded her head and smiled. She said, \u201cThen can I have someone help me?\u201dShe looked eagerly at Yan Junyi. Her target was clear.Director Qu Jing started laughing amongst them. He clapped Yan Junyi on the back, smiled and said, \u201cShe wants you to help her, so go ahead and act with her.\u201dYan Junyi obviously wouldn\u2019t reject her. Whether if it was out of personal or business reasons, he wanted to help Su Yaya anyway, so he agreed right then and said, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll act with her.\u201dOnce he finished his words, the others chuckled, but they laughed kindly, not meaning anything bad.Yan Junyi stood up while they were laughing. He walked towards Su Yaya and asked, \u201cHow are we going to act?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She shared some of her ideas with Yan Junyi, who nodded his head as he listened to her plans. He also gave suggestions at suitable moments, and soon, the two of them wrapped up their discussion.\u201cDirector, we\u2019re ready.\u201d Su Yaya said confidently.Confident girls are very likeable. Director Qu Jing waved his hand and replied, \u201cThen begin performing.\u201d\u2026In a morning, Su Yaya got out of bed and pulled the curtains open. She stood by the window and looked afar towards a tall figure walking over from the distance. The tall man walked towards her home and looked up at her with a splendid and bright smile. Upon recognizing him, Su Yaya hurried downstairs.She opened the door and his figure finally appeared. Yan Junyi, who stood by the door, handed over an exquisite gift box to her. She received the box from him with a questioning look, and under his gaze, she opened the box to find a pair of couples\u2019 watch. Su Yaya really liked it. She smiled happily and threw herself in Yan Junyi\u2019s arms\u2026After their performance, an enthusiastic applause erupted in the conference room.Director Qu Jing was very pleased. He smiled and said to Su Yaya, \u201cYou really know how to use your resources to your advantage. You also have a lot of thoughts and creativity. Not bad, not bad.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and bowed.K Family\u2019s representative was very pleased with her performance as well. The man slightly nodded his head; he now had a candidate in mind.\u201cGo home and wait for a notification. When the results come out, we\u2019ll notify you.\u201d Director Qu Jing said to her.\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya slightly smiled and bowed before exiting the room.The moment she walked out, she clearly sensed the questioning and unfriendly looks that people were giving her. Su Yaya could guess what had happened; she had spent the longest time in the audition room. Director Qu Jing and the others even laughed delightfully, and at the end, they applauded at her and Yan Junyi\u2019s performance while giving compliments. These things had never happened in the previous performances, so the contestants thought that she definitely had a high chance of succeeding. Therefore, they looked at her in enmity.Su Yaya stared back at the rivals who were glaring at her. Whether or not she wins the advertisement, she mustn\u2019t lack in imposing manners, so she straightened her back and kept her spirits up as she walked over in her high heels.Zhou Peiyun quickly walked up to her and pulled her to the side, then urged her sit down. She asked, \u201cHow do you think it went?\u201dSu Yaya gave her an \u201cok\u201d hand gesture. She smiled and said, \u201cIf nothing happens, this advertisement should be mine.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally,\u201d Su Yaya nodded her head. She was very confident in the result.In reality, it was like what Su Yaya had said. With an outstanding person like her who had just performed, Director Qu Jing and the others thought the other people performing were lacking in personality and thoughtfulness. No one could compare to her.\u201cThen, let\u2019s decide on number eighteen, Su Yaya.\u201d In the end, Director Qu Jing had called for the end of the tryouts. No one else disagreed, as they all thought that Su Yaya was the best.When the staff proceeded to announce the result, Zhou Peiyun was even more excited than Su Yaya. She tugged Su Yaya and said, \u201cYou got K Family\u2019s advertisement. Let\u2019s go and sign the contract to avoid any possible problems.\u201dSu Yaya still buried her head in her phone and focused her attention on playing games. \u201cDon\u2019t tug on me. Wait until I\u2019m done with this round, otherwise I will have you pay for it if I die!\u201dZhou Peiyun was speechless.She didn\u2019t know what to say, after all, she was still Su Yaya\u2019s manager. She worked day and night to help this actress get connections and find resources while tiring herself out every day.Zhou Peiyun was happy for this actress and rushed her to sign the contract, but while she meant well for Su Yaya, this actress didn\u2019t seem to care. Su Yaya only cared about playing her stupid game. This actress even dared to say that she will make Zhou Peiyun pay if she died!Pay?Heh, she really has the guts now!She really thinks she can\u2019t control her now?\u201cSu\u2013\u201d\u201cI\u2019m done. Let\u2019s go.\u201dWhile Zhou Peiyun prepared to scold Su Yaya, the girl suddenly stood up and closed the game, waving the phone in her face. She indicated that her game was done and that they could go sign the contract now.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Zhou Peiyun was halfway through with her words when Su Yaya interrupted her. She hiccuped subconsciously.Su Yaya, who had walked ahead, realized that Zhou Peiyun didn\u2019t follow her. She turned around to look at her and said with a shocked expression, \u201cWhy are you standing there? Aren\u2019t we going to sign the contract?\u201dHah. This person\u2026wasn\u2019t she the one who didn\u2019t want to go before?\u201cGo. Of course we\u2019re going!\u201d Zhou Peiyun gritted her teeth and said. \u201cWe\u2019ve put in so much effort to get this K Family\u2019s couples watch advertisement. How could we not go?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Let\u2019s go!\u201d Su Yaya turned around and walked in large strides.Zhou Peiyun stared at her slender figure and stomped on her feet as she followed after her.The signed the contract successfully. Zhou Peiyun looked through the contract first then allowed Su Yaya to sign it after checking that it didn\u2019t have any problems.When they came out from signing the contract, Zhou Peiyun went to the parking lot to drive the car over. Su Yaya waited at the lobby of the hotel when a black van drove over and stopped in front of her. The car window in the back seat slid down, revealing Yan Junyi\u2019s handsome face that many people swooned over.He smiled at her and said, \u201cYaya, we haven\u2019t seen each other for many years.

If the paparazzi take pictures of us eating together and say that we are in a relationship, wouldn\u2019t you mind? After all, I am using your fame to become more popular.\u201dYan Junyi didn\u2019t think that she would say this. He was frozen for a bit but then reacted quickly. He replied, \u201cI don\u2019t mind. If you are willing to use me for popularity, I will be very happy.\u201dSu Yaya tilted her head to look at him. She pursed her lips and said, \u201cThen that makes me very happy. But thank you for the offer. Let\u2019s have a raincheck and eat another time. I have an appointment.\u201d\u201cI got rejected by a beautiful woman again.\u201d Yan Junyi pretended to be very upset. He revealed a miserable look and clutched his chest as he stared at Su Yaya and said, \u201cThen let\u2019s see each other next time. You have to give me a chance!\u201dSu Yaya smiled and nodded her head. She made an \u201cok\u201d gesture and said, \u201cI promise.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d Yan Junyi emphasized.\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya agreed.Yan Junyi continued to say, \u201cWhere are you going? Although we can\u2019t eat together, it should be fine for me to bring you over, right?\u201dSu Yaya waved her hands and raised her chin. She smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need. My manager is driving over now.\u201d She pointed.Yan Junyi followed the direction of her finger. As expected, a white Cayenne drove over from the front. Zhou Peiyun sat in the driver\u2019s seat and waved her hands at Su Yaya, telling her to come over.Yan Junyi looked at Su Yaya with a complicated expression. He knew that Su Yaya had just entered the entertainment industry. This Cayenne shouldn\u2019t be hers and her manager doesn\u2019t seem like someone who could afford it either. Who did this car belong to? The entertainment circle was very messy and there were a lot of enticing going on. Some people couldn\u2019t control themselves and in the end, they become corrupted.\u201cI\u2019m going now. Bye.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and waved her hands. She quickly walked to the white Cayenne.Yan Junyi stared at her silhouette. He originally wanted to tell her something, but he chose not to in the end. He watched as she got into the Cayenne and as it slowly drove away.In the car, while driving, Zhou Peiyun drove and asked Su Yaya where she wanted to go. She said, \u201cPresident Chen just sent me a message and wanted me to bring him food.\u201dThis is also the reason why she rejected Yan Junyi and said that she had an appointment. Chen Xiuqi was her sugar daddy right now, the actual boss. He was calling for her, so how could she dare not go?!Su Yaya had no choice but to order takeout from a restaurant, three dishes and one soup. She also passed by a dessert shop. Seeing that the desserts looked pretty good, she bought two boxes of durians and brought all of these to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s company.Li Lan and He Rui, who were at the reception desk, had received the notification early on and knew that Su Yaya was about to come. Seeing that she carried food through the door, they revealed a standard smile that they had practiced many times, and welcomed Su Yaya.\u201cMiss Su, follow me. President Chen had already notified us and said that you can go directly up.\u201d He Rui led Su Yaya to the elevator and helped her swipe the card before bringing her into the elevator.When the elevator door closed, He Rui turned around and ran excited to Li Lan. She said, \u201cI saw F Family\u2019s bracelet that Miss Su is wearing. On the website, the quoted price is about 80,000 yuan. I always wanted to buy one but it\u2019s too expensive and I couldn\u2019t bear to.\u201dLi Lan patted her. \u201cWait until you get yourself a wealthy man, then buy it. Otherwise, 80,000 is enough to buy a house that\u2019s about two or three square meters. Didn\u2019t you always want to buy a house?\u201d\u201cI should save my money to buy a house.\u201d He Rui sighed. When she thought about it, she was more unhappy. She pulled on Li Lan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cWhen can I be like Miss Su? When can I live in a large house and be able to buy whatever I want?!\u201dLi Lan calmly said, \u201cThere\u2019s a time you can.\u201d\u201cWhen?\u201d\u201cGo home and lie on your bed and sleep.\u201d Li Lan smiled and said, \u201cGo dream!\u201dHe Rui clapped her back out of anger. \u201cYou\u2019re so mean! I\u2019m not going to talk to you now!\u201d She turned around and ignored her.Li Lan said humorously, \u201cIn the past, I looked down on her, thinking that she was just an ordinary online celebrity. I thought that she purposefully seduced President Chen and created scandals with him, but now, it feels like President Chen likes her and was willing to pamper and soothe her. She ate the best food, wore the best clothes, and is even living in a large villa. Just that bracelet that she wore was about a few 10,000s. What right do I have to look down on her? I must have nothing to do if I\u2019m thinking about this!\u201dTowards Li Lan\u2019s words, He Rui didn\u2019t disagree. She nodded her head as well. \u201cRight, she\u2019s living a better life than us.\u201d\u2026By the time Su Yaya carried the food to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s office, he had just finished work. She placed the three dishes and one soup on the table, then waved her hands at Chen Xiuqi. Su Yaya smiled sweetly and said, \u201cHubby, I bought food for you. It\u2019s all food you like. Come over and eat.\u201dChen Xiuqi placed the file down and walked over. He hugged Su Yaya\u2019s slender waist from behind and lowered his head to kiss the side of her face. Chen Xiuqi revealed a smile and said, \u201cLet me taste it first.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She shivered and protested coquettishly, \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me.\u201dChen Xiuqi softly chuckled and kissed the side of her face again. He pulled her down to a seat on the sofa next to him and asked, \u201cWas the audition successful today?\u201dSu Yaya hurriedly nodded. \u201cVery successful. I got K Family\u2019s watch advertisement.\u201dThere was a bright and splendid smile on her face. She raised her head to look at Chen Xiuqi as though asking for a compliment.\u201cGood, not bad.\u201d Chen Xiuqi complimented and rubbed her head.Heheh. Su Yaya was very happy and she rubbed herself against Chen Xiuqi\u2019s body. She added on while he was still in a good mood, \u201cAlthough I got K Family\u2019s watch advertisement, you told me you would give me resources to advertisements as well this morning. You have to keep your words!\u201dShe looked at him eagerly and with bright eyes, afraid that he might go back on his words. Chen Xiuqi\u2019s heart softened and he said in a pampering tone, \u201cOk, I said I will give you it. I\u2019ll let someone arrange this for you, ok?\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya nodded and smiled happily. \u201cThank you hubby.\u201dChen Xiuqi revealed a smile.Su Yaya happily delivered the utensils and bowl to him. \u201cLet\u2019s eat, let\u2019s eat.\u201dChen Xiuqi looked at the dishes on the table. He liked it all and took the chopsticks from Su Yaya and began to eat.Su Yaya was hungry as well. She tried the simmer-fried pork chop and it tasted really good. She couldn\u2019t help but recall the process of making pepper and salted pork chop on a food blogger\u2019s post as she scrolled through Weibo. She smiled and said to Chen Xiuqi, \u201cI saw a blogger making pepper and salted pork chop. It seems appealing and I want to try making it later.\u201dChen Xiuqi looked at her and recalled how good her cooking was. \u201cWhen you finish cooking it, let me taste it.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Su Yaya said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t make it for you, who else would I make it for?\u201dChen Xiuqi loved hearing this. Even though the food wasn\u2019t made by Su Yaya, he thought it tasted better now.After dinner, Su Yaya brought out the box of durians and shared a piece with Chen Xiuqi. Unsure whether Su Yaya had initiated this, Chen Xiuqi would eat some now even though he disliked it in the past.\u201cIt\u2019s tasty.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and said, \u201cSweets can put people in a good mood.\u201dChen Xiuqi felt that he was in a pretty good mood too. He nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201dSu Yaya giggled and scooped a big piece of durian into her mouth. It was delicious!Chen Xiuqi pinched her face and said, \u201cI think you\u2019ve gotten more chubby.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d Su Yaya hurriedly pushed his hand away and wanted to find a mirror in her bag.Chen Xiuqi proudly smiled. \u201cIf you continue to eat like this, you will definitely be chubby. In the future, I\u2019ll make sure you eat a lot so you would become a chubby person.\u201dWomen were most scared of \u201cyou\u2019re getting chubby\u201d and such. Su Yanyi wasn\u2019t an exception either.She glared at Chen Xiuqi and said in mock anger, \u201cYou\u2019re fat! You\u2019re chubby!\u201d Everyone is fat in your family!Wah. Although she strongly scolded Chen Xiuqi, it was the truth that she ate too much. She really couldn\u2019t eat as much in the future otherwise she would become fat. That would be a loss to her great figure now. Once she returned, she would go run on the treadmill for two hours, no. Three hours!Chen Xiuqi pulled on her but she didn\u2019t want to answer him. He grinned and soothed her. \u201cYou\u2019re angry?\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019m angry.\u201d Su Yaya said coquettishly. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that women hate hearing that they\u2019ve gotten fat? I don\u2019t want to be fat!\u201dAlthough there was the possibility that her physique allowed her to stay skinny despite eating so much, she was still scared. As long as they were women, they would be.\u201cOk, ok, ok.\u201d Chen Xiuqi held her in his arms and pinched her arms then her waist. He said seriously, \u201cActually, I think you\u2019re a bit too skinny. It makes me feel uncomfortable when I\u2019m hugging you.\u201d\u201cNo, I think I\u2019m just right.\u201d Su Yaya said clearly and determined. \u201cDon\u2019t try to soothe me.\u201dChen Xiuqi held her and lowly chuckled. \u201cIf you become chubbier, you would only be mine.\u201dPsh. Su Yaya wanted to roll her eyes.He was good at talking smooth. Though, where did he, a dominant CEO, learn this from? If she really became chubbier, she might be driven out of the family much quicker than now!Although she wanted her alimony so then she could leave, she didn\u2019t want to be fat either. It\u2019s not like one could get a great figure in a day! It was result of exercise and hardwork!Humph, she won\u2019t be fooled by him!She definitely can\u2019t believe the words of a man who likes to play the field!Su Yaya patted his shoulders and shifted the topic of discussion. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a lot of work to do? Go work on it quickly.\u201d\u201cHow about you?\u201d Chen Xiuqi asked.Su Yaya thought about it and had an idea. \u201cHow about I stay here while you work? When you\u2019re tired from working, I can massage your shoulders and back?\u201dIt was clear she was trying to please him. Chen Xiuqi gave her a deep gaze and there was a tint of a smile on his face. \u201cOk.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Yaya yawned and wanted to take a nap.Chen Xiuqi turned around to see her yawn in time. She was frightened by his sudden move and hurriedly shut her mouth. She did it so quickly that she almost sprained her jaw. Her bright and sparkling eyes were filled with tears.Seeing this, he pointed at the lounge by his side and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a bed in the lounge. You can sleep there for a while.\u201dThat would be terrific. Su Yaya had been wishing for this. She waved at Chen Xiuqi and softly said, \u201cThen I\u2019m going to nap.\u201dChen Xiuqi nodded and when she turned around, she yawned again and headed straight for the lounge.The lounge was bigger than what Su Yaya expected. It was very neat and someone would come over everyday to clean up. There were complete sets of items and materials. There was a bed, chair, closet, bathroom, and everything that should be here.The bed was very soft and comfortable. There was a faint fragrance as she slept on it. She quickly fell asleep after laying on it.At the same time, the TV Show \u300aFlourishing Palace \u300bannounced the main actors on its official Weibo.TV Show \u300aFlourishing Palace \u300b: The show invested by Sheng Shi Entertainment was directed by Director Zhou Tongguang who collaborated with the female lead \u2014 Chen Yan \u2014 male lead \u2014 Xu Chaoran \u2014 second female lead \u2014 Su Yaya \u2014 and second male lead \u2014 Zhang Yue. It talked about love, hatred, and revenge within the palace.The moment the official announcement came out, many forwarded this. The only exception was Su Yaya who was still sleeping and didn\u2019t know.\u2026Last time, An Yuting who asked Chen Xiuqi for the second female lead role, Imperial Concubine Shu, didn\u2019t have her wish granted. After she returned, she angrily tattled to her sister, An Yutong who was abroad. However, she didn\u2019t answer the phone so she almost smashed her phone in a fit of anger.After a few days, her anger finally diminished. Listening to her manager\u2019s advice, she planned on finding Chen Xiuqi in the Chen Company again. No matter what, she would make sure Chen Xiuqi gives her the second female lead role.Who knew she just sat in the car and was on her way to Chen Company when she saw that the TV Show had announced its actors. Clearly, someone had taken the second female lead role and it was Su Yaya, who she disliked!She stared at Su Yaya and clicked on her Weibo. She looked at her selfies and finally confirmed it was Su Yaya.Su Yaya was the second female lead?! How could it be her?It\u2019s impossible. She couldn\u2019t believe it! She must ask Chen Xiuqi about this!An Yuting was very angry. She had praised and gave Chen Xiuqi so many compliments in hopes of him giving her the role. She even begged him but he remained unmoved. In the end, he harshly rejected her request. He wouldn\u2019t even give her sister, face.Yet, he actually gave the second female lead role to Su Yaya, that slut! She was incredibly angry right now!Just what was good about Su Yaya? Had she surpassed her in anything, she would\u2019ve admitted defeat! If the second female lead role was given to someone with more fame than her, she might\u2019ve accepted this! But how could she accept this when the role was given to an ordinary online celebrity who looked like her sister, a substitute even?! How could this be?!The more An Yuting thought about it, the more angry she was. She was unwilling to accept this. She recalled the day she went to ask Chen Xiuqi for the role and how she coincidentally met Su Yaya who was bringing food for him. The two went up together and she went to see Chen Xiuqi in the parlor, but Su Yaya didn\u2019t. She had to wait in the parlor for a while before she saw him. Could Su Yaya have done something during this period of time?She didn\u2019t even think about this until now. It really seemed like the case. Su Yaya must\u2019ve done something so Chen Xiuqi refused to give her the second female lead role!Su Yaya, that slut!Right now, An Yuting forgot what she had said to Chen Xiuqi. She would\u2019ve never thought that she said something wrong and made him unhappy. Therefore, he didn\u2019t give her this chance. She was so angry that she placed all the blame on Su Yaya. She felt like she had blocked her way!She won\u2019t let her go!An Yuting quickly unlocked her phone and found a number, calling them.\u201cBrother Yang, help me hack someone. I want the best and strongest internet water army. Money is not a problem. Expose all of her dark secrets. I want to make sure she can\u2019t change the tables over after this and that I would be able to step on her!\u201d(T/N: internet water army \u7f51\u7edc\u6c34\u519b\u2013 Internet ghostwriters paid to post online comments with particular content; can post news, comments, gossip, disinformation on some online platforms)They replied, \u201cOk, no problem. Give me 100,000 and once I receive the money, I will immediately do so.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the first time An Yuting worked with Brother Yang. She immediately transferred 100,000 to him and when he received the money, he had her send the information of who she wanted him to hack.An Yuting send Su Yaya\u2019s information over and he replied with \u201cok\u201d after receiving it. He immediately went to work.An Yuting sneered as she looked at Brother Yang\u2019s reply.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She attempted to call Chen Xiuqi but he didn\u2019t answer, so she had to change her plans. She took out a mirror from her bag and checked her appearance to make sure that nothing was wrong with her makeup. Afterwards, she got out of the car.An Yuting walked to the Chen Company with her purse and found Li Lan at the reception desk. She maintained the same arrogant tone as she ordered \u201cI\u2019m here to meet Brother Xiuqi. Call the President\u2019s office.\u201dThe commanding tone made Li Lan uncomfortable. This visitor had a bad attitude compared to Su Yaya\u2019s friendly manner, which made a huge difference between the two. The receptionist suddenly thought that Su Yaya was ok, at least better than An Yuting.Li Lan revealed a professional faint smile and said in a proper tone. \u201cMiss An, do you have an appointment?\u201dAn Yuting\u2019s face became gloomy upon hearing this. She was in a bad mood and had been holding in her anger. Now, she was angrier. She pointed at Li Lan and yelled, \u201cI told you to call the President\u2019s office. Are you deaf? Can\u2019t you understand English?\u201dAn Yuting wasn\u2019t that much of a beauty and she also had poor manners. She really thought of herself as a young miss!Li Lan originally didn\u2019t want to call but An Yuting had been constantly urging her. She glued her eyes to the President\u2019s exclusive elevator, wishing for it to open up immediately.What a coincidence that the elevator door opened right then. An Yuting was ecstatic and quickly walked over to see Assistant Chen coming out.\u201cAssistant Chen.\u201d An Yuting smiled and called. Her attitude towards him, compared to Li Lan\u2019s, was completely different. She changed her expression so quick as if she was acting.\u201cMiss An.\u201d Assistant Chen stopped, surprised that she was here.Right now, An Yuting couldn\u2019t attend to much. She was anxious to see Chen Xiuqi so she hastily said, \u201cAssistant Chen, I have an urgent matter to find Brother Xiuqi for. Can you let me up?\u201dAssistant Chen hesitated.An Yuting quickly thought of something and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s about my sister. Brother Xiuqi must want to know.\u201dAssistant Chen had been Chen Xiuqi\u2019s assistant for a few years. He personally witnessed Chen Xiuqi and An Yuting\u2019s love and entanglement, so he knew how much Chen Xiuqi liked An Yutong. He paid attention to everything regarding her, and even feared if the task wasn\u2019t done to its best.Thinking of this, Assistant Chen made a decision without Chen Xiuqi\u2019s permission. He led her to the elevator door, then took out his card and swiped it, opening the door for her. He allowed her go straight to the 26th floor.When An Yuting arrived and walked out, she headed straight for Chen Xiuqi\u2019s office. She didn\u2019t even knock on the door, and instead, barged in directly.\u201cBrother Xiuqi, there\u2019s an important matter.\u201dRight now, Chen Xiuqi was video conferencing with people abroad in subsidiary companies. Seeing that An Yuting barged in without notice, his handsome face became gloomy all of a sudden. He hastily said something to the staff on the other side and agreed to stop here and resume discussing about the other matters later on. He then hurriedly ended the conference.Chen Xiuqi slapped the laptop shut and An Yuting\u2019s heart thumped rapidly as she watched him.\u201cWho let you in?\u201d His voice was icy cold, emitting cold aura. He looked sharply at An Yuting as though throwing darts at her.This was the first time she had seen him that angry with her. His face was gloomy and there was a dispirited atmosphere. He was terrifying. She nervously gulped and said, \u201cI, I came up by myself.\u201dChen Xiuqi coldly humphed and his face became scarier. \u201cYou came up by yourself?\u201d\u201cY-yes. I met Assistant Chen downstairs and he let me up.\u201d At this time, An Yuting didn\u2019t dare to spit lies. She said the truth.Chen Xiuqi humphed.An Yuting carefully examined his expression. She revealed a miserable look and gently begged, \u201cBrother Xiuqi, I really have an urgent matter. Don\u2019t be angry at me.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Spit it!\u201d At this time, Chen Xiuqi just wanted to drive her away. The conference she interrupted was very important so he didn\u2019t have that much time to talk with her.Seeing that he calmed down a bit, An Yuting immediately stepped forward and asked, \u201cBrother Xiuqi, why did you give the second female lead role to Su Yaya for \u300aFlourishing Palace\u300b? I dislike her a lot and so does my sister!\u201dIn the lounge, Su Yaya was sleeping soundly. She dreamed of numerous dollar bills falling down from the sky and piling up on her bed. She rolled around in bed due to happiness, turning from left to right, and then right to left. She was going crazy with ecstasy.Suddenly, a sharp and piercing woman\u2019s voice penetrated her ear drums, yelling loudly, \u201cI hate Su Yaya!\u201dSu Yaya, who was in a dream, suddenly heard this voice filled with enmity and disgust. She immediately woke up.Outside the lounge, An Yuting cried and caused a racket, causing Su Yaya, who was in the lounge, to hear it from her end.\u201cBrother Xiuqi, what\u2019s good about Su Yaya? Is her acting better mine? Is she more famous than me? She\u2019s just an online celebrity who can\u2019t do anything right! How come she could have the second female lead role but not me? You knew how much I liked that role. Why did you have to do this to me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An Yuting was displeased that she got the second female lead role in \u300aFlourishing Palace\u300b so she came to cause a disturbance.Thinking that a tragedy was about to happen, Su Yaya thought that she may not be able to keep her second female lead role.According to the original book\u2019s plot, Chen Xiuqi took extra care of An Yuting because of her family ties to An Yutong, at least before An Yuting began to seduce him later in the story. But before then, he tried his best to give her the roles she wanted. Therefore, she calmly and peacefully made her way up in the entertainment circle and had acted in a number of big and small projects. However, because of her attitude, arrogance, and tendency to look down on others after she had received Chen Xiuqi\u2019s support, she had yet to become someone famous. An Yuting simply remained an ordinary celebrity.An Yuting was unhappy that Su Yaya obtained the second female lead role in the TV Show, so now, she came requesting Chen Xiuqi to give her the role instead. According to the plot, there was a chance that Chen Xiuqi might really do so, and then give Su Yaya a different role instead as a compensation and comfort.After all, the truth was laid bare; Su Yaya wasn\u2019t as famous as An Yuting. She was just an ordinary online celebrity while An Yuting was an actual celebrity. If An Yuting was to have the second female lead role, there would definitely be more people watching than if it was her, an online celebrity acting this role. Chen Xiuqi was an authentic businessman. He invested in movies to earn money, not for charity. He would use whoever was more beneficial to helping him earn money. This was something so simple that anyone could think of.There was another point\u2013it had to do with their relationships. According to the original book, Chen Xiuqi deeply loved An Yutong and An Yuting was her biological sister. He would help his beloved\u2019s sister in order to obtain a favorable impression of himself to her. This was the usual methods for many love stories. Even dominant CEO, Chen Xiuqi, couldn\u2019t escape this.Sigh. She was just a cannon fodder side female lead. How did she have the abilities to fight against An Yuting? If she really wanted the second female lead, she might as well give it to her.It was so difficult to be a nice person. It was so difficult to live peacefully, especially a cannon fodder like her. If she wanted to have a peaceful future and live, she needed to remember to please the male and female lead always. She needed to make sure she didn\u2019t offend anyone from the male or female lead\u2019s side. Whenever she could let them do as they wish, she would do so. There were boundless open opportunities from moving a step back. After she divorces Chen Xiuqi, everything would be fine.While Su Yaya was thinking about this, she immersed herself in the character of a miserable side lead. She didn\u2019t bother paying attention to what Chen Xiuqi and An Yuting were saying outside, but then, she suddenly heard Au Yuting shrieking.\u201cBrother Xiuqi, how could you do this to my sister? You told me you would treat me like your actual sister in the past. That\u2019s how you treat me? Who is this Su Yaya? Why are you comparing her to me? She just looks similar to my sister. Who doesn\u2019t know that she\u2019s actually my sister\u2019s substitute!?\u201dSu Yaya nodded, agreeing with the words. She admits that she was indeed An Yuting\u2019s substitute. She knew her place.The only reason Chen Xiuqi had pursued her was because she was similar to An Yutong. He wanted to place hope on someone else so he decided to be with her. Chen Xiuqi had married her under a contract so that he could inherit his grandfather\u2019s billion inheritance. He had no choice but to marry someone and he didn\u2019t want to put in so much effort, so he found her.Plus, the two had only completed their marriage procedures and signed the contract before marriage. It was a secret agreement. Besides a few essential figures who knew, no one else knew, and when the time comes, they will divorce!Right now, they were in a tangled situation all because Chen Xiuqi wanted to satisfy his greediness. When the real original host returns, everything would end.Su Yanyi understood this. Of course, she didn\u2019t care that much since she was just a cannon fodder side lead. She simply needed to live each day happily.However, the plot didn\u2019t develop as she expected.Chen Xiuqi suddenly hollered, \u201cScram. Don\u2019t let me see you again.\u201dSu Yaya hid in the lounge and jumped at this bellow, not to mention An Yuting who was the target of his anger.\u201cBrother Xiuqi\u2026\u201d An Yuting was really frightened by the angry Chen Xiuqi. She had never seen this side of him. Compared to when she disturbed his conference, he was much frightening right now, so she timidly called him.\u201cScram!\u201d Chen Xiuqi angrily shouted again. Even Su Yaya who was hiding in the lounge felt the room shaking. Her heart was in her mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With such a tear-stained face, anyone would pity her had they seen her. \u201cBrother Xiuqi, you weren\u2019t like this before. You were really nice to me but you changed after you met Su Yaya\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you leaving or not? If not, I\u2019ll call security to throw you out!\u201d Chen Xiuqi icily showed her to the door. He was truly annoyed with An Yuting.Now that Chen Xiuqi had ran out of patience, she would lose face even more if she was escorted out by security. Although An Yuting was impulsive, she wasn\u2019t completely stupid. She quickly weighed the pros and cons in her heart; if she was escorted out by security, it would be even more difficult to see Chen Xiuqi in the Chen Company in the future.She bit her lips and her eyes were red. She held in her tears and stopped it from falling down her face, acting stubborn yet miserable. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dShe looked at Chen Xiuqi with her teary eyes again before walking to the door, hoping he would stop her. When she walked to the door, she couldn\u2019t help but look back again.Dark clouds hovered over Chen Xiuqi\u2019s head, as though the calm before the storm. It seems like he would explode anytime soon.An Yuting looked down and tears fell down her eyes. She left.Su Yaya, who hid in the lounge, heard the door opening and closing, signaling that An Yuting had gone.When she confirmed the door had closed, Su Yaya, who had been eavesdropping deeply, sighed. She had been holding in her breath while listening to their conversation, and only dared to slightly pant now.She heard a bang then something smashed on the ground.Su Yaya\u2019s heart violently thumped. Her heart was in her throat and she didn\u2019t dare to breathe heavily.So intimidating. She was a bit scared!She patted her chest. Chen Xiuqi was infuriated because of An Yuting\u2019s words, saying said that Chen Xiuqi had found a substitute for her sister. Although this was the truth, she should never say that out loud in front of him. It would be absurd if Chen Xiuqi was happy that she exposed his secret. Chen Xiuqi clearly became angry, and thus, started to smash things!Although he became quiet after smashing things, Su Yaya thought that it would be best if she pretended she knew nothing. She knew better than to anger him even more at this time.She looked around in the lounge and decided to continue to sleep in the end, pretending nothing happened. If Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t wake her up, she would keep sleeping. That was how she would try to get away with it.Hm. She would happily decide this.Su Yaya felt like her idea was excellent!She gave herself a thumbs up for her intelligence!Once she made this decision, Su Yaya decisively laid back in bed. She covered the blankets over her, up to her chin, then closed her eyes and tried to sleep.Outside, Chen Xiuqi smashed a document on the ground due to anger, but thankfully, he calmed down after doing so. He sat back on his seat with a cold face. An Yuting was too impolite and impudent. She didn\u2019t know what she should say and what not to say. Who knows how many people she had offended with such an attitude? Sooner or later, she would be taught a lesson, so he didn\u2019t need to be angry at her words. This was unlike him!Then what caused him to be furious?He couldn\u2019t understand his emotions. He just felt infuriated when he heard An Yuting say that Su Yaya was her sister\u2019s substitute in a disdainful tone.Su Yaya indeed looked similar to her sister but they had completely different personalities. He knew this since he had been with Su Yaya for a long time.Plus, Su Yaya was his wife right now; despite her being his wife by contract, she was still his woman. She helped him gain the right to an inheritance worth billions, so with the contract in effect, it was his job to protect her as her husband. No matter what, it wasn\u2019t An Yuting\u2019s right to scold her, or even insult her!Right. That\u2019s what he meant. This is why he was so angry!She was his woman. Whether he wanted to pamper or praise her wasn\u2019t anyone\u2019s right to criticize her, no matter who they were!Chen Xiuqi turned around and looked at the lounge. The door was tightly shut. He didn\u2019t know whether Su Yaya had woke up due to An Yuting\u2019s crying or not.He stood up and walked to the lounge in a few steps. He held the doorknob and softly opened the door to see Su Yaya buried in the thin blankets. Her jet-black hair scattered on the white pillow; this contrast between black and white made her appear even more beautiful and lovable.His heart was touched right then and Chen Xiuqi walked over, digging her out of bed. He held her in his arms and said in her ears. \u201cYaya, time to wake up. It\u2019s too late. If you continue to sleep, you won\u2019t be able to tonight.\u201dSu Yaya who pretended to sleep gradually woke up. She fisted her hands and rubbed her eyes. She softly murmured, \u201cI will be able to fall asleep.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Chen Xiuqi softly laughed in her ears.Su Yaya immediately understood him. She almost fell out of his arms.Ahhh. He\u2019s so bad!He had his mind set on keeping her up all night!She didn\u2019t want to become a flatbread. Cries.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She even released news of her and Chen Company\u2019s President, creating a scandal between the two of them. Newpicture.jpg. Then she went out on a date with another man. Picture.jpg. What a slutty woman. She should be kicked from the entertainment circle!!Happy that I can\u2019t see you: #Kick Su Yaya out of the entertainment circleLove: Kick Su Yaya out of the entertainment circle. I refuse to watch this drama!\u2026The crazy internet water armies kept on degrading Su Yaya under the TV Show\u2019s official Weibo. Even the female lead, Chen Yan, and male lead, Xu Chaoran\u2019s comments from fans were overshadowed. The front page was about Su Yaya not being worthy of taking on the second female lead and wanting for her to be kicked out of the entertainment circle, as well all sorts of degrading pictures.Besides insulting Su Yaya under the official Weibo, these professional water armies and numerous other people found Su Yaya\u2019s Weibo. It was an eyesore to look at the comments which mentioned offensive and vulgar things.Besides this, the internet water armies even made #Kick Su Yaya out of the entertainment circle as the hot search.Su Yaya was famous, but for negative reasons. Many users who didn\u2019t know the truth saw the comments and degrading pictures of Su Yaya and felt that it was the truth. There was no merit or positive points about her, so they followed the internet water armies and liked #Kick Su Yaya out of the entertainment circle.Despite how beautiful Su Yaya was and how they knew they couldn\u2019t attack her appearance, the internet water armies found other ways to insult her. For instance, they said she was a vixen and born to be a slut or a mistress!The entertainment circle was like this. The water was very deep and it\u2019s more simple than ever to drown a person without a name.Seeing the internet water armies degrading Su Yaya, An Yuting who was in a bad mood suddenly sneered. She strangely felt a sense of happiness.She squinted her eyes looking at the comment where Su Yaya seduced various men, then she uploaded two pictures.The first one was when Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi were in a scandal. Although the picture was a bit blurry, one could see clearly that it was Su Yaya. There was only a side view of the man, not the front view, though it looked a bit like Chen Xiuqi from his silhouette.The second picture had clear views of the woman and man. One could tell it was Su Yaya, and although the man was a stranger, they had some information on him. Someone quickly exposed him to be Yong Rong Food Company\u2019s CEO, Wang Wenhao.Ever since Wang Wenhao\u2019s status was exposed, the comments below became even messier. There were all sorts of comments degrading Su Yaya, saying how wicked she was and unbearable to the public.Next, someone who claimed to be a staff of the company exposed information to the media. Su Yaya had took on Yong Rong Food Company\u2019s white rabbits advertisement a few days ago, but this advertisement wasn\u2019t originally hers. Based on her status and fame, she would never have gotten the advertisement. She must\u2019ve slept with someone in order to obtain this.Half of it was true and the other half wasn\u2019t. It was true that Su Yaya took on the white rabbits advertisement, which someone had proved with a picture. However, it was false that she slept with Wang Wenhao to obtain this, although no one cares now whether it was real or not. Everyone believed that she slept with him to get this advertisement.It was very simple: you sleep with someone, you get the advertisement. You don\u2019t sleep with someone, you don\u2019t get an advertisement.Such stupid logic!(T/N Kitty Jiu: emm, the author comments that at the end, but it\u2019s the same author using the same logic for MC \u2018sleeping\u2019 to get the 2nd female role hahaha.

She told the new media that Su Yaya fooled around with many people, so much that her private life was a chaotic mess. She couldn\u2019t stand her way of life; Su Yaya would be with this man today and tomorrow, she\u2019ll be with another man. Two days ago, she even fooled around with Yan Junyi who is currently one of the most popular guy in the entertainment circle. Picture.jpg, Picture.jpgOne of the photos was of Su Yaya attending the audition for K Group\u2019s couple watch. It was the moment when Yan Junyi recognized Su Yaya, and the two of them were standing together talking.The other photo was of Su Yaya waiting by the side of the road for the car after she successfully signed the contract. Yan Junyi\u2019s housekeeper drove over and asked Su Yaya if she wanted a ride. The photo showed Su Yaya smiling and talking as she bent over towards Yan Junyi who was in the car.The first photo can be justified by saying that Su Yaya knew Yan Junyi and that the two people were only exchanging a few words while standing together. After all, the staff were present. However, the second photo led everyone\u2019s imagination wild and astray. It felt like Su Yaya had intentionally stopped Yan Junyi\u2019s car, trying to please him so that she can get in her car.Yan Junyi was currently one of the most popular rising stars and he always maintained a positive image of himself in the entertainment circle. There had never been any gossip or scandals about him, as a result, he had numerous female fans!Yan Junyi exploded from the news, thousands of fans went to the official blog of the TV series \u300aThe Flourishing Fall of the Palace Willow Wall\u300bto scold Su Yaya. They had vehemently requested that the crew swap her out, otherwise, they will stop watching!There was also another wave of fans who went to Su Yaya\u2019s Weibo to scold her. They attacked her from various angles; it was unbearable to even look at the comments. In the blink of an eye, the fans had already left thousands of messages under Su Yaya\u2019s Weibo.For the first time, Su Yaya\u2019s desolate and frigid Weibo was bustling with noise and excitement!The first one who responded to the news was the supervisor of the TV Series, \u300aThe Flourishing Fall of the Palace Willow Wall\u300b. When she noticed that the direction of the comments were heading in the wrong way, she immediately reported the news to the crew leader.Director Zhou Tongguang was extremely angry when he heard the news. He didn\u2019t like Su Yaya from the beginning because he felt like she had gotten the role because of an investor. He had never seen her before, yet she will play the second female lead of his film, it was an insult to his work. If it weren\u2019t for the lack of funding, he would\u2019ve never wanted someone like her.\u201cWhat do I need these kinds of people for? To ruin my work? Ah, I really want to fucking kick her out! Where did that rubbish even come from?!\u201d Director Zhou Tongguang\u2019s face was black as he cursed at her; he was full of resentment towards Su Yaya.Producer Yu Hui also had a fire in his heart, but he didn\u2019t vocalize it. He was more reserved than Zhou Tongguang. He endured his own anger and comforted Director Zhou Tongguang, \u201cI\u2019ll call the President Xiao of Xiaoshi Entertainment and tell him about this matter.\u201dYu Hui went out and called President Xiao, telling him that he wanted to remove Su Yaya\u2019s second female lead position and replace her. When President Xiao heard this, he laughed and said, \u201cYan Hui, even if you want to remove Su Yaya from the second female lead position, neither of us can make the decision.\u201d\u201cThis show will be ruined if we don\u2019t remove her,\u201d Yan Hui impatiently and urgently said.President Xiao fell silent for a moment before he said, \u201cWait for me to notify them.\u201d After he said that, he hung up.At the Chen Group headquarters, Assistent Chen had just been called into the office and was being scolded by Chen Xiuqi, \u201cWho told you to let An Yutong come up here?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He bowed his head and admitted his mistake, not daring to say anything in response.\u201cIf you dare to make these decisions again without my consent, then you can go to Africa to dig mines. The branch office there lacks people anyways!\u201d Chen Xiuqi said calmly.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Assistant Chen was about to cry to death in his heart.In the end, Assistant Chen made up for the mistake earlier by sacrificing a month of his salary, finally calming Chen Xiuqi down.\u201cGet out.\u201d Chen Xiuqi waved his hand and drove Assistant Chen out.Assistant Chen came out of the president\u2019s office with his head drooping down. He was extremely annoyed at himself for letting An Yuting into the office. His brain must\u2019ve stopped working for him to let An Yuting in. He will never be muddleheaded like this in the future.His cell phone rang at this time, he took his cell phone out and looked at it. It was from President Xiao from the branch office of Shenshi Entertainment. He expected it to be a work issue, so he answered the phone, \u201cPresident Xiao?\u201d\u201cAssistant Chen, something really big happened,\u201d President Xiao immediately responded with that. He didn\u2019t dare to directly call Chen, but instead used a roundabout tactic and called Assistant Chen. He thought that since Assistant Chen was Chen Xiuqi\u2019s most capable assistant, he would definitely be able to find a way to report it to Chen Xiuqi and handle this matter nicely.President Xiao didn\u2019t even breath as he reported the whole situation quickly to Assistant Chen.After Assistant Chen listened to the whole thing, the expression on his face changed, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He quickly opened his Weibo to read the comments on the internet. When he saw those negative large scale online comments targeting Su Yaya, his whole body felt ill.Ah, ah, ah, ah. He had just been scolded by Chen Xiuqi and he also said that he\u2019ll assign him to dig mines in Africa. If he went in to report this right now, then he might be scolded again. Maybe he\u2019ll really need to pack his bags and roll to Africa to mine tomorrow!He doesn\u2019t want that!Realizing that the situation was serious and could not be delayed any longer, Assistant Chen knocked on Chen Xiuqi\u2019s office again under immense pressure. Under his eyes that were as sharp as knives, his voice shook as he said, \u201cPresident Chen, there is a large scale of online comments splashing dirty water at Miss Su\u2026\u201dChen Xiuqi opened Weibo and saw the unbearable comments and abuses on the internet. Each time he swipe to the next comment, Assistant Chen who was standing next to him felt the surrounding temperature decreasing by a percent, and the expression on Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face was getting uglier.\u201cInvestigate, and dig out the person behind the scenes!\u201d Chen Xiuqi instructed with a cold voice as he threw the phone. His handsome face appeared ruthless.Su Yaya had just went to the tea room to make herself a cup of milk tea when she received a call from Zhou Peiyun, \u201cDid you offend someone?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Su Yaya appeared confused as she responded, \u201cI didn\u2019t offend anyone!\u201dShe was obedient and well-behaved, how could she possibly offend someone? What\u2019s more, she only interact with only a few people everyday; the most important person she interact with was the overbearing president of the original novel, Chen Xiuqi. She served him well everyday, so she had never offended him. Who else would she offend?Zhou Peiyun said, \u201cSomeone poured dirty water on you. The other part had invited many people to pour dirty water on you, there are also people who are taking advantage of this situation for a personal gain. In the next two days, don\u2019t look at your phone and don\u2019t go on the internet. The company will find a way to resolve this\u201dSu Yaya\u2019s heart pounded, someone was pouring dirty water on her online? Who is this ruthless? She lived her life honestly and just wanted to earn a little money, so in the future, she will be able to go back to the countryside and farm and just be happy with a simple life. Yet, how could there be someone pouring dirty water on her?Su Yaya didn\u2019t understand.She asked Zhou Peiyun, \u201cWhat is the company planning to do?\u201dZhou Peiyun responded vaguely, she didn\u2019t tell her the specific plan but said, \u201cIt will be handled properly, you have to trust the company.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 - Water Army (4)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64 Water Army (4)The moment that Zhou Peiyun had responded vaguely, Su Yaya realized that this matter was troublesome. Xinghui Entertainment was just a small company, they didn\u2019t have anything to offer, so it was impossible for them to handle anything. When dealing with crises and risks, the public relation\u2019s ability was medicare. If someone was purposely pouring dirty water on her, the company still won\u2019t have the ability to fight back. She most likely will have to take care of this matter herself.Su Yaya didn\u2019t have any reputation, yet she was still being deliberately poured with dirty water by other people. It seemed like she was about to be trampled to the ground by other people, and if she wants to climb back up in the future, it\u2019ll be harder than reaching for the sky.No, this can\u2019t happen. She was looking forward to earning some money in the entertainment circle! In the future, she will be able to buy a bigger courtyard when go back to the countryside!She can\u2019t rely on the company. The greater the hope, the greater the disappointment. Fortunately, there was a person she could ask for help. That person was Chen Xiuqi, he was the male lead of this novel, the powerful and overbearing president. He can kill off his opponents by just moving his fingers.After some thoughts, Su Yaya decided to ask Chen Xiuqi for help. She said to Zhou Peiyun, \u201cI\u2019ll look for President Chen in a while, I\u2019m hanging up first.\u201dThe company had limited capabilities, so it cannot solve big issues. Su Yaya didn\u2019t intend to embarrass Zhou Peiyun. In fact, she understood that for Zhou Peiyun to call her at this time, she probably wanted her to find Chen Xiuqi for help!After talking to Zhou Peiyun, Su Yaya hung up and quickly opened her Weibo. Thousands of messages instantly popped up on her screen. Her fruit-branded phone almost froze from all the messages.After a while, the fruit-branded phone finally calmed down. Su Yaya first checked her private messages, all the messages she received were scolding her. Then she looked at the comments under her Weibo selfies, which were even more unbearable to look at. People attacked her from various angles in the comment section, there were also people who commented on how she fooled around with various men. They even posted pictures of her with Chen Xiuqi, Wang Wenhao, and Yan Junyi.After seeing all these chaotic insults and comments, her whole body didn\u2019t feel well.Your mother! She had previously thought that someone was just pouring dirty water on her, and she could find Chen Xiuqi to easily resolve this. But these people were accusing her of seducing men, having a chaotic private life, and changing men like she was changing clothes.Although these remarks are fake, even though she knew these remarks are fake and that Chen Xiuqi should probably also realize that these remarks are fake, whether this was true or not, how will Chen Xiuqi react to these remarks after he sees them?He probably want to tear her apart!No man wanted a green hat, even if it was just a fake rumour! These rumours were about to seriously turn Chen Xiuqi\u2019s head as green as the Hulunbuir Prairie.She could even hear the sound of a grass mud horse running wildly on his head.The situation was not optimistic. She must go find Chen Xiuqi and make this clear to him. She also needs to coax him to make him happy. She can\u2019t let Chen Xiuqi misunderstand that she was acting just like the comments. Otherwise, her life will be miserable because she doesn\u2019t even need to wait for his white moonlight to return, she would already be dead.Su Yaya was anxious to go find Chen Xiuqi to explain everything to him. On the way there, she saw Chen Xiuqi walking towards her with large strides. When she saw that there was no expression on his handsome face and a gloomy aura around him. It appeared like the calm before the storm.It\u2019s over, it\u2019s over. Judging from his appearance, it seemed like he has come here to punish her, right?What should she do? She wants to run away\u2026The author has something to say:Su Yaya: What should I do? I want to run away\u2026Chen Xiuqi: Where do you want to run off to?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no way for a cannon fodder to match up to the imposing aura of the male lead.While Su Yaya was still pondering over those things, Chen Xiuqi headed straight towards her and stopped right in front of her. He looked her up and down with his deep eyes and said, \u201cWhy are you standing there in a daze?\u201dSu Yaya\u2019s heart was beating rapidly as she asked in astonishment, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dChen Xiuqi looked at her and said, \u201cYou had gone out for such a long time. I thought you were lost, so I came out to look for you.\u201dSu Yaya subconsciously pouted and said, \u201cHow can that happen? I definitely won\u2019t get lost. Hehe!\u201dChen Xiuqi lifted his hand and stroked her head, \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible since you\u2019re so stupid.\u201dSu Yaya, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYou are the stupid one, your whole family is stupid!Chen Xiuqi reached out his hand towards her and said without an expression on his face, \u201cGive me your phone.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes. She didn\u2019t dare to say no while facing his firm and unyielding gaze, so Su Yaya obediently gave him her phone.\u201cFrom now on, you\u2019re not allowed to surf the internet, not allowed to play on your phone, and you\u2019re not allowed to go on Weibo.\u201d Chen Xiuqi directly put her phone into the pocket on his suit pants.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Su Yaya opened her mouth, but before she could even make a sound, Chen Xiuqi held her left hand. His big hand wrapped around her little hand, although he didn\u2019t use a lot of strength, his hold of her was firm and impossible for her to resist.\u201cIf you have anything you want to say, we can talk about it after we go back first.\u201d Chen Xiuqi glanced at her and led her to his office.Su Yaya had wanted to ask him something several times on their way to his office, but she changed her mind when she saw how Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face was stretched taut, jaw clenched tightly, and his thin lips were curled into a straight line. He appeared to be unwilling to talk to her. Su Yaya could only suppress the words in her heart and followed him all the way back to the office.Chen Xiuqi held her hand as he walked to the side of the desk. Su Yaya can\u2019t help but look up at him and asked, \u201cDid you already know about the comments on the internet?\u201dChen Xiuqi glanced at her, the corners of his mouth curved up into a faint smile, \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re not that stupid.\u201dSu Yaya pursed her lips and remembered that he had confiscated her phone, she quickly grabbed pulled his arm and asked, \u201cDid you take my phone away because you don\u2019t want me to feel sad about those comments online?\u201dChen Xiuqi reached out his hand and stroked the top of her head; he didn\u2019t reply with a yes or no to her question.Since he didn\u2019t speak, Su Yaya assumed that he had tacitly agreed.\u201cThank you.\u201d Su Yaya rubbed her head against Chen Xiuqi\u2019s body, \u201cYou\u2019re so good to me.\u201dHe was afraid that she would be sad after seeing those comments and so he confiscated her phone so that she won\u2019t be able to see those negative comments hurled at her. He had specifically went out to find her because he was worried that she would be sad after reading the comments and would secretly hide somewhere to cry alone!Chen Xiuqi was really a nice person! Su Yaya thought.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already arranged for someone to handle the issue. It will be resolved soon,\u201d Chen Xiuqi said.Since Chen Xiuqi took charge of the matter, there would definitely be no problem. Su Yaya nodded her head and hugged Chen Xiuqi tightly.

He reached out his hand and rubbed Su Yaya\u2019s head, like he was teasing a cat and said, \u201cObedient.\u201dAssistant Chen immediately arranged for people to investigate according to Chen Xiuiq\u2019s instructions. Their actions were very fast, in less than an hour they found out that An Yuting was the mastermind behind this. They were also able to block many IDs that were making abusive comments; all the bad and abusive comments hurled at Su Yaya was deleted. The hot search tag #Su Yaya get out of the entertainment circle had also been removed. They arranged for other people to comment on other posts, strongly guiding the public\u2019s flow and attitude.At the same time, Wang Wenhao\u2019s Yonrong Food Company had issued an official statement on their blog.Yonrong Food Company: The CEO of our company, Wang Wenhao and Miss Su Yaya were old classmates. Miss Su Yaya had accepted to star in our toffee advertisement is because of her own skills. Our company will pursue legal actions against all inappropriate comments that is twisting the truth or any slander towards our CEO Wang Wenhao and our brand representative, Miss Su Yaya.As soon as the state was released, many netizens appeared on Weibo and expressed their support.Snow Days Is the Most Beautiful: Yes, I raised both my hands and feets to support suing those people spouting nonsense and pouring dirty water at someone else.Mommy Mommy Coax: Support +1Dreaming Little Pig: Support + 10086Really Love You: Am I the only one who noticed the most important sentence in this statement about Su Yaya and Wang Wenhao being classmates?

Everyone was discussing what kind of classmates the two were like.A few minutes later, Yan Junyi\u2019s Weibo had also updated.Actor Yan Junyi: I\u2019m here to explain that Miss Su Yaya and I were neighbors who grew up together. When she went to the audition that day, we happened to meet and exchanged a few words. When the audition ended, it was already pretty late. I saw Su Yaya standing on the side of the road waiting for her car, so I told her I can send her home. This is why there is a photo of my housekeeper\u2019s car parked in front of her, not because she was trying to hang on to me nor did she want to hang on to me.Once he posted this statement, Yan Junyi\u2019s Weibo was instantly flooded with a large number of fans.Baby Yan Loves Me the Most: Oh, so they turned out to be neighbors. That\u2019s good, that\u2019s good. Almost scared baby to death.Brother Yan and I are a Destined Match: It\u2019s nothing since they\u2019re neighbors.

He recalled how the agent, sister Wu had ran into the lounge with an anxious and worried expression on her face. She pulled his arm and told him to clarify the situation immediately on his Weibo. It looked like someone was holding a knife to her neck. She looked like she was afraid that if she was a second too late, she and him would both be dead!He immediately understood that someone had asked sister Wu to make him clarify the situation on Weibo!When sister Wu saw Yan Junyi in a daze, she came over and asked, \u201cDid you post the clarification statement?\u201dYan Junyi nodded his head and said, \u201c I posted it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Sister Wu appeared to be obviously relieved, and the expression on her face was not as worried or anxious as before.Yan Junyi frowned slightly, \u201cSister Wu, what is going on?\u201dSister Wu smiled reluctantly and said to him, \u201cThe people behind Su Yaya found me and wanted you to come forward to post a clarification statement. The people behind here isn\u2019t people we can afford to offend. It\u2019s better to quickly get rid of your relationship with her if you can.\u201dYan Junyi stared blankly into space; he recalled the white Cayenne that Su Yaya got into that day. It was a very valuable car. She was a newcomer and wasn\u2019t well-known in the entertainment industry. In addition, her family\u2019s background was average, so it was impossible for her to afford such a car. It was also impossible for the company she was in to let her use such a good car. There was only one possibility, it was just as he had thought that time, the car was given to Su Yaya by the person behind her.Who could that person be? Yan Junyi frowned.The Yonrong Food Company had also posted an official statement on their blog, clarifying the relationship between CEO Wang and Su Yaya. It was obvious that like him, they had been asked to post a clarification statement by the other party.The men on the internet that were rumoured to have a relationship with Su Yaya, besides him, was CEO Wang and President Chen from Chen Group. The first two were just rumours and had been clarified. The news regarding Su Yaya and President Chen was just a scandal. Even if there were photos of the two of them together, the photos were too vague and it could\u2019ve been taken at an angle to make the scene look ambiguous. Whether it was the internet, the media, or the people in the entertainment circle, they had all agreed that the scandal was just fake news released by Su Yaya when she had just started her career to gain some attention. No one believed that it was real.When he thought up to this, Yan Junyi was suddenly taken aback. He thought about it for a moment and immediately thought of a possibility. Based on President Chen\u2019s powers, he can easily give Su Yaya a Cayenne, or ask him and Yongrong Food Company to come forward to post a clarification statement.Therefore, the person behind Su Yaya was really President Chen.Yan Junyi suddenly raised his head and looked at sister Wu. He moved his lips and finally found his voice, \u201cSister Wu, is that person President Chen from the Chen Group?\u201dWhen sister Wu heard his words, a flash of surprise flashed across her face, \u201cHow did you know?\u201dYan Junyi said, \u201cIt was such an obvious matter, yet no one from his side came to clarify it.\u201dThat\u2019s right, he didn\u2019t need to clarify anything. Even if he didn\u2019t clarify it, no one dared to do anything to him!Sister Wu patted Yan Junyi\u2019s shoulder and said sincerely, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you understand. There is someone behind her to protect her. You will have to shoot an advertisement with her in a few days, it\u2019s best if you keep your distance.\u201dYan Junyi was particularly excited when he met Su Yaya at the audition that day. He was always vigilant and kept some distance from the people around him. The first reason was because he feared being exploited by others to increase their own fame and the second reason is because he was worried that the media will make a big fuss about him getting close to another female celebrity.However, he acted out of character that day. First, he took the initiative to look for Su Yaya to talk. When auditioning, he also partnered up with Su Yaya, allowing her to successfully receive the female lead role for K Group\u2019s couple watch advertisement. In the end, he even offered to send her home. But after she rejected his offer, his mood plummeted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The photo was old, so the image was a little fuzzy. But she could still see the two people in the photo, one was Yan Junyi and needless to say, the other one was Su Yaya.Sister Wu had been his agent for several years, so how could she not know why he was acting so abnormally He clearly likes Su Yaya!Sister Wu sighed in her heart. Yan Junyi was almost perfect; he was handsome, good at acting, and have a strong sense of business ability. But he just doesn\u2019t have any relationship experience. When he finally encountered someone he likes, the person he likes wasn\u2019t someone he could like. This had nothing to do with their respective status and fame in the entertainment industry, but because of the person behind Su Yaya!For this reason, sister Wu had to warn Yan Junyi that no matter how much he likes Su Yaya, he now had to keep a distance from her. Su Yaya wasn\u2019t someone he could like.Unless\u2026Sister Wu quickly shook her head, throwing those thoughts out of her mind. Now that Su Yaya was following President Chen, they can\u2019t afford to mess with her. In the future, when Su Yaya isn\u2019t following President Chen anymore, she would be unworthy of Yan Junyi. Yan Junyi deserved better.Yan Junyi understand that sister Wu wanted to keep him away for Su Yaya for his own good. He paused for a moment before he nodded his head and said, \u201cI understand.\u201dThe flow of the internet had changed, the comments that needed to be deleted were deleted, the accounts that needed to be banned were banned, and the hot searches has been withdrawn. The key figures in the issue had all issued a clarifying statement. Even if there were more negative comments such as, \u201cthe more you delete delete, the more guiltier you are\u201d, they would be immediately suppressed by the Chen Xiuqi\u2019s people. They would also scold the person who left the message until they shut up completely.Taking this opportunity, Xinghui Entertainment also stepped forward and issued a statement, reserving all legal rights to sue those who slander Su Yaya.Su Yaya stayed by Chen Xiuqi\u2019s side throughout all of this. She couldn\u2019t go anywhere and her phone was confiscated by Chen Xiuqi. She didn\u2019t know that the public opinion on the internet had changed, and that everything was moving towards a good direction.Assistant Chen knocked on the door and came in. He saw Su Yaya sitting on the sofa holding a pencil and paper; he didn\u2019t know she was writing. With her present, some words were difficult for him to say.Chen Xiuqi moved his gaze from the computer to him, his face was expressionless. He wasn\u2019t very satisfied with his performance today, he asked with a calm face, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThese are the materials we had obtained after the investigation. Please take a look.\u201d Assistant Chen handed the information over to Chen Xiuqi.Chen Xiuqi flipped through the information, which revealed how An Yuting had contacted a group of people to pour dirty water on Su Yaya. The evidence was clear and concise from the beginning to the end.In fact, right after Chen Xiuqi learned that someone was pouring dirty water at Su Yaya on the internet, he had already guessed that it was An Yuting. He just didn\u2019t have evidence at that time. Now that the facts and evidence were in front of him, Chen Xiuqi was really disappointed.The obedient little girl that used to follow him around, calling him big brother Xiuqi, had become such a scary person now!Chen Xiuqi was too lazy to read through all the information, directly handing the material back to Assistant Chen. He said with a cold expression on his face, \u201cDeal with it like how you should. Since she wants to steal someone else\u2019s role, let her go home and stay home so that she won\u2019t stir up any trouble again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Assistant Chen was a little confused, did that meant that he wanted to block An Yuting\u2019s path?Although other outsiders may not know about this, Assistant Chen knew about the relationship between An Yuting and Chen Xiuqi. Chen Xiuqi and the two sisters, An Yutong and An Yuting had known each other for many years. Even without mentioning An Yutong, Chen Xiuqi had taken care of An Yuting in the past. He had given An Yuting a lot of good resources before, but now, he was planning to block all her resources?He couldn\u2019t see where this was going.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Assistant Chen turned his head to look and saw that Su Yaya had just finished drawing. She stood up and with a cup in her head, she headed towards the water dispenser to get water.Su Yaya has a good figure and white glowing complexion. The length of the dress she wore was just a little above the knee, exposing her slender, fair, long, and straight legs. She wore a pair of nude colored high-heels that seemed to have a lengthening effect on her legs, making people feel like her legs are very long while giving off a fairy-like feeling.She took the cup of water and drank slowly from it. Su Yaya\u2019s long eyelashes were thick and dense, and it naturally curled itself at night. It left a shadow below her eyelid when she blinks, just like a small fan.Assistant Chen suddenly understood. There was such a beautiful woman like Su Yaya here, and no man would be willing to let her feel wronged. An Yuting had harmed Su Yaya and since President Chen wanted to protect Su Yaya, An Yuting was bound to be unlucky.En, he needed to be a little smarter in the future, so that he won\u2019t make anymore mistakes.\u201cI\u2019ll work on it immediately.\u201d Assistant Chen turned around and left.After Su Yaya finished drinking water, she walked back to the sofa and sat down. She picked up the pencil and continued to draw.When Chen Xiuqi finished his work, he walked over to look at what she was drawing.There was green mountains, white clouds, crystal-clear water, and a small courtyard on the A4 paper. There was a pond full of fish in front of the courtyard and several ducks were swimming on top of the water. The painting revealed a carefree and relaxed mood. Just by looking at the painting, it made people feel comfortable and relaxed. The people living there must feel cozy and satisfied.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you know how to paint,\u201d Chen Xiuqi said with a smile.Su Yaya was startled by his sudden comment and quickly tried to put her painting away, \u201cI\u2019m just drawing things casually.\u201dChen Xiuqi reached out his hands and stopped her from putting her painting away. He pointed at the painting and said, \u201cYou\u2019re able to produce such a beautiful pieces just from casually painting. Doesn\u2019t that mean that you can open an art exhibition if you\u2019re painting seriously?\u201d\u201cWell, I was just bored so I doodled something casually, it\u2019s not as good as you said. Okay, stop praising me. If you continue to praise me, I\u2019ll become too arrogant.\u201d Su Yaya grinned as she observed the expression on Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face, seeing that he didn\u2019t overthink about her painting, she quickly put her painting away. She inwardly muttered at herself, she was so bored that her brain stopped functioning and painted such a painting in Chen Xiuqi\u2019s office. See? Now that he saw it, she prayed that he doesn\u2019t discover anything off.Fortunately, Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t ask her anything else regarding the painting; Su Yaya was relieved.\u201cI\u2019ve finished my work for the day so I can go home early today.\u201d Chen Xiuqi pulled her hand and began playing with her fairy and slender fingers, \u201cIt will be the weekends in two days and I will be free by that time. Is there anywhere you want to go?\u201d\u201cThe weekends?\u201d Su Yaya promptly counted the time using her fingers. After she determined her schedule for weekend, she bitterly said, \u201cI have to shoot an advertisement on Saturday, so I don\u2019t think I can go.\u201dWhen Chen Xiuqi heard that, he sighed in his heart. When he saw her painting of green mountains, white clouds, crystal-clear water, and a courtyard, he thought that she wanted to go to the suburbs to relax since she had been in the city for a long time.He was usually busy with his work. When he is free, he will choose to spend his vacation in a villa in the suburbs for a few days to relax.He originally planned to take Su Yaya to the suburbs for the weekend. After all, he wanted to make it up to her after she had suffered such a big grievance. But who would\u2019ve thought that she needed to shoot an advertisement? Was shooting an advertisement more important than spending time with him?The author has something to say: The third update should be posted at 11pm or earlier.Chen Xiuqi: Was shooting an advertisement more important than spending them with him!?Su Yaya: Earning money is more important, heehee!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chen Xiuqi knew about it, yet he still rolled in the bed sheet with her the night before. She was tossed around by Chen Xiuqi for most of the night until she finally begged him for mercy. Chen Xiuqi said that he wanted to eat the porridge and steamed bun she makes, and wouldn\u2019t have let her go unless she agreed. Su Yaya was about to cry to death. Her desire to live too strong, she immediately agreed to the unequal compromise proposed by Chen Xiuqi while crying.In the morning, Su Yaya was still asleep when she was woken up by Chen Xiuqi. The overlord ordered, \u201cHurry up and make me porridge and steam some xiaolongbao.\u201d\u201cStop it, let me sleep for another five minutes,\u201d Su Yaya muttered. Su Yaya still haven\u2019t woken up yet; she turned to the other side and was about to continue to sleep.Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t give her a chance to do that, he reached out his hand and pulled her up from the bed. He said in an unkind tone, \u201cGo cook, you promised.\u201dThis time, Su Yaya was unable to sleep, she opened her eyes and was faced with Chen Xiuqi\u2019s extremely handsome but angry face. Even though he had a handsome face and sharp eyes, Su Yaya could see a trace of grievance from his sharp eyes.Su Yaya\u2019s heart suddenly jumped, she raised her hand and grabbed a handful of her beautiful dark hair. How bothersome! She wanted to get angry. Chen Xiuqi was pretending to pitiful in front of her! She was the pitiful one here, okay? She didn\u2019t even sleep enough, yet she still had to get up to make him porridge and steam some xiaolongbao for him. He really was a natural businessman!\u201cYou promised,\u201d Chen Xiuqi repeated as he stared at her. He was acting just like a child throwing a tantrum because they want candy.Ahhh! This guy was being too much!Su Yaya can\u2019t stand him anymore. Besides pretending that he had been wrong, he also knew how to throw a tantrum!She secretly roasted him, but she didn\u2019t dare to show it on her face. Su Yaya was terrified, who told Chen Xiuqi to be the male lead, the one person she can never offend? While she was the cannon fodder, so she could on fawn over him and try to please him the best she could.Su Yaya accepted her fate, got up from the bed, and felt her way to the bathroom. When she squeezed the toothpaste on the toothbrush, she almost didn\u2019t squeeze the toothpaste on the toothbrush. It was the person next to her who had held her hand and helped her squeeze the toothpaste on the toothbrush.She brushed her teeth with the toothbrush for a while before she finally snapped awake and turned to look at Chen Xiuqi who was standing next to her. She asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dChen Xiuqi crossed his arms in front of his chest and raised his eyebrows while looking at her, \u201cI saw that someone hasn\u2019t completely woken up yet. So I kindly followed her to the bathroom to make sure she doesn\u2019t fall into the toilet.\u201dSu Yaya, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe\u2019s being too much, too much!Wasn\u2019t it all his fault that she hadn\u2019t completely woken up yet? So why does he act so confident and righteous when he said that? Ahhh!\u201cDon\u2019t gnash your teeth, that expression is too ugly!\u201d Chen Xiuqi walked over and cupped her face in his hands, letting her see herself in the mirror.The woman in the mirror had red lips, white teeth, creamy skin, youthful, and a pair of charming eyes. She appeared to have been fiercely loved.Su Yaya looked at herself and couldn\u2019t help but become narcissistic. Which part of her was ugly? She was clearly very beautiful, very very beautiful, more beautiful than most people! She was about to die from her own beauty!Chen Xiuqi urged her, \u201cI\u2019m hungry, hurry up.\u201dSu Yaya pursed her lips and continued to wash her face and putting on her skincare products slowly, making sure every part of her face was thoroughly protected.When Chen Xiuqi saw that she was still dilly dallying, he moved close to her and whispered in her ear, \u201cDo you still want resources?\u201dUpon hearing that, Su Yaya immediately nodded her head and said, \u201cI want, I want!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The resources that Chen Xiuqi have are very good. It will be very advantageous for her if she gets her hand on them.Chen Xiuqi chuckled lightly and pinched her cheek, \u201cIf you want, then hurry up and cook for me. Afterall, you promised me you would.\u201dSu Yaya didn\u2019t dare to slack off anymore. She quickly finished her skincare routine and ran to the kitchen to make porridge.Porridge was simple to make; wash the rice, boil some hot water in a pot, put the rice into the pot of water once the water comes to a boil, and use small fire to boil it slowly. In addition, steaming xiaolongbao was pretty easy too. The morning before, Su Yaya had already made some xiaolongbao at home, so there were a dozen or so still left in the freezer. She just needed to take it out and steam it until its fully cooked.In a short while, the porridge and xiaolongbao were both done. Su Yaya picked the bowl of porridge, put the xiaolongbao on a plate, and took the two items out to the table. Chen Xiuqi was already sitting there, waiting to eat.The reason Chen Xiuqi wanted to eat Su Yaya\u2019s xiaolongbao was because he had eaten the xiaolongbao Su Yaya made the day before. He couldn\u2019t take his mind off the delicious xiaolongbao afterwards.Su Yaya had only eaten four xiaolongbao, while Chen Xiuqi ate the remaining eight and drank a bowl of porridge.Su Yaya raised her head and looked at him. Was he going to go to the gym and run for two hours again?After having breakfast, Su Yaya tidied everything up and told Chen Xiuqi that she was heading out. She needed to shoot the advertisement for K Group\u2019s couple watch.Zhou Peiyun took Su Yaya to the shooting site, the staff at the site were still busy preparing for the shoot. Zhou Peiyun took Su Yaya to greet Director Qu Jing and the representatives of the K Group first, only to find out that Yan Junyi\u2019s place was arriving late and was still on its way.\u201cThen let\u2019s wait.\u201d Zhou Peiyun smiled and said, \u201cYaya can go and apply her makeup.\u201dSu Yaya went to the dressing room to apply her makeup, and just when she finished applying makeup, she saw Yan Junyi and his party arrived. Yan Junyi\u2019s agent, sister Wu greeted everyone. She said with a smile, \u201cI apologize for being late. The plane arrived late, Little Yan will invite everyone out for coffee later.\u201d\u201cBrother Yan is too polite,\u201d the staff member said with a smile.\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s out of your control that your plane is late!\u201d another staff member said.\u201cBrother Yan, this way. I will take you to the dressing room to apply makeup.\u201d A staff member led Yan Junyi to the dressing room to put on makeup. As soon as he looked up, he saw Su Yaya standing next to him.Su Yaya had already applied her makeup. The corners of her mouth curved into a beautiful smile as she smiled at her, her brilliant eyes were captivating.\u201cBrother Yan,\u201d she called him sweetly, it was just like how she had called him when they were still children.Yan Junyi blankly stared at her, his eyes fell on her smiling face. Her smile was just as charming and beautiful as it was when they were young, his heart couldn\u2019t help but flutter when he saw it. He was just about to say something when sister Wu came over and pulled on his arm, \u201cLittle Yan, why aren\u2019t you applying your makeup yet? It\u2019s getting late.\u201dAfter he heard sister Wu\u2019s words, Yan Junyi recalled what sister Wu had warned him about a few days ago. He could only suppress his throbbing heart and gave Su Yaya a slight nod. He followed the staff to put on his makeup.Su Yaya stood still in place, even if she was slow to react, she was still able to distinguish that Yan Junyi\u2019s attitude towards her was abnormal today.Wasn\u2019t he just fine a few days ago? At that time, he was very friendly towards her. Why did it seem like he had completely turned into a different person in just a few days?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her eyes followed the direction Yan Junyi had left in when her gaze met sister Wu\u2019s gaze. Even with the distance between the two, Su Yaya noticed the vigilance and rejection in her eyes.Su Yaya, \u201c???\u201dWas she that scary? She didn\u2019t do anything to Yan Junyi, so why did his agent gave her such a gaze?Fortunately, Su Yaya wasn\u2019t very stupid, she quickly thought of a possibility. Was it because Yan Junyi also had dirty water poured on him because of her?After thinking of it this way, Su Yaya felt that that was very likely the reason his attitude towards her had changed so drastically! Although Chen Xiuqi intervened in the incident and solved it perfectly, Yan Junyi had also sent a clarifying statement on Weibo to clarify their relationship. However, Yan Junyi was also scolded by many people because of the incident, so the rumour must\u2019ve affected him too. Sister Wu must still be worried that she will implicate Yan Junyi again. After all, Yan Junyi was a popular actor and countless eyes would be watching over his every move. He can\u2019t have anymore bad rumours with her, so it was reasonable that sister Wu was full or precaution and vigilance against her.After thinking about the cause of this, Su Yaya doesn\u2019t blame Yan Junyi\u2019s abnormal attitude towards her. After all, the two of them have different identities and Yan Junyi needed to avoid suspicion because of his job. If that\u2019s the case, she will try to keep a distance from Yan Junyi too, Su Yaya thought.Perhaps because both of them wanted to keep a distance from each other, things become awkward when they were shooting the advertisement.Director Qu Jing was annoyed and began scolding them, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you two? You\u2019re suppose to act like couples, do you know? When a couple looks at each other, their eyes must be full of love? Neither of you did that! When the two of you looked at each other, it looked like you just saw your next door neighbor! If I want to shoot something like that, then why did I have to do all this? Please understand that we are shooting an advertisement for a couple watch. The scene needs to be full of sweetness, even the air must feel sweet. I don\u2019t want a lifeless and dull expression, okay?\u201d\u201cDirector, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t have a good rest yesterday, so I\u2019m not feeling too well, so it affected the shooting. I will adjust it right away, it won\u2019t happen again when we shoot later.\u201d Yan Junyi took the initiative to apologize and took on all the responsibilities on himself. He apologized sincerely and promised that he would be serious about the shooting later so that he won\u2019t make such a mistake again.Seeing Yan Junyi apologizing, Su Yaya quickly apologized to the director too, \u201cDirector, I\u2019m sorry. I will also adjust my emotions later and work hard.\u201dDirector Qu Jing\u2019s anger was reduced after having already scolded him and after Yan Junyi apologized. Seeing Su Yaya\u2019s obedient and well behaved appearance, he didn\u2019t scold her again. He waved his hands and said, \u201cThe two of you can rest for two mintues. In two minutes, we will start shooting again.\u201dSu Yaya and Yan Junyi glanced at each other, but neither of them said anything to each other. They went to rest in their own respective area and adjusted their emotions for the shooting.Two minutes soon passed, Su Yaya and Yan Junyi returned to the set to continue shooting. This time, the two finally behaved normally. They brought out each other\u2019s highest acting skills. Their eyes were full of spirit and love when they looked at each other. It was as if they were really a couple in love. The shooting went smoothly after this.Chen Xiuqi had came here secretly, he didn\u2019t inform anyone when he arrived. He quietly took Assistant Chen through the back door. He was just in time to see the scene where Yan Junyi gifted the couple\u2019s watch to Su Yaya, the two of them hugged and kissed.Chen Xiuqi glared at the two people who had just hugged and kissed each other. The corners of his mouth turned downward and he muttered in dissatisfaction, \u201cAren\u2019t they just shooting an advertisement? Why do you need to kiss when you shoot an advertisement? What kind of useless advertisement is this?\u201dThe author has something to say:Chen Xiuqi: When we go back, I need to get my profit back!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Assistant Chen had no choice but to follow along when he heard Chen Xiuqi say displeased, \u201cIsn\u2019t she just filming a watch ad? Why must there be extra things in the ad? What\u2019s this stupid ad? Don\u2019t let her film things of this sort in the future.\u201dAssistant Chen silently followed behind him while listening. He tried to minimize his presence, trying to avoid setting fire to himself.Right now, it was clear Chen Xiuqi was unhappy. After murmuring this, he felt a ball of fire burning in his heart. He turned to look at Assistant Chen and knitted his eyebrows, asking, \u201cWhy did she choose to film an ad like this?\u201dAssistant Chen was helpless. Who was he supposed to ask?Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t expect a response from him either. He turned around and walked back with a gloomy face, sitting in the car parked outside the film studio.Assistant Chen stared at his silhouette emitting a cold aura and endured the freezing atmosphere around him. After summer, came winter. He wanted to wear extra clothes!\u201cPresident Chen, where are we going now?\u201d The driver, Uncle Zhong, detected how unhappy Chen Xiuqi was. Yet, he braced himself and asked. After all, it was his responsibility.Chen Xiuqi said expressionlessly and coldly, \u201cThe company.\u201dUncle Zhong hurriedly said ok and started the car, making a U-turn and driving him to the company.\u2026In the film studio, no one knew Chen Xiuqi had gone there. Everyone was focused with their work, up until the couple\u2019s watch ad was finished filming.Su Yaya and Yan Junyi\u2019s photoshoots were very successful. Besides being scolded by Director Qu for their bad cooperation at the beginning, the two quickly adjusted themselves and had precise acting skills. They quickly immersed themselves in this photoshoot and completed the filming of the couple\u2019s watch ad according to Director Qu\u2019s requirements.Su Yaya and Yan Junyi sighed after it was completed. They thanked the staff for their work and there was a harmonious atmosphere.Su Yaya and Junyi went back to the makeup room, to remove their makeup. There was no one in the hallway so Su Yaya took the chance to say to Yan Junyi, \u201cThank you for helping me out on Weibo the other day.\u201dThe day of the incident, Chen Xiuqi had taken Su Yaya\u2019s phone away. She wasn\u2019t clear what happened online until later on when she realized that Yan Junyi had cleared the situation for her. However, that was the second day after it happened.Thankfully, before this, Zhou Peiyun helped her forward Yan Junyi\u2019s Weibo and give a clear reply. She addressed Yan Junyi as her good neighbor and posted a cute picture of them. It gave her a favorable impression amongst the users.When the fans saw this on Weibo, they all bumped #best neighbor, #mine is brother Yan and titles like that.There were others commenting how the most handsome Brother Yan and most beautiful Yaya were neighbors and wondering why they didn\u2019t have neighbors like them. This evoked a round of laughter amongst the users. They were extremely ecstatic and it was a humorous atmosphere.Of course, occasionally, there would be a negative comment. But it would quickly be suppressed by fans who liked Su Yaya and Yan Junyi. They maintained the peace and happiness under their Weibos.Seeing her Weibo, Su Yaya was grateful for Yan Junyi for helping her out. She clearly knew how horrifying cyber bullying was. It would be incredibly easy to suppress an online celebrity like her. Yan Junyi\u2019s Weibo which had clarified the situation for her was extremely helpful. She wanted to thank him right then and immediately called him. However, he didn\u2019t have service where he was. Su Yaya thought that perhaps he was busy when it didn\u2019t go through. But the two would\u2019ve been able to see each other when they were filming this ad anyway so it didn\u2019t matter. It would be better if she thanked him in person anyways. That way it seemed more sincere.Originally, Su Yaya had it all planned out. She was going to thank him when she saw him. Who knew that when she finished applying makeup, his manager, Sister Wu, had pulled him away before she could even say anything to him. Plus, Sister Wu looked at her in alarm which placed her in a bad mood. She was unhappy for a while and didn\u2019t recover from this mood until after filming the ad. She felt so awkward that she didn\u2019t know how to cooperate with Yan Junyi. Thankfully, the two were able to adjust their feelings later on and successfully finish filming the ad.Right now, the hallway was empty so Su Yaya had a chance to thank Yan Junyi.Yan Junyi looked at her in a complicated gaze. He recalled his feelings which he clarified when clearing the situation on Weibo the other day. The moment he knew that there were internet water armies, he wanted to speak up for her. It was at that moment when Sister Wu ran over to tell him to quickly clarify their relationship.Initiating the clarification and being forced to clarify are two different matters and feelings. Especially after Sister Wu told him to avoid her because her sugar daddy isn\u2019t someone a small celebrity like him could offend.

Everyday, she was like his tail, calling him \u201cBrother Yan\u201d. His heart would soften hearing this.\u201cBrother Yan, time to go to school!\u201d\u201cBrother Yan, you\u2019re so good at running!\u201d\u201cBrother Yan, you got first place!\u201d\u2026.The cute and well-behaved little girl had grown up now. She was a beautiful and charming woman. She had stopped following him and calling him \u201cBrother Yan\u201d. She was different from before.\u201cIt\u2019s something I should do.\u201d Yan Junyi calmly said.Su Yaya smiled and said, \u201cI need to thank you regardless.\u201dIf he didn\u2019t clarify or speak up for her, his near total of 30,000,000 fans would tear her to pieces and skin her alive.Yan Junyi faintly smiled but it was forced. He wasn\u2019t really happy, instead his heart ached while looking at her. \u201cYaya, do you remember when you scraped your knee when you were nine and bled a lot? You were incredibly frightened, telling me to bring you to the doctor\u2019s as you cried. I carried you to the infirmary and the doctor treated your wound. It stopped bleeding later on but you cried miserably because of the pain. I told you to protect and take care of yourself in the future and not to let yourself be hurt. Otherwise, those who love you will also feel pain if you\u2019re hurt.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes. She was a fake. How could she know if she had said this before? While maintaining a smile, she tried her best to rummage through the remaining memories the original host left. She indeed found a piece of this memory.That time, the original host really injured her knee and Yan Junyi personally carried her to the infirmary. Seeing that she was in a lot of pain, his eyes became teary because he felt bad. He patted her head, saying that he would always protect her in the future and for her to take care and love herself.Hm, it\u2019s quite touching.The two kids stood next to each other. The boy promised to protect the girl. It was such a pure and sincere promise, one that someone would remember their whole life.Su Yaya nodded. \u201cI remember, thank you.\u201dBesides this simple sentence, Su Yaya didn\u2019t know what to say. After all, she wasn\u2019t the original host. She was unable to guess the original host\u2019s feelings and attitude toward Yan Junyi. They haven\u2019t met for so many years. She could only say that she remembered when he suddenly mentioned their childhood. She even thanked him. Nothing could go wrong from this.A glimpse of disappointment flashed by Yan Junyi\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t want to hear this. He hoped that she would show self-love and not go on the wrong path.\u201cYaya, you have to love and not hurt yourself. The entertainment circle is very complicated. I don\u2019t want you to be hurt. You might think this is a shortcut right now but once you remember this in the future, you will regret this.\u201d Yan Junyi felt bad for her and looked deeply, while saying this gloomily.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Su Yaya was confused and with difficulty, tugged a smile on her face. She really had no idea why he had said this. How could she do something to hurt herself? When did she not love herself? She felt that his words were random.Yan Junyi thought she had smiled bitterly and became even more determined with his thoughts. He looked at her in pity and heartache, \u201cYaya, you\u2019re a great girl. Based on your conditions, even if you don\u2019t rely on President Chen and decide not to find a sugar daddy, you can believe in yourself and do better. Stop being with someone like President Chen. He\u2019s not suitable for you. You will be hurt in the future.\u201dWhat?How did he know she would be hurt in the future?Su Yaya blinked her eyes and observed Yan Junyi. He looked at her in concern and pity. Oh, it should be concern and pity for the original host!But she unfortunately couldn\u2019t accept his good intentions!Leaving aside the fact the original host wasn\u2019t here anymore, she didn\u2019t even know if she would return in the future. But right now, she had taken over the body. She and Yan Junyi had only talked twice. At most, they were just acquaintances. It would be inaccurate to say they had deep feelings. She didn\u2019t believe that his feelings for her would be that deep after separating for a decade or so!Plus, she had the title as Lady Chen right now. She and Chen Xiuqi were married (marriage by contract). Chen Xiuqi was the male lead in the original novel. He was a dominant President with powerful means and methods. Right now, she must please him. Even if people had given her courage, she wouldn\u2019t dare to listen to Yan Junyi. Otherwise, she would be an unlucky person if she angered Chen Xiuqi.When she thought of this, Su Yaya calmly said to Yan Junyi, \u201cThank you for your intentions. I know what to do.\u201d\u201cYaya\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be going now.\u201dIgnoring Yan Junyi\u2019s harmful gaze, Su Yaya turned around and left. It seemed like she wanted to escape him, running off.Yan Junyi glanced at her quickly fading silhouette and murmured, \u201cYaya\u2026\u201dSu Yaya rapidly ran away. She walked to the makeup room and walked in. She looked up to see Chen Xiuqi sitting inside. She gasped in fright.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - Unexpected Visitor (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.75 Unexpected Visitor (1)Su Yaya would never have thought they would see Chen Xiuqi the moment she opened the door. Her heart thumped rapidly from the fright. He expressionlessly sat on a seat and coldly glanced at her.\u201cPresident Chen, why are you here?\u201d Su Yaya was a bit stiff. Recalling the words Yan Junyi had said, she had no idea what Chen Xiuqi had heard or not heard. She couldn\u2019t help but be a bit guilty.Although she didn\u2019t agree to Yan Junyi\u2019s request, what he had said about Chen Xiuqi was quite offending. With Chen Xiuqi\u2019s attitude, if he knew that Yan Junyi had talked behind his back, it would be tragic for Yan Junyi. She, who was looked after by Yan Junyi, would definitely be unable to get away with this too.It was scarier the more she thought about it!Su Yaya\u2019s heart was trembling. Hopefully, Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t know what Yan Junyi had said to her.Chen Xiuqi looked up to observe Su Yaya. Seeing that she was standing by the door and stunned, she was clearly surprised by his sudden appearance.As it turned out, after Chen Xiuqi left, he was on his way to the company when he suddenly thought of something and he had Uncle Zhong make a U-turn to come back here.Wasn\u2019t she just filming an ad? Wasn\u2019t the kiss just for the ad? There were numerous actors who had to film sex scenes for movies and TV shows! She just had to kiss for the ad. It wasn\u2019t a big deal. If he left angrily, it made him look too stingy. This was no big deal. She was just doing this for her work. Why would he be angry over this? Go back!He immediately had Uncle Zhong drive back here. He had the envision that Su Yaya would\u2019ve been incredibly happy to see him visiting her. She would\u2019ve thrown herself in his arms and rub her face against his chest, like a little kitten. When he thought of this, he was in a great mood.But right now, he only saw shock on Su Yaya\u2019s face and no happiness at all. This was a little different from what he expected. He originally thought that she would\u2019ve been ecstatic to see him visiting her, like usual. She would be well-behaved and try to please him.Yet, expectations were different from reality. Chen Xiuqi who was originally unhappy became even more unhappy. He motioned for Su Yaya to come over with a cold face. \u201cCome over. Why are you standing so far away? I won\u2019t eat you!\u201dBut she was scared that he would!Su Yaya replied in her heart but didn\u2019t dare not to go over. She tried to adjust the expression on her face, making herself look more natural. No matter what, she should go and please Chen Xiuqi right now and make him happy. There would be nothing wrong if she did that.Su Yaya made her decision and walked over in calm strides. She transformed into a happy bird, pouncing on him. She smiled splendidly at him. She didn\u2019t care whether Chen Xiuqi would agree or not but she held onto his arm with her two hands. She tightly pressed her body against his arm and said with a surprised and sweet tone, \u201cPresident Chen, why are you here? Did you come here to specially visit me? When did you come? How come I didn\u2019t know? Have you been waiting for a long time? Oh my, I\u2019m so happy. I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201dShe was so lost and frightened that she didn\u2019t know what to say. Su Yaya was so nervous that she kept on rambling. She rambled to conceal her emotions.After Chen Xiuqi was hugged by Su Yaya, a special sweet fragrance from Su Yaya entered his nose. He stared at her splendid and bright smile and listened to her rambling. He glanced at her sparkling eyes, bright like diamonds. Who said that she wasn\u2019t shocked? She was clearly shocked right now!\u201cI have been here for a while.\u201d Chen Xiuqi stroked her hair, clearly in a good mood. He was affectionate with her unlike before when he looked at her indifferently.Su Yaya clearly felt Chen Xiuqi\u2019s change of attitude. This was right. It was correct for her to please Chen Xiuqi. From this, it seems like he is easy to please. After all, she had exerted more than 100% of her acting skills. Heheh. She finally calmed her nervous heart down.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you were visiting?\u201d Su Yaya asked as she continued to act cute.Chen Xiuqi stroked her hair again and said, \u201cIt\u2019s the same if I\u2019m waiting here for you.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes and an idea formulated in her mind. She kissed Chen Xiuqi and smiled as she said, \u201cPresident Chen, you\u2019re the best.\u201dChen Xiuqi put a faint smile on his face. He was really happy on the inside, despite not showing it. He faintly said, \u201cIs it fun to film ads?\u201dSu Yaya pondered over this. She realized that Chen Xiuqi was a bit dangerous right now. Whether she responded with yes or no, it didn\u2019t matter, it wouldn\u2019t be a good answer. Therefore, she decided not to answer his question. She replied with her own thoughts, \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as having fun or not. I\u2019m just doing this for work.\u201dShe filmed ads for work. She went to work to earn money. Once she has money, she could do whatever she wanted. There was no problem with this logic!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, it was work. It was the same as him playing along with someone to discuss business. He wasn\u2019t as unpleased about Su Yaya and Yan Junyi kissing anymore.\u201cQuickly pack up so we can go home.\u201d Chen Xiuqi patted Su Yaya and untangled her from himself. He rushed her to remove her makeup.Su Yaya said wittily, \u201cWait a while for me.\u201dChen Xiuqi lifted his right hand to look at the time on the watch. He said expressionlessly, \u201cI\u2019m only giving you ten minutes.\u201dIt felt like he would be leaving her here if she didn\u2019t come out in ten minutes.Would he be that heartless?Su Yaya felt like Chen Xiuqi wouldn\u2019t be that harsh but her instincts told her that there was nothing a dominant President like Chen Xiuqi wouldn\u2019t do. He was harsher than anyone else. She, a cannon fodder, wouldn\u2019t dare to challenge him.\u201cI will be done instantly.\u201d Su Yaya quickly walked over to the makeup table to remove her makeup.Chen Xiuqi stood behind her. Su Yaya saw him looking at the time on his watch every now and then in the reflection of the mirror. It seemed like he was giving her a countdown. Would he really walk off after ten minutes?This thought scared Su Yaya. She hurriedly wiped makeup remover on her face and almost accidentally wiped it in her eyes. She was even more anxious than going on a battlefield. When she finished her last step, she looked at the time and laughed.\u00a0Haha.\u00a0Thankfully, it was only nine minutes and ten seconds, it hadn\u2019t been ten minutes yet.\u201cI\u2019m done. We can go now.\u201d Su Yaya held onto Chen Xiuqi\u2019s arm and smiled. Her beautiful eyes were like the crescent of the moon. She was sweet and adorable.Chen Xiuqi pinched her face. It was smooth and soft. He smiled and wrapped his arms around her waist. He said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThe two walked out the makeup room and even met Yan Junyi who was still standing in the hallway. His head was down and he leaned against the wall. He held a cigarette between his fingers and there were sparks jumping. Hearing the sound of the makeup room opening, he suddenly looked over to see Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi walking out together.Yan Junyi stood up straight and his gaze was on Su Yaya. He revealed a look of pity on his handsome face, wanting to say something but he didn\u2019t in the end.The moment Su Yaya saw his gaze, alarms rang in her heart. She was scared that he might say something bad under impulse in front of Chen Xiuqi. After all, he was just a side character in the original book who barely had any lines. The dominant President, Chen Xiuqi, could easily make him miserable. Out of personal feelings, she didn\u2019t want to drag him down. She wanted him to peacefully live his life in the entertainment circle. She blinked her eyes at him anxiously and so quickly that there was almost a whiplash in her eyes.Thankfully, Yan Junyi understood her. Seeing that she blinked her eyes at him, he knew what she was thinking. She didn\u2019t want him to be involved in her matters.He secretly sighed and didn\u2019t say anything that would affect Su Yaya. He calmly said, \u201cGoodbye.\u201dGoodbye. That meant that they would only see each other again if it was fated.In the future, Su Yaya only thought of avoiding him. Her heart was really weak and couldn\u2019t endure being frightened day and night.\u201cGoodbye.\u201d Su Yaya didn\u2019t say this with as much emotions as Yan Junyi did. She quickly said that and walked off with Chen Xiuqi.On the way to the car, Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t say anything either. When they got in the car, Chen Xiuqi indicated for Uncle Zhong to raise the partition between them. Then he turned around to look at Su Yaya, asking, \u201cWhat exactly is going on between you and him?\u201dSu Yaya knew that he was referring to Yan Junyi. Although he didn\u2019t say anything he wasn\u2019t supposed to, his emotions were clearly shown on his face. How could a smart person like Chen Xiuqi not be able to tell?\u201cWhat could happen between me and him?\u201d Su Yaya forced a smile and said, \u201cWe were neighbors in our childhood and haven\u2019t seen each other for many years. We don\u2019t normally contact each other either. I was just a bit shocked when I heard we were actually going to collaborate together.\u201dChen Xiuqi glanced at her and smiled. \u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d Su Yaya quickly responded and looked innocently at Chen Xiuqi.\u00a0Looking at her innocent gaze, would he think that she was lying? Of course not! Heheh!Chen Xiuqi tugged a smile on his face, accepting her response.They were on their way home and the journey was peaceful. Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t probe about the matters regarding Yan Junyi. Su Yaya slightly sighed.When they returned home, Chen Xiuqi leaned against the sofa and said to Su Yaya, \u201cGo cook.\u201dSu Yaya hummed in agreement and tried to please him. \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201dChen Xiuqi said, \u201csweet and sour fish, sweet and sour pork chop, sweet and sour Chinese cabbage, sweet and sour eggplant\u2026\u201dSu Yaya couldn\u2019t hold it in and burst into laughter. She pounced on him and bit his lip. \u201cHow can you be so cute?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She said softly, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201dChen Xiuqi kissed her lips and curled his lips into a smile. \u201cI\u2019m hungry too.\u201dSu Yaya softly pounded his chest with her fists. She swayed her slender legs back and forth, acting cute. \u201cI\u2019m being serious.\u201dChen Xiuqi laughed proudly and picked up his phone by the side. \u201cI\u2019ll call someone to send food over.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya smiled sweetly and kissed Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face.Who knew that Chen Xiuqi would suddenly stop dialing the phone number. He then turned to look at Su Yaya and said meaningfully, \u201cI actually want to eat food cooked by you.\u201dSu Yaya said \u201cok\u201d and smiled. \u201cYou want to eat vinegar?\u201d(T/N: to \u2018eat vinegar\u2019 in Chinese can also mean to be \u2018jealous\u2019)Heh. The audacity of her. She dared to make fun of him?Chen Xiuqi pinched her cheeks and said, \u201cI want to eat something sweet!\u201dHeh. She\u2019d be dumb to believe him.Did he think that she didn\u2019t see his gloomy face from before? It was black like the bottom of the pot.In the past, she thought that he liked to act cool. She now knew him as someone childish, he was like a little kid!\u201cThen I want to eat something sweet too!\u201d Su Yaya followed him and looked up. She blinked her bright eyes at him, trying to say that she would do whatever he wanted.He didn\u2019t know what to do with her.Chen Xiuqi rubbed her hair and looked at her in a pampering gaze. \u201cOk.\u201dHeheh\u2026Su Yaya was happy again. She believed that she understood Chen Xiuqi\u2019s attitude now. As long as she tried hard enough to soothe him, with enough acting skills, she would be able to easily comfort him. It wasn\u2019t very hard.Chen Xiuqi looked at Su Yaya who was foolishly laughing. Why did she enjoy to laugh so much? He helplessly sighed and called a number to order food.When dinner was brought over, it was almost an hour later. Once Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi finished their food, they sat on the sofa and watched an entertainment program for a while. Then they returned to the room to rinse and sleep.The next morning, while Su Yaya was still asleep, Chen Xiuqi dug her up from the bed. He pinched Su Yaya\u2019s sleepy face and soothed her. \u201cQuickly wake up. I\u2019m going to take you somewhere fun.\u201dSu Yaya said sleepily, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201dChen Xiuqi patted her face and smiled. \u201cQuickly go rinse and get dressed. You\u2019ll find out once we\u2019re there.\u201dSu Yaya was stunned for a second before she nodded. She got out of bed and dressed herself.After sitting in the car for a while, Su Yaya then noticed that the car was heading to the outskirts. She realized this and asked, \u201cAre we going to the outskirts?\u201dChen Xiuqi patted her head and said, \u201cWe are going to Yunhu Villa.\u201dYunhu Villa was the biggest villa in the capital for vacation. The scenery was picturesque. It was a great place for travel and vacation.Su Yaya reached over to hold onto Chen Xiuqi\u2019s arms. She leaned her chin on his shoulder and looked up to say, \u201cI haven\u2019t been there before but I\u2019ve heard people say it was very fun.\u201dChen Xiuqi said calmly, \u201cYou\u2019ll find out for yourself after going there.\u201dIn the past, he had been there multiple times but didn\u2019t think it was that much fun. But seeing how happy Su Yaya was, he didn\u2019t expose this. He wanted her to see for herself.The car quickly arrived at Yunhu Villa. Because he had contacted them earlier on, when they arrived, the manager came to welcome them. He indicated that everything was arranged for them.Su Yaya wanted to stroll around in the villa and Chen Xiuqi offered to accompany her. The two followed the interesting and appealing corridor. The two walked to the back of the villa and she looked over to see a huge lake. It was a deep lake and fish were raised there. There were some tools for fishing at the shore.\u201cWow, we can even fish here.\u201d Su Yaya couldn\u2019t hold in the urge to fish when she saw this. She ran over to pick up a fishing rod. She turned to say to Chen Xiuqi, \u201cLet\u2019s fish.\u201dChen Xiuqi didn\u2019t reject this either. He walked towards Su Yaya and she hurriedly helped him pick a fishing rod. \u201cTake this one and I will take this one.\u201dAfter picking the fishing rod, Su Yaya found a bucket to put the fish in. She placed the fish food in the bucket and looked at her surroundings. She chose a spot that was diagonal from where she was then told Chen Xiuqi that she was going to fish there. She picked up the fishing rod, bucket, and a small camping chair, then ran over.Chen Xiuqi watched as she chose her place to sit and placed the fishing rod down. The bucket was next to her and she opened the camping chair and placed it down. She hooked the fish food on the fishing rod and then pretended to fish.It\u2019d be bizarre if she was able to fish like this!After seeing her actions, Chen Xiuqi silently commented in his heart.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you coming over to fish?\u201d Seeing that Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t move from his spot, she hollered at him.The bystanders who looked over watched as Chen Xiuqi who wore a suit held a fishing rod. They couldn\u2019t help but think it was a bit strange. Chen Xiuqi felt awkward too. He picked up the fishing rod and walked to the ride. He decided not to fish next to Su Yaya so he wouldn\u2019t be influenced by her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Like A Child (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.78 Like A Child (2)So, Chen Xiuqi found a spot far from Su Yaya. They were directly across from each other.Chen Xiuqi made his preparations for fishing then silently sat there, waiting for the fish to take the bait.Su Yaya who was across suddenly yelled. \u201cOh my god! I got it! I got it!\u201dThe loud voice echoed across the entire lake. He watched as she screamed while frantically pulling the fishing line up. She was so anxious and busy that Chen Xiuqi was worried she might fall into the lake accidentally. He wanted to walk over and help her but then she actually tugged the fish up.Su Yaya took the fish off the fishing hook and compared it to her hand. It was the size of half the length of her palm. She broke into a smile and cupped the fish with her hands. She proudly called Chen Xiuqi who was across and said, \u201cPresident Chen, look. I got a big fish!\u201dChen Xiuqi wanted to cover his face. He shouldn\u2019t have brought her here too. He turned around and pretended he didn\u2019t know her, silently continuing to fish.Su Yaya was so happy that she didn\u2019t notice anything strange. She happily placed the fish in the bucket and continued to fish for the next one.Chen Xiuqi thought that she must be settling down now.Who knew that not even ten minutes in, Su Yaya started to cheer again. \u201cAhhh, I got another fish!\u201dChen Xiuqi looked at his unmoving fish float. These fish aren\u2019t giving him face. He was a bit angry!Su Yaya who was on the other side placed the second fish in her bucket. She suddenly remembered how Chen Xiuqi said nothing. She stood up and asked, \u201cPresident Chen, did you get any fish?\u201dChen Xiuqi had a gloomy face, not wanting to answer her.Su Yaya got no response. She thought that he hadn\u2019t heard her so she asked again, \u201cPresident Chen, did you get any fish?\u201dHe disliked her asking him again and again. He was irritated!Chen Xiuqi said coldly, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cHahah\u2026\u201d Su Yaya proudly laughed. \u201cI got two. You have to try harder!\u201dChen Xiuqi\u2019s face was unwell and he harshly said, \u201cWait for it.\u201dSu Yaya giggled and her eyes were crescent-like. She was waiting for him.Then, a strange scene appeared by the lake.On Su Yaya\u2019s side, she would cheer every now and then. She got another fish! It was a huge one! Hahaha!On Chen Xiuqi\u2019s side, however, it had been silent, strangely silent. From the beginning to now, he had not gotten a single fish.Damn. This stupid place is cursed!Once Su Yaya got another fish, Chen Xiuqi threw the fishing rod to the side. He couldn\u2019t get a single fish and compared to the number of fish Su Yaya got, he was losing his face. Can he choose not to fish anymore? The next day, he will have someone purchase this stupid villa. He didn\u2019t believe in this curse!\u201cPresident Chen, President Chen, wait for me!\u201d Su Yaya watched as Chen Xiuqi threw the fishing rod. Seeing that he got no fish, he must\u2019ve been angry. She hurriedly placed her fishing rod and chased after him. She wanted to hold onto Chen Xiuqi\u2019s arm but he avoided her. Su Yaya wasn\u2019t discouraged either. She tried again and this time, Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t dodge his touch. He allowed her.Sigh. This man would be angry from not being able to get a fish. He acts like a child!Su Yaya roasted him in her heart. She held onto his arm and said, \u201cPresident Chen, where are we going to play now?\u201dChen Xiuqi said, \u201cNowhere.\u201dHe was in no mood to play. He tragically lost in front of who he believes to be a newbie. He got no fish at all. He didn\u2019t want to lose his face!Su Yaya glanced at Chen Xiuqi. He was angry at not getting a fish! Did he think that he was losing face because he lost to her?This was indeed the truth. Su Yaya really understood Chen Xiuqi.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go play golf?\u201d This was a sport played by the rich. Chen Xiuqi was great at it and she had never played before. Chen Xiuqi should be very pleased.He looked at her and before he could say anything, she tugged his shoulders. \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. I haven\u2019t played this before. You can teach me!\u201dWith Su Yaya trying to act cute and pleasing him, Chen Xiuqi also wanted to regain his good image. He had lost tragically before and now, he should do something he was good at. He wanted to let Su Yaya see what he was capable of.Therefore, Chen Xiuqi reluctantly agreed to bring her to the golf course to play after Su Yaya\u2019s begging.Chen Xiuqi had changed into sportswear while Su Yaya changed her dress into a T-shirt and sports skirt. She revealed her long and smooth legs. She wore white sneakers and a sunhat. It made her look youthful and full of vigor.\u201cAm I beautiful?\u201d Su Yaya ran over to him and spun in a circle. The hem of the skirt slid up a bit. She was pure and cute.Chen Xiuqi\u2019s eyes swept over her legs and said, \u201cBeautiful.\u201dSu Yaya immediately smiled. \u201cPresident Chen, you have good taste.\u201dTrying to seduce him?Uniform temptation?He could try this at home!Su Yaya detected his passionate and burning gaze. She hurriedly placed away her thoughts of teasing him. She hurriedly said, \u201cPresident Chen, teach me how to play.\u201dChen Xiuqi coughed and shifted his gaze from her. \u201cCome over and I will teach you.\u201d(T/N Kitty Jiu: haha how can he impress MC when she\u2019s better than him at fishing lol)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Playing Golf (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCh.79 Playing Golf (1)Chen Xiuqi was great at playing golf. Each ball went accurately into a hole. While watching him play, Su Yaya would always cheer when the ball went into the hole. She was an incredibly good cheerleader.\u201cPresident Chen, you have great skills!\u201d\u201cPresident Chen, you\u2019re amazing!\u201d\u201cPresident Chen, you\u2019re awesome!\u201dHe listened to Su Yaya\u2019s gentle and sweet voice. Chen Xiuqi pleasingly smiled, finding some face back.When Chen Xiuqi made another accurate shot and finished, Su Yaya ran over. Sunlight shone on her thin and slender legs and the sports skirt swayed as she ran over. She was like a happy bird running over as she threw herself in his arms. Su Yaya stood on her tippy toes and kissed Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face before complimenting him openly, \u201cPresident Chen, you\u2019re awesome!\u201dChen Xiuqi glanced at her and the corner of his lips curled up. It was unconcealed pride. \u201cThis is nothing. I can be better!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Su Yaya looked at him in admiration, her eyes sparkling and bright.Chen Xiuqi took this chance to hold her and gently bit her earlobe as he lowered his head. His voice seemed to put her under a spell. \u201cWe can try this when we go back to the room. Hm. You can put on some more outfits.\u201dDespite Su Yaya\u2019s shamelessness, her courage to brace herself for this, and her great acting skills, she still couldn\u2019t help but shiver when Chen Xiuqi leaned in her ears and said this, causing his warm breath swept over her ears like feathers. Her cheeks gradually turned red, as if she had put on pink blush.\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying!\u201d Su Yaya coquettishly replied and gently pounded his chest. How dare he say this out loud and right here?!Chen Xiuqi grabbed her hands and smiled proudly. His chest slightly vibrated from laughter as his unhappiness had disappeared. He had a beautiful woman in his arms and she was very cute, one who had pleased him very much.The two were being intimate and saying secretive things to each other when they suddenly heard a male voice. \u201cPresident Chen seems to be in a good mood.\u201dSu Yaya was embraced by Chen Xiuqi and her back was towards them. She didn\u2019t know who it was but she felt the voice was familiar. It felt like she heard this somewhere.Then she heard Chen Xiuqi talk calmly, \u201cPresident Wang, it seems like you have friends over too.\u201dSu Yaya was confused.President Wang? The President Wang she knew?She recalled his voice and it was really Wang Wenhao\u2019s. Why was he here?Su Yaya turned around to see Wang Wenhao wearing deep blue sportswear. He held a golf club in his hand and squinted with his red phoenix eyes. He had a half smile on his handsome face.\u201cOld friend, I haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d Wang Wenhao had recognized Su Yaya long ago. When she turned around, he first smiled and greeted her.Su Yaya was slightly shocked but she quickly recovered. She showed off her 120% acting skills, smiling and greeting him. \u201cHey, old friend.\u201d\u201cYou must be Su Yaya? You\u2019re beautiful! More beautiful than on TV!\u201d There was an online celebrity by Wang Wenhao\u2019s side. She recognized Su Yaya at first glance and immediately grinned at her, then enthusiastically said, \u201cI saw the drama you acted in \u2014 Pamper After Marriage. You have good acting skills and I like you very much!\u201dSu Yaya glanced at the online celebrity and saw that she was a woman about her age. The woman applied makeup conspicuously and her face was paler than the color of the wall. The color of her lips were red as fresh blood. She wore a white dress that was very short, barely up to her thighs, and she revealed her long and slender legs, but it wasn\u2019t as fine and well-proportioned as hers, nor was it as white. Her leg muscles seemed to be slightly sturdy, not as appealing as hers.Without comparison, the online celebrity had beautiful legs as well. But with Su Yaya present, one could see the difference. The difference was huge as well, like one on heaven and one on earth. There would be no pain if there weren\u2019t any comparisons.The online celebrity was overly enthusiastic and Su Yaya felt the need to entertain her thoughts, otherwise people might think she was arrogant and hard to talk to. That was why she smiled and replied, but who would have thought that the online celebrity was even more enthusiastic. She immediately held onto Su Yaya\u2019s arms and started to chat with her. Su Yaya had no choice but to respond every now and then.Wang Wenhao had invited Chen Xiuqi. \u201cLet\u2019s play a round. What do you think, President Chen?\u201dEveryone was a businessman; they knew how to act. Plus, last time, Yong Rong Food Company had clarified the situation because it had given Chen Xiuqi face. Right now, there was no reason for Chen Xiuqi to reject the offer.Chen Xiuqi faintly glanced at Wang Wenhao and said, \u201cOk, let\u2019s play a round.\u201dThe two competed while Su Yaya and the online celebrity sat by the side and observed the game. With this break, the online celebrity smiled at Su Yaya and asked, \u201cCan we follow each other on Weibo?\u201dWhile she said this, she already opened Weibo, wanting to follow her and vice versa.Su Yaya pursed her lips and pondered over it before nodding. She took out her phone and followed her back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were lots of photoshopped photos of her. The majority were pictures after she added fillers of herself. There was quite a difference between her and the actual her. As it turned out, she lied to her fans about her identity.\u201cSister Yaya, we are friends now. You can call me Xiao You in the future.\u201d The online celebrity said.Su Yaya slightly nodded. Xiao You it is.Xiao You\u2019s phone rang, signaling notifications. She smiled at Su Yaya and walked to the side to respond to the message. Su Yaya looked at her and didn\u2019t care about what she was doing. She focused on Chen Xiuqi and Wang Wenhao\u2019s competition.Xiao You opened her WeChat to see numerous messages sent in the group chat.Wang Jing: What the heck. Is there something wrong with my eyes? Or did you and Su Yaya followed each other?Deeply hugging Lanlan: Why did you and Su Yaya follow each other? Do you know her?Love Sweet Tangtang: How did you know Su Yaya? You\u2019ve gotten to her good side?\u2026Dozens of messages were of the same content.Xiao You read through them and smiled proudly. She didn\u2019t think she would be involved with Wang Wenhao one day and then had met Su Yaya. Even more so, she didn\u2019t think they would\u2019ve followed each other.In her group of sisters, they all thought Su Yaya was cool. They were all online celebrities. Yet, Su Yaya was able to take on online dramas and famous ads. She even got the second female lead role for a huge TV show and had Yan Junyi, this current famous celebrity as her neighbor. Moreover, she and President Chen were a couple. She was basically the winner in life!Xiao You smiled and replied.Xiao You: I met Su Yaya today and exchanged Weibos with her. Guess who else I saw?Wang Jing: Who? Is it my idol, Yan Junyi?Deeply Hugging Lanlan: Right, is it Yan Junyi?Love Sweet Tangtang: Why do I think it\u2019s President Chen?Everyone in the group chat made their own guesses, rushing Xiao You to reveal the person.When the sisters in the group chat were about done with their discussion and Xiao You felt that she had given them enough suspense, she answered.Xiao You: Aiya, President Wang wanted to teach me to play gold before so I left for a bit. Acting cute.jpgLove Sweet Tangtang: Ok, ok. You don\u2019t need to show off your love with President Wang. Quickly tell us who it was.Wang Jing: Right, quickly tell us.Deeply Hugging Lanlan: Speak. Who is it?Xiao You purposefully responded: Guess.The moment she sent this message, everyone in the group chat was displeased. They claimed that if she didn\u2019t immediately tell the truth, they would come over and tear her to pieces.Xiao You: Fine, I\u2019m scared of you guys. I\u2019ll say. I\u2019ll say.\u201dDeeply Hugging Lanlan: Quickly!Xiao You: It\u2019s Chen Company\u2019s President Chen, Chen Xiuqi!Once she said this, the group was silent for three seconds. Then they started to explode and scream.Ahhhh!!!Love Sweet Tangtang: Su Yaya is really with President Chen? Is it President Chen from the Chen Company?Deeply Hugging Lanlan: Ahhh, my husband!!Xiao You: Heh.Deeply Hugging Lanlan: No pic, no truth. No pic, no truth. No pic, no truth! I need say this three times!Xiao You was speechless.Not far from here, Chen Xiuqi and Wang Wenhao were already done playing golf. Chen Xiuqi won. Su Yaya hurriedly ran over with a bottle of water and a towel.\u201cPresident Chen, drink water. President Chen, wipe your sweat.\u201dChen Xiuqi glanced at Wang Wenhao and slightly smiled. He bent down a bit and indicated for Su Yaya to wipe his sweat for him in front of Wang Wenhao.Su Yaya guessed his intentions and sighed. She calmly picked up the towel and wiped his sweat for him. Chen Xiuqi\u2019s smile deepened.The sunlight was splendid and bright. The clouds were fluff. The grass was an oil green. The breeze was gentle. The handsome man and beautiful woman were eye-catching.Xiao You was suddenly attracted by this scene, like Cinderella and her Prince Charming. It was even more beautiful than in the fantasies. She was suddenly propelled by an urge and picked up her phone to capture this scene where Chen Xiuqi kissed her forehead while Su Yaya wiped his sweat for him.After she finished, she was about to send it to the group chat. But when her hand hovered over the picture and prepared to send this, she suddenly stopped.Would it be bad to send this? After all, Su Yaya was a celebrity right now. If people found out about it, it might influence her. Nevermind. She would be better off not sending it. Maybe it was because of Xiao You\u2019s conscience acting up so she abandoned her decision.Thankfully she hadn\u2019t done this either. If she did, she didn\u2019t need to be part of the entertainment circle anymore.Chen Xiuqi and Wang Wenhao enjoyed their time playing golf. It was getting late so the group decided to have an all fish banquet in the villa. It was all fish that Su Yaya caught.When the four sat down, a glimpse of light flashed by Wang Wenhao\u2019s red phoenix eyes as he glanced at the table full of fish. He smiled at Su Yaya and asked shockingly, \u201cYaya, did you really catch all of this? I remember how you disliked eating fish when you were a child.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He faintly glanced at Su Yaya and picked up the cup of tea, sipping it.Su Yaya felt the back of her hair standing up. She harshly scolded Wang Wenhao in her heart. He was so annoying. He clearly knew her relationship with Chen Xiuqi. Yet, he purposefully made their relationship sound ambiguous. Did he want to harm her?\u201cWhen do I not like to eat fish? I always liked to eat fish.\u201d Su Yaya ruthless retorted and placed a piece of fish in her bowl. She started to eat it and used her actions to demonstrate how much she liked to eat fish.Seeing that she finished a piece of fish and was about to grab another one with his chopsticks, Wang Wenhao faintly smiled. \u201cMaybe I remembered wrong.\u201dSu Yaya paused her action and pursed her lips. Whatever. She was too lazy to talk about the nonsense with him. She grabbed another piece of spicy fish and slowly tasted it.Chen Xiuqi saw the entire process and there was no expressions on his handsome face. He placed the teacup down and grabbed a piece of fish with his chopsticks as well. He carefully got rid of the fish bones and placed the fish in Su Yaya\u2019s bowl. He said considerately and in a gentle voice, \u201cIf you like fish, eat some more.\u201dSu Yaya hurriedly lifted her head and her eyes sparkled as she looked at Chen Xiuqi. Her eyes were sparkling like diamonds and her voice was sweet like honey. \u201cThank you.\u201dChen Xiuqi\u2019s face softened a bit and he faintly smiled. \u201cWhat else do you want to eat? I\u2019ll get it for you.\u201dSu Yaya looked at him. Despite the subtle expression, she realized that he did this purposefully in front of Wang Wenhao. She didn\u2019t overthink and decided to keep this act up. She sweetly smile and said, \u201cI want that fish ball.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Chen Xiuqi looked at her in a pampering tone. He picked up a spoon and scooped two fish balls. He gently asked, \u201cMore?\u201dSu Yaya nodded. \u201cMore. Give me two more.\u201dChen Xiuqi softly laughed and the smile on his face deepened. It felt like he was helpless with her actions but he enjoyed pampering her. He picked up the spoon and scooped two more fish balls.Su Yaya ate a fish ball and complimented the taste. The quality of the meat was smooth and tasty. It was exquisite and full of juice. Very yummy.\u201cIt\u2019s really yummy.\u201d Su Yaya smiled while eating this. She revealed two sweet and cute dimples, asking Chen Xiuqi, \u201cDo you want to try it? It\u2019s really yummy.\u201dChen Xiuqi glanced at Wang Wenhao, not batting his eyelids. He curled his lips into a smile and said, \u201cok.\u201dSu Yaya scooped a fish ball in her bowl to Chen Xiuqi\u2019s mouth. She grinned at him. The two were good actors. Chen Xiuqi opened his mouth and ate the fish ball. The two flawlessly cooperated with each other.So sweet!Xiao You who was across was envious and she was slightly jealous. Su Yaya was really lucky to have someone like President Chen pampering her!In the past, her friends in the group chat would gossip, saying that there was no way Su Yaya was connected to Chen Xiuqi. How could he be interested in Su Yaya? She was just an online celebrity who came from about the same status as them. Before today, she believed this too. Until she saw Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi standing together, like an ideal and a well-matched couple, she believed that their relationship was real now.Then she became jealous and believed that just because they were together, it didn\u2019t prove anything. It was like her and Wang Wenhao. They were just playing along. Maybe it was the same for Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi. Everyone could tell that Su Yaya had been trying to please Chen Xiuqi. It was very likely that her thoughts were true. She was persistent with this idea too, until Chen Xiuqi placed a fish ball in Su Yaya\u2019s bowl and she fed him a fish ball. The two were incredibly intimate with each other and they were each other\u2019s worlds. Their eyes were full of love, not acting. They were really affectionate and sweet with each other.Wang Wenhao\u2019s red phoenix eyes darkened. He picked up the wine glass on the table and gulped down a mouthful.After they finished, Wang Wenhao took Xiao You along with him and said goodbye to Chen Xiuqi and Su Yaya. The two quickly left.Su Yaya followed Chen Xiuqi to their lodging, a renovated luxurious penthouse.\u201cI\u2019ll go shower now.\u201d After fishing in the morning and playing golf with Chen Xiuqi for a while, Su Yaya had sweated a lot. Her clothes stuck to her body and she was uncomfortable. She opened her suitcase and took out some clothes to change into after showering.Chen Xiuqi looked at her and his eyes darkened. His adam\u2019s apple bobbed as he suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dChen Xiuqi didn\u2019t even give Su Yaya a chance to say no. He held her waist and took her into the bathroom without another word.The warm water splashed down from the sprinkler, wetting Su Yaya\u2019s hair and face, and then her whole body. Her wet dress stuck to her body. After Chen Xiuqi tugged on it several times, her clothes were off of her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her wet dress stuck to her body. After Chen Xiuqi tugged on it several times, her clothes were off of her.Chen Xiuqi pressed her against the wall and violently thrusted in her. She felt her body falling apart so she held onto his shoulders, whispering words of mercy.\u201cHubby~\u201dShe laid on his shoulder. She wanted him to stop being angry and let her go.Who knew that Chen Xiuqi\u2019s veins burst when he heard her seductive voice. He couldn\u2019t control himself anymore and was like a crazy horse freed from its reins. He clenched his teeth and said, \u201cWhat exactly is your relationship with Wang Wenhao?\u201d\u201cJust, just elementary school friends!\u201d Su Yaya was uncomfortable by the power of his thrusts. She responded miserably.Chen Xiuqi humphed and thrusted again. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t treat you as an elementary school friend though. Otherwise, how would he know you don\u2019t eat fish?\u201dSu Yaya felt wronged. Her eyes were teamy and she wrapped her arms around Chen Xiuqi\u2019s neck, making him look at her. She wanted him to see her eyes. \u201cWhen did I not eat fish? Didn\u2019t you see that I was having a good time eating it before? I even ate a lot. Didn\u2019t you see that? If you\u2019re going to believe whatever he says to you, what do you want me to do?\u201dSeeing her miserably face and teary red eyes, Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t know whether it was due to the hot water or her tears, but his heart suddenly softened. The anger in his heart immediately vanished.Why was he angry at her? She had always been well-behaved, wasn\u2019t she? It was all Wang Wenhao\u2019s fault. He purposefully said all that so he could misunderstand her. If he fell into his trap, who knew how happy he could be. Su Yaya would\u2019ve felt extremely wronged.Chen Xiuqi slowed down his actions and held her with both his hands. He looked deeply at her slightly pouting lips. He lowered his head and kissed her. Her lips were soft and sweet, like jello. He couldn\u2019t have enough of her.Su Yaya finally soothed Chen Xiuqi and made him pleased after tremendous strength. But it was a tragedy for her. Her whole body was sore and felt like on the verge of falling apart. She slept in her room the entire afternoon and didn\u2019t go anywhere. She even ate her dinner in her room.After dinner, Su Yaya wanted to sit on the sofa and play games on her phone. Chen Xiuqi sat next to her and looked at the game she was playing. The characters, designs, and images looked pretty good. After she played a round, he was a bit interested as well. He said, \u201cHelp me download this game and we can play together.\u201dSu Yaya said, \u201cOk.\u201dShe took his phone and downloaded the same game, then asked which character he wanted to play. She explained the instructions in a simple manner and after he was clear, the two formed a team. Then, they called over some teammates to play with and prepared for the next round.At the beginning, Chen Xiuqi wasn\u2019t as skilled so he quickly died after a few turns. He had to wait for a wet nurse to save him and he delayed the entire team\u2019s progress. After playing several more times, Chen Xiuqi was now familiar with the tactics. His character\u2019s attitude changed completely and he had picked a knight who was adept at close-in battles. He was able to play his character to its full potential. Heroism reached the clouds and his opponents were utterly defeated.Su Yaya couldn\u2019t believe how extremely powerful the red-clothed knight was. She turned around and curiously asked Chen Xiuqi, \u201cHow did you do all that?\u201dChen Xiuqi proudly raised his eyebrows but pretended like he didn\u2019t really care. He faintly said, \u201cI just did it.\u201dSu Yaya grabbed his hands and begged, \u201cWill you teach me? I have been struggling this whole time.\u201dChen Xiuqi smiled and spit, \u201cStupid!\u201d\u201cHubby~\u201d Su Yaya acted cute and pestered him. \u201cJust teach me!\u201dChen Xiuqi softly laughed and asked, \u201cWhat do I get from teaching you?\u201dSu Yaya knew well. She moved over and kissed his handsome face. It was really quick and then it was over. Even Chen Xiuqi was stunned by this.\u201cHubby, can you teach me now?\u201d Su Yaya giggled and looked at him with sparkling eyes. It was mixed with eagerness, as if she would kiss him a second or a third time if he didn\u2019t agree, until he did.Chen Xiuqi reached over to stroke her hair. How could she be so cute? His heart melted.\u201cOk, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201dAs long as she wanted to learn something, there was nothing he couldn\u2019t teach. It was just a game. It was incredibly easy.\u201cThis is what I did\u2026\u201d Chen Xiuqi told Su Yaya about his tactics and played a few rounds with her. Su Yaya\u2019s combat skills rapidly upped a few levels.The two played the game the entire night. They enjoyed their time and didn\u2019t sleep until very late.The next morning, Su Yaya was still immersed in her dream, in a daze. She was woken up by a phone alarm. She woke up and saw Chen Xiuqi reaching over to pick up the phone next to the bedside. He greeted the person, saying \u201cTang\u201d, and his expression completely changed after hearing what they had to say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed to look unwell. He reached over and threw the blanket to the side, wearing his clothes and saying to Su Yaya at the same time, \u201cThere are some urgent matters and I need to head back. Do you want to come back with me or continue to play here?\u201d How would she be able to have fun when he was gone? She hurriedly said, \u201cI\u2019m going back with you.\u201d Chen Xiuqi nodded. \u201cOk.\u201d While Chen Xiuqi went to rinse and dress in the bathroom, Su Yaya climbed out of bed and started to pack things up. By the time Chen Xiuqi came out of the bathroom, Su Yaya finished packing. She looked up to see Chen Xiuqi\u2019s rigid looking face. His eyebrows were knitted like he was really worried. \u201cI\u2019m going to rinse and dress up.\u201d She went to the bathroom and in order to save time, she only did a simple facial, spending less than half the time she usually would. Then, she walked out. Chen Xiuqi was already in a call. \u201cAssistant Chen, please book a plane ticket to H City for me. There is an urgent matter and I need to be there.\u201d Assistant Chen agreed and hurried to book a ticket. Chen Xiuqi hung up to see Su Yaya standing by the side. Chen Xiuqi bent down to pick up his luggage. \u201cLet\u2019s go. Uncle Zhong is waiting for us downstairs.\u201d The two walked out the room and took the elevator downstairs. When they arrived on the second floor, the door opened. Wang Wenhao and Xiao You walked in. When she saw Su Yaya, she enthusiastically greeted her and called her \u201csister Yaya\u201d. Then she turned around to greet Chen Xiuqi, saying \u201cHi President Chen\u201d. Su Yaya returned a smile while Chen Xiuqi was expressionless the entire time. Wang Wenhao saw the luggage they were carrying and asked, \u201cAre you guys preparing to head back?\u201d Su Yaya looked at Chen Xiuqi and he didn\u2019t plan on saying anything, so she had to find an excuse. \u201cYeah, my manager is telling me to come back.\u201d Wang Wenhao smiled and glanced at Chen Xiuqi. \u201cPresident Chen is quite considerate.\u201d Su Yaya smiled. While speaking, the elevator arrived on the first floor. The moment the door opened, Chen Xiuqi walked out first. Su Yaya looked over to say goodbye to Wang Wenhao and Xiao You. Then she quickened her pace to catch up to Chen Xiuqi. The car parked in front of the door. Chen Xiuqi and Su Yaya followed in succession into the car. The black Bentley drove off quickly. Chen Xiuqi looked to his side and said to Su Yaya, \u201cI need to head to the airport in a bit. When we arrive in the city, you have to get off and Assistant Chen will be in charge of bringing you home.\u201d Su Yaya could tell that Chen Xiuqi wasn\u2019t in a good mood. She obediently replied, \u201cOk.\u201d Chen Xiuqi reached over to stroke Su Yaya\u2019s hair. \u201cIt will be fine. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d Actually, instead of saying that the words were for Su Yaya, why not say he was trying to comfort himself? Su Yaya replied, \u201cI know.\u201d The car quickly arrived in the city. Assistant Chen\u2019s car was parked to the side of the road. Su Yaya got off the car with her luggage and Assistant Chen gave Chen Xiuqi his things. The black Bently quickly drove off afterwards. \u201cMiss. Su, I\u2019ll bring you back.\u201d Assistant Chen walked over and said. Su Yaya shifted her gaze back and followed Assistant Chen back in the car. The car drove all the way to the villa and Assistant Chen helped Su Yaya carry her luggage into her room. He said, \u201cMiss Su, President Chen won\u2019t be here for the next few days. If you need anything, call me. I will try my best.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and replied, \u201cOk, I know. Thank you.\u201d \u201cGood. If there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019ll be going now.\u201d Assistant Chen left and Su Yaya brought him to the door, watching his car drive off. Su Yaya returned to the villa and sat on the sofa for a while. She had slept late last night and woke up too early this morning. She was still half-asleep and decided to nap on the sofa for a while. Su Yaya ended up sleeping for almost three hours. She woke up hungry and her stomach was rumbling. She got off of the sofa and straightened her hair, wearing her shoes. She turned around to the kitchen to see if there was anything to eat. She found egg and tomato and some noodles in the fridge. She decided to make tomato and egg noodles. She first fried the egg then placed the sliced tomato pieces into the pan to fry. She boiled the water in the post and then added the noodles in after. That way, it would be chewier. The sooner she took the noodles out of the pot, the softer it would be. Therefore, she had it boil for a while. After the noodles were done, she fished it up and placed it in a bowl. Then she added the tomatoes and fried egg on top. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d Su Yaya smiled as she brought the tomato and egg noodles out of the kitchen. The moment she placed the bowl on the table and prepared to sit down to eat, the door bell rang. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Su Yaya wondered who would be coming at this time. She walked towards the door and saw Zhou Peiyun standing outside after looking through the peephole. She wondered why Zhou Peiyun was looking for her. She didn\u2019t call her before coming either. Su Yaya quickly opened the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Why did you shut your phone? Do you know how long I have been looking for you?\u201d The moment Zhou Peiyun walked in, she threw her numerous questions. Clearly, she was angered by the fact Su Yaya turned her phone off and her sudden disappearance. Su Yaya then remembered. Yesterday, she had been playing the game with Chen Xiuqi until late at night, to the point where her phone was out of battery. Later on, they were incredibly tired and fell asleep on the bed immediately. The result was that she forgot to charge her phone and she woke up this morning in a hurry, so she didn\u2019t remember this. Plus, she had another two hour nap. Clearly, the phone automatically shut down because there was no battery. Therefore, Zhou Peiyun couldn\u2019t find her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She vaguely explained and tried to move past this.Zhou Peiyun wanted to sigh while looking at her. When she couldn\u2019t get ahold of him, she thought that she wanted to quit the job again.\u201cDo you know that you have to take a makeup photos?\u201d Zhou Peiyun reminded her.Su Yaya was stunned. Don\u2019t mention it but she really didn\u2019t know.The moment Zhou Peiyun saw her expression, she knew she didn\u2019t know either. She told Su Yaya the location and time.\u201cOk, I will remember this.\u201d Su Yaya said.Zhou Peiyun continued to say, \u201cTwo days later, you will be entering the cast and beginning to film your scenes. You would end up staying in S City for a few months and I can\u2019t follow you every day. The company arranged an assistant for you and they will come tomorrow. The assistant will be paid by the company. This is what the boss said.\u201dShe especially emphasized that it was the boss. She was just taking into consideration of Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face. If he didn\u2019t support her, how would Su Yaya be able to get the second female lead role of this huge TV show? The company would definitely not even arrange an assistant for her.Su Yaya nodded and said, \u201cI know. Thank you, Sister Zhou.\u201dAfter going over everything, Zhou Peiyun was much more relaxed now. Only the Heavens would know how fantic and anxious she was when she couldn\u2019t find Su Yaya. She was afraid that she might delay the matters again. After all, tomorrow\u2019s makeup photos would be very important.\u201cWhat\u2019s the smell?\u201d After Zhou Peiyun calmed down, she had a sharp nose and smell food.Su Yaya said, \u201cIt\u2019s tomato and egg noodles.\u201d\u201cWow, just in time. I haven\u2019t eaten lunch yet because I was too busy finding you. Can I eat this?\u201d Zhou Peiyun walked to the dining table in a few steps and took in the aroma of the tomato and egg noodles. She was drooling.While they were speaking, the noodles had been placed there for a while. It wasn\u2019t as delicious as when it was first cooked. Su Yaya nodded and said, \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll go cook another bowl.\u201dZhou Peiyun was shocked. \u201cWhen did you learn to cook? How come I didn\u2019t know?\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes and answered seriously, \u201cI always knew how to. You just never asked me before.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zhou Peiyun thought back. Did she really not ask him before? But she had a lot to do and she was always busy. She couldn\u2019t remember whether she asked him if she could cook before or not.Su Yaya went to the kitchen to cook another bowl of noodles again. Zhou Peiyun took a mouthful of tomato and egg noodles and her eyes brightened. Wow. It was delicious. She didn\u2019t know if something was wrong with her taste buds or she really felt like it was the taste in her childhood. Just like when her mother cooked tomato and egg noodles for her.She couldn\u2019t believe this at all. She hurriedly grabbed her chopsticks and had another two bites. It was indeed the taste of her childhood. It wasn\u2019t a mistake. It was really good. She was so touched that she was about to cry.She ate mouthful after mouthful of noodles. She originally wasn\u2019t that hungry but she felt hungrier the more she ate. She just wanted to eat some more.Su Yaya finished cooking another bowl of noodles and brought it out. Zhou Peiyun was almost done eating. She raised her head and said to Su Yaya, \u201cYour noodles are great. I want to have another bowl.\u201d\u201cSister Zhou\u2026\u201d Su Yaya helplessly looked at Zhou Peiyun. She didn\u2019t eat yet. She was very hungry too!\u201cNevermind.\u201d Zhou Peiyun waved her hands, unable to endure Su Yaya\u2019s gaze. She abandoned her thought and started to finish up the noodles in her bowl.Su Yaya held the bowl of noodles and sat across from her. She ate slowly and it felt like this was a scene coming out of a drawing. She was at the top of the world, yet she knew how to cook.Zhou Peiyun was touched at the moment. She took a picture of Su Yaya and then a picture of the empty bowl in front of her. Then, she added filters and uploaded it to Weibo.Manager Zhou Peiyun: This is the tomato and egg noodles that Yaya cooked. It\u2019s delicious and nutritious. Su Yaya elegantly eating the noodles.jpg. Empty bowl.jpg.Right now, no matter big or small celebrities, they enjoyed posting pictures of them eating food, so that people would think they are foodies.In reality, however, the pictures were purposefully taken for show. In order for celebrities to look nice on camera, they would maintain their figures. Despite how skinny they might be, they wanted to be skinnier.There were some celebrities who exaggerated and said that they hadn\u2019t had a full meal for a few years in order to keep the fitures. They counted the grains of rice and refused to eat meat. They cooked the vegetables with water and didn\u2019t even dare to put salt in. There was no flavor in their lives. How could they really act like foodies and eat all they want?Therefore, it was really rare for someone like Su Yaya to finish eating a huge bowl of noodles.Zhou Peiyun posted pictures of Su Yaya eating noodles on Weibo and this attracted many people\u2019s attention right away. Plus, the pictures didn\u2019t seem purposeful. Instead, she was really eating the noodles. The tomato and egg noodles made them ravenous and they drooled. She seemed much more realistic than the celebrities pretending to be foodies.Because it was real, people liked her. Within a while, there were hundreds of comments under Zhou Peiyun\u2019s Weibo and thousands forwarded her post. One could see the rapid increase and bystanders had brought the post to the hot search!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this age, it was normal for all sorts of numbers to call them. Zhou Peiyun picked up after the third ring.They first introduced themselves. \u201cI am Sun Lei, the producer of \u300aFood and Guests\u300bfrom the Fruits TV Station.\u201dZhou Peiyun hurriedly said, \u201cHey, hey, hey.\u201d Then she covered the speaker and secretly said to Su Yaya, \u201cIt\u2019s the producer of \u300aFood and Guests\u300b from the Fruits TV Station.\u201dWhile saying this, Su Yaya just finished her noodles and placed her chopsticks down, satisfied. She reached over for a napkin and wiped her mouth. She recalled \u300aFood and Guests\u300band it seemed like the ratings were pretty good and the program was popular.Sun Lei\u2019s voice traveled through the phone and he said, \u201cI saw the picture of Su Yaya that you sent on Weibo. Are you Su Yaya\u2019s manager? I think she fits our program\u2019s requirements and I would like to invite her to the program as a guest.\u201dZhou Peiyun\u2019s mind flew quickly. \u300aFood and Guests\u300bwas an important program that the Fruits TV Station was trying to develop. It was an entertainment program revolving around leisure times and interviews. It would broadcast every Friday night at 9:30 pm. Every episode,they would invite three actors who were good at cooking. What was worth mentioning was that the actors who were invited were handsome men and beautiful women that were approved by the audience. It definitely fitted the requirements of the \u300aFood and Guests\u300b.In the program, the host would request each of the attending actors to cook three dishes or so that they were good at. While cooking, the host would interview the actors and ask some interesting questions. The actors would have to respond according to their intelligence and could obtain a certain amount of points. After the actors were finished, the host and the judges would rate them after trying out the dishes. The actor who got the highest points would win and continue to attend the next episode.In this program, not only were there delicious food to try out, but also people trying others to cook. There were even appealing women and men the audience would watch. The judges would even rate their dishes and allow the audience to be involved too. From the beginning of the broadcast of the program, it had attracted numerous people. The ratings had been increasing and it held the highest rating of the entertainment programs in the Fruits TV Station.It meant that they approved Su Yaya if they allowed her to attend the program. It would make her more famous and expand her fan groups. It would help her a lot. In short, this was a rare and wonderful chance that she must treasure.Thinking of this, Zhou Peiyun hurriedly agreed to Sun Lei\u2019s invite. \u201cThank you Producer Sun for giving Yaya a chance. Yaya is looking forward to attending this program.\u201dSun Lei said straightforwardly, \u201cGood. If you guys have time, come the day after to the TV Station so we can talk about the specifics.\u201d\u201cYes, we do have time.\u201d Zhou Peiyun hurriedly answered. \u201cThe day after tomorrow, I will bring Yaya to see you at 10:30 am.\u201d\u201cOk, this is it. See you soon.\u201d\u201cSee you the day after tomorrow.\u201dGot it!Zhou Peiyun snapped her fingers happily. She turned around and smiled at Su Yaya .\u201dSee, all I did was post a picture of you eating noodles on Weibo and who knew you ended up on the hot search. The producer of \u300aFood and Guests\u300beven looked for you to attend this program. When people are lucky, nothing could block this fortune!Su Yaya was ecstatic in her heart too. She revealed a sweet smile but acted like she didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt was probably coincidental.\u201dHeh. Zhou Peiyun walked to her and observed. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking normally? Wouldn\u2019t you always start to laugh and go crazy? Why are you so calm at this time? I don\u2019t even recognize you anymore.\u201dSu Yaya was teased by Zhou Peiyun and her face turned slightly red. She said in an embarrassed tone, \u201cSince when? Wasn\u2019t I like this before?\u201dThe moment she said this, Zhou Peiyun was irritated. Whenever she recalled how disobedient and lazy she was, she would be angry. She would rather go on dates and sleep with Chen Xiuqi rather than taking on jobs.\u201cYou dare to mention the past?\u201d Zhou Peiyun raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cNo matter what happens, you have to do your best in the program. You can\u2019t make a single mistake, do you hear me?\u201dShe was quite scary when she was harsh. So scary!Su Yaya hurriedly nodded, acting well-behaved. \u201cI heard you. Don\u2019t worry. I will do my best this time and not let you worry.\u201dNow that sounds better!Zhou Peiyun was slightly pleased. She stared at her beautiful face and said, \u201cActually, I think you are quite in luck recently. You went shopping and even a fashion blogger had taken pictures of you, attracting a large number of fans. Now that I sent a picture of you eating noodles on Weibo, the producer of \u300aFood and Guests\u300bwas now interested in you. It seems like your good luck follows you everywhere.\u201dSu Yaya didn\u2019t dare to think this. She immediately interrupted Zhou Peiyun and said, \u201cSister Zhou, why don\u2019t you talk about how I was attacked on the internet the other day? That day, I was scolded so badly by everyone. I didn\u2019t even dare to go on Weibo.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They only care about their fame and reputation. Even if they became famous because of the degrading comments, they still became famous. What people are scared of the most was that no one knows them. Although you were badly attacked by the internet water armies, you won the battle in the end. The clarification Weibo that Yan Junyi sent helped you get on the hot search as well. Now, there were many favors in favor of the two of you guys. You seemed to be blessed from this misfortune in the end. When the K Family\u2019s couple\u2019s watch ad you guys collaborated on is launched, you will probably experience another wave of enthusiasm amongst the fans. Numerous people would die for this. Just be satisfied.\u201dSu Yaya spit out her tongue. Fine. She was benefited from this after all.\u201cOk. It\u2019s getting late and I should go now. I will bring the assistant here tomorrow.\u201d Zhou Peiyun looked at her watch and reminded her before leaving.After Zhou Peiyun left, Su Yaya brought the utensils and bowls to the kitchen to wash. She was thankful for the dishwasher so she didn\u2019t need to wash them personally. It wouldn\u2019t hurt her hand.She had a pair of beautiful, slender, and gentle hands. Her nails were cut clean and round. It was faint pink and wasn\u2019t barbed at all. This pair of beautiful hands required careful care. No one could bear to harm her hands.She hastily woke up this morning and didn\u2019t do a full facial. She went back to her facial and by the time she was done, it was an hour later.Su Yaya picked up her phone and opened her WeChat. She found Chen Xiuqi\u2019s number and sent him a message.Yaya: Hubby, I\u2019m already missing you although you were only gone for a few hours. When are you coming back? Acting cute.jpg.She waited a while but she received no messages. She had no idea whether Chen Xiuqi had seen it or not.Su Yaya wanted to call him but recalled his gloomy face in the morning. He clearly encountered a thorny problem. If she called him right now, she might end up disturbing him. She abandoned the thought of calling him.Right now, she decided not to disturb Chen Xiuqi. Su Yaya went to find the play script for \u300aFlourishing Palace\u300b. She had already looked through the play script and started to look at it the second time. She already marked up the play script with different highlighters. The script was full of her annotations. One could tell how serious she took her role.\u300aFlourishing Palace\u300b was modified originally by a novel talking about the schemes in a palace. It talked about the female lead, Senior Concubine Tong\u2019s legendary life. Su Yaya really enjoyed the second female lead\u2019s role. She quickly immersed herself in the play script and concentrated on reading.Time slowly passed by. By the time Su Yaya snapped out of her trance from the play script, she noticed that it was already dark outside. It was 8 pm.Su Yaya hurriedly placed the play script away and made something to eat for herself. Then she rested for a while and went to the bathroom to rinse. She had to take makeup photos tomorrow so she wanted to appear energetic and full of vigor. After doing her facial, she went up to sleep early.She slept peacefully through the night.The next morning, Su Yaya was woken up by the alarm. After dressing and rinsing, Zhou Peiyun brought an assistant over. She was Xiao Yu, a girl in her early twenties. She had a baby face and round eyes. She smiled whenever she saw someone. She called Su Yaya, \u201cSister Yaya\u201d sweetly.When she called Su Yaya that, she thought of the online celebrity, Xiao You. She would call her \u201cSister Yaya\u201d as well and she was much sweeter than Xiao Yu.\u201cI will have to trouble you in the future.\u201d Su Yaya said.Duan Xiao Yu said, \u201cNo worries, no worries. It is my job to take care of Sister Yaya. I knew that I was going to be your assistant and I was unable to sleep the entire night because I was so excited. I like you a lot and I am also your fan.\u201dSu Yaya smiled and turned around to look at Zhou Peiyun. She really wanted to ask where she found an interesting assistant like her.Zhou Peiyun raised her eyebrows and said, \u201cThe company arranged Xiao Yu to be your assistant. She will take care of you in the future.\u201dSu Yaya made an \u201cok\u201d gesture, seemingly accepting this arrangement.After that, the three walked out the door. The assistant, Xiao Yu, drove the car. Zhou Peiyun sat in the passenger seat and Su Yaya was in the back. Zhou Peiyun looked back and started to talk to Su Yaya about what she needed to pay attention and the procedure for taking makeup photos. Su Yaya listened seriously and took her words to her heart.Quickly, the three arrived. Coincidentally, Director Zhou Tongguang and Producer Yu Hui were there too. Zhou Peiyun hurriedly brought Su Yaya over to greet them.\u201cHello Director Zhou and Produce Yu.\u201dZhou Tongguang coldly glanced at her, not paying attention. He looked at Yu Hui as if wondering who she was.However, Yu Hui recognized Zhou Peiyun. He smiled and said, \u201cYou must be Su Yaya\u2019s manager? Are you here to take the makeup photos?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Zhou Peiyun smiled and nodded. \u201cYaya is very hardworking.\u201dThe moment she said this, Director Zhou Tongguang coldly humphed, a look of disdain was clear on his face.Su Yaya clearly heard the humph. Her heart thumped quickly when she saw Director Zhou Tongguag\u2019s face.She heard him say, \u201cDon\u2019t change just yet. Act out the scene where the second female lead, Imperial Concubine Shu, is sent to the cold palace by the Emperor and she kneels on the ground, begging for his mercy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He must be!During their first meeting, he wanted her to act out the scene where she begged the Emperor for mercy. Was he trying to teach her a lesson and make her lose face?Su Yaya was unhappy and glanced at Director Zhou. That\u2019s not how you bully someone!In reality, Director Zhou had this intention as well.He was very unpleased with Su Yaya. From the bottom of his heart, he disliked her. He disliked her whole being, from top to bottom. There was not a single thing that he liked about her. It had nothing to do with Su Yaya\u2019s appearance. He was just uncomfortable with her.Originally, he had planned \u300aFlourishing Palace \u300bfor three years and had found a second female lead who he was very pleased with. He just needed to talk about the specifics with them and sign the contract. Who knew that the investor swapped the second female lead to Su Yaya without even asking for his opinion.When he found out, he thought that his life\u2019s worth of work had been destroyed. He was so angry that he went over to Sheng Shi Entertainment to find President Xiao. He wanted her to give the second female lead role back to the girl he had chosen but President Xiao looked coldly at him and refused. The two ended up quarreling over this.President Xiao pointed at his nose and argued, \u201cYou and I both can\u2019t make the decision. The big boss wanted to give the role to her. If you have the ability to, go find the big boss and ask to change the person. Don\u2019t come looking for me!\u201dZhou Tongguang\u2019s face turned to different shades of red from anger. If only he had the courage to ask find the big boss to change the person. He miserably said, \u201cThat is my life\u2019s worth of work\u2026\u201dTsk. He mocked him. He couldn\u2019t relate to what he meant by life\u2019s worth of work.\u201cPresident Xiao\u2026\u201d\u201cPresident Xiao, sorry for disturbing you. We will be going back now. When Yu Hui found out, he rushed over. Feeling the tense atmosphere, he hurriedly rushed over and apologized. Without another word, he started to pull Zhou Tongguang out of the office. \u201cLet\u2019s talk outside.\u201dZhou Tongguang and Yu Hui had worked together for numerous years and they were like real brothers. They had a deep connection. Yu Hui pulled him outside and advised him earnestly, \u201cBrother Zhou, I know this drama is very important to you as well as this role, but talking to President Xiao won\u2019t help you at all. The big boss hasd invested 178 million and what objections could you hold against him if he wanted one of his people to act in this drama? You can\u2019t have any opinions. You can only accept this decision. Otherwise, the big boss might be angry and take away the funds. Do you plan on holding onto your play script for another three years? Three years after already waiting for three years. How many three years do you have left to wait in your life?Zhou Tongguang was speechless.\u201cOk, don\u2019t think so much about it.\u201d Yu Hui patted his shoulders and continued, \u201cActually, I had looked through the girl\u2019s information, the girl who the big boss wanted to place in the drama. Although she didn\u2019t have too much experience in filming scenes and only filmed an online drama, her performance was worth mentioning. She isn\u2019t like those useless girls who only knoew how to glare and pout. She was much better than them at least. You just need to bring out your directing skills and train her. Maybe she will be better than the girl you chose. So, don\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s go back now.\u201dYu Hui pulled Zhou Tongguang away. He thought about this for the next few days and finally accepted the situation when he realized he couldn\u2019t change anything.After that, he released the actors\u2019 information on the official Weibo.

In fact, they even attacked him.He had filmed so many years\u2019 worth of dramas and he had never been scolded before. If it weren\u2019t for Su Yaya, how could his drama be attacked the moment he released information on the major actors?There were so many people who claimed they wouldn\u2019t watch this. Although many of them were internet water armies, he had never received this kind of treatment before. Therefore, he was extremely upset with Su Yaya.This is also the reason why he wanted to make things difficult for Su Yaya.He wanted to vent his anger!When Su Yaya heard that he wanted her to act the scene where she was banished to live in the cold palace, she realized that Zhou Tongguang had a lot of objections against her. He wanted to teach her a lesson.But she had no choice but to accept this. Acting was acting. But it depended on what she was acting. Different content meant different ways of acting. If she admitted defeat and acted this scene, with all the staff looking at her, she would probably be banished to the cold palace for real in the future!Su Yaya looked around and had an idea. She half-smiled at Zhou Tongguang and said, \u201cIt seems like Director Zhou has high enough regards for me to let me act right now. I definitely have no reasons why I shouldn\u2019t act but I accidentally slipped at home yesterday and injured my knee. President Chen personally applied medicine for me and he reminded Sister Zhou many times to take care of me. He didn\u2019t want me to injure it even more otherwise he would feel bad. Sister Zhou might be dragged down by me as well so I can\u2019t act this scene out today. How about we change to a different scene?\u201dThis morning, Su Yaya wore a dress that reached her toes and she was also wearing shoes. It really did seem like she injured her knee and it was inconvenient for people to see that. She wasn\u2019t afraid of lying about this.Even if people guessed that she was lying, no one would dare to come up and check. After all, she had President Chen supporting her. President Chen had told her to take care of herself. If she told the truth, wouldn\u2019t they be offending the big boss? Did they not want to work here anymore?Zhou Peiyun reacted quickly and smiled, trying to resolve the dispute. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Director Zhou and Producer Yu, why don\u2019t you guys let Yaya act out another scene? It\u2019s really not suitable for her to kneel and beg today.\u201dYu Hui was called out. He was a brilliant person and not as old-fashioned as Zhou Tongguang. He understood their point and knew how to judge and size the situation.He smiled and said, \u201cSince Xiao Su injured her knee, let\u2019s change to another scene. Why don\u2019t you have her act the scene where Imperial Concubine Shu finds out the palace maid by her side tried to poison her?\u201dZhou Tongguang immediately looked at Yu Hui. He smiled and said, \u201cZhou, is this scene hard to act?\u201dZhou Tongguang stared at his smile and sighed. \u201cFine, you can act this scene.\u201dYu Hui said, \u201cXiao Su, you have no problems with this scene, right?\u201dSu Yaya smiled sweetly and said, \u201cNo problem. I can start right now.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s begin then.\u201d Yu Hui said.Su Yaya gave her bag to her assistant, Xiao Yu, to carry. She looked around to see a lounge chair by the side. She walked over and carried the chair to the middle of the space. Then, she slowly sat down.The beautiful woman was relaxed and charming. She leaned against the back of the chair, closing her eyes slightly as if she was resting. A palace maid carried a white bowl with embroidered flowers over. She gently said, \u201cImperial Concubine, it\u2019s time for medicine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She slightly knitted her eyebrows and looked confusingly at the palace maid. She asked, \u201cAre you new? Where\u2019s Chun Lan?\u201dThe palace maid answered, \u201cThis maid is from the kitchen. Sister Chun Lan has a stomach ache so she wants this maid to bring the medicine over.\u201dThe beautiful woman\u2019s gaze became sharp as if she was shooting arrows at the palace maids.

She looked murderously at her and coldly said, \u201cI\u2019ll reward you this bowl of medicine then.\u201dLike a cold breeze coming from hell, the beautiful woman ruthlessly pinched the palace maid\u2019s chin and forced her to open her mouth. She looked indifferently and she poured the bowl of medicine down her throat.After she made her chug down this bowl, the palace maid couldn\u2019t stop coughing. She wanted to throw up the medicine. The beautiful woman stared at her and there was no warmth in her eyes. It felt like she was looking at a dead person.\u201cDrag her out. Don\u2019t dirty my ground!\u201d The beautiful woman smashed the bowl by the palace maid\u2019s feet. The broken pieces of glass splattered everywhere. The servants came in and dragged the palace maid out like a dead dog.\u2026.Clap clap clap.When Su Yaya was done performing, Yu Hui was the first one to applaud. He was really shocked by Su Yaya\u2019s performance. He really didn\u2019t think that she would be able to act so well, especially the ruthless and cold gaze she held while forcing the medicine down the palace maid\u2019s throat. It frightened him, making him shiver. He couldn\u2019t help but clap for Su Yaya. From the bottom of his heart, he really thought she acted well.\u201cXiao Su, you did a great job.\u201dSu Yaya smiled and said, \u201cThank you, Producer Yu.\u201d\u201cContinue to work hard in the future.\u201d Yu Hui responded.\u201cI will.\u201d Su Yaya nodded. She was well-behaved and one would have a favorable impression of her at first glance.Yu Hui bumped Zhou Tongguage and indicated, \u201cGive some comments.\u201dRight now, Zhou Tongguang felt awkward. He originally wanted to embarrass her in order to vent his anger. From his perspective, Su Yaya was an online celebrity so it was unlikely she had any acting skills anyway. Even though she acted pretty good in Pamper After Marriage, it wasn\u2019t enough. Who knew that Su Yaya\u2019s acting skills were that good. It wasn\u2019t within his expectations. He felt like this was a slap to his face. It hurts. It hurts a lot!\u201c\u2026you\u2019re pretty good.\u201d Zhou Tongguang said awkwardly, \u201cHopefully, you can maintain this while acting in the future.\u201dSu Yaya said in a proper tone, \u201cI know. Thank you Director Zhou.\u201dSeeing how she had a proper attitude, he wasn\u2019t as angry at her anymore.He finally softened and Zhou Tongguang seemingly approved of Su Yaya as well.Yu Hui observed the situation and hurriedly said to Su Yaya, \u201cThen let\u2019s go ahead and change for the makeup photo. Don\u2019t waste time.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya smiled splendidly and hurried to the makeup room to change and apply makeup.Once she finished, Su Yaya asked Zhou Peiyun, \u201cHow come I didn\u2019t see the other actors?\u201dZhou Peiyun just got off the phone and she placed it away. She looked at her and said, \u201cThey seemed to be busy with their own matters. They will be here in a while.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all busy people!\u201d Su Yaya sighed.\u201cIndeed, they are much busier than you.\u201d Zhou Peiyun responded and looked at the group of people walking in. She raised her chin and said, \u201cSee, they\u2019re here now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She walked up and greeted Director Zhou Tongguang. \u201cDirector Zhou, long time no see.\u201d\u201cLong time no see.\u201d Director Zhou Tongguang\u2019s attitude towards Chen Yan was much more enthusiastic. He smiled and complimented, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten even more beautiful.\u201dWomen loved being beautiful, especially women within the entertainment circle. Chen Yan smiled and said, \u201cI love hearing this.\u201dFour years ago, the first drama Chen Yan acted in after debuting was with Director Zhou Tongguang. He was her patronage. The two naturally were much closer than others.After Chen Yan was done talking to Director Zhou, she greeted Yu Hui who was by the side. \u201cHi Producer Yu.\u201d\u201cHello. I haven\u2019t congratulated you for getting the Hundreds Flowers Award for the best female actress.\u201dChen Yan tilted her head to the side and blinked her yes. She curled her lips into a grin. \u201cDo you want me to treat everyone?\u201dYu Hui softly chuckled. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201dChen Yan was very straightforward and immediately said, \u201cOnce we\u2019re done taking makeup photos, we\u2019ll go to Kai Yue Hotel to eat. I\u2019ll treat you guys.\u201dYu Hui looked at Zhou Tongguang and said, \u201cDo you hear this? Film Empress Chen is treating everyone out to eat. She is covering this meal!\u201dEveryone started to laugh and agreed. \u201cOk, Chen Yan is the straightforward one, it seems.\u201dZhou Peiyun who had witnessed the entire process bumped Su Yaya with her elbow. She whispered and reminded her, \u201cDo you see this? Learn from her. She was the one late but she soothed Director Zhou and Producer Yu and made them happy within a few sentences. They all remember how good she is. Why would they be angry at her now?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Su Yaya nodded, taking this information in.This was the entertainment circle. People followed whoever was popular. Chen Yan just obtained the Hundred Flowers Award for the best female actress and everything has been going well her way. Zhou Tongguang and Yu Hui obviously regarded her highly. She was the female lead of this entire drama. The biggest point was that she knew how to conduct herself and she was good at complimenting others. It was obvious that the two would be close to her.Once Chen Yan was done catching up and complimenting Zhou Tongguang and Yu Hui, she went to the makeup room to prepare for her makeup photos.As she passed by Su Yaya\u2019s side, she looked at smiled at her, nodding.Su Yaya was slightly shocked and hurriedly smiled back.Chen Yan quickly left with her people.\u201cIt seems like she has a good attitude. It should be easy to get along with her.\u201d Su Yaya said as she stared at her silhouette.Zhou Peiyun snorted. \u201cOh please, Miss Su, stop being so pure and gullible. There\u2019s no such thing as getting along with her easily. After you enter the set, be quick-witted and wise. Otherwise, you won\u2019t even know when you\u2019re bullied by someone else.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes and said oh. She silently took out her phone to search the entertainment gossip about Chen Yan. Quickly, she saw users talking about Chen Yan being fake with people under an anonymous forum. She really had no idea until she searched this. When she did, she jumped in shock. There was no such thing as being truthful with people in the entertainment circle.After a while, the staff came and called Su Yaya to take pictures. She hurriedly gave the phone to Xiao Yu to look after while she followed the staff.Su Yaya was really beautiful. After changing to the clothes in the scene and pulling her hair into a bun, she was even more beautiful. She seemed like a fairy who would be flying to the heavens at any moment. Plus, she was well-behaved and lively. She posed in whatever positions the photographer had her to do. Her expressions were all on point and the photographer was extremely satisfied. They couldn\u2019t help but take a few more pictures of her.\u201cPretty good?\u201d Yu Hui looked at Su Yaya\u2019s performance and asked Zhou Tongguang who was beside him.\u201cShe\u2019s ok.\u201d Zhou Tongguang was embarrassed to admit that he was shocked and enchanted by Su Yaya. Therefore, he gave a vague response. He didn\u2019t expect Su Yaya to be so lively. It was out of his expectations. In the past, he was angry that Su Yaya was shoved into the set by the investor and wasn\u2019t as great as the actress he regarded highly of. He was scared that she wouldn\u2019t be able to express the role to his satisfaction but in reality, he was the one overthinking. Su Yaya had more talent that the actress he was looking for.How could Yu Hui not know what Zhou Tongguang was thinking when they were like brothers for so many years? He chuckled but didn\u2019t expose his real thoughts.Su Yaya quickly finished her photos and Chen Yan walked over, in her outfit for the photos. She smiled at her and said, \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201dSu Yaya hurriedly answered, \u201cSister Yan is flattering me. You\u2019re also very beautiful.\u201dChen Yan chuckled by her bluntness. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re very cute. I like you. Let\u2019s go out to eat later on.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes, shocked but happy. How would she dare to reject Chen Yan? She quickly answered, \u201cSure!\u201d\u201cSo cute!\u201d Chen Yan complimented her and went off to take her pictures.Su Yaya went to the makeup room to remove her makeup, then found a place in the corner to sit. She paid attention to the others taking their pictures and held a proper attitude, wanting to learn from them.Zhou Tongguang sat diagonally from her. His gaze swept past her a couple of times and he watched as she concentrated on other people\u2019s photoshoots, as if she was trying to learn from them. The displeasure he had for her gradually disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

People would like them even more. Director Zhou had been a director for many years so he treasures talented people, like Su Yaya.Su Yaya was focused on learning from other people\u2019s photoshoots that she didn\u2019t know about Director Zhou Tongguang\u2019s change of thoughts. She waited for everyone to finish their photoshoots then went to eat with them.While eating, Chen Yan who was the female lead and the person treating them out, sat in the center. To her left, was Zhou Tongguang and to the right, was Yu Hui. Then, it was the male lead, Xu Chaoran. Then, it was Su Yaya and then the second male lead, Zhang Yue, co-director, and then the photographer. There were ten of them in the table.While eating, Chen Yan was great at making the atmosphere more lively. The entire table laughed and chuckled every now and then. They drank quite a bit of alcohol. Su Yaya sat by the side, well-behaved. She would drink a few glasses when it was her turn. She didn\u2019t dare steal Chen Yan\u2019s spotlight but wasn\u2019t too quiet either. It was just right for her. Xu Chaoran sat by her side and seeing that she was from the same company as him, he reminded her not to drink too much. When she didn\u2019t have to drink, don\u2019t drink.Chen Yan had heard this and pointed at him, saying, \u201cMy male lead actually cares about someone else other than me.\u201dXu Chaoran said calmly, \u201cWell, she\u2019s my junior sister!\u201d\u201cNice, nice!\u201d Yu Hui clapped his hands and everyone laughed along.After they finished, it was almost two hours later. The others had their own plans but Su Yaya was free, so she had Xiao Yu drive her home.When she returned home, Su Yaya went to nap first then continued to look through the play script after she woke up. Without realizing, another day had passed. At night, Su Yaya laid on bed after rinsing and recalled how she hadn\u2019t contacted Chen Xiuqi the entire day. She didn\u2019t know what he was busy with.She opened her WeChat to see the message still there. Chen Xiuqi hadn\u2019t replied. This wasn\u2019t good. She decided to call Chen Xiuqi and ask. That way, he could tell how much she cared for him!She clicked on Chen Xiuqi\u2019s number and called him. Yet, it said that he was busy and the call ended after a few rings.Su Yaya pursed her lips. She couldn\u2019t get ahold of him so she could only send him another text. She sent him a cute \u201cI miss you\u201d picture and then turned her phone off. She went to have her beauty sleep.The next morning, Su Yaya and Zhou Peiyun went to the Fruit TV Station to find Producer Sun Lei to talk about the specifics of \u300aFood and Guests\u300b. Everything went by successfully and Su Yaya just needed to cook three specialty dishes of hers for the program and answer some of the questions posed by the host. Of course, the host would go through the questions with her beforehand so she could think about how to answer the question in the program. This episode would be broadcasted next Wednesday and the treatment was pretty good. Su Yaya was very satisfied.Zhou Peiyun and Sun Lei both flattered each other and they were looking forward to next week\u2019s collaboration. They successfully signed the contract then Zhou Peiyun brought Su Yaya along to say goodbye to Sun Lei. Then they left the Fruit TV Station.On the way back, in the car, Zhou Peiyun reminded Su Yaya, \u201cYou will be going to the set tomorrow to film scenes. You have to be smart and don\u2019t let others bully you. Xiao Yu will follow you. Call me if you have any problems.\u201dSu Yaya asked, \u201cSister Zhou isn\u2019t following me over?\u201dZhou Peiyun said, \u201cThere\u2019s an urgent matter and I need to handle some things. After I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll go over and find you. I will ask the set for the day off for Wednesday in advance so you just need to focus on filming your scenes.\u201dSu Yaya said, \u201cI know.\u201dWhen the car drove back to the villa, Su Yaya said goodbye to Zhou Peiyun. She got out of the car and walked to the door, punching in the password and walking in. She saw a man\u2019s leather shoes by the door and a faint smell of smoke in the air.Was Chen Xiuqi back?Su Yaya raised her head and called towards the room, \u201cHubby, you\u2019re back!\u201dThere was a slight movement behind the curtains of the balcony. Su Yaya took off her high heels and ran barefoot over to the balcony without even changing into her slippers.She pulled the ocean blue curtains over to see Chen Xiuqi sitting on a chair smoking, just as expected. Su Yaya walked over and hugged him. She softly and sweetly said, \u201cHubby, when did you come back?\u201dChen Xiuqi put out the cigarette and placed it in the ashtray. He reached over and pulled Su Yaya to sit on his thigh. He held her waist and rubbed his chin against her neck. \u201cHave you missed me these few days?\u201dSu Yaya wrapped her hands around his throat and looked at her reflection through his eyes. She pursed her pouting lips and acted cute, saying, \u201cOf course I do. I miss you a lot. I even sent you texts but you didn\u2019t respond.\u201dChen Xiuqi looked at her and pursed his lips. He said gently, \u201cI have been busy these past few days so I didn\u2019t see the texts.\u201d\u201cOh, I guessed that would\u2019ve been the case.\u201d Su Yaya wasn\u2019t upset by Chen Xiuqi not responding to her messages. Instead, she asked in concern, \u201cAre you done with your work?\u201dChen Xiuqi continued to hold her and hummed in agreement. He pecked her lips and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask what I have been working on?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 - Lady Chen (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92: Lady Chen (1)Whoa. This question was beyond her capabilities to answer.Su Yaya had never thought of asking him this question. He was the male lead in the book while she was a cannon fodder. It wasn\u2019t up to her to ask about his whereabouts. She knew that very well and understood their relationship as well. She would definitely not overstep her boundaries.But since Chen Xiuqi had already asked this, if she didn\u2019t comply, it wouldn\u2019t look good on her. Chen Xiuqi might be upset because of this. It\u2019s better to follow along with what he wants so that he willbe pleased.Therefore, Su Yaya took her own advice and asked, \u201cHubby, what have you been busy with? You didn\u2019t even respond to my messages.\u201dUnsure whether it was because she had great acting skills or that Chen Xiuqi\u2019s attention wasn\u2019t on this conversation at all, but he couldn\u2019t tell what he had asked before so she didn\u2019t have to answer his question. He hugged her tightly and said in a bit of an upset tone, \u201cI went to see my mother over these past few days.\u201dHis mother? Lady Chen?!Su Yaya was shocked. When she was reading the novel, it didn\u2019t talk about the Lady Chen. She thought it said that Chen Xiuqi\u2019s parents had divorced while he was in his teens. Chen Xiuqi and Lady Chen didn\u2019t have a good relationship and haven\u2019t seen each other for many years. The novel didn\u2019t talk much about Lady Chen.However, she transmigrated to the beginning of the novel. There was a possibility that the situation right now was different from the original novel. Chen Xiuqi went to visit his sick mother which meant that Chen Xiuqi and Lady Chen\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t as poor and bad as described by the novel. At the very least, Chen Xiuqi cared about his mother. After all, it was clear he was worried about picking up the call that morning. His expressions couldn\u2019t hide his worry.\u201cIs your mother ok?\u201d After Chen Xiuqi picked up the call that day, his face seemed unwell. Plus, he left in a hurry afterwards. Su Yaya guessed that something must\u2019ve happened to Lady Chen, which was why she was asking right now.Chen Xiuqi looked at her and revealed a look of displease. Su Yaya saw his gaze and her heart pounded. She immediately reacted and changed the way she addressed the question, \u201cI meant how is our mother now?\u201dThis man loves to argue over small things. It was just a sentence but he would glare at her as if she had done something incredibly bad. Was he trying to say that his mother wasn\u2019t his mother anymore because of what she was saying? Plus, they were only married by contract. Everyone knew this. Could she change the truth just by changing the way she addressed Lady Chen?Psh \u2014 Immature!Su Yaya wanted to roll her eyes but taking into account of Chen Xiuqi\u2019s feelings, she endured this.Thankfully she did and Chen Xiuqi hadn\u2019t seen her either. Otherwise, who knew how angry he could be because Chen Xiuqi was very worried for his mother right now. Although he and his mother had separated for numerous years, blood was thicker than water. It was impossible for him to not be worried.\u201cShe\u2019s sick. She suddenly fainted this morning. At the beginning, we thought it was a chronic sickness and that frightened everyone. Thankfully, we brought her to the hospital in time. After having a specialist look over her condition, they were positive it wasn\u2019t her chronic sickness acting out but a very serious cold.\u201dJust by recalling this, Chen Xiuqi frightened himself. If his mother didn\u2019t just have a serious cold but the chronic sickness or even a more serious illness, he really couldn\u2019t forgive himself if he arrived there a moment too late and couldn\u2019t see his mother. He couldn\u2019t forgive himself for the rest of his life.\u201cActually when she divorced my father, I hated her. At that time, I had just finished taking my college entrance exam and got the highest score for the sciences. I thought that since I had such great scores, she would be very happy for me. What a pity that she wasn\u2019t. She just said that I was outstanding, then moved out of the Chen Family household.\u201d\u201cBack then, I knew she and my father didn\u2019t have a great relationship, but I didn\u2019t want to face this fact. I lied to myself and hoped that their relationship would improve like in the past and we would all be together. But looking back, I realized that it was just a one-sided wish.\u201d\u201cThey quickly finished handling the divorce procedure and my mom left without saying anything. She hasn\u2019t visited me once all these years and I hated her a lot for that time. I always thought that she was coldhearted and ruthless, abandoning me. Was I not her son?\u201d\u201cUp until recently, we never saw each other. She has grown older but was still as beautiful as before. She was also very concerned for me. I finally realized that the hatred and resentment I held for her in the past meant nothing now. I just want her to live a good life.\u201dSu Yaya silently listened to him and then patted his hand. She comforted him saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Thankfully there aren\u2019t any major problems. She just needs to take her medicine, be put on IV and she\u2019ll be fine in a few days. She won\u2019t feel good if you keep on worrying for her. Your mother should be fine now, right?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Otherwise, she would\u2019ve stayed there an extra two days.Su Yaya said, \u201cWhen are you planning to take me to see her? I haven\u2019t seen her!\u201dChen Xiuqi\u2019s parents divorced a decade or so ago. The two haven\u2019t contacted each other for many years. In order to inherit his grandfather\u2019s millions worth of inheritance, Chen Xiuqi found Su Yaya\u2019s parents and decided to marry the original host through contract. Chen Xiuqi only brought her back to see his grandfather, Second Uncle, and Second Aunt. His father was still enjoying his time abroad at that time, having the time of his life with women. Therefore, Su Yaya hadn\u2019t seen his parents before.Chen Xiuqi paused then said, \u201cOk. I\u2019ll find a chance and I\u2019ll bring you to see her.\u201dSu Yaya hummed and kissed him on the face. She smiled and said, \u201cHubby, you\u2019re so good to me.\u201dSeeing her like this, she was like a buffoon. She was always smiling and free from worries. He felt better whenever he was with her.Chen Xiuqi kissed her and his adam\u2019s apple bobbed. He said hoarsely, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201dSu Yaya\u2019s eyes looked around and asked, \u201cI\u2019ll cook for you. What do you want to eat?\u201dChen Xiuqi kissed her again and there was a dangerous glint in his deep eyes, like a hungry wolf. \u201cI just want to eat you.\u201d\u201cAh! \u2014\u201dChen Xiuqi carried her princess style and Su Yaya wasn\u2019t prepared at all. She screamed in shock, scared that she might fall out of his arms off. She hurriedly wrapped her arms around his neck, making Chen Xiuqi chuckle at her. He carried her into the room.\u201cGo, go upstairs\u2026\u201dSu Yaya was pressed against the sofa by Chen Xiuqi, trying to struggle.However, Chen Xiuqi had pressed her down and his warm breath on her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t wait.\u201dWhen it was over, Su Yaya was like a puddle of water. She cuddled in Chen Xiuqi\u2019s arms, feeling like her body was about to fall apart. She was too lazy to even move her fingers. Her eyes were red from the bullying and her throat was hoarse.\u201cWater\u2026\u201d Su Yaya said this tiredly and softly, without strength.Chen Xiuqi knew that he had overdone it. He reached over to caress her face. There was a smile in his eyes and he gently said, \u201cLay here for a while. I\u2019ll go pour water for you.\u201dSu Yaya was too lazy to even respond. She just opened her eyes and then closed it, indicating she knew.Look at her fragile body. Sigh!Chen Xiuqi sighed. He had provoked her so he would have to take care of her. He accepted this task and stood up to pour water for Su Yaya.Chen Xiuqi came back with a glass of water and personally fed her water. Su Yaya squinted her eyes like a kitten, enjoying Chen Xiuqi\u2019s care.Heh. She was always the one serving him in the past. Now that the roles had changed, why did she feel so happy? Heh\u2026\u2026Chen Xiuqi looked at her smiling and he reached over to pat her head. He didn\u2019t know why but he just wanted to keep pampering her. As long as she was happy.The two cuddled on the sofa for a while and Su Yaya slowly recovered. She laid on Chen Xiuqi\u2019s body and she couldn\u2019t bear to leave him. \u201cI will be going to the set tomorrow morning. I really don\u2019t want to leave you!\u201dChen Xiuqi was very pleased with her words. Seeing the kitten-like woman cuddled up in his arms, his heart softened and was on the verge of melting.He lowered his head to kiss her face. He said gently, \u201cHow about you don\u2019t go?\u201dSu Yaya\u2019s eyes widened when she heard this. She was like a kitten before but she immediately changed now. She said seriously, \u201cHow could I? I already signed the contract and I can\u2019t ruin it. I have integrity for my profession.\u201d Hm. She would have to pay money if she ruined the contract. She hadn\u2019t earned anything yet and it was far from her goal. She can\u2019t fall into Chen Xiuqi\u2019s trap.She has integrity for her profession?Chen Xiuqi raised his eyebrows and laughed. He pinched her face and said, \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d Su Yaya hurriedly nodded, sighing in her heart. She was already scared that Chen Xiuqi might not let her go in the spur of the moment. Then she would suffer a huge loss.Chen Xiuqi thought about it and said, \u201cDo you want me to bring you there tomorrow?\u201dSu Yaya shook her head and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s ok. My assistant will come and pick me up.\u201d\u201cYou have an assistant?\u201d Chen Xiuqi chuckled.Su Yaya said proudly, \u201cOf course. Why can\u2019t I have one? After all, I am the second female lead of the drama. The company would have to give me an assistant no matter what, since I\u2019m going to the set to film now.\u201dThat seemed reasonable. Chen Xiuqi nodded. Recalling her silly and naive personality, he was a bit worried. He reminded her, \u201cWhen you\u2019re at the set, remember to be wise and quick-witted. Don\u2019t let yourself be bullied. Call me if there are any problems.\u201d\u201cAm I that easily bullied?\u201d Su Yaya pouted and thought. Why was everyone saying this to her? Did she look so naive?\u201cYou look like the type to be easily bullied!\u201d In Chen Xiuqi\u2019s eyes, she was cute and adorable. She fit the type. If he wasn\u2019t protecting her, who knew how bad her life would be.Su Yaya was speechless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She leaned her head against his shoulder and said, \u201cI will miss you once I\u2019m gone.\u201dChen Xiuqi looked down at her and considered her words. Did she want him to visit her? His lips curled into a smile and said, \u201cDo you want me to visit you then?\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes. This was a pretty good suggestion!In the past, she said that she missed Chen Xiuqi because she wanted to please him. She wanted to give him the feeling as if she was infatuated with him. But if Chen Xiuqi could really come and visit her, it would be different. It was a great idea.\u201cWill you come?\u201d Su Yaya looked up at Chen Xiuqi and her eyes were sparkling bright like diamonds.Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t immediately agree but he said, \u201cI need to have Assistant Chen take a look. If my work allows me to, I will come when I have time.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Su Yaya smiled and said, \u201cIf you come, give me a call and notify me first. If you can\u2019t come, that\u2019s fine too. I\u2019ll just come back to visit you whenever I have a break.\u201dAlthough Chen Xiuqi mentioned this first, Su Yaya didn\u2019t hold much hope. Of course, it would be best if he could come. If he couldn\u2019t, it was no big deal either. If she didn\u2019t have expectations, she wouldn\u2019t be disappointed. She just needed to face this calmly.Chen Xiuqi liked how sensible she was. He smiled and said, \u201cThen this is settled.\u201dSu Yaya said \u201cok\u201d.\u2026That night, Su Yaya took out her suitcase and packed everything she needed to bring to the set: clothes, makeup products, skin products, bags\u2026etc. The more she tried to pack, the messier it became. A huge pile of things were on the bed and she still wasn\u2019t done yet.Chen Xiuqi looked at it and shook his head. She walked over and said, \u201cWhy are women so problematic when leaving the house? Just bring a card with you. You can buy whatever you\u2019re missing over there.\u201dSu Yaya stared at him and pouted miserably. \u201cI need to bring makeup and skin products, clothes, and all of that. Otherwise, what should I do when I\u2019m there?\u201dThe original host took care of her body so she needed to do the same too. She should bring whatever was needed. Otherwise, she would have to say goodbye to her beautiful face and figure!Chen Xiuqi was unable to understand why this woman was so stubborn. He sighed and asked, \u201cDo you want me to help you pack?\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes. \u201cCan I?\u201dChen Xiuqi wanted to say no but after looking at her big and pure eyes, he couldn\u2019t reject her. Whatever. She was his woman anyway. He might as well pamper her.\u201cOk, I\u2019ll help you pack.\u201d Chen Xiuqi said.Su Yaya happily pecked Chen Xiuqi\u2019s face. She had crescent-like eyes, and there were two cute dimples on her cheeks. \u201cThank you hubby, you\u2019re the best. I love you!\u201dShe was getting better and better at making Chen Xiuqi do what she wanted. She talked smoothly, not feeling awkward or embarrassed at all.Thankfully, Chen Xiuqi was willing to do as she pleased. He looked at her in a pampering gaze and helped to pack her suitcase.By the time it was completely done, it was already 10 pm. Su Yaya had to wake up early the next day and the two were already exhausted. They went to their respective bathrooms to rinse and then quietly laid in bed to sleep.It was rare for them to lay in bed and for nothing to happen. Su Yaya didn\u2019t even need to be crushed into a pancake. She slept soundly tonight.In the morning, Duan Xiao Yu came to the villa to take Su Yaya to the airport and meet up with the cast. She was afraid of being late so she especially came twenty minutes earlier.When the doorbell rang, Chen Xiuqi woke up first. He turned to his side to see Su Yaya who had buried her head in the blankets. She slept soundly and he couldn\u2019t bear to wake her up. He moved the blankets to the side and walked out to open the door.The door opened and Chen Xiuqi stared at Duan Xiao Yu. He said expressionlessly, \u201cYou are Yaya\u2019s assistant?\u201dDuan Xiao Yu would\u2019ve never thought it was Chen Xiuqi who would open the door. Facing Chen Xiqui\u2019s dominant imposing manner, she nervously gulped and stuttered while talking. \u201cY-yes. I-I am Sister Yaya\u2019s assistant. I am Duan Xiao Yu.\u201dChen Xiuqi nodded and stepped to the side. He said to Duan Xiao Yu, \u201cYou can come in. I\u2019m going to go get Yaya.\u201dDuan Xiao Yu said \u201coh\u201d and walked into the room, unable to react.In private, she had heard gossip about Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi. Everyone said that Chen Xiuqi was Su Yaya\u2019s sugar daddy but they didn\u2019t get to see him. Therefore, some believed it and some didn\u2019t. Until she became Su Yaya\u2019s assistant and Zhou Peiyun kept on mentioning for her to keep to herself, no matter what she heard or saw. If the public asked about it, she had to say she didn\u2019t know. She then realized that Su Yaya was probably different from what she thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chen Xiuqi was really Su Yaya\u2019s sugar daddy and they lived together.Ahhh. It seems like she found out something impressive!Thankfully, Su Yaya didn\u2019t know what Duan Xiao Yu was thinking. But even if she did, she probably would\u2019ve nodded her head. From her perspective, Chen Xiuqi was her sugar daddy and they did live with each other. There was nothing wrong with this. Heh!Chen Xiuqi returned to the room to get Su Yaya. \u201cYour assistant is here and waiting for you outside. Quickly get up otherwise you will be late to the airport.\u201dSu Yaya sat up on the bed and had a look of pity. \u201cI had a great dream and you just ruined it.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Chen Xiuqi chuckled and pinched her face. It was smooth and soft. He was touched for a second and asked, \u201cWhat did you dream of? Me?\u201dSu Yaya hastily nodded. \u201cYes, yes. You were quite handsome in the dream.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Chen Xiuqi was interested in her response. \u201cHow handsome?\u201d\u201cThe most handsome!\u201d Su Yaya answered quickly.Chen Xiuqi was speechless.\u201cHahah!\u201d Su Yaya chuckled proudly and pounced in Chen Xiuqi\u2019s arms. She pecked his face and said, \u201cGood morning kiss.\u201dChen Xiuqi stared at her smiling face. Fine. He won\u2019t argue with her. He was indeed handsome anyway!\u201cGo rinse.\u201d Chen Xiuqi patted her butt. What a minx.Su Yaya giggled and got off Chen Xiuqi. Then she ran to the bathroom and rinsed.Once Su Yaya was done packing, time was almost up. Duan Xiao Yu thought she made a smart decision to come twenty minutes earlier.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving now. Goodbye.\u201d Su Yaya said goodbye at the door.Chen Xiuqi kissed her forehead and gently reminded her, \u201cBe careful on the way to the airport. Call me if anything happens.\u201dSu Yaya nodded, well-behaved. \u201cI know.\u201dChen Xiuqi turned around to say to Duan Xiao Yu who was carrying the suitcase. \u201cI\u2019m leaving you to take care of Yaya.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, President Chen. I will take good care of Yaya.\u201d Duan Xiao Yu answered, feeling like she was fed too much dog food this early in the morning. She couldn\u2019t digest it!She waited for Su Yaya and Chen Xiuqi to finally finish cuddling one another. Once they were in the car heading to the airport, Duan Xiao Yu sighed. She looked down at her phone and opened Weibo. She forwarded a picture of koi seeking marriage. She silently swore that she would definitely find a guy this year. Being single was too miserable. Wahh\u2026The car quickly arrived at the airport. Su Yaya wore her sunglasses then got out of the car. Duan Xiao Yu was in charge of carrying the suitcase. The two walked to the airport lobby and saw the staff for the set. The two walked over to meet up with them and quickly finished handling the different procedures for the plane ride. Then they walked through security and rested inside the VIP airport departure terminal.Su Yaya arrived first and sat down by a seat in the corner. She took out her phone and scrolled through her Weibo. Then the show\u2019s male lead, Xu Chaoran, came. He wore a black and white casual outfit, with a baseball hat and sunglasses. He walked into the VIP airport departure terminal and saw Su Yaya sitting on the side. He took off his sunglasses and greeted Su Yaya.\u201cWhen did you get here?\u201dSu Yaya raised her head and smiled at him. \u201cI just got here.\u201dXu Chaoran looked at the seat beside her and asked, \u201cCan I sit here?\u201dSu Yaya didn\u2019t care. \u201cSure, there\u2019s no one anyway.\u201dXu Chaoran gently laughed and sat next to her. He took out his phone and unlocked it, saying to Su Yaya, \u201cLet\u2019s follow each other on Weibo.\u201dSu Yaya blinked her eyes. She was just an invisible actress in Starlit Entertainment while Xu Chaoran was the Elder Brother and also the male lead of \u300aFlourishing Palace\u300b. If they followed each other, it felt like she was the one taking advantage of him. Was this really ok? Would she be attacked by his fans, saying that she was using him for fame? She was a bit worried.Xu Chaoran stared at her hesitant face and he seemed to guess her worry. He smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re just following each other on Weibo. Nothing will happen. If you don\u2019t believe me, ask your manager. Plus, you\u2019re from the same company as my junior sister and I. I am supposed to take care of you anyway, right?\u201dWhat he said seemed reasonable. Su Yaya was speechless.Since Xu Chaoran had said all of this, if Su Yaya continued to reject him, she wasn\u2019t giving him face. After all, he was the company\u2019s Elder Brother. Even the boss had to give him face, not to mention a newbie like her.\u201cThen I\u2019m going to trouble senior brother.\u201d Su Yaya smoothly opened her Weibo and followed Xu Chaoran.Seeing Su Yaya appearing in his list of followers, Xu Chaoran subconsciously smiled. Then he posted something.Xu Chaoran.v: Hi, junior sister! Su Yaya smiling.jpgAfter he sent this, Xu Chaoran turned around to look at Su Yaya. \u201cForward this.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dXu Chaoran pointed at her phone.Su Yaya looked down to see the new post.Su Yaya was speechless.(T/N: regarding the chapter title that the author gave, Xu Chaoran may be the novel world\u2019s supporting male lead, since Chen Xiuqi is the novel world\u2019s main male lead)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Something\u2019s Wrong (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUnder Xu Chaoran\u2019s gaze, Su Yaya had no choice but to forward his post.Su Yaya: Senior brother, hi! Xu Chaoran smiling.jpg.Seeing that she posted something, Xu Chaoran was extremely happy. He pointed at his phone and said, \u201cLook at how understanding we are with each other.\u201dSu Yaya was dumbstruck.So this was how Starlit Entertainment\u2019s Elder Brother, Xu Chaoran, acts!After the two posted their respective posts, after a while, the female lead, Chen Yan, and second male lead, Zhang Yue arrived too. Then Director Zhou Tongguang and Producer Yu Hui as well as other photographers arrived too.At this time, it was time to board so everyone got on plane.After Su Yaya got on plane, she shut her phone off. The entire plane ride was almost three hours long. She spent two hours sleeping so she had no idea what was going on the internet.At first, Xu Chaoran\u2019s fans noticed that Xu Chaoran finally updated his Weibo after half a month. They were incredibly excited and all went into his Weibo to see the content. Then they saw the post where Xu Chaoran called Su Yaya as his junior sister. Right after, Su Yaya forwarded the post and commented on the same thing. She called Xu Chaoran her senior brother!When did Su Yaya become Xu Chaoran\u2019s junior sister? When were their relationship that good? Xu Chaoran\u2019s 3,000,000 worth of fans were all confused!However, the fans had very strong powers. They were extremely valiant at exploiting all the information!Quickly, Xu Chaoran\u2019s fans found traces of information.Firstly, Xu Chaoran and Su Yaya were both Starlit Entertainment\u2019s actors. Xu Chaoran was the Elder Brother of the company, without a doubt. Su Yaya entered the company later than Xu Chaoran so it made sense why she called him senior brother.Secondly, Xu Chaoran and Su Yaya were both part of the cast for \u300aFlourishing Palace \u300b. One was the male lead and the other was the second female lead. Xu Chanran was the Emperor and Su Yaya was Imperial Concubine Shu. In the beginning, the Emperor pampers Imperial Concubine Shu a lot. They had a lot of scenes together.In addition, someone else exposed an inside story. On the day where the actors went to take their makeup photos, Xu Chaoran took care of Su Yaya and reminded her to not drink too much alcohol while they were having lunch together. Chen Yan even made a joke saying that Xu Chaoran only cared about Su Yaya and not her. He calmly said that Su Yaya was his junior sister and it was his responsibility to take care of her.From the information above, this was the origin of Xu Chaoran and Su Yaya\u2019s relationship.Xu Chaoran\u2019s fans who genuinely liked them were clearly happy for him. After Xu Chaoran accepted Su Yaya as his junior sister, the fans all accepted this too. They started to make all sorts of jokes. It was bustling with comments all of a sudden.Wind: Junior sister and senior brother are so lovely with each other! Heart.jpg.Why not love each other: Senior brother, hello! @Why not think about each other.Why not think about each other: Junior sister, hello! @Why not love each other\u2026Ahhh: Hello senior brother. I love you! @Heheh\u2026Heheheh: Hello junior sister, I love you too! @Ahh\u2026Gentle kitten: Scram, the people above with their PDA!Transparent Autumn: +10086Immortal Moon God: +ID number.\u2026Xu Chaoran\u2019s fans had fun. A bunch of couples confessed their love for one another and a lot of people started topics like #Senior brother Xu Chaoran and junior sister Su Yaya. Besides fans, there were other strangers who found this fun. They started to participate in this too.For a moment, hundreds and thousands of comments were on Xu Chaoran\u2019s Weibo. The number of forwards and likes went to tens of thousands in the blink of an eye. Su Yaya became even more famous because of this. One could see the rapid increase of fans and she received numerous likes and comments. Her Weibo exploded with comments.However, as celebrities, one would have true fans and anti-fans. The true fans would be happy over the celebrities\u2019 happiness. They sincerely liked the celebrities. It was the opposite for anti-fans. They enjoyed inciting disharmony and making the smallest things a big deal. They would make up all sorts of nonsense, wanting the celebrities to fall to their misfortune.Of course, while Xu Chaoran\u2019s sincere fans were joking around, the anti-fans started doing their things too. They started to comment under #Senior brother Xu Chaoran and junior sister Su Yaya and liked comments that incited a quarrel.For example:Moon likes to eat fish: You fools. I don\u2019t know what you guys are happy about. When are there so many senior brothers and junior sisters now a days? They\u2019re basically confessing to each other. The senior brother is the hubby and the junior sister is the wife!Being single is not an issue: I agree with the person above. Xu Chaoran actually found an online celebrity as his girlfriend. This is really dropping this status. I\u2019m his anti-fan now, anti-fan.Little thing: What right does Su Yaya have, an online celebrity who made her way up by relying on her sugar daddy, to be Chaoran\u2019s girlfriend? We don\u2019t accept this!Love Chaoran: Wahhh. Brother Chaoran is running off with a slut. I\u2019m going to unfollow him, unfollow him.\u2026These comments were the more gentle ones. There were others which were even more degrading and ugly. It was like they could spew poop out of their mouths. They even referred back to the gossip that Su Yaya clarified before. They did all they could to comment below #Senior brother Xu Chaoran and junior sister Su Yaya.The battles of the fans were endless and it was as messy as smoke coming out of a battlefield. Quickly, #Senior brother Xu Chaoran and junior sister Su Yaya made it on hot search.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 - Something\u2019s Wrong (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was a good thing that Xu Chaoran\u2019s fans were valiant. They attacked and retorted all sorts of anti-fans\u2019 comments. They successfully beat up the anti-fans, not giving them a chance to hurt Xu Chaoran at all. Under this topic of #Senior brother Xu Chaoran and junior sister Su Yaya, one could only see comments that were beneficial to Xu Chaoran and Su Yaya.The moment Su Yaya and the others got off the plane, Su Yaya turned her phone on to see Zhou Peiyun calling her.Her first sentence was, \u201cSu Yaya, do you know you got on hot search again?\u201dHer second sentence was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter between you and Xu Chaoran? When did you guys become senior brothers and junior sisters?\u201dSu Yaya responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the hot search. I just got off the plane and turned my phone on, when you called me. I can\u2019t really explain what happened between me and Xu Chaoran, but he was the one who suggested following each other on Weibo. He was the one who called me junior sister first as well. He was standing by my side and watching me before. He wanted me to forward the Weibo and I had no choice but to do so.\u201dZhou Peiyun said, \u201cThat simple?\u201dSu Yaya retorted, \u201cDo you think I would lie?\u201dZhou Peiyun paused and said, \u201cOverall, this isn\u2019t bad. You and Xu Chaoran both made it on hot search and his fans are very protective of him. But they don\u2019t dislike you either. If it was someone else who used him for fame, who knows how much they would\u2019ve been scolded. You guys are both Starlit Entertainment\u2019s actors and he is willing to take care of you. Therefore, you need to maintain a good relationship with him. Since he is willing to treat you as his junior sister, you are not losing anything by calling him senior brother.\u201dSu Yaya agreed and said, \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I\u2019m going to hang up now.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Zhou Peiyun hung up.Su Yaya placed her phone in her bag when it rang again. She thought that Zhou Peiyun had something to say and that she had forgotten. She mumbled something and took her phone out again.She looked at the screen to see Chen Xiuqi\u2019s name jumping. It was actually Chen Xiuqi calling. Su Yaya\u2019s heart thumped rapidly. Zhou Peiyun just called her to say that she and Xu Chaoran made it on hot search. Right after, Chen Xiuqi called her too. Could he be asking about the hot search too?Su Yaya quickly pondered over this. If Chen Xiuqi asked about her and Xu Chaoran, how should she respond? After preparing a draft, she then picked up the phone. She said sweetly, \u201cXiuqi, I just got off the plane when you called. I\u2019m so happy!\u201dXiuqi?Chen Xiuqi was slightly stunned. Whenever Su Yaya tried to act cute with him, she liked to call him hubby. If there were strangers, she would pay attention to her words and properly call him President Chen. Regarding Xiuqi as an address, she never called him that before. It was the first time.Maybe it was because this was the first time, Chen Xiuqi felt a strange feeling rising in his heart. This address made them sound intimate. It made him feel like she had lingering feelings for him and couldn\u2019t bear to part with him.\u201cYou got off the plane?\u201d Chen Xiuqi asked.\u201cMhm.\u201d Su Yaya said. \u201cI\u2019m walking out of the airport now. I have to take a car later on.\u201dChen Xiuqi asked, \u201cAre you with people from the set?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Su Yaya nodded then realized that Chen Xiuqi couldn\u2019t see her at all. She was clearly used to being well-behaved.\u201cStay away from Xu Chaoran.\u201d Chen Xiuqi immediately said.He clearly called to warn her after seeing her and Xu Chaoran on hot search. Su Yaya actually wanted to ask why since nothing was going on between her and Xu Chaoran. They didn\u2019t do anything overboard either. But when she thought about it, she remembered that Chen Xiuqi was the book\u2019s dominant male lead, her sugar daddy. If he had her walk to the east, she couldn\u2019t go west. Otherwise, she might offend Chen Xiuqi and land herself with tragic consequences. It wasn\u2019t something she could endure. Being a cannon fodder, it was better to treasure her life and make her relationship with Chen Xiuqi better.\u201cI know.\u201d Su Yaya obediently agreed.Su Yaya felt like she agreed reluctantly. She recalled how miserable she would look at him, her eyes full of water and about to cry. She was fragile like a little kitten. His hardened heart couldn\u2019t help but soften. He said gently, \u201cYaya, stay away from Xu Chaoran. You don\u2019t understand some things. I\u2019m scared that you might suffer, do you understand?\u201dSu Yaya said oh and thought about Chen Xiuqi\u2019s words. She understood his words on the surface but there seemed to be a hidden meaning beneath it. She didn\u2019t understand that part but she decided to follow Chen Xiuqi\u2019s instructions. She smiled and said, \u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry. I will always listen to you.\u201dReceiving a certain response, Chen Xiuqi was slightly comforted. He said to Su Yaya, \u201cFilm your scenes and I\u2019ll come and visit you in a few days.\u201d\u201cOk!\u201d Su Yaya answered quickly, her voice full of sweet happiness. She just entered the set and didn\u2019t even start filming yet, when Chen Xiuqi said he would make time to come and visit her. Just thinking about it made her happy. They made a promise just like that.However, no one knew that before Chen Xiuqi could even make time to visit her, Su Yaya was in trouble within the set.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 - It Hurts\u2026(1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat day was the day Su Yaya\u2019s first joined the crew and began filming, and she only had one scene then with the male lead, Xu Chaoran. Currently, her role as the supporting female lead is only a fair consort. In order to obtain the favor of the emperor that was played by Xu Chaoran, she bribed all of the eunuchs by his side. After learning of the emperor\u2019s tracks, she secretly ran to the lotus pond, took off her shoes and socks, and sat down on the stones beside it, playing with the water.She had a beautiful and delicate pair of feet that looked pure white like jade, especially when submerged under the dazzling water. After the emperor walked by and saw the scene, he was captivated by her beautiful feet in an instant. They were absolutely beautiful to him. As if he was being led by the devil, he felt the need to touch her feet.Based on the plot written down in the script, the emperor will successfully touch the feet of the consort and fall in love with them instantly. Then, he will carry this consort away with him back to the Ganyuan Palace. After a passionate night together, he will name her as his favored woman.However, an accident happened during the shooting. Dressed in the heavy historical costume, Su Yaya took off her shoes and sat on the stone by the lotus pond and played with the water. The sun shone down through the gaps of the leaves on top of Su Yaya\u2019s body and the surface of the water like a fine layer of gold, creating a dazzlingly beautiful scene.Xu Chaoran who was dressed in the emperor\u2019s costume appeared at this moment, and he saw Su Yaya\u2019s feet. Fair and beautiful, they attracted his gaze in an instant. He couldn\u2019t help but come towards her and reached out his hand, hoping to touch her feet while he spoke his lines, \u201cMy dear, how beautiful\u2026\u201dAnd this was where the accident happened. According to the script, Su Yaya should try to evade his touch bashfully. But who knew that she would accidentally slip while attempting to do so, and landed her entire person inside of the pond.With a splash, Su Yaya fell in.Originally, Su Yaya could swim. Even though she wasn\u2019t good at it, she still wouldn\u2019t drown. However, she was wearing the historical costumes today which consisted of layers upon layers of fabric. Every piece of her clothing was wide, and they wrapped around her hands and feet after they had gotten wet, stopping her from freeing herself. It was ridiculously heavy as if something was pulling her down. Seeing that she was going to be pulled underwater, she accidentally choked on a few mouthfuls of water during her panic.Xu Chaoran was the closest to Su Yaya when it happened. He froze for a moment when he saw Su Yaya fall into the lotus pond but he quickly came back to his senses. This was not what it said in the script. Su Yaya had really fallen into the water. Then, without even thinking, he quickly took off his loose robes and jumped in to save Su Yaya.After Xu Chaoran jumped in, the other crew members had also realized that an accident had happened. They quickly ran over to help them.Xu Chaoran jumped into the water and quickly swam his way to Su Yaya. He grabbed onto her from behind and took her to the shore. Holding her wet body, he brought her up.\u201cBrother Chao, Brother Chao, are you okay?\u201d One of the crew members ran over and asked him anxiously.Xu Chaoran responded, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Then, he looked down at Su Yaya in his arms. When he saw how pale her face was, he asked in worry, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\u201cI\u2026I\u2019m okay.\u201d Su Yaya forced down the discomfort in her body and answered.\u201cYou don\u2019t look so good. I think it\u2019s better for you to see a doctor,\u201d Xu Chaoran suggested.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary\u2026\u201d\u201cListen to me. If you get sick, then you\u2019ll also delay the filming for the rest of the crew,\u201d Xu Chaoran said to her with a serious face that accepted no refusals.Su Yaya, \u201c\u2026\u201dYu Hui had also rushed over. He said, \u201cI think Chaoran is right. It\u2019ll be for the best to have a check.\u201dHe knew very well that Su Yaya was Chen Xiuqi\u2019s woman. If anything were to happen to her in the crew, then things would still be fine if Chen Xiuqi didn\u2019t care. If he got angry because of this, then the entire crew would be in deep trouble. And, according to the rumors, Chen Xiuqi seemed very concerned about Su Yaya. It\u2019s hard to guarantee anything, and he didn\u2019t dare to take the gamble. Whether she was fine or not, she should still be sent to the hospital for a check-up just in case.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 - It Hurts\u2026(2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cHurry up and help Chaoran and Xiao Su change their wet clothes, then quickly send her to the hospital.\u201d After Yu Hui finished speaking, everyone finally realized that Xu Chaoran was still holding Su Yaya. However, in this current situation, everyone\u2019s minds were filled with getting her to a hospital and they didn\u2019t think much of it.After Duan Xiaoyu returned from buying coffee for Su Yaya, the first thing she saw was Su Yaya wet from head to toe with a terrifying complexion. She was completely shocked and couldn\u2019t even bother with the coffee anymore. She quickly brought Su Yaya to the changing room to get changed. On the other hand, Xu Chaoran was also taken away by his assistant to the men\u2019s changing room to get changed.While changing clothes, Su Yaya could see Duan Xiaoyu\u2019s hands shaking. Pulling up a smile on her pale face, she said, \u201cI\u2019m really fine. I just ended up like this because I\u2019m on my period. I\u2019ll be okay after I drink some red date tea when I\u2019m home. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cHow could I not worry? What will I do if anything happens to you? Women should be even more careful when they\u2019re on their period. You can\u2019t touch cold water or catch a cold, and you fell into the water. That\u2019s no good at all! It\u2019s still better to get a check-up just in case.\u201d Not taking any nos for an answer, Duan Xiaoyu dragged Su Yaya into the car and brought her to the hospital.After the check-up, the doctor diagnosed Su Yaya with a small cold. And, as she was on her period, her ovaries were weak to begin with and she even fell into the water. If she doesn\u2019t take care of herself now, she\u2019ll have hell to suffer through when she gets older!Once he was done nagging Su Yaya, he prescribed a large pile of medicines for Su Yaya to take home and eat.Su Yaya didn\u2019t like to eat medicine so she didn\u2019t want to go get them. She complained to Duan Xiaoyu, \u201cI said I didn\u2019t need to see the doctor but you wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. And look, they gave me so much medicine, this is injustice! Who likes taking medicine in this day and age? I\u2019m not a masochist!\u201dBut Duan Xiaoyu remembered how Chen Xiuqi had asked her to take good care of Su Yaya before heading out. Regardless of what Su Yaya says, they still have to go and get the medicine. She also said to Su Yaya, \u201cI\u2019ll have to supervise you when you take your medicine. Otherwise, I\u2019ll tell Sis Zhou and President Chen.\u201dSu Yaya glared at her and pouted, \u201cYou\u2019re my assistant so you should be on my side. It\u2019s no good if you report me to them like that, you know?\u201dHolding the medicine in hand, Duan Xiaoyu insisted, \u201cBut you can\u2019t be so reckless with your body. If something happens to you, then Sis Zhou and President Chen will blame me for not taking care of you too.\u201dSu Yaya sighed. She felt like she didn\u2019t just get a new assistant, she got a new mother!\u201cFine, forget it. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d Since she can\u2019t get through to Duan Xiaoyu, Su Yaya gave up.After driving back to the hotel where she was staying, Su Yaya immediately went for a hot shower. After falling into the water and getting wet, then going to the hospital for a check, she had only changed to a new set of clothes and hadn\u2019t had the time to clean herself, which made her feel very uncomfortable. Now that she can finally have a nice warm shower, she finally felt relaxed.After she came out, Duan Xiaoyu gave her medicine again and said with concern, \u201cSis Yaya, you should take a nap after you eat your medicine. It\u2019s good to have some rest.\u201dSu Yaya responded with a hum and climbed into bed. She pulled the blanket over herself and closed her eyes, falling asleep.Duan Xiaoyu stayed beside her and waited until she fell asleep before heading out in light steps. She took out her phone to call Zhou Peiyun and report to her that Su Yaya fell into the water on the set today.Before she could even find her number, another call came. It was one of the members from the crew, calling to say that Su Yaya\u2019s handbag had been left at the set, and asking her to come pick it up.Only then did Duan Xiaoyu remember that Su Yaya had left her phone in her handbag and handed it to her before filming. She asked Su Yaya to go buy her coffee and she returned just in time to see Su Yaya fished out of the water. In a hurry, she helped her change her clothes before bringing her to the hospital and completely forgot to take Su Yaya\u2019s bag.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, she looked at the bed. Su Yaya was laying there, sleeping soundly. She was unlikely to be waking up anytime soon. So, she quickly set out to get Su Yaya\u2019s bag.When Duan Xiaoyu arrived at the set, the crew member who called her brought Su Yaya\u2019s bag from the staff room to her. This Chanel handbag costs at least a few hundred thousand yuan. There were also some of Su Yaya\u2019s personal belongings in there. She couldn\u2019t afford to lose it.\u201cCheck and see if anything is missing,\u201d the crew member reminded her with a good heart.\u201cOkay, thank you.\u201d Duan Xiaoyu knew there wasn\u2019t much in Su Yaya\u2019s bags. There were just tissues, compact powder, lip tint, a small mirror, and whatnot. The only important thing in there was her phone. With today\u2019s technology, smartphones are increasingly useful, but they also touch upon a person\u2019s personal privacy. Especially as Su Yaya was an artist, things would not be good if anything leaked out. So, she quickly opened the handbag to check. It was still there. Su Yaya\u2019s Apple smartphone was still there. Su Yaya was the one who set the password herself so even she didn\u2019t know it. Everything should be fine.After checking her bag and making sure that nothing was missing, Duan Xiaoyu thanked the crew member. The crew member replied in jest and said if she really wanted to thank her, then she should invite her for a drink.Seeing that she had helped her out, it should only be proper for Duan Xiaoyu to buy her a cup of milk tea. So, she smiled and said, \u201cSure. Let\u2019s go together.\u201dSince the crew member was also free at this time, the two of them headed for a milk tea shop.Halfway through her sleep, Su Yaya was woken up by her cramps. This was the first time she had her period since she transmigrated over. She never expected it to be so painful as she had never experienced cramps to such a degree before. Even if it hurts, it was just a dull throb, which was still tolerable.But this body was clearly different from her own, even the pain tolerance was different. Also, her current condition was very bad. Her flow was extremely heavy, almost like it was an open faucet down there. A constant stream of heat was flowing outwards and her headache was causing her to see stars. The cold sweat lining her forehead almost gave her the illusion that she was going to die.She suddenly remembered that the female doctor told her in the hospital. \u201cYour ovaries were weak to begin with and you even fell into the water. If you don\u2019t take care of yourself now, she\u2019ll have hell to suffer through\u2026\u201dThinking about this now made her a little scared. She quickly called out to Xiaoyu, but nobody responded to her.She got up and looked around. Nobody was in the room. So, she could only get up herself and find her phone to make a call. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t find her phone either.While she was still in a fluster, she heard a knock on the door. Su Yaya thought that Xiaoyu had returned, so she endured the pain in her stomach and went over to open the door.As soon as she opened the door, she saw Xu Chaoran standing outside. Before waiting for her to speak, he quickly stated the intentions of his visit. \u201cAre you doing okay? You fell into the water this afternoon, so I\u2019ve come to visit.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Su Yaya was just about to say that she was fine. But as soon as she opened her mouth, she felt the heat flowing out from below and her vision went dark. Uncontrollably, she toppled forward.\u201cSu Yaya!!!\u201dXu Chaoran reached out to catch her. After looking down, he realized that her face was as white as a sheet. Her forehead was also covered in cold sweat and her entire body was shaking.\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Su Yaya\u2019s appearance gave Xu Chaoran a fright. Worry could be seen on his handsome face as he asked her anxiously.Bouts of pain came one after another in Su Yaya\u2019s stomach. Her vision was growing dark and she was sweating profusely. She felt extremely weak. \u201cIt hurts\u2026I feel bad\u2026\u201dThe author has something to say: I just told you all that Xu Chaoran could be a supporting male lead, but nobody believed me, lalalala~~~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
